      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aging''' (often spelt ''ageing'') is the process of becoming older.  Aging is a [[w:senescence|biological process]], but it is of interest to sociologists because it is accompanied by changes in how one is viewed and treated in society.

==Dividing the lifespan==
Human life is often divided into various age spans, like the following:  
*[[w:Infancy|Infancy]]
*[[w:Toddler|Toddler]]
*[[w:Childhood|Childhood]]
*[[w:Adolescence|Adolescence]]
*[[w:Young adult|Young adult]]
*[[w:Adult|Prime adulthood]]
*[[w:Middle age|Middle age]]
*[[w:Old age|Old age]]

These divisions are somewhat arbitrary, but generally capture periods of life that reflect a certain degree of similarity. In many countries, such as Sweden, [[w:adult|adulthood]] legally begins at the age of eighteen. This is a major age milestone that is marked by significantly different attitudes toward the person who undergoes the transition.

==Socially Constructed Aspects of Aging==
[[File:UPSTREAM FITNESS-4.jpg|right|thumb|200px|This is a photo of an &quot;older&quot; person who is more physically fit than many &quot;younger&quot; people. While age will eventually take its toll on everyone, the association of vigor with youth is a cultural construct and does not necessarily reflect the reality of biological aging.]]

While aging, itself, is a biological process, what it means to be &quot;old&quot; or &quot;young&quot; and at what ages such distinctions are made varies by culture.  In Western societies, where youth is highly valued, people are considered &quot;old&quot; at much younger ages than in Eastern societies where age is often seen to beget wisdom.  This emphasis on youth translates into considerable expenditures on makeup, cosmetics, and surgeries to hide signs of aging, particularly among women, but also among men.  Ironically, among adolescents, just the opposite approach is taken, as adolescents often try to appear &quot;older&quot;, though obviously not too much older.

The labels of &quot;old&quot; and &quot;young&quot; also vary by life expectancy.  In societies where lifespans are relatively short (e.g., [[w:Chad|Chad]]), one could be considered &quot;old&quot; or &quot;middle-aged&quot; by her mid-twenties, whereas in countries with longer lifespans (e.g., [[w:Japan|Japan]]), mid-twenties is still considered young-adulthood.

The activities that are expected of one at different ages is also socially constructed and relative to culture.  For instance, retirement only became a &quot;universal&quot; American institution in the post-World War I era, as the growth of Social Security and private pensions dramatically expanded the safety net available to aging workers who were leaving the labor market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graebner1980&quot;&gt;Graebner, William. 1980. A History of Retirement: The Meaning and Function of an American Institution 1885-1978. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the idea of childhood being an age of innocence when children should be kept from adult worries and spend their time pursuing education and recreating is only widely held in highly developed countries and is a relatively recent invention, following the industrial revolution and the introduction of [[w:child-labor laws|child-labor laws]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker2007&quot;&gt;Parker, David. 2007. Before Their Time: The World of Child Labor. Quantuck Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2000. The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential Treatment by Age or Ageism==
'''Ageism''' is prejudice on the grounds of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bytheway1995&quot;&gt;Bytheway, B. (1995). Ageism. Buckingham: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it can be targeted toward individuals of any age, two groups that are often targeted are the young and the elderly.

===Treatment of the Young===
While most people are aware of the mistreatment of the elderly (see below), few people seem to realize that young people are often subjected to discrimination because of their age. Discrimination against young people is primarily in the area of behavioral restrictions, often by parents,&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews1999&quot;&gt;Matthews, H., &amp; Limb, M. (1999). Defining an agenda for the geography of children: Review and prospect. Progress in Human Geography, 23(1), 61-90.&lt;/ref&gt; but also in public places like malls and stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breitbart&quot;&gt;Breitbart, M. M. (1998). &quot;Dana's mystical tunnel&quot;: Young people's designs for survival and change in the city. In T. Skelton &amp; G. Valentine (Eds.), Cool places: Geographies of youth culture (pp. 305-327). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some stores have gone so far as to limit the hours young people can be in their stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee2006&quot;&gt;Lee, Louise. 2006. “Kick out the kids, bring in the sales.” BusinessWeek 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above are clear examples of discrimination, there are other restrictions placed on young people based on the assumption that they are unable to make decisions for themselves.  Examples of such restrictions include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Bytheway1995&quot;/&gt;
*inability to vote in elections
*inability to legally imbibe alcohol or smoke cigarettes
*inability to legally engage in sexual activity (this varies by region)
*inability to hold public office
*inability to determine whether or not one can marry
*inability to determine whether or not one can get an abortion (varies by region)

All of the above restrictions hinge upon the idea that young people lack the maturity required to make such important decisions.  While this is likely true for some young people, there are also some young people who are mature enough to make these decisions. The above restrictions are tied to specific ages for [[w:Age of majority|legal reasons]], but such restrictions may not always be followed, do vary substantially by region and culture, and may not always make sense.  However, it is also the case that young people can lack the maturity to make important decisions.  Legally, when young people make poor decisions, the [[w:defense of infancy|defense of infancy]] is used in such cases to argue that such individuals are too immature to be held responsible for their decisions.

Another way in which the young are treated differently is in the marketing practices of corporations.  Children and teenagers have little money of their own, but of the money they have most of it is available for buying consumer goods (their parents cover their basic living needs).  Children can also be heavily influential on how their parents' spend their discretionary income.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheEconomist2006&quot;&gt;The Economist. 2006. “Trillion-dollar kids..” Economist 381:66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Manufacturers of consumer goods and providers of services (e.g., [[w:Disney|Disney]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes2009&quot;&gt;Barnes, Brooks. 2009. “Disney Expert Uses Science to Draw Boy Viewers.” The New York Times, April 14 http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/14/arts/television/14boys.html?_r=1 (Accessed October 7, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;) are aware of the buying power of young people and target them specifically.  The elderly are also targeted as a consumer demographic, but the approaches are different.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;Williams, Kimberly D. 2007. “How to target older demos.” Advertising Age 78:8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people are also stereotyped as being both amusing, but at the same time potentially dangerous and disturbing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amit-Talai1995&quot;&gt;Amit-Talai, V., &amp; Wulff, H. (Eds.). (1995). Youth cultures: A cross-cultural perspective. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is stereotypes like these that translate into the discrimination toward young people described above.

===Treatment of the Elderly===
While discrimination toward the young is primarily behavioral restrictions, discrimination toward the elderly ranges from behavioral restrictions to the realm of physical abuse.  Elder abuse is a serious problem in the U.S.  There are nearly 2 million cases of elder abuse and self-neglect in the U.S. every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dong2009&quot;&gt;Dong, XinQi et al. 2009. “Elder Self-neglect and Abuse and Mortality Risk in a Community-Dwelling Population.” JAMA 302:517-526.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[w:Abuse|Abuse]] refers to psychological/emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, caregiver neglect or financial exploitation while [[w:self-neglect|self-neglect]] refers to behaviors that threaten the person's own health and safety.

Elderly individuals who are subjected to abuse have at least two times higher risk of premature death than do other seniors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dong2009&quot;/&gt;  And elders who suffer from self-neglect have an even higher risk (up to 5 times higher) of premature death than do elders who do not suffer from self-neglect.  The higher risk of death associated with elder abuse effects both those who are physically and cognitively impaired and those who are more capable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dong2009&quot;/&gt;

Additionally, the elderly are often stereotyped.  One stereotype of the elderly is that they are inflexible in their attitudes and that they tend to only become more conservative with time. This is not the case - the elderly are quite adept at changing their views and often they become more tolerant as they age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danigelis2007&quot;&gt;Danigelis, Nicholas L., and Stephen J. Cutler. 2007. “Population Aging, Intracohort Aging, and Sociopolitical Attitudes..” American Sociological Review 72:812-830.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another stereotype of the elderly is that they are poorer drivers than younger people.  This stereotype is also not backed by evidence, with some caveats.  Up to about the age of 75, older drivers are actually safer than drivers of other ages.  Beyond age 75 response times and visual acuity do begin to decline, leading to increases in accidents.  Thus, many older drivers are actually much safer than the youngest drivers (under 18).&lt;ref name=&quot;Horswill2009&quot;&gt;Horswill, Mark S. et al. 2009. “A comparison of the hazard perception ability of matched groups of healthy drivers aged 35 to 55, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 years..” Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society 15:799-802.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age and Income==
Prior to the introduction of [[w:Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] in the U.S. and other programs for the needy, the elderly were the poorest age group in the U.S.  Social Security (technically ''Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance'' or OASDI) is an income redistribution program that takes taxes from those working and distributes it to those who cannot work or who are elderly enough to be considered past the age at which they can retire. With the introduction of Social Security, the poverty rates of the elderly in the U.S. dropped dramatically, as illustrated in the figure below.

[[File:Poverty-by-age-1959-2005.gif|thumb|600px|center|This chart depicts the percentage of the respective age groups that fell below the poverty line over the last 40+ years.]]

Despite the success of the Social Security program in reducing poverty among the elderly, one unforeseen consequence has been the increasing poverty of people under 18.  Conflict theory provides a clear theoretical argument to explain this: Since there are limited resources - in this case limited tax revenue - if those resources go to one group, they must necessarily come from another group.  Thus, if the elderly see an increase in their total share of tax revenue, it is likely that some other age group will see a decrease in its total share of tax revenue.  Thus, individuals under 18 have seen some programs cut that would have otherwise helped maintain their lower levels of poverty.  Even so, poverty rates across all three age groups depicted in the figure above have declined from what they were prior to the introduction of tax redistribution policies like Social Security.

While generally considered a highly successful program at reducing poverty among the elderly, Social Security is currently experiencing problems.  The chart below illustrates the problems with Social Security payments for retirees in the U.S.  Currently, more money is received from Social Security taxes than is distributed to retirees.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSA2009&quot;&gt;http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  However, that will change if Social Security is not modified by 2017.  At that point, less will come in than will go out.  For about 20 years following that, the Social Security Trust Fund, which is the money that was collected when there was a surplus in tax revenue, will make up the difference in payments.  But by 2037, the Trust Fund reserves will be exhausted and payments to beneficiaries will drop to about 75% of what they would normally receive.

[[File:Social Security Benefits - 2009-2083.png|center|600px|thumb]]

Of additional concern is where the Trust Fund reserves were invested - in [[w:Federal bonds|Federal bonds]]. While Federal bonds are backed by the the U.S. Federal Government, it is the Federal Government that borrowed the money.  Thus, the Federal Government of the United States actually owes itself the money - over $2 trillion.  If the Federal Government is unable to or decides not to pay this money back, the reserves will run out sooner, reducing the payments to beneficiaries at an earlier date.

While the Social Security program in the U.S. is in trouble, the situation of Social Security is not as dire as is that of [[w:Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], which is a healthcare program for the elderly. The chart below replicates the chart above, but for Medicare.  Medicare is worse off as tax income in 2009 was already insufficient to cover the expenses of the program and the Trust Fund reserves are already been tapped to offset the costs.  The Trust Fund for Medicare will be exhausted by 2017, at which point the Federal Government will only be able to cover about 80% of the costs of medical treatments of senior citizens.  That percentage will gradually decline to 50% by 2035, then to 30% by 2080.

[[File:Medicare's Future Payments to Beneficiaries, 2009-2080.png|thumb|600px|center]]

This is resulting from the lower ratio of employed workers to benefit recipients, a ratio that continues to decrease as the U.S. population grows more elderly (as shown in the figure  below).  

[[File:Percentage of US Population Over Age 65 1950-2050.png|center|thumb|600px]]

==Age and Gender==
While the elderly have seen substantial improvements in their economic situation in recent decades, those improvements have not equally affected men and women.  Women, whether working or not, are more likely to fall below the federal poverty line than are men, as depicted in the figure below.

[[File:Poverty Rates by Sex and Work Status for Americans 65+ in 2006.png|center|thumb|600px]]

This is of special concern considering women live longer than men, as illustrated in the next figure.

[[File:Life Expectancy at Birth for Males and Females - USA - 1950-2050.png|thumb|600px|center|This chart depicts the increasing life expectancy at birth in the USA.]]

Why women live longer than men is not perfectly understood.  Several factors may contribute to this.  For instance, men do engage in riskier behaviors than women, reducing their life expectancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2003&quot;&gt;Williams, David R. 2003. “The Health of Men: Structured Inequalities and Opportunities.” Am J Public Health 93:724-731.&lt;/ref&gt;  Men are also more &quot;successful&quot; when attempting suicide, which increases the rate of death among men of suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2003&quot;/&gt;  Another factor that may contribute to the greater life expectancy of women is the different types of jobs men and women tend to have during their lifetimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luv2003&quot;&gt;Luv, Marc. 2003. “Causes of Male Excess Mortality: Insights from Cloistered Populations..” Population &amp; Development Review 29:647-676.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other biological factors likely play a role, including greater heart health among women,&lt;ref name=&quot;TheEconomist2005&quot;&gt;The Economist. 2005. “The stronger sex..” Economist 374:75.&lt;/ref&gt; though how much they contribute to the greater longevity of women is not entirely clear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reebs2005&quot;&gt;Reebs, Stéphan. 2005. “Female Radicals..” Natural History 114:14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The combined effect of all these differences may or may not account for the longevity gap between men and women, but it is clear that women do live longer than men and that holds true around the world.

==Age and Race==
Aging does not result in similar outcomes for members of different races.  There is evidence that black senior citizens are more likely to be abused - both physically and psychologically and suffer greater financial exploitation than do white senior citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach2010&quot;&gt;Beach, Scott R, Richard Schulz, Nicholas G Castle, and Jules Rosen. 2010. “Financial exploitation and psychological mistreatment among older adults: differences between African Americans and non-African Americans in a population-based survey.” The Gerontologist 50(6):744-757. Retrieved January 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging in the US==
The geography of age in the US is quite intriguing.  The map below illustrates that the elderly are not equally distributed throughout the U.S.

[[File:USA - percent over 65 - 2000.png|thumb|600px|center|This map depicts the percentage of the population that is over age 65 by census district (from the 2000 Census).]]

There are concentrations of the elderly in the Midwest and in the South, particularly in Florida.  While the high concentration of the elderly in Florida may not come as much of a surprise to most Americans who are aware of the high rate at which people who retire move to Florida, the high concentration of the elderly in the Midwest may be more surprising.  This higher concentration is not because the elderly are moving to the Midwest but rather because the young are moving out of the Midwest as they search for jobs.  Thus, the two regions with the highest concentrations of the elderly in the US have high concentrations of elderly people for very different reasons.

The city of Pittsburgh offers an intriguing case study of the effects of an aging population on a city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;&gt;Roberts, Sam, and Sean D. Hamill. 2008. “As Deaths Outpace Births, Cities Adjust.” The New York Times, May 18 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/us/18pittsburgh.html (Accessed January 30, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008 more people are dying in Pittsburgh than are being born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;/&gt;  Add to this the fact that many young people are moving away from Pittsburgh to find jobs, and you have the perfect recipe for both population decline and an aging population.  One result of this demographic shift is that there is a greater demand for health care provision.  Health care has replaced steel as Pittsburgh's biggest industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;/&gt;  Another result of these trends is the decline in students attending Pittsburgh schools.  In the 1980s there were nearly 70,000 students in the public school; by 2008 there were only about 30,000 and the number is declining by about 1,000 every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;/&gt;  In short, as populations in specific locations age, the entire social structure must change to accommodate the new demographic, which supports the notion of equilibrium in structural-functionalist theory.

==Global Aging Trends==
Globally, most countries are seeing the average life expectancy of their populations increase.  This translates into a greater percentage of the world's population falling above the age of 65, as illustrated in the figure below.

[[File:Percentage of the World Population Over 65 - 1950-2050.png|thumb|center|600px]]

However, the rate at which the world's population is aging is not uniform across countries, and some countries have actually seen decreasing life expectancies, largely as a result of [[w:AIDS|AIDS]].  The varied life expectancies and younger populations are illustrated in the map below, which depicts the percentage of each country's population that is over 65.

[[File:Percentage of Population Above 65 - 2005.png|center|thumb|600px|This map illustrates global trends in aging by depicting the percentage of each country's population that is over the age of 65.  The more developed countries also have older populations as their citizens live longer. Less developed countries have much younger populations. [http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/visualizations/percent-of-population-over-65-by-c An interactive version of the map is available here.]]]

It is pretty clear from the map that more developed countries have much older populations and a greater percentage of their population is aged 65+.  The least developed countries are also the youngest countries as life expectancies are substantially lower.

==Aging and Health==
While aging is often associated with declining health, current research suggests there are some things people can do to remain healthy longer into old age.  For instance, maintaining a positive attitude has been shown to be correlated with better health among the elderly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ong2010&quot;&gt;Ong, Anthony D. 2010. “Pathways Linking Positive Emotion and Health in Later Life.” Current Directions in Psychological Science 19:358 -362.&lt;/ref&gt;  Older individuals with more positive attitudes and emotions engage in less risky behavior and have lower levels of stress, both of which are correlated with better health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ong2010&quot;/&gt;

'''Mass media''' is a term used to denote, as a class, that section of the media specifically conceived and designed to reach a very large audience (typically at least as large as the whole population of a nation state). It was coined in the 1920s with the advent of nationwide radio networks and of mass-circulation newspapers and magazines. The mass-media audience has been viewed by some commentators as forming a mass society with special characteristics, notably atomization or lack of social connections, which render it especially susceptible to the influence of modern mass-media techniques such as advertising and propaganda. It is also gaining popularity in the blogosphere when referring to the mainstream media. The term '''mass media''' is mainly used by academics and media-professionals. When members of the general public refer to &quot;the media&quot; they are usually referring to the mass media, or to the news media, which is a section of the mass media.'' 

==History==
During the 20th century, the advent of mass media was driven by technology that allowed the massive duplication of material at a low price. Physical duplication technologies such as printing, record pressing and film duplication allowed the duplication of books, newspapers and movies at low prices to huge audiences. Television and radio allowed the electronic duplication of content for the first time. Mass media had the economics of linear replication: a single work could make money proportional to the number of copies sold, and as volumes went up, unit costs went down, increasing profit margins further. Vast fortunes were to be made in mass media.

===Corporate and mainstream outlets===
Sometimes mass media (and the news media in particular) is referred to as &quot;corporate media&quot;.  Other references include the &quot;'''mainstream media'''&quot;. Technically, &quot;''mainstream media''&quot; includes outlets that are in harmony with the prevailing direction of influence in the culture at large. In the United States, usage of these terms often depends on the connotations the speaker wants to invoke. The term &quot;corporate media&quot; is often used by leftist media critics to imply that the mainstream media is manipulated by large multinational corporations. This is countered by right-leaning authors with the term &quot;MSM&quot;, the acronym implying that the majority of mass media sources is dominated by leftist powers which are furthering their own agenda.

==Purposes==
*Advocacy, both for business and social concerns. This can include advertising, marketing, propaganda, public relations, and political communication.
*Enrichment and education, such as literature.
*Entertainment, traditionally through performances of acting, music, and sports, along with light reading; since the late 20th century also through video and computer games.
*Journalism. 
*Public service announcements.

==Forms==
Electronic media and print media include:
*Broadcasting, in the narrow sense, for radio and television.
*Various types of discs or tape. In the 20th century, these were mainly used for music. Video and computer uses followed.
*Film, most often used for entertainment, but also for documentary film|documentaries.
*Internet, which has many uses and presents both opportunities and challenges. Blogs are unique to the Internet.
*Publishing, in the narrow sense, meaning on paper, mainly via books, magazines, and newspapers.

Toward the end of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web marked the first era in which any individual could have a means of exposure on a scale comparable to that of mass media. For the first time, anyone with a web site can address a global audience, although serving to high levels of web traffic is still relatively expensive. It is possible that the rise of peer-to-peer technologies may have begun the process of making the cost of bandwidth manageable.  Although a vast amount of information, imagery, and commentary (i.e. &quot;content&quot;) has been made available, it is often difficult to determine the authenticity and reliability of information contained in (in many cases, self-published) web pages. The invention of the Internet has also allowed breaking news stories to reach around the globe within minutes.  This rapid growth of instantaneous, decentralized communication is often deemed likely to change mass media and its relationship to society.

&quot;Cross-media&quot; means the idea of distributing the same message through different media channels. A similar idea is expressed in the news industry as &quot;convergence&quot;. Many authors understand cross-media publishing to be the ability to publish in both print and on the web without manual conversion effort. An increasing number of wireless devices with mutually incompatible data and screen formats make it even more difficult to achieve the objective “create

==Contrast with non-mass media==
Non-mass or &quot;personal&quot; media (point-to-point and person-to-person communication) include:
* Speech
* Gestures
* Telephony
* Postal mail
* Some uses of the Internet
* Some Interactive media

'''Education''' is a [[Wikipedia:social science|social science]] that [[Wikipedia:List of education topics|encompasses]] [[Wikipedia:teaching|teaching]] and [[Wikipedia:learning|learning]] specific [[Wikipedia:skill|skill]]s.  Practicing teachers in the field of education use a variety of methods and materials in their instruction to impart a curriculum. There has been a plethora of literature in the field of education that addresses these areas. Such literature addresses the facets of teaching practices to include instructional strategies, behavior management, environmental control, motivational strategies, and technological resources. However, the single most important factor in any teacher's effectiveness is the interaction style and personality of the teacher, for the quality of their relationships with the students provides the impetus for inspiration. The best teachers are able to translate good [[Wikipedia:judgment|judgment]], experience, and [[Wikipedia:wisdom|wisdom]] into the art of communication that students find compelling. It is their compassion for varied human qualities, passion, and the creativity of potential that assists teachers to invigorate students to higher expectations of themselves and society at large. The goal of education is the growth of students so that they become productive citizens of a [[Wikipedia:dynamic|dynamic]], everchanging, society. Fundamentally, the imparting of [[Wikipedia:culture|culture]] from generation to generation (see [[Wikipedia:socialisation|socialisation]])promotes a greater awareness and responsiveness through social maturity to the needs of an increasingly diversified society.

==Overview==

It is widely accepted that the process of education begins at birth and continues throughout life. Some believe that education begins even earlier than this, as evidenced by some parents' playing music or reading to the baby in the womb in the hope it will influence the child's development.

The word 'education' is often used to refer solely to formal education (see below).  However, it covers a range of experiences, from formal learning to the building of understanding through day to day experiences.  Ultimately, all that we experience serves as a form of education.

Individuals can receive informal education from a variety of sources.  [[Wikipedia:Family|Family]] members and [[Wikipedia:society|society]] have a strong influence on the informal education of the individual.

==Origins of the Word &quot;Education&quot;==

The word &quot;education&quot; is derived from the [[Wikipedia:Latin|Latin]] ''educare'' meaning &quot;leading out&quot; or &quot;leading forth&quot;.   This reveals one of the theories behind the function of education - of developing innate abilities and expanding horizons.

==Formal Education==

Formal education occurs when society or a group or an individual sets up a [[Wikipedia:curriculum|curriculum]] to educate people, usually the young. Formal education can become systematic and thorough.  Formal education systems can be used to promote ideals or values as well as knowledge and this can sometimes lead to abuse of the system.

Life-long or [[Wikipedia:adult education|adult education]] has become widespread in many countries. However, 'education' is still seen by many as something aimed at children, and adult education is often branded as 'adult learning' or 'lifelong learning'.

Adult education takes on many forms from formal class-based learning to self-directed learning.  Lending [[Wikipedia:Library|libraries]] provide inexpensive informal access to books and other self-instructional materials.  Many adults have also taken advantage of the rise in computer ownership and internet access to further their informal education.

==History of education==

In 1994 [[Wikipedia:Dieter Lenzen|Dieter Lenzen]], president of the [[Wikipedia:Freie Universität Berlin|Freie Universität Berlin]], said education began either millions of years ago or at the end of [[Wikipedia:1770|1770]]. (The first chair of [[Wikipedia:pedagogy|pedagogy]] was founded at the end of the [[Wikipedia:1770s|1770s]] at the [[Wikipedia:University of Halle|University of Halle]], [[Wikipedia:Germany|Germany]].) This quote by Lenzen includes the idea that education as a science cannot be separated from the educational traditions that existed before. 

Education was the natural response of early civilizations to the struggle of surviving and thriving as a culture, requiring adults to train the young of their society in the knowledge and skills they would need to master and eventually pass on. The evolution of culture, and human beings as a species, has depended on this practice of transmitting knowledge. In pre-literate societies this was achieved orally, story-telling from one generation to the next. As oral langauage developed into witten symbols and letters, the depth and breadth of knowledge that could be preserved and passed increased exponentially.

As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond the basic skills of communicating, trading, gathering food, religious practices, etc., the beginnings of formal education, schooling, eventually followed. There is evidence that schooling in this sense was already in place in Egypt between 3000 and 500BC.

[[Wikipedia:Basic education|Basic education]] today is considered those skills that are necessary to function in society. Yet, a more critical view&lt;ref name=&quot;Spring1998&quot;&gt;Spring, Joel. 1998. A Primer of Libertarian Education. Montreal: Black Rose Books&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that mass public education has been used by governments as a way to instill in the minds of youth nationalism and patriotism, as well as obedience to authority. Business corporations have also advocated public education as a way to teach children to be obedient to managers (&quot;teachers&quot;), to follow orders, complete assignments, show-up for class on time, and other conditions that mirror a work environment. In this radical critique of public education, schools are tools for coercing children to respect hierarchy and to fit them into the systems of the nation-state and capitalism.

==Education Globally==
===In developing countries===

In developing countries, the number and seriousness of the problems faced is naturally greater. People are sometimes unaware of the importance of education, and there is economic pressure from those parents who prioritize their children's making money in the short term over any long-term benefits of education. Recent studies on child labor and poverty have suggested, however, that when poor families reach a certain economic threshold where families are able to provide for their basic needs, parents return their children to school. This has been found to be true, once the threshold has been breached, even if the potential economic value of the children's work has increased since their return to school. Teachers are often paid less than other similar [[Wikipedia:profession|profession]]s.

A lack of good universities, and a low acceptance rate for good universities is evident in countries with a relatively high population density. In some countries there are uniform, overstructured, inflexible centralized programs from a central agency that regulates all aspects of education.

*Due to [[Wikipedia:globalization|globalization]], increased pressure on students in curricular activities
*Removal of a certain percentage of students for improvisation of academics (usually practised in schools, after 10th grade)

India however is starting to develop technologies that will skip land based phone and internet lines. Instead, they have launched a special education satellite that can reach more of the country at a greatly reduced cost. There is also an initiative started by AMD and other corporations to develop the $100 dollar computer which should be ready by 2006. This computer will be sold in units of 1 million, and will be assembled in the country where the computer will be used.  This appears to be a different computer to that developed by MIT, with the same price tag, believed to be powered by clockwork and a generator. This will enable poorer countries to give their children a digital education and to close the digital divide across the world.

In Africa, [[Wikipedia:NEPAD|NEPAD]] has launched an &quot;[[Wikipedia:NEPAD e-school programme|e-school programme]]&quot; to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and internet access within 10 years.

*should cover education statistics around the world
*also talk about economic development of countries and the connection to education
*maybe highlight some countries

==Technology and Education==

[[Wikipedia:Technology|Technology]] has become an increasingly influential factor in education.  [[Wikipedia:Computers|Computers]] and associated technology are being widely used in developed countries to both complement established education practices and develop new ways of learning such as [[Wikipedia:online education|online education]] (a type of distance education). While technology clearly offers powerful learning tools that can engage students, research has been mixed as to whether  technology actually improves student learning.

==Education and Social Theory==
===The Functions of Education===
The manifest function of education is the transmission of knowledge to students in order to help them contribute back to society, either as knowledge producers themselves (i.e., scientists) or in other ways, like in business or industry. However, education also has a latent function, and it is a function that is actually quite important when it comes to financial outcomes.  One of the latent functions of a mass educational system is to foster social skills.  And, it turns out, those social skills literally pay-off in the long run.  Students who score high on measures of sociability earn more money and get more education than equally intellectually gifted students who don't score as high in social skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lleras2008&quot;&gt;Lleras, Christy. 2008. “Do Skills and Behaviors in High School Matter? The Contribution of Noncognitive Factors in Explaining Differences in Educational Attainment and Earnings.” Social Science Research 37 (3): 888-902.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and Inequality==
===Gender===
A recent topic of policy debate in the U.S. is the concern that there is a &quot;boy crisis,&quot; as boys are less likely to graduate from high school and go on to college than are girls.  However, recent research by Judith Kleinfeld suggests that painting this as a &quot;crisis&quot; exclusive to boys may be a little misleading.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinfeld2009&quot;&gt;Kleinfeld, Judith. 2009. The State of American Boyhood. Gender Issues. 26:113-120.&lt;/ref&gt; Boys at the primary and secondary educational levels do have a number of problems: lower rates of literacy, lower grades, lower engagement in school, higher dropout rates, higher rates of placement in special education, higher rates of emotional disturbance, higher rates of learning disabilities, higher rates of suspension and expulsion from school, and lower rates of entrance into college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinfeld2009&quot;/&gt;  Outside of school, boys are also more likely to: commit suicide, exhibit conduct disorders, die young, and be arrested or sent to juvenile detention centers.  Clearly, boys have a number of problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinfeld2009&quot;/&gt;  However, girls have their own share of problems that are no less serious than those facing young men, just different: higher rates of depression, higher incidence of eating disorders, higher rates of suicide attempts, lower scores on math and science tests, and less likely to be the highest achievers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinfeld2009&quot;/&gt; Kleinfeld does conclude that the issues facing boys are probably more serious (e.g., 25% of American male high school graduates cannot understand a newspaper article vs. 10% of females), but also reminds us that women are facing many serious issues as well.

In the U.S. in 1960, 65% of all Bachelors degrees went to men; in 1982 it reached parity between men and women.  In 2004, women received 58% of Bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchmann2006&quot;&gt;Buchmann, C., and DiPrete, T.A. 2006. The Growing Female Advantage in College Completion: The Role of Family Background and Academic Achievement. American Sociological Review, 71 (4), 515-541.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1960s and 1970s were pivotal years in the reversal of educational disparity between men and women.  According to recent research,&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchmann2006&quot;/&gt; the reversal in disparity  of educational attainment between men and women is largely attributable to higher drop-out rates of men from 4-year colleges, particularly males whose fathers have just a high school education or are absent from the home.  Additionally, women experience earlier academic success than men do (in junior high and high school); the study skills and commitment that contribute to that success carries over to college where they do better than men.  Additional reasons why this reversal has taken place may include: a faster rise in the value of college for females than for males (resulting in women benefiting more from completing their education) and rising divorce rates, which force women to be more independent.  The increasing completion rate of women may have substantial influences on society in general, as education and income are important factors when considering who one will marry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul2006&quot;&gt;Paul, A.M. 2006. The Real Marriage Penalty. The New York Times. Retrieved November 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class and Income===
One of the primary factors contributing to educational inequality and poverty in general in the US is the funding system for public education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009&quot;&gt;Taylor, Kay Ann. 2009. Poverty's Multiple Dimensions. Journal of Educational Controversy. 4(1). http://www.wce.wwu.edu/Resources/CEP/eJournal/v004n001/a002.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  In most areas of the US, public schools are funded primarily through local property taxes.  As a result, schools in wealthier neighborhoods have substantially larger budgets, which translates into better facilities, better teachers, and better resources.  When these monetary advantages are coupled with the advantage of having a safe, supportive, and intellectually enriching home environment that comes with wealth,&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009&quot;/&gt; it is not surprising that children who attend better funded public schools tend to be more successful than those who attend more poorly funded public schools.  Additionally, within schools in the U.S., [[w:Tracking_(education)|tracking]] is commonly employed (separating students into different classes based on their abilities and skills).  Tracking increases disparity in educational attainment rather than reducing those disparities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacks2007&quot;&gt;Sacks, Peter. 2007. Tearing Down the Gates: Confronting the Class Divide in American Education. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence to suggest that the lifetime educational possibilities of most kids are set by the time they are six years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entwisle2005&quot;&gt;Entwisle, Doris R., Alexander, Karl L., and Steffel Olson, Linda. 2005. First Grade and Educational Attainment by Age 22: A New Story. American Journal of Sociology, 110 (5):1458–502.&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that several family background characteristics are very strong predictors of future educational attainment, including: parental support, parental expectations for schooling, household income, and parental educational attainment, with the last two being the most important factors. Also surprising in this study was the finding that the lifetime educational attainment predicted using background characteristics when individuals were in the first grade were just as good at predicting educational attainment as were similar variables when inviduals were in high school, and on some measures better. In real terms, this translates into children living in poorer neighborhoods receiving less education than children who live in middle-class or upper-class neighborhoods. What's more, the lifetime educational attainment seems to be set by the time children are starting school, not when they are finishing it.

Educational deficits resulting from inequality also affect future life trajectories.  Colleges tend to draw students from a relatively advantaged background because of their high costs and stiff academic requirements for enrollment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elder2010&quot;&gt;Elder, G. H., L. Wang, N. J. Spence, D. E. Adkins, and T. H. Brown. 2010. “Pathways to the All-Volunteer Military*.” Social Science Quarterly 91:455-475.&lt;/ref&gt;  What's more, because colleges want to maintain their rankings in various college ranking systems (e.g., U.S. News &amp; World Report), colleges favor students with higher standardized test scores and aggressively recruit them using &quot;merit&quot; scholarships.  In 2000, affluent students, students who could otherwise afford to pay for college, received &quot;merit&quot; scholarships worth 82% of the need-based aid received by students with the lowest family incomes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacks2007&quot;/&gt; In other words, affluent students who could pay for college often do not have to because the advantages they received attending better elementary, middle, and high schools translated into higher standardized test scores, which are attractive to universities when it comes to recruiting.  As a result, there is less funding available for students who actually need it. This ends up reinforcing the existing status hierarchy by keeping the affluent wealthy and the poor unable to attend college.

Some of those under-privileged youth choose another path as a result.  Despite being both volunteer and high risk, the military remains attractive to a certain segment of the U.S. population, primarily young people from less advantaged families and neighborhoods.  Such individuals view the military as more promising than entry-level jobs in the workforce without a college diploma.  Cognitively, young people from disadvantaged homes are about average, but are socioeconomically disadvantaged, which is one of the primary reasons they turn to the military rather than college to pursue financial success, with some success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elder2010&quot;/&gt;

===Health and Longevity===
As noted in the chapter on [[Introduction_to_Sociology/Demography|demography]], education is a strong and significant predictor of greater life expectancy.  The more years of education a person has, the greater their likelihood of engaging in healthy behaviors (and, inversely, the lower their likelihood of engaging in unhealthy behaviors, like smoking).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolata2007&quot;&gt;Kolata, G. 2007. A Surprising Secret to a Long Life: Stay in School. The ''New York Times''. Retrieved January 3, 2007. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/health/03aging.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues in Education (U.S. Focus)==
===Charter Schools===
Charter schools are publicly funded elementary or secondary schools in the United States that have been freed from some of the rules, regulations, and statutes that apply to other public schools in exchange for some type of accountability for producing certain results, which are set forth in each school's charter. Their founders are often teachers, parents, or activists who feel restricted by traditional public schools. State-run charter schools (schools not affiliated with local school districts) are often established by non-profit groups, universities, and some government entities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Renzulli2007&quot;&gt;Renzulli, Linda A., and Vincent J. Roscigno. 2007. “Charter Schools and the Public Good.” Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds 6:31-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for greater accountability. They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups, including the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them. Charter schools can theoretically be closed for failing to meet the terms set forth in their charter, but in practice, this can be difficult, divisive and controversial. One example was the 2003 revocation of the charter for a school called Urban Pioneer in the San Francisco Unified School District, which first came under scrutiny when two students died on a school wilderness outing.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Ray. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/07/MN158276.DTL &quot;District suspends wilderness trips: School could lose charter if safety lapses found&quot;,] San Francisco Chronicle, 2003-03-07. Retrieved on 2008-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt; An auditor's report found that the school was in financial disarray&lt;ref&gt;Schevit, Tanya. [http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/08/26/BA148795.DTL &quot;Audit finds faults in charter school: Board set to vote on troubled Urban Pioneer&quot;,] 2003-08-26. Retrieved on 2008-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt; and posted the lowest test scores of any school in the district except those serving entirely non-English-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://api.cde.ca.gov/reports/API/2003Base_Sch.asp?SchCode=3830452&amp;DistCode=68478&amp;AllCds=38684783830452 Academic Performance Index (API) Base Report: School Report: Urban Pioneer Experiential.] California Department of Education (2004-06-14). Retrieved on 2008-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also accused of academic fraud, graduating students with far fewer than the required credits.

Opponents of charter schools argue that charter schools probably cannot fix any broader problems with the U.S. educational system.  If they do anything, they probably encourage segregation while drawing money out of the public school system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Renzulli2007&quot;/&gt;  Additionally, recent data indicates that children in charter schools are not doing any better on standardized achievement tests.  At best, they are doing as well as children in public schools, but when charter schools are not associated with a public school district, children in the schools score significantly less well than their public school counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Renzulli2007&quot;/&gt;  Charter schools appear not to be the solution to the lackluster educational system of the U.S.

===High School Completion===
An issue often obfuscated by confusing statistics, high school completion rates in the U.S. are often lower than reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon2008&quot;&gt;Dillon, Sam. 2008. “States’ Data Obscure How Few Finish High School.” The New York Times, March 20 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/education/20graduation.html (Accessed March 20, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  High school completion rates are calculated at the state level and aggregated at the federal level.  The percentage of students who graduate from high school often reported by the federal government in the U.S. is around 85%, but a more accurate percentage is about 71%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon2008&quot;/&gt;  Seventy-one percent is a sobering statistic when you think about its implications - slightly less than 3 out of 4 students who start high school in the U.S. finish; 1/4 of young people in America today are moving into adulthood without a high school diploma.  The lack of a high school diploma contributes to lower wages and increased rates of poverty, as well as poorer general understandings of society, health, and science.  Additionally, the U.S. used to lead the world in sending high school graduates on to higher education, but in 2008 it was 5th and 16th out of 27 industrialized countries in the proportion of students who start college and complete it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiske2008&quot;&gt;Fiske, Edward B. 2008. “A Nation at a Loss.” The New York Times, April 25 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/25/opinion/25fiske.html (Accessed February 8, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  We also have a disproportionate share of low-performing students; almost 1/3 of students in U.S. secondary schools don't have the minimum education to contribute to a globalized, high-tech economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiske2008&quot;/&gt;

===Public vs. Private Schools===
While it has long been held that private schools provide better education than public schools, current research suggests that is not the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubienski2008&quot;&gt;Lubienski, Christopher, Corinna Crane, and Sarah Theule Lubienski. 2008. What Do We Know About School Effectiveness? Academic Gains in Public and Private Schools. Phi Delta Kappan. 89, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Public school students test higher, on average, in math than do private school students when social and economic backgrounds are controlled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubienski2008&quot;/&gt;  Longitudinal data illustrates that, while students beginning in public and Catholic schools test at about the same level in math, by the fifth grade the public school students make significantly greater gains, equivalent to almost an extra half year of schooling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubienski2008&quot;/&gt;  While the limited number of private schools makes it difficult to compare a wide variety of religiously affiliated schools with public schools, conservative Protestant private schools show the worst math performance of all types of schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubienski2008&quot;/&gt;  Math is particularly telling in this regard as it is the subject least influenced by home environment and most greatly influenced by the effectiveness of the schooling environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubienski2008&quot;/&gt;  However, it should be noted that school type only explains about 5% of the variation in math scores; the bulk of the difference is explained by demographic characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubienski2008&quot;/&gt;  The implication of this research is that, while private schools may provide a specific type of schooling (i.e., one that includes religious instruction), there is little evidence that private schools in general provide better instruction or improve educational outcomes.

===Other Issues===

*home schooling
*tracking
*[[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 5: Students with Special Educational Needs|people with disabilities]]
*adult education
*teacher shortages and teacher quality

Some of these issues, as well as others, are discussed in a Wikibook called [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]].

==The Role of Students==
Education is not solely about the provision of information to students.  Students also play a role in the education process.  One of the ways they do so is in employing effective study techniques.  Unfortunately, there are a number of myths about effective studying techniques for students.  For instance, many educators encourage elaborate study techniques, like concept-mapping, claiming that they improve the encoding of information into memory.  Recent research suggests it is more beneficial for recall to practice retrieving information than using elaborate encoding techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karpicke2011&quot;&gt;Karpicke, Jeffrey D., and Janell R. Blunt. 2011. “Retrieval Practice Produces More Learning than Elaborative Studying with Concept Mapping.” Science.&lt;/ref&gt;  Students' time is better spent practicing free recall of information studied than employing complex study techniques.

==Challenges in education==
The goal of education is the transference of [[Wikipedia:ideas|ideas]] and skills from one person to another, or from one person to a group.
Current education issues include which teaching method(s) are most effective, how to determine what knowledge should be taught, which knowledge is most relevant, and how well the pupil will retain incoming knowledge. Educators such as [[Wikipedia:George Counts|George Counts]] and [[Wikipedia:Paulo Freire|Paulo Freire]] identified education as an inherently political process with inherently political outcomes. The challenge of identifying ''whose'' ideas are transferred and what goals they serve has always stood in the face of formal and informal education.

In addition to the &quot;Three R's&quot;, [[Wikipedia:reading (activity)|reading]], [[Wikipedia:writing|writing]], and [[Wikipedia:arithmetic|arithmetic]], Western primary and secondary schools attempt to teach the basic knowledge of [[Wikipedia:history|history]], [[Wikipedia:geography|geography]], [[Wikipedia:mathematics|mathematics]] (usually including [[Wikipedia:calculus|calculus]] and [[Wikipedia:algebra|algebra]]), [[Wikipedia:physics|physics]], [[Wikipedia:chemistry|chemistry]] and sometimes [[Wikipedia:politics|politics]], in the hope that students will retain and use this knowledge as they age or that the skills acquired will be transferrable. The current education system measures competency with tests and assignments and then assigns each student a corresponding grade. The grades usually come in the form of either a letter grade or a percentage, which are intended to represent the amount of all material presented in class that the student understood. 

Educational progressives or advocates of unschooling often believe that grades do not necessarily reveal the strengths and weaknesses of a student, and that there is an unfortunate lack of [[Wikipedia:youth voice|youth voice]] in the educative process. Some feel the current grading system risks lowering students' [[Wikipedia:self-confidence|self-confidence]], as students may receive poor marks due to factors outside their control. Such factors include poverty, [[Wikipedia:child abuse|child abuse]], and [[Wikipedia:prejudice|prejudice]]d or incompetent teachers.

By contrast, many advocates of a more traditional or &quot;back to basics&quot; approach believe that the direction of reform needs to be quite the opposite.  Students are not sufficiently inspired or challenged to achieve success  because of the dumbing down of the curriculum and the replacement of the &quot;canon&quot; with inferior material.  Their view of self-confidence is that it arises not from removing hurdles such as grading, but by making them fair and encouraging students to gain pride from knowing they can jump over these hurdles.

On the one hand, [[Wikipedia:Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein]], one of the most famous [[Wikipedia:physicist|physicist]]s of our time, credited with helping us understand the universe better, was not a model school student. He was uninterested in what was being taught, and he did not attend classes all the time. However, his gifts eventually shone through and added to the sum of human knowledge. On the other hand, for millennia those who have been challenged and well-educated in traditional schools have risen to great success and to a lifelong love of learning because their minds were made better and more powerful, as well as because of their mastery of a wide range of skills.

There are a number of highly controversial issues in education. Should some knowledge be forgotten? What should be taught, are we better off knowing how to build nuclear bombs, or is it best to let such knowledge be forgotten?

===Parental involvement===

[[Wikipedia:Parent|Parental]] involvement is an essential aspect of a child's educational [[Wikipedia:development|development]]. Early and consistent parental involvement in the child's life is [[Wikipedia:critical|critical]] such as reading to children at an early age, teaching patterns, [[Wikipedia:interpersonal communication|interpersonal communication]] skills, exposing them to diverse cultures and the [[Wikipedia:community|community]] around them, educating them on a healthy [[Wikipedia:lifestyle|lifestyle]], etc. The socialization and academic education of a child are aided by the involvement of the [[Wikipedia:student|student]], [[Wikipedia:parent|parent(s)]], [[Wikipedia:teacher|teachers]], and others in the community and extended family.

Sorry if you found my suggestions offensive in any way.

It's true that currently there's no consensus about naming policy. However, most contributors agree that we should not name pages like &quot;XXX YYY&quot;, it's better to name in one of two ways: &quot;XXX:YYY&quot; or &quot;XXX/YYY&quot;. Disagreements are connected with prefering one of these two conventions over another and some rather irrelevant issues (whether allow title shortcuts or not).

Using one of this two conventions, it's easier to determine to which book a chapter belongs, you also have some automatic actions easier to perform. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:12, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If phonics were a quaint, fanciful and eccentric theory advanced in internet chatrooms by people who palpably lacked a knowledge of English phonology, it might be harmless. The trouble is that it is used to teach real children in real schools who must, therefore, learn literacy despite it.

A child who is told by a perhaps otherwise trustworthy adult that &quot;a&quot; has a long sound (as in &quot;make&quot;) and a short one (as in &quot;cat&quot;) will be unable to read &quot;father&quot; correctly till he has learned to ignore those rules. A child who is told that &quot;e&quot; can only represent the vowels in &quot;beat&quot; and &quot;bet&quot; will be unable to read the words &quot;English&quot; and &quot;enable&quot; properly until he learns to ignore that rule. A child who is told that the two vowel-letters in &quot;beat&quot; are a diphthong is being downright misled.

Phonics has the appearance of a scheme devised by people who don't know phonetics trying to find patterns in a chaotic system, and often getting it wrong. Fundamental mistakes include a failure to distinguish vowel-length and diphthongs, as well as a belief that spoken language renders the orthography rather than the other way around.

My hunch is that people learn to read and write in a similar way to the way in which they learn to speak. This would make sense, since it is all about language.  &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash;''the preceding unsigned comment is by'' [[User:80.189.226.94|80.189.226.94]] ([[User talk:80.189.226.94|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/80.189.226.94|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sorry, I've got to disagree with your semi-rant.  No system of education can provide a learner with the tools to be ''immediately'' capable of performing every task within a field of study.  &lt;p&gt;

You might want to check out some of the work cognitive scientists (''e.g.'' Pinker) have done regarding language acquisition vs reading skills.  Reading appears to be learned through very different paths from speaking and listening skills.&lt;p&gt;

In the US, there were many arguments made in the 60s that said essentially what you have said.  As a consequence, quite a few school districts dropped phonics from their curricula, saving a few dollars.  In its place was a different approach to teaching reading, the &quot;look and say&quot; method, which is the alternative you seem to be advocating.  The results were disastrous for students. Pure memorization of spelling, pronunciation, and meaning for each newly acquired word is absurd. &lt;p&gt;

For the last 15 years, phonics has been either reintroduced into the classroom or has been the primary effective method of choice for tutoring those non-disabled students who have struggled to gain reading skills. Parents have turned to phonics as a means to assist their children outside of the classroom. I have never known a child whose reading skills were not improved by the study of phonics.&lt;p&gt;

Phonics is a necessary class for most, if not all, children.  It has never been promoted as the ''sole'' method of teaching reading (as far as I can recall) but has a long history as an essential adjunct in the acquisition of literacy.  &lt;p&gt;

You specifically pointed to perceived inadequacies regarding the pronunciation &quot;rules&quot; for certain vowels.  This poses a minor problem at most.  If you keep in mind that English is a consonant intensive language, you will note that there are only a few consonants with unpredictable pronunciations.&lt;p&gt;

I suppose that none of this matters much, seeing that, at least in the US, school districts are under funded, under staffed, and over politicized.  Hmm. I guess that was rather POV of me! [[User:Ande B.|Ande]] 09:00, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This seems an un-necessary concept to bother to teach. Inasfar as most speech consists of more than one sound, one could say that all speech is a blend. To suggest that &quot;br&quot; is a single sound is to ignore the way in which it is composed of two sounds, the way that &quot;r&quot; isn't. If there are to be blends, why do they not include clusters of vowels and consonants, such as &quot;bri&quot; in &quot;bring&quot;. If &quot;bri&quot; is a cluster or a blend, then so is &quot;bring&quot; which is, of course, also a word. Although phonics focuses on this distracting concept of clusters/blends, it seems oblivious to the fact that some vowels which are written with one letter are actually diphthongs and therefore consist of a glide between two vowel-positions.

I can't see what possible good there is in telling a child that, if you put p and l together you get (wait for it) pl. Pl isn't a sound in its own right, but just two sounds attached. The inventors of phonics may have got confused by combinations such as th and sh. Maybe they think that one produces the th and sh sounds by somehow combining a t or an s with an h. That is untrue.

Phonics, I'm afraid, has all the marks of having been created by people who don't know English phonology.</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Lavender Brown''''' is a Gryffindor girl in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s year. She is a very good friend of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]], and favours [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]] lessons above all others.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Lavender Brown is the first student Sorted into Gryffindor.

As they go down to the Hallowe'en Feast, Harry and Ron overhear [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati]] telling Lavender that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] was crying in the girls' toilet and wanted to be left alone. Ron, who had made harsh comments about her following [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] class, seems to feel a bit awkward about this revelation.

While we see Lavender in passing in some of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s classes, she does not play any particularly significant role in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

While we see Lavender in passing in some of Harry's classes, she does not play any particularly significant role in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Lavender, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]], is particularly intrigued by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination class]], and almost starts worshiping [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] when she correctly predicts that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] will break some of her teacups. At the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]] class, Professor Trelawney tells Lavender, &quot;That thing you are dreading? It will happen on October 16th.&quot; On October 16, Lavender receives word that her pet bunny had been killed, and we see that Lavender has reshaped the prediction retroactively in her own mind so that it refers to this event: while she admits that she had not been dreading Binky's death, and that it had not actually happened on the 16th, she still resents [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s questioning of whether the prediction that Trelawney had made had actually come to pass.

Another thing that Trelawney had predicted was that &quot;near Easter time, one of our number will leave us forever.&quot; Immediately after Easter break, as they are starting crystal balls, Trelawney claims to see the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Grim|Grim]] in Harry's crystal ball. This angers Hermione, and she and Trelawney exchange words, as a result of which Hermione drops Divination. Lavender and Parvati immediately accept this as fulfillment of Trelawney's earlier prediction.

It is mentioned that Lavender and Parvati seem to spend almost all of their free time up in Trelawney's tower after that.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Lavender's role in this book is relatively minor.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] class, starts teaching the class about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skrewt|Skrewts]], it is Lavender who discovers that some of them have stingers.

In desperation, Harry asks Parvati if she will go to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] with him, and she accepts. He asks Lavender if she would go with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], but she is already going with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]].

After Hagrid returns from his self-imposed suspension, he chooses to prove that he can teach Care of Magical Creatures at least as well as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]]. He chooses to teach about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]], and has captured a foal which he has secured under the eaves of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Lavender and Parvati are absolutely entranced by it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Lavender Brown is talking with Parvati Patil when Harry arrives in the Great Hall at the start of the school year. They greet Harry with a light, airy unconcern that tells Harry that they had been discussing him before he arrived. Hermione mentions the following morning that Lavender is skeptical of Harry's story that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] has returned. Apparently this is fairly common in the school, largely because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] has been systematically belittling Harry and Dumbledore over the summer.

On the second day of classes, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] asks if anyone can identify the creatures she has in front of her, Hermione puts her hand up, and Draco imitates her. Pansy shrieks with laughter, then screams as the little bundles of twigs on the table jump up. Lavender and Parvati let out little sighs of amazement, which annoy Harry: it is not like Hagrid had not been showing them fantastic creatures all along.

As Harry enters the greenhouse for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]] on the second day of classes, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] says that she believes Harry. Parvati and Lavender laugh at Luna and her earrings that appear to be orange radishes, but become much more sober when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] loudly states that he believes Harry's report of the return of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

Lavender is one of the students who attends the first meeting of what becomes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]].

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] appears outside the window of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]] classroom, Lavender comments that she's always loved Hedwig, she's so beautiful.

After receiving her evaluation from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]], Professor Trelawney seems distraught. Parvati and Lavender ask her what is wrong, and catch a lot of the resulting diatribe against &quot;the establishment&quot;.

Parvati and Lavender are noted as being two of the students who are somewhat dismayed to see that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is back, when he returns from the mission Dumbledore had assigned him.

Lavender and Parvati Patil are seen hugging each other and crying quietly as Professor Trelawney is sacked by a cheerfully sarcastic Umbridge.

The following day, Lavender and Parvati suggest that Hermione should now be sorry that she had given up Divination, as the new teacher is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]]. Hermione says that she was not terribly fond of horses, and Lavender, indignant, says that he isn't a horse, he's a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]]. Hermione dismisses this, saying he still has four legs. Lavender says also that she and Parvati had gone to see Professor Trelawney and had found that she was distraught, still, and was saying that she would prefer to leave the school.

Lavender tells Ron that Firenze will be teaching in Classroom Eleven, on the ground floor, as he cannot manage the ladders that lead up to the tower. Reaching the classroom, everyone is surprised to see that it has been turned into a replica of a clearing in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Although Lavender is likely as upset by Firenze's abrupt dismissal of all Trelawney's teachings as Parvati, she says nothing.

In the final meeting of Dumbledore's Army in April, the class is working on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronuses]]. Several people in the class are having trouble; Lavender and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], in particular, can only produce little bits of white vapour.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Lavender Brown becomes a more important character in this book, as she begins the year openly flirting with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. On his way to breakfast on his first day as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]], Ron confiscates a Fanged Frisbee from a first-year student, then remarks that he'd always wanted one of them himself. Lavender, who is passing, laughs particularly loudly.

At breakfast, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] is handing out timetables. Lavender asks who is teaching Divination; told that Professor Trelawney is teaching the sixth-year students, Lavender and Parvati seem somewhat discouraged.

After a particularly terrible Quidditch match, Ron and his sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] have a row after he and Harry accidentally walk in on her snogging [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] in a Hogwarts hallway. They have a screaming match in which Ginny accuses Ron of having absolutely no experience with girls. Since Ron is still smarting from watching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] being singled out by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', and their ongoing pen-pal relationship, he starts responding to Lavender's advances. Their relationship is publicly and intensely physical – Harry at one point compares it to a vertical wrestling match, and at another point wonders which of several hands he can see belongs to whom. This causes a huge rift between Hermione and Ron that lasts several months during their 6th year. 

Lavender Brown is something of a scatterbrain, however, and has absolutely no idea what Ron is thinking when they are apart. For example, at Christmas, Lavender sends Ron a gold necklace with letters spelling out &quot;My Sweetheart&quot;; Ron is repulsed by it. Ron eventually realizes that he needs more from a relationship than just snogging.

On his birthday, Ron eats some chocolate cauldrons which have been spiked with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Love Potion|love potion]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]], who intended them for Harry. While Harry is taking him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] to get the potion effects reversed, they meet Lavender; Ron roughly pushes her aside, saying that Harry has promised to introduce him to Romilda. After receiving the antidote, Ron is nearly killed by some poison intended for another victim, possibly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. Lavender does visit Ron in the hospital wing, but complains to Harry that he always seems to be sleeping when she visits. Harry asks Ron about this, and Ron admits that he is feigning sleep, because he doesn't want to deal with Lavender at the moment. Lavender is outraged when she discovers that Ron has been released from the hospital wing, but she has not been told; and further, that Hermione evidently knew before Lavender did. 

Ron's relationship with Lavender seems to continue after his recovery, though it has suffered a major blow. At one point, when Hermione is correcting one of Ron's essays, in apparent gratitude he says &quot;Thank you Hermione, I love you.&quot; Hermione replies that he shouldn't let Lavender hear that, and Ron says that maybe he should; he hasn't yet found any other way to break up with her.

Harry now determines that he must use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis potion]] to get a memory from Professor Slughorn. Under the influence of this potion, he decides to don his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] and go visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. As he, Ron, and Hermione descend from the boy's dormitory, they run into Lavender; she of course can't see Harry, and starts berating Ron for being up in his dormitory &quot;alone with ''her''&quot; (Hermione). This is basically the lever Ron needs to end his relationship with her. Ron almost immediately takes up with Hermione, and Lavender has very little further role except looking saddened by Ron and Hermione's closeness.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

As Lavender Brown returns to Hogwarts to finish her seventh year there, we see very little of her in this book. She is one of the members of Dumbledore's Army who are found to be living in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] when Harry gets back to Hogwarts. 

As Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape the castle on their way to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|the Shrieking Shack]], they see Lavender, who has just fallen from a balcony in the Entry Hall, attacked by a grey blur that Harry at first takes for an animal. Hermione jinxes the blur, which Harry now recognizes as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]]. Fenrir is then knocked unconscious by a flying crystal ball, sent his way by Sybill Trelawney.&lt;!-- To the editor who keeps adding that Lavender later dies: whether or not that is mentioned elsewhere, it is not in the book, and therefore not part of our work here. --&gt;

== Strengths ==

Lavender seems to be intensely committed to her relationships, and fiercely loyal to friends and, apparently, lovers.

== Weaknesses ==

Lavender talks a lot and doesn't usually let anyone else get their message across. Somewhat gullible, she seems completely taken in by Professor Trelawney. 

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Throughout the series, Lavender is best friends with Parvati Patil.

Taken in by Professor Trelawney's &quot;Divination,&quot; Lavender is seen to be almost hero-worshiping Trelawney starting from the first few Divination classes. She seems to transfer some of her affections to Firenze when he takes over teaching Divination.

In her relationship with Ron, she seems to be more attached to an image of him than to him; she has no idea what he would actually like for Christmas, for instance. This relationship, which is intensely physical, is also marked by jealousy on Lavender's part. It seems that she is in love with the idea of having a boyfriend who is a prefect, rather than with Ron himself.

== Analysis ==

Lavender is very much a minor character, playing at best a supporting role in the story; it is to the author's credit that she is so well written as a character. There is little need, if any, in the story line, to have her express so much interest in Divination, or to so clearly have become best friends with Parvati Patil. In the overall scheme of things, the entire affair between Ron and Lavender is unnecessary to the main plot line of the story. The author, however, has chosen to write the story against a fully believable backdrop of what happens to teenagers as they mature, and of course the sort of romantic entanglements we see with Ron and Lavender are a large part of that maturation. The additional details allow the reader to mentally flesh out the character, so that while Lavender may be dismissed to some extent as important to the story, the reader still cares about her as a person, and is concerned about her survival and possible injuries in the final battle.

Hermione comments at one point that Ron has &quot;the emotional depth of a teaspoon.&quot; It is perhaps for this reason that Lavender is portrayed, at least in her relationship with Ron, to be almost equally shallow. Perhaps this is a necessary stage in Ron's maturation, as it causes him to recognize the value of Hermione's more mature outlook. It is possible that, just as the author felt there had to be a major event, such as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|mountain troll]], to knock Hermione out of her &quot;grind&quot; character [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 10|in the first book]], equally Lavender is the major relationship event that awakens some emotional awareness in Ron.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
# Is Lavender Brown now a werewolf? It seemed that she was bitten by Fenrir Greyback near the end of book seven, and he may have been transformed into his werewolf form at the time.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is interesting that in a clever twist by the author, it is Hermione who saves Lavender from being mauled by Greyback, in spite of Lavender being in direct competition with Hermione for Ron's affections throughout the course of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.

There is significant debate as to whether Greyback was in his Werewolf shape or not when Lavender was attacked; much of the debate appears on the [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 32|talk page]] for that chapter. One major factor arguing against his being Transformed is the author's habit of never naming characters Harry has not been introduced to, and he has never seen Greyback transformed. He has seen Greyback in his human form, and had him named, in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|previous book]], so the immediate identification of Greyback would imply strongly that Greyback is in his human shape. Against this, there is the description of Greyback as a &quot;grey blur&quot;, and the fact that little in the text rules out Fenrir (and Lupin) being transformed. While it is true that that the given date for the battle of Hogwarts, May 2nd, 1998, according to the lunar calendar is not a full moon, we must discount this as evidence due to earlier lack of correlation between the Hogwarts lunar cycle and ours, as mentioned in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''. Finally, however, it is mentioned elsewhere that Lupin met his death while dueling with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]], which would not be a description of what he was doing were he transformed. As we see in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', however, Lupin does not transform until the light of the full moon actually hits him; despite the moon being fully up, he does not transform in the Shrieking Shack, only when he emerges from the tunnel, so it is just possible that he has somehow managed to battle the Death Eaters without ever being exposed to moonlight.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As with other aspects of phonics, the idea of breaking words into syllables is a distraction from learning to read. We learn to read by associating written words with spoken ones. In some cases, the word gives us a clue to its pronunciation, because some letters represent few sounds or just one. An example is &quot;k&quot;. If a word contains letters which represent many sounds (such as all vowel-letters and many consonants such as &quot;c&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and &quot;g&quot;), one needs to learn what the letter is doing in that word. One of the things which a letter could be doing in a word is nothing: for example, the &quot;b&quot; in &quot;numb&quot; and the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;syllable&quot;. In other cases, a letter could be being used with another letter to make a single sound, such as many instances of &quot;th&quot; (which can actually represent one of two sounds). Sadly, most words include letters which can make several sounds.</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Sir Cadogan''''' is one of the portraits at Hogwarts. He is in a habit of taunting people as they pass.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Perhaps because of his habit of challenging all who pass, Sir Cadogan's portrait is hung in one of the upper and more remote corridors of the castle. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] request his assistance in finding the Divination classroom on their first day of classes; he provides it by moving from picture to picture in the correct direction.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] attempts to destroy the portrait of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|The Fat Lady]], in retaliation for her not letting him into the Gryffindor Common Room, Sir Cadogan takes her place. He retains that position until he allows Sirius into the Gryffindor common room because he happened to have the password; he is then returned to the upper reaches of the castle.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Sir Cadogan is mentioned briefly by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]] when he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] meet Harry before watching him as he competes in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]]. Bill asks Harry if the painting containing Sir Cadogan still remains in Hogwarts, later saying how he hasn't been to the school in five years, most likely since he graduated. This indicates that Sir Cadogan has been in the castle for at least five years, but probably more.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Sir Cadogan is mentioned as one of the portraits who shout encouragement to the defenders of Hogwarts. As Harry is on his way to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], where he now believes Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem is hidden, Sir Cadogan paces him for a while, shouting words of encouragement.

== Strengths ==

He knows his way round Hogwarts well, and shows Harry where to go for his first lesson of Divination. He is also very brave, always willing to accept a Quest or a Challenge. It seems that he generally considers any request for assistance to be a Quest.

== Weaknesses ==

Sir Cadogan isn't good at fighting at all. He is extremely clumsy, dropping his sword, or getting it stuck in the turf, and can never get onto his pony. Another weakness, of course, is that his horse is a pony, rather than a more typical charger. As mentioned in Strengths, above, he is very brave, but he actually seems brave to the point of foolhardiness; he will seemingly accept any challenge, even one that would result in the destruction of his painting.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Sir Cadogan can be quite tiresome, with his repeated demands that people &quot;Stand and fight, ye scurvy cur!&quot; Particularly as, being part of a painting, you cannot actually reach him to fight him, and he cannot reach you either.

Additionally, due to his perpetual clumsiness, he is something of a figure of fun to the people who have to deal with him.

== Analysis ==
Sir Cadogan is a useful object, because he can help Harry and his friends around the castle. He doesn't complicate much when action is needed, unlike many other artistic objects around the castles - the gargoyles being good examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Children can pronounce polysyllabic words long before they learn to read. Indeed, connected speech is itself polysyllabic. And do children really understand all this VCCV and jack-in-the-box stuff, even if it's true? Surely, if they're trying to read a word like &quot;kit&quot;, they pronounce the three elements one by one and see if it makes sense. If the word is &quot;kitbag&quot; they do the same. It would be a waste of time and effort to split &quot;kitbag&quot; into syllables if one can decode the six elements sequentially and come up with a plausible word. Sure, it gets more difficult with words containing less predictable letters (such as &quot;c&quot; and &quot;s&quot;) but then one is learning the letters' roles in context. At an impressionistic level, this distracting search for syllables might make a learner expect that &quot;through&quot; had more syllables than, say, &quot;title&quot;.

BTW, in looking for syllables in &quot;title&quot;, where is the second talking vowel? It's not the &quot;e&quot; which is silent. &quot;Title&quot; is actually di-syllabic because the &quot;l&quot; is syllabic. Are we really going to burden children with this concept, which even the inventors of phonics don't seem to have grasped?

::The comments above may have some validity, but surely the purpose of this book is to tell people what Systematic Phonics is, whatever reservations some people may have about it. If the authors can reference sources which support their description of conventional practice then that is sufficient justification for the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ArosNav}}

'''AROS''' is an recursive acronym for the ''AROS Research Operating System'', an AmigaOS (TM) API compatible [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_operating_systems OS], with certain improvements, that is portable and freely available. It is developed as a collaborative project, with the source code being available under an [[/APL|open source license]].

AROS is not tied to any company policy or computer hardware. No financial or legal circumstances will have any negative effect on the progress of AROS. It has a secure future. Moreover AROS effort helps the Amiga community in general. Projects such as AfA-OS which improves the Classic Amiga OS and the free [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstart_%28Amiga%29 kickstart] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory rom] which is useful in improving UAE(software), [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimig Minimig] and [http://www.fpgaarcade.com/ FPGA Arcade](hardware) and others. 

As more Amiga 68k hardware and accelerators become scarce and expensive some thought was made to preserve the Amiga spirit. One approach out of many is AROS which can run on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola Motorola] 68k, PowerPC, Intel x86 and compatibles, ARM SOCs and others. Where anyone can use an alternative to most mainstream Operating Systems (OS), for nostalgic reasons, educationally as an alternative to Linux, to experience new ideas or just be different. 



Ways to program 

* Open -  Aros target level with C, C++, Pascal, LUA and others. Goal of portable coding 
* Closed - CPU architecture means specific assembler mnemonics becomes machine code - closely coupled to hardware and not portable 

Many old 68k applications and games work out of the box on Aros68k and related Amiga based m68k hardware, so it has a lot to do with &quot;Amiga&quot;. It implements the same APIs, it has the same directories. You can code a program in M68K assembler which will actually run on BOTH AmigaOS 3.x and AROS for M68K. But it will run on AmigaOS 3.x and AROS M68K ONLY (this means: on classic Amiga models, clones and ports of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE_%28emulator%29 UAE]). 

Obviously, if you wish your code to work on ANY OTHER platform, you have to either code the application in a compatible assembler for THAT platform or use a higher level language. The advantage of C and other interpreted or compiled high-level languages is that you can write your source code once, and then compile it for any target platform. 

Being able to share the same source code and compile it on many platform targets is the aim of AROS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Diphthong and vowel team'''

The definition of diphthong is unsatisfactory. In phonetics, a diphthong is a glide between two vowel-positions. In this article, it is characterised as being new. How is the student to ascertain the novelty of a sound? If the article means that the &quot;ea&quot; in &quot;beat&quot; is a diphthong, then students will be being taught an irregular meaning of diphthong. In phonetics, the &quot;ea&quot; in &quot;beat&quot; is a monophthong. One assumes that the author would say that the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;like&quot; was not a diphthong because it was represented by just one letter, yet, phonetically, it is a diphthong.

One wonders if a vowel team is a phonetic dipthong, as in &quot;fear&quot; where a vowel-glide is represented by two letters. What, I wonder, would phonics make of &quot;bear&quot; where the same two letters represent a phonetic monophthong. Is the &quot;ea&quot; in &quot;bear&quot; a vowel team or a diphthong? It has two elements but makes one sound. Is that sound new in terms of the definition of the product of a diphthong?

And what on earth would phonics' zany vowel team/diphthong theory make of the vowel-cluster in &quot;create&quot;? Phonetically it is, in IMHO, a dieresis comprising a monophthong (/i/) and a diphthong (/ei/); or maybe it's a triphthong. Yet (poor old phonics) it's the same two letters as in &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;bear&quot;.

'''Schwa'''

Saying that this is pronounced like &quot;uh&quot; is just plain wrong. It's as wrong as saying it's like &quot;ah&quot;.

'''Long and short vowels'''

This section implies that the five vowel-letters have just two sounds each. This does not account for the fact that &quot;a&quot; makes different sounds in make, cat, father and about. This model also implies that English has just 10 vowel-sounds (or 11 if you include schwa) when it actually has around twice that number.

Four of the five vowels which this section calls long are actually diphthongs, characterised, not by the time it takes to pronounce them, but by the fact that they are a glide between two vowel-positions.

I cannot think that there is any evidence that what the section calls short vowels are harder to pronounce than, for example, diphthongs.


:Also, &quot;oo&quot; is never pronounced the same way as the short &quot;o&quot; of ''not''. [[User:Politas|Myk]] 21:04, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===jp===
In the previous program a label was written:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
text:
      .db &quot;Hello, World&quot;,0&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
''text:'' is a label. Labels are never tabbed and always end with a colon. Labels are actually 16-bit numbers, pointing to the instruction directly following them. Thus labels are actually 16-bit immediate numbers and can be treated the same (the same loads apply to them). They mark a place in a program. You can jump to a label by using jp ''labelname'':
&lt;pre&gt;.NOLIST
#define END .end
#define end .end
#define equ .equ
#include &quot;ti83plus.inc&quot;
.LIST

      .org 9D93h
      .db $BB,$6D
      jp clearscreen   ;here it is
      ld a,0
      ld (CURCOL),a
      ld (CURROW),a
      ld hl,text
      B_CALL(_PutS)
      ret
text:
      .db &quot;Text&quot;,0
clearscreen:           ;and here it goes
      B_CALL(_ClrLCDFull)
.end
end&lt;/pre&gt;
(B_CALL(_ClrLCDFull) clears the screen.) The program above clears the screen but never displays text. Why? Because ''jp clearscreen'' automatically jumps to the label clearscreen and contintues until the end of the program, skipping over all the text display code. 

''jp label'' is equal to this invalid-syntax code ''LD PC,label''.

By the way, the stuff followed by the semicolon are comments: they are used to explain the code and are ignored by the compiler. (The compiler is the program which converts the code you write to code a machine can read.)

===jr===
jr is a jumping instruction similar to jp, but with a few important differences. It's one byte smaller (this may not seem like a lot, but it can add up); however, unlike jp (which can jump to any address), jr can only jump to a label that's up to 127 bytes forward or up to 128 bytes backward in your code. So, use jp if the label is far away but otherwise use jr. In fact, you may want to always use jr, because when you compile an error will be returned if the label is too distant. The compiler subtracts the address to which the label behind the jr is pointing to from the address of the label itself, if the result does not fit in a signed 8-bit number it will throw an error because it can not be compiled (address exceeds range). JR's are always slower than JP's, and you can not use all conditions with them. JR can use the conditions Z, NZ, C and NC, whereas JP, RET and CALL can use the conditions Z, NZ, C, NC, PO (parity odd), PE (parity even), P (positive)and M (negative).

The jump in the above program could be replaced with jr:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;.NOLIST
#define END .end
#define end .end
#define equ .equ
#include &quot;ti83plus.inc&quot;
.LIST

      .org 9D93h
      .db $BB,$6D
      jr clearscreen      ;this saves space!&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

===call===
Imagine if you want to jump somewhere and then go back. CALL pushes its address +3 on the stack; 
RET pops the top of the stack in PC. This is the very same stack as the PUSH-POP stack, so be careful.
Use call and ret to 'jump' somewhere and return:
&lt;pre&gt;.NOLIST
#define END .end
#define end .end
#define equ .equ
#include &quot;ti83plus.inc&quot;
.LIST

      .org 9D93h
      .db $BB,$6D
      call clearscreen   ;1. here it is
      ld a,0             ;4. to here
      ld (CURCOL),a
      ld a,0
      ld (CURROW),a
      ld hl,text
      B_CALL(_PutS)
      ret              ;5. and ends
text:
      .db &quot;Text&quot;,0
clearscreen:           ;2. here it goes
      B_CALL(_ClrLCDFull)
      ret              ;3. then it comes back
.end
end&lt;/pre&gt;
As you can see, the first ret (right after the _ClrLCDFull) went back to after the call command. Then, the second ret ended the program. You can think of your program as one big call routine, with the ending ret going back to the main calculator. Warning: Calls interfere with stacks.

These jumps can be combined with code learned in later sections.

Sikhism is a religion from the Indian sub-continent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition . Sikhs consider their faith to be a seperate religion from Hinduism though they acknowledge its Hindu roots and traditions. Sikhs call their religion ''Gurmat'', which is Punjabi for &quot;way of the guru&quot;. The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions but in Sikhism has taken on an importance that forms the core of Sikh beliefs. The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469–1539). There followed in succession a further nine gurus. Sikhs acknowledge the last guru to be Guru Gobind Singh (1666–1708). The Sikh's holy book is ''Guru Granth Sahib'' (The Granth as the Guru) and this is considered the summation of the ten gurus and their beliefs. The title reflects the Sikh belief that their holy book is now the sole &quot;guru&quot; for guidance and instruction.

==What is Economics?==
Economics is the study of the social relations of production and distribution and how different societies cope with the basic economic problem of scarcity.
It is also the study of human behavior as it makes rational decisions to satisfy its needs.

and also, &quot;Economics is a social science that studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means that have alternative uses&quot; (Robbins)

==Scarcity==
Scarcity is based on the premise that human beings have unlimited wants and needs and that the resources which can be used to fulfill these wants and needs are limited (or finite). This means that choices have to be made about what, how and for whom to produce goods or services. Given the fundamental problem of resource scarcity in the face of infinite human wants, economic agents must make choices between competing alternatives. If resources were not scarce, there would be no need to choose between competing alternatives. Economics for this reason is also referred to as the science of constrained choice. Scarcity is why efficiency is so important to economists as inefficient use of resources reduces the amount of wants which can be satisfied.

==Factors of Production==
Economic resources can be divided into four different categories; LAND, LABOUR and CAPITAL and ENTERPRISE. These are referred to as the factors of production, each of which has a factor payment.

Factor payments are payments made to scarce resources, or generated by the factors of production, in return for productive services. The factors of production are also known as resource inputs to the productive process.

===Land===
*Land consists of all naturally occurring resources, i.e. agricultural land, mineral deposits. The resource land includes anything growing on land such as forestry or agricultural produce, or mineral subsoil assets lying beneath the surface. The factor land thus generates many different types of raw materials used in the production process.
*The factor payment for land is ''RENT''.

===Labour===
*Labour is a measure of the work carried out by human beings
*Supply of labour is initially determined by the total population but then more directly by the labour force (those who are of working age and who participate in the Labour force).
*The skills and training of the labour force affects the overall PRODUCTIVITY.
*The factor payment for labour is ''WAGES''

===Capital===
*Is the physical and non-human inputs used in production. This can can include factory buildings and other equipment such as vehicles, plant and machinery or tools used in the production process.
*The factor payment for capital is ''INTEREST.'' Interest is a simplification which embeds the assumption that typically many firms use a mixture of equity and debt to fund to acquisition of capital. Interest is payable on debt used for capital acquisition or expansion.

===Enterprise===
*Enterprise is the role of entrepreneur within the economy. The entrepreneurial ability of management organises the other three factors into a cohesive production process which results in the output of goods or services.Enterprise represents the skill of management.
*The entrepreneur is the risk taker who combines the other factors of production to create a good or service for which there is demand.
*There are several factors which can affect the level of entrepreneurship within an economy
**Start-up costs - high start-up costs will discourage entrepreneurship as it reduces the level of profit which can be attained. High start-up costs also discourage entrepreneurship because the total loss is great if the business fails.
**Level of profits - the higher the level of profit available the more incentive for the entrepreneur, this can be altered by wages levels and availability of labour, availability and cost of land, level of tax on profit
**Support - Financial support, such as loans. Knowledge support, advice on things such as marketing or accounts can encourage entrepreneurs.
*Factor payment for enterprise is ''PROFITS''. Profit is also the return to the firm and its owners after all other factor payments have been made. Dividends represent a distribution of profits.

==Markets==
A market is anywhere where buyers and sellers meet for purpose of exchange, such as: eBay, a market etc. Within a market prices are determined by the market mechanism.

==Supply and Demand==
===Demand===
Demand is the '''amount''' of goods and services buyers are willing and able to purchase at a given '''price''' over a given period of '''time''', Demand can be represented graphically in a demand curve or in a table known as a demand schedule. The main determinants of demand are; the price of the good, the price of substitute goods, the price of complimentary goods, levels of income. &lt;big&gt;'''The price of a good and the quantity demanded usually have an inverse relationship; if one increase the other decreases'''.&lt;/big&gt; 
====Demand Schedule====
Demand schedules are tables which show the price of a good and the quantity demanded.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+An Example Demand Schedule
|-
! Price (£) !! Quantity Demanded ( 000's ) 
|-
! 40
| 500
|-
! 50
| 450
|-
! 60
| 400
|-
! 70
| 350
|-
! 80
| 300
|}

====Demand Curve==== A demand curve is the graphical representation of a demand schedule, in which quantity demanded is plotted on the X axis and price on the Y axis. The curve on a demand curve slopes downwards left to right, the only exception being status goods in which the demand curve slopes upwards from left to right.
[[File:DemandExample.PNG|An example of a demand curve]]

====Movement Along a Demand Curve====
Movement along a demand curve occurs when the only variable to change is the price. For goods (except status goods) an increase in price causes a ''contraction'' of demand and a decrease causing an ''expansion'' of demand.
[[File:DemandCurveMovementExample2.png]] In this example the original price of the good was at P1 and the quantity demanded was at Q1. An increase in price to a level of P2 has caused a '''contraction''' of demand to a level of Q2.

====Shifts in Demand Curves====
A shift in a demand curve occurs when a variable other than price changes. For instance a change of income, a change in fashions or trends, a change in the price of a complimentary or substitute good, a successful/unsuccessful advertising campaign.

====Price Elasticities of Demand====
'''The extent to which the quantity demanded responds to a change in price'''. 

Price elasticity of Demand = &lt;math&gt;{percent\ change\ in\ quantity\ demanded\ x \over percent\ change\ in\ price\ x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which can be worked out by;
Price elasticity of Demand = &lt;math&gt; {{ change\ in\ quantity\ demanded\ of\ good\ x\ \over original\ quantity\ demanded\ of\ good\ x} \over { change\ in\ price\ of\ good\ x \over original\ price\ of\ good\ x}}&lt;/math&gt;

====Types of Price Elasticity of Demand====
'''Perfectly Inelastic Demand'''&lt;br&gt;
P.E.D = 0 Any change in price will have no change in demand and whatever the price is the demand will remain equal.  If this were to occur firms would set as high a price as possible to make maximum profit. &lt;br&gt;
'''Inelastic Demand'''&lt;br&gt;
0 &lt; P.E.D &lt; 1 This means that any change in price will have a less than proportional change in demand. &lt;br&gt;
'''Unitary Demand'''&lt;br&gt;
P.E.D = 1 Any change in price has an exactly proportional change in demand, i.e. 10% reduction in demand would cause a 10% reduction in price.&lt;br&gt;
'''Elastic Demand'''&lt;br&gt;
1 &lt; P.E.D &lt; ≈ Any change in price will cause a greater than proportional change in demand. &lt;br&gt;
'''Perfectly Elastic Demand'''&lt;br&gt;
P.E.D = ≈ Any change in price will have an absolute change in demand as buyers will only buy at one price and no other.

=== Supply ===
The ''quantity'' of goods and services a firm is willing and able to sell at a given ''price'' over a given period of ''time''.

==== Supply Schedule ====
As with demand schedules supply schedules are tables which displays the amount of goods and services supplied at what price. 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+An Example Supply Schedule
|-
! Price (£) !! Quantity Supplied ( 000's ) 
|-
! 40
| 500
|-
! 50
| 550
|-
! 60
| 600
|-
! 70
| 650
|-
! 80
| 700
|}

==== Supply Curve====
A supply curve is the graphical representation of a supply schedule, in which quantity supplied is plotted on the X axis and price on the Y axis. The curve of a supply curve slopes upwards right to left, the only exception being status goods in which the demand curve slopes downwards from right to left.

=== Equilibrium ===
'''Equilibrium is the point in a market at which supply and demand intersect, thus giving the equilibrium price and quantity'''. In the example below the equilibrium price is P1 and the equilibrium quantity is Q1. Were the price or the quantity supplied to change then the market would be in a state of disequilibrium. A price above P1 would mean there would be an excess of supplies, and a price below P1 would mean there is excess demand.  [[Image:Equilibrium.png]]

==Elasticities==
Elasticities measure the change on one variable in proportion to another.

===Income elasticity of demand===
Income elasticity of demand is a measure of the responsiveness of the demand for a good or service to a change in income. If an increase in income lead to  an increase in demand, then the income elasticity of that good or service would be said to be positive. If a change in income lead to no change in demand then that good would be said to have an income elasticity of demand of zero. A rise in income leading to a decrease in demand would mean that the good or service is said to have a negative income elasticity of demand.

The following formula is used to calculate a good or service's income elasticity of demand:
Income elasticity of Demand = &lt;math&gt; percentage\ change\ in\ quantity\ demanded\ of\ good\ x \over percentage\ change\ in\ income &lt;/math&gt;

===Cross elasticity of demand===
Cross elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the demand of one good to a change in the price of another good. This allows, for instance, how a rise in the price of natural gas affects the demand of electricity. In addition to this, by calculating the cross elasticity of demand, it is possible to identify the relationship between two goods or services. If the cross elasticity of demand for two goods is positive, then it can be summarised that the two goods are substitute goods, as would be the case for the example of natural gas and electricity. If the cross elasticity of demand for two goods is negative, then the two goods are complimentary goods, such as fish and chips. 
&lt;br&gt; The following formula is used to calculate the cross elasticity of demand: &lt;br&gt;
Cross elasticity of Demand = &lt;math&gt; percentage\ change\ in\ quantity\ demanded\ of\ good\ x \over percentage\ change\ in\ price\ of\ good\ y &lt;/math&gt;

===Price elasticity of supply===
Price elasticity of supply is a measure of the responsiveness in quantity supplied to a change in price. 
The following formula is used to calculate price elasticity of supply:
&lt;br&gt;Price elasticity of Supply = &lt;math&gt; percentage\ change\ in\ quantity\ supplied\ of\ good\ x \over percentage\ change\ in\ price\ of\ good\ x &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Factors Affecting Elasticity of Supply===
1.Stock
low stock-supply inelastic
large stock-supply elastic

2.Time
short period-inelastic
long period-elastic

3.Availability of substitutes
easily replicable capital and labour-elastic

4.Spare capacity
less-inelastic
more-elastic

==Monopoly and The Allocation of Resources==
An absolute monopoly is a market structure in which only one firm supplies a good or service. In addition to this there are, within the UK, legal monopolies, which are firms with a market share greater than 25%. In the long run, monopolies are created and prosper due to the erection of barriers to entry. 

''''Legal Barriers''''
The law can be used to create monopolies. This can be achieved in a number of ways. The use of copyrights or patents are examples of a legal barriers to entry. As one firm controls the production of goods for which they have a patent or copyright they can become monopolies. A further example would be the granting of a permit by the government to a firm, such as, the numerous train companies which are monopolies for their respective lines, allowing only them to run trains.  Professional licensing is also promoted by existing firms in an effort to keep out additional firms.  The licensing laws are often set up in ways that favor existing firms, but are difficult for new firms to meet.

''''Resource Barriers''''
If a firm is able to control some or all of the resources necessary to produce a good, it can then become a monopoly. For instance, an oil company which controls all the oil fields has monopoly power over the production of oil. De Beers, the diamond company, controls over 95% of the Earth's diamond reserves, allowing only a certain number of diamonds to be mined a year, keeping the price high. 

''''Unfair Competition''''
Firms may undertake acts of unfair competition to maintain their monopoly status or to become monopolies. If a large firm is in competition with another then it could, as an example, lower its prices to a level which would drive a competitor out of business, safe in the knowledge that the loses associated can be sustained for a short amount of time due to the large reserves of the firm. Having driven the competing firm out of the market the monopoly is then free to revert back to the previous price charged. 

''''Natural Cost Advantages''''
Due to economies of scale (in which a larger firm can make a product at a lower per-unit cost than smaller firms due to the larger scale of its production capacities) and economies of scope (in which a single large firm can use the same input resource in multiple production processes, resulting in the production of multiple goods for lower per-unit costs than two smaller firms would experience), it is possible that a market with a single large firm is the most cost-efficient means of producing a good or service.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Operations With Exponential Function==
An exponential function is a function where a constant base (b) is raised to a variable.

===Multiplication===

Firstly, &lt;math&gt;b^x \times b^{2x}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;b^{\left(x + 2x\right)}\,&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;b^{3x}\,&lt;/math&gt;. So when you multiply a base by the same base you add the variables. To clarify, here is an example with numbers:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2^x\,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2^x \times 2^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2^{3x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| 1
| 2
| 4
| 8
| 8
|- 
| 2
| 4
| 16
| 64
| 64
|}

===Division===

Secondly &lt;math&gt;\frac{b^{2x}}{b^y}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;b^{\left( 2x - y \right)}\,&lt;/math&gt;(also &lt;math&gt;y \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;). So when a base is divided by the same base you subtract the variables. 

Here is an example with numbers:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{2^4}{2^2}=\frac{16}{4}=4=2^2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Base raised to two powers===

Thirdly &lt;math&gt;\left(b^{2x}\right)^{3x}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;b^{\left(2x\right) \times \left(3x\right)}&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;b^{6x^2}&lt;/math&gt;. So when a base with a variable is raised to a variable you multiply the variables. Here is another example with numbers: (when x = 1) &lt;math&gt;\left(2^2\right)^3=4^3=64=2^6&lt;/math&gt;.

===Multiple bases===

Fourthly when &lt;math&gt;a^2 \times b^2 = ab \times ab&lt;/math&gt; it is the same as &lt;math&gt;\left(ab\right)^2\,&lt;/math&gt;. Here is an example with numbers: &lt;math&gt;2^2 \times 3^2 = 36 = 6^2&lt;/math&gt;. There is a similar situation with division: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^2 = \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{a}{b} = \frac{a^2}{b^2}&lt;/math&gt;. So when you multiple or divide two different bases raised to the same variable you can multply or divide them first and then raise them to the variable.

===Fractional exponents===

The last case is when x is presented as a fraction, you can make a square root function, for example &lt;math&gt;b^\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt[x] b&lt;/math&gt;. However it is customary to only use the positive root and so &lt;math&gt;b^\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[x] b&lt;/math&gt;. Another similar case is when the fraction has a constant (designated as c) other than 1 in the numerator  , for example &lt;math&gt;b^ \frac {3}{x} = \left( \sqrt[x] b \right)^3&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;b^ \frac {c}{x} = \left( \sqrt[x] b \right)^c&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Laws of Exponents===

The rules that have been suggested above are known as the laws of exponents and can be written as:

# &lt;math&gt;b^xb^y = b^{x+y}\,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{b^x}{b^y} = b^{x-y}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left(b^x\right)^y = b^{xy}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;a^n b^n = \left(ab\right)^n\,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;b^{-n}=\frac{1}{b^n}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;b^ \frac {c}{x} = \left( \sqrt[x] b \right)^c&lt;/math&gt; where c is a constant
# &lt;math&gt;b^1=b\,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;b^0=1\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Solving exponential equations===
In order to solve an exponential equation you need to make sure that all the bases are the same. Then you can remove the base and solve for the variable. Here is an example:&lt;p&gt;
Solve for x. &lt;math&gt;2^{\left(x-1\right)} = 16\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now we convert 16 to a base 2 raised to a number.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2^{\left(x-1\right)} = 2^4\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now we can remove the base. So we have:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x-1 = 4\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Finally solve for x.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = 5\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

===Graphing an Exponential Function===
When you graph an exponential function you use the same methods as with a regular function. There is a graph below that you can look at.

==Logarithmic Functions==
[[Image:Logexponential.svg|right|400px]]
In mathematics you can find the inverse of an exponential function by switching x and y around: 
&lt;math&gt;y = b^x\,&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;x = b^y\,&lt;/math&gt;. The problem arises on how to find the value  of y. The logarithmic function solved this problem. All conversions of logarithmic function into an exponential function follow the same pattern: &lt;math&gt;x = b^y\,&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;y = \log_b x\,&lt;/math&gt;. If a log is given without a written b then b=10. Also with logarithmic functions, b &gt; 0 and &lt;math&gt;b \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;. There are 2 cases where the log is equal to x: &lt;math&gt;\log_bb^X = X\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b^{\log_bX} = X\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Laws of Logarithmic Functions===
When X and Y are positive.

* &lt;math&gt;\log_bXY = \log_bX + \log_bY\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\log_b \frac{X}{Y} = \log_bX - \log_bY\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\log_b X^k = k \log_bX\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Change of Base===
When x and b are positive real numbers and are not equal to 1. Then you can write &lt;math&gt;\log_a x\,&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\frac { \log_b x}{ \log_b a}&lt;/math&gt;. This works for the natural log as well. here is an example:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\log_2 8 = \frac { \log 8}{ \log 2} = \frac {.9}{.3} = 3\,&lt;/math&gt; now check &lt;math&gt;2^3 = 8\,&lt;/math&gt;

Importing objects into Blender is not that different from exporting.  However, there are a few additional things to take care of.  Firstly, all references to &quot;export&quot; in the header should be changed to &quot;import&quot;.  Secondly, instead of simply writing out data that Blender provides to us, we are responsible for giving data to Blender and ensuring that it is properly formatted.  Although Blender is flexible, allowing us to ignore things like vertex indices, we do need to be careful that we do things in a sensible order.

Additionally, there is a bit of housekeeping to deal with.  We should be in edit mode while modifying the mesh data.  We also need to link up our newly created data to the scene, after it has been properly constructed, so that Blender can see it and maintain it.  This makes it visible to the user, as well as ensuring that it gets saved along with the scene.

== Importing a Mesh ==

Here is a simple script that can import an OBJ file created by the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Python Scripting/Export scripts|export script]].
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
import Blender
def import_obj(path):
        Blender.Window.WaitCursor(1)
        name = path.split('\\')[-1].split('/')[-1]
        mesh = Blender.NMesh.New( name ) # create a new mesh
        # parse the file
        file = open(path, 'r')
        for line in file:
                words = line.split()
                if len(words) == 0 or words[0].startswith('#'):
                        pass
                elif words[0] == 'v':
                        x, y, z = float(words[1]), float(words[2]), float(words[3])
                        mesh.verts.append(Blender.NMesh.Vert(x, y, z))
                elif words[0] == 'f':
                        faceVertList = []
                        for faceIdx in words[1:]:
                                faceVert = mesh.verts[int(faceIdx)-1]
                                faceVertList.append(faceVert)
                        newFace = Blender.NMesh.Face(faceVertList)
                        mesh.addFace(newFace)
        
        # link the mesh to a new object
        ob = Blender.Object.New('Mesh', name) # Mesh must be spelled just this--it is a specific type
        ob.link(mesh) # tell the object to use the mesh we just made
        scn = Blender.Scene.GetCurrent()
        for o in scn.getChildren():
                o.sel = 0
        
        scn.link(ob) # link the object to the current scene
        ob.sel= 1
        ob.Layers = scn.Layers
        Blender.Window.WaitCursor(0)
        Blender.Window.RedrawAll()

Blender.Window.FileSelector(import_obj, 'Import')
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This will load an OBJ file into Blender, creating a new mesh object.  Let's take a look at the more interesting portions.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Blender.Window.WaitCursor(1)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Turn on the wait cursor so the user knows the computer is importing.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
name = path.split('\\')[-1].split('/')[-1]
mesh = Blender.NMesh.New( name ) # create a new mesh
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Here, we create a new mesh datablock. The name is made from the path only with the filename.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
ob = Blender.Object.New('Mesh', name)
ob.link(mesh)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Next, we create a new object and link it to the mesh.  This instantiates the mesh.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
scn = Blender.Scene.GetCurrent()
scn.link(ob) # link the object to the current scene
ob.sel= 1
ob.Layers = scn.Layers

&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Finally, we attach the new object to the current scene, making it accessible to the user and ensuring that it will be saved along with the scene. We also select the new object so that the user can easily modify it after import.
Copying the scenes layers ensures that the object will occupy the scenes current view layers.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Blender.Window.WaitCursor(0)
Blender.Window.RedrawAll()
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Now the finishing touches.  We turn off the wait cursor. We also redraw the 3D window to ensure that the new object is initially visible.  If we didn't do this, the object might not appear until the user changes the viewpoint or forces a redraw in some other way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like gravitational fields, electric fields are a field of force that act from a distance, where the force here is exerted by a charged object on another charged object. You may already be familiar with the fact that opposite charges attract, and that like charges repel. Here, we will look at ways to calculate field strengths and the magnitude of forces exerted, in a very similar manner to gravitational fields.

==Representing electric fields==

Electric field lines are drawn always pointing from positive to negative, like the flow of current. Just like magnetic and gravitational fields, the separation of the lines tell us the relative strength.

===Radial fields===

Radial fields are drawn from a centre point. The field is stronger nearer the surface of the object, and weakens as you move further away. For a positive charge, the arrows point outwards, and for a negative charge, the arrows point inwards.

{|
| [[File:VFPt minus thumb.svg|150px|thumb|The field is directed into a negative point charge...]]
| [[File:VFPt plus thumb.svg|150px|thumb|...and it is directed outwards from a positive one.]]
|}

===Uniform fields===

[[File:VFPt capacitor.svg|VFPt capacitor|120px|thumb|right|Two plates of opposite polarity (from inside a capacitor) and the lines representing the uniform field between them.]]

Between two charged plates there is a uniform electric field, which means that its strength is constant between each plate. This is represented by parallel lines, directed from the positive plate to the negative plate. The field curves outwards slightly on the edges of the plates, and it is important that you draw it like that.

===Multiple charges===

When there are several radial and uniform fields close to each other, they have to be combined into one field, since each of their fields interact and change. The most common shapes are shown, and the arrows, as always, point from positive to negative. You should be able to draw field lines for simple variations on these.

{|
|[[Image:VFPt charges plus minus thumb.svg|200px|thumb|Two point charges of opposite polarity and the lines representing the electric field between them.]]
|[[File:VFPt image charge plane horizontal.svg|200px|thumb|A point charge and a plate. Notice how the radial field transitions to a uniform one near the plate.]]
|}
The closer the charge lines are the stronger the force is.

==Coulomb's law==

'''Coulomb's law''' is very similar to Newton's law of gravitation, except instead of relating the force between two masses together, it relates the force between two charges, &lt;math&gt;Q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_2&lt;/math&gt;. Since the two charges are point charges which have radial fields, they follow the inverse square law.

Therefore, the relationship can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;F \propto \frac {Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Or, in words:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
Any two point charges exert a force on each other that is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Just like Newton's law, we need to introduce a constant of proportionality to make it into an equation, which in this case is k:

:&lt;math&gt;F = k \frac {Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Where &lt;math&gt;k= \frac {1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \approx 8.99 \times 10^9&lt;/math&gt;.

===Permittivity of free space===

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is known as the permittivity of free space, and is roughly &lt;math&gt;8.85 \times 10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt;. It is often useful to just remember that &lt;math&gt;k \approx 8.99 \times 10^9&lt;/math&gt; in free space, however you do also need to know &lt;math&gt;k= \frac {1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;, as you may be given the permittivity of different mediums.

===Signs of charges===

Note that for each charge, you must keep the signs intact in the equation. If you were to have two positive, or two negative charges in the equation, the result would be positive, but if you were to have one negative and one positive charge, the final answer would be negative. The sign of the answer tells us whether the force between the two charges is an attraction, or a repulsion, like charges will repel, and opposite charges will attract. This also explains the minus sign in Newton's law of gravitation, since the force between two masses is always an attraction.

==Electric field strength==

Just as gravitational field strength is the force exerted per unit mass, we could define the electric field strength in terms of charge:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The electric field strength at a point is the force per unit charge exerted on a positive charge placed at that point.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is just like saying that the electric field strength is the force a charge of +1 coulomb experiences in that electric field. Therefore, we can find the electric field strength, E, by:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{F}{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.

From this equation, you can see that the electric field strength is measured in &lt;math&gt;N C^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Field strength of a uniform field===

You can make a uniform electric field by charging two plates. Increasing the voltage between them will increase the field strength, and moving the plates further apart will decrease the field strength. A simple equation for field strength can be made from these two points:

:&lt;math&gt;E= \frac{V}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

Where V is the voltage between the plates, and d is the distance between them. 

Here you can see that the units of electric field strength is &lt;math&gt;Vm^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;NC^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;Vm^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Field strength of a radial field===

Since the electric field strength could be said to be the force exerted on a charge of +1C, we can substitute 1 coulomb for &lt;math&gt;Q_2&lt;/math&gt; in Coulomb's law. We then get the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac {kQ}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;, or

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac {Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This will tell us the field strength of a charge, Q, at a distance, r.

==Force on particles==

To calculate the force an electron experiences in a uniform field, we can combine &lt;math&gt;E = \frac {F}{Q}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;E= -\frac {V}{d}&lt;/math&gt; in the following steps:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {F}{Q} = -\frac {V}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{F} = -\frac {QV}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

For an electron with a charge of -e, this becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;{F} = \frac {eV}{d}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;eE&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful if you are asked to find the force on an electron in a uniform field, most often in a cathode ray tube.

==Comparison of electric and gravitational fields==

As you may have already noticed, electric and gravitational fields are quite similar. You should be aware of the similarities and differences between them.

===Similarities===

*For point charges or masses, the variation of force with distance follows the inverse square law.
*Both exert a force from a distance, with no contact.
*The field strength of both is defined in terms of force per unit of the property of the object that causes the force (i.e. mass and charge).

===Differences===

*Gravitational fields can only produce forces of attraction, whereas electric fields can produce attraction and repulsion.
*Objects can be shielded from an electric field, but there is no way to shield an object from a gravitational field.
*Electric fields only act upon charged masses, however gravitational fields act upon all masses.

Hi, I'm David Osborn.  I'm most active in the [http://gamedev.net/ ''GameDev.net''] community under the alias dcosborn.  I also frequent the [http://forums.cgsociety.org/ ''CGTalk forums''], particularly the [http://forums.cgsociety.org/forumdisplay.php?f=39 ''WIP/Critique: Game Art Design''] forum, and the Elysiun's [http://www.elysiun.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=5 ''Blender Python &amp; Plugins''] forum.  My contributions are rather sparse at the moment, but I hope to do a lot of Blender scripting work in the near future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== capitalization ==

I my opinion commands like JAVAC or JAVA, and filenames or extensions like .CLASS should not be capitalized, as they are in reality lower case, as seen in case-sensitive operating systems like Linux.

:''I agree -- I've started this conversion; see [[Java Programming Environment]]'' --[[User:Djb|djb]] 03:57, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== compiler options ==

I was planning on expanding this, but I want to know whether it would be better to list all the options (except the -X) are just the most common ones. [[User:IMacWin95|IMacWin95]] 00:09, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
:Well, a there should be a full reference somewhere... but, ''Getting Started'' may be the wrong place for that, I think. I'm still not sure why this chapter is existing, in this section. Any explanations? --[[User:Yuuki Mayuki|Yuuki Mayuki]] 15:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

== Too much information ==

This page is near the start of the book, quite often where the beginners will start, I think this is throwing too much information at them.

Just a quick example program, and showing them how to compile and run it using the javac and java commands respectively, any mentions of additional methods of compilation in my opinion should be kept for later chapters or even the appendix.--[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 23:59, 7 March 2010 (UTC)

== Extendable ==

The eclipse section refers to extendability. I have no idea what this is.

== Newbie Frustration... ==

As a newbie, this chapter has failed me. After downloading &amp; installing the JDK as instructed, writing the &quot;HelloWorld&quot; program as described, I cannot figure out how from this page how to compile it... which kinda defeats the point of this chapter. 

As mentioned already, newbies will start here &amp; the first priority should be to enable them to get something real basic to work. I don't care about the frills if the darn thing doesn't go.

What is needed is a step by step account of how to get &quot;HelloWorld&quot; to compile. At least from that I may be able to figure out what is wrong at my end.

EDIT:
Found what I needed here http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout/windows-cmd.html

First lesson done. I sometimes think I'm a glutton for punishment...

== Updating to v. 2.0.2 ==
I have made a couple of changes to this end, but not checked installation instructions, etc., etc...

In particular, the statement &quot;Clicking next again allows you to choose a directory in which to install the software.&quot; is, AFAIK, no longer true. Windows users cannot choose their install directory - or can they?... Would prefer another's confirmation rather than to make this change myself, considering my uncertainty.

== Removing the Version section ==

I'm thinking about removing the version section, cause this is a section that would need updating every time there is a version up. I think a book should contains information that isn't too time-critical, book should essentially contain information that won't change frequently. What do you think?
--[[User:The Kid|The Kid]] 10:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

==Cost==
I don't like the use of the word &quot;none&quot; for cost.  While the software is free to obtain, there are other cost factors (for businesses) like training, conversion etc. which should be noted. [[User:Oberiko|Oberiko]] 21:53, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

:True, but if you already know other Office Suite, converting to OpenOffice is easy, and needs little retraining, if any, since they will most likely only need a little readjustment. If you don't know any other Office Suite, learning Open Office is easy and training cost is as much as training someone with other Office Suite. Anyway, don't ask someone who's completely blank on any Office Suite to create a Document, Spreadsheet, etc on any Office Suite. It's much cheaper to hire another person to do that job or since learning Office Suite is easy if the employee is already familiar with computer you could cut the training cost by encouraging the employee to learn autodidactly at their own pace (nowadays though, most people have at least some degree of familiarity with computers).

== Base ==

A tutorial about OOoBase is very important and necessary. Can anybody write a structure for the page ?. --[[User:82.159.136.215|82.159.136.215]] 05:53, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

Hello all. I'm writing the hebrew wikibook of OpenOffice. Please note that Commons have now some relevant images in categories such as [[commons:Category:OpenOffice.org Writer|OpenOffice.org Writer]].

*Older patients risk of head and neck, esophageal, gastrointestinal, and genital tract cancers
**Usually develop after 13 years of age (average age is 23)
**Difficult to treat due to sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such a chemo and radiation
*Patients who receive androgen treatment are at increased risk of liver tumors

==Physical Characteristics/symptoms==
(25-40% have no physical abnormalities)
*Short stature (60%)
*Extreme fatigue
*Frequent infections
*Nosebleeds or easy bruising
*Low white cell, red cell, or platelet count (age of onset highly variable)
*Myelodysplasia
*Upper limb malformations: misshapen, missing or extra thumbs or an incompletely developed or missing radius (50%)
*Other skeletal anomalies (30%) - short low hairline, spina bifida, scoliosis, sacrococcygeal sinus, vertebral anomalies
*Renal malformations (25%) pelvic, horseshoe, hypoplastic, dysplastic kidney or abnormal artery or abnormal collecting system
*Abnormal skin pigmentation (café-au-lait spots, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation (65%)
*Microcephaly
*Eyes (25%) - micropthalmia, strabismus, epicanthal folds, hypertelorism/hypotelorism, ptosis, slanting, cataracts, epiphora, nystagmus
*Genitalia (40%) -
**males: hypogenitalia, undescended, absent or atrophic testes, azospermia, delayed puberty. Few males have fathered children

==Genetic Basis==
*Mutations in any one the eleven known genes cause FA
*Autosomal recessive inheritance FANCA 66% (16q24.3), FANCC 9.5% (9q22.3), FANCD1/BRCA2 3.3% (13q12.3), FANCD2 3.3% (3p25.3), FANCE 2.5% (6p21.3), FANCF 2.0% (11p15), FANCG 8.7% (9p13), FANCJ/BRIP1 1.6% (17q22-q24), FANCL 0.4% (2p16.1) and FANCM 0.4% (14q21.3)
*X-linked inheritance FANCB 0.8% (Xp22.3)
*FANCA and FANCC mutations account for 76% of patients
*FA pathway regulates DNA repair

==Incidence==
*Found equally in males and females
*All ethnic groups
*1 in 100,000 live births

==Carrier frequency==
*Estimated between 1 in 600 and 1 in 100
*gene clinics states 1 in 300 for general population in US, Europe and Japan
*AJ frequency is 1 in 89

==Diagnosis and testing==
*Chromosomal breakage studies in presence of diepoxybutane (DEB) or mitomycin C (MMC)
*Only FA cells exhibit increased chromosomal breakage in response to DEB
*Chromosomal breakage can be performed prenatally with cells from CVS or amnio
*If mutations known, mutation analysis can be performed prenatally
*Chromosome breakage tests don't detect carriers
*Siblings should be tested since 25-40% of individuals with FA may have no physical abnormalities
*Complementation studies and mutation analysis available for 6 of the genes on research basis
*Fanconi Anemia mutation database found at www.rockefeller.edu/fanconi/mutate/
*FA cell repository in Oregon (will do complementation analysis)
*Carrier testing available once mutations identified

==Mosaicism==
*Some cells revert to normal phenotype
*Attributed to recombination or gene conversion
*May cause false negative DEB test

==Geneotype-Phenotype==
*Appear to be some correlations

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Bloom syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, and other chromosomal breakage syndromes are all ruled out by DEB chromosomal breakage test
*NF1 shares café au lait spots
*Thrombocytopenia with absent radii
*VACTERL syndrome
*Above are ruled out by DEB or MMC test

==Leukemia==
*Malignancy where bone marrow produces excess quantities of immature white cells called blasts
*These suppress the development of healthy blood cells
*Results in infections and bleeding
*AML is a particularly aggressive type usually found in older people

==Management of FA==
(focuses on surveillance of and treatment for physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and related cancers)
*Baseline tests
**Ultrasound of kidneys and urinary tract
**Formal hearing test
**Baseline developmental assessment
**Referral to ophthalmologist, endocrinologist, and geneticist for initial screening and counseling
**Follow by hematologist
***HLA typing of patient, sibs, and parents: full blood typing and blood chemistries
***Regular blood counts
***Many recommend annual bone marrow aspirate or biopsy to evaluate morphology, cellularity, and cytogenetics
*Androgens
**Improve blood counts in ~50% of patients
**stimulate production of RBC's, often platelets, sometimes WBC's
**patients often eventually fail to respond to this treatment
*Hematopoetic growth factors
**G-CSF or GM-CSF stimulate production of WBC's in some patients
**Improved platelet and red cell count in a few patients
**Generally not recommended for patients with a clonal cytogenetic abnormality
*Blood transfusions
**Should be avoided or minimized if patient is a candidate for bone marrow transplantation
**Family members should be avoided as blood donors to minimize chance of sensitization if considering bone marrow transplant
*Bone marrow transplant
**Only long-term cure for blood problems
**Many associated risks
*Gene therapy
**Clinical trials for patients with mutations in A or C gene
**Potentially correct the hematopoietic defect, but not reduce the risk of developing solid tumors in other tissues
**Not done if considering bone marrow transplant

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fetal Alcohol Syndrome'''

== Contracting ==
* Establish rapport with small talk-acknowledge prior contact (Jane)
* Assess the understanding for the referral to genetics
* Assess the concerns of the family and what they hope to learn today
* Ascertain the level of understanding of FAS for those members present
* Discuss topics to be covered during the appointment- review medical/family history, physical exam

== Elicit Medical History ==
It is important to establish a thorough, detailed medical history as certain medications (such as warfarin or valproic acid) may be teratogenic to the fetus or embryo if taken during pregnancy, and this may result in an exacerbation of congenital abnormalites.

== Elicit Family History and Pedigree ==
* Confirm family history taken by Jane- any updates?
* Often FAS-affected children are taken away from their biological parents and put into a foster or adoptive home, and a complete and thorough history is therefore important. 
* For the maternal history, the genetic counsellor should note such things as: documented high blood-alcohol concentration 
           history of alcohol or other substance abuse 
           history of living with an alcohol abuser
           low socioeconomic class
           previous children with FAS
           low self esteem
           unemployment or social transience
           loss of a child to a foster home (Welch-Carre, 2005). 
* The genetic counsellor should ask what kind of alcohol was consumed, the amount of consumption, and the frequency (Welch-Carre, 2005). 
* The genetic counsellor needs to record the child’s history, such as milestones, growth deficits, or CNS abnormailities (Welch-Carre, 2005).

== Psychosocial Assessment ==
* Often FAS-affected children are taken away from their biological parents and put into a foster or adoptive home, and a complete and thorough history is therefore important. 
* For the maternal history, the genetic counsellor should note such things as: documented high blood-alcohol concentration 
           history of alcohol or other substance abuse 
           history of living with an alcohol abuser
           low socioeconomic class
           previous children with FAS
           low self esteem
           unemployment or social transience
           loss of a child to a foster home (Welch-Carre, 2005). 
* The genetic counsellor should ask what kind of alcohol was consumed, the amount of consumption, and the frequency (Welch-Carre, 2005). 
* The genetic counsellor needs to record the child’s history, such as milestones, growth deficits, or CNS abnormailities (Welch-Carre, 2005).

== Definition ==
* Fetal alcohol syndrome is a disorder characterized by abnormalities in physical and mental development as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure.

== Etiology ==
* Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is caused by ethanol and/or its by-products
** Ethanol is a teratogen that can cross the placenta and interrupt development during any stage of pregnancy.
** Currently, it is not known whether alcohol is a mutagen affecting the ova or sperm prior to conception
* Alcohol is now recognized as the most common major teratogen to which a fetus is liable to be exposed
* 2 alcoholic drinks consumed per day by pregnant women have been shown to result in smaller birth size, while 4-6 drinks consumed per day show additional clinical features; both of the above can result in fetal alcohol effect (FAE)
* FAE is a condition characterized by some, but not all, of the birth defects associated with FAS.
* Most of the children believed to have FAS have been born to alcoholic women whose intake of alcohol was 8-10 or more drinks per day (Smith's pg. 555).
** Although FAS is usually associated with exposure to large amounts of alcohol, this is not always the case.
** The U.S. Surgeon General's conclusion that zero exposure to alcohol equals zero risk remains the only defensible true statement.

== Incidence ==
* An accurate incidence rate of FAS has not been established
* One study suggests approximately 1-3:1,000 live births (Management Of Genetic Syndromes pg.151).

== Timing ==
* Alcohol exposure during the first trimester is associated with facial dysmorphology
* Exposure during the second half of pregnancy is associated with growth deficiency
* The brain appears to be uniquely vulnerable to alcohol
** Variations in abnormalities are due to dose, frequency, timing of exposure and genetic factors of the mother and fetus.
** The brain appears to be most vulnerable during the first trimester but can be affected throughout gestation.

== Clinical Features ==
* Pre- and postnatal onset growth deficiency
* Craniofacial anomalies
** Mild to moderate microcephaly
** Short palpebral fissures, ptosis, epicanthal folds
** Maxillary hypoplasia
** Short nose
** Smooth philtrum with thin and smooth upper lip
** Malformations of the inner ear
* Skeletal anomalies
** Joint anomalies, abnormal position and/or function
** Scoliosis
** Altered palmer crease patterns
** Small distal phalanges
** Small fifth fingernails
** Clinodactyly of the 4th and 5th fingers
* Cardiac Anomalies
** Heart murmur (usually disappears by age 1)
** VSD- most common heart defect in children with FAS
* Genitourinary
** Renal anomalies are reported to occur at an increased frequency
** Renal hypoplasia or hydronephrosis
* Occasional abnormalities
** Cleft lip with or without cleft palate
** Micrognathia
** Short or webbed neck
** 10-20% have cervical vertebral malformations
** Tetralogy of Fallot
** Hydrocephalus
** Strawberry hemangiomata
* Brain Dysfunction
** Ethanol exposure leads to structural alterations of the brain resulting in cognitive and behavioral dysfunction
** Most serious consequence of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure
** Diminished brain cell number and intelligence
** Heterotopias (faulty migration) of neurons
** Measures of brain dysfunction:
*** MR (not present in many)
*** Microcephaly
*** Epilepsy or other hard neurological signs
*** Subtle problems such as clumsiness and difficulties with visual-motor integration
*** Sleep regulation difficulty
*** Clinical features of ADHD
*** Poor inter-social relationships
* Intelligence
** The average IQ for patients with FAS is 63, which is considered mild mental retardation. Some patients with FAS have higher intelligence; patients can have a wide range of IQ's, including normal.
** Developmental delay
** Fine motor dysfunction
** Irritability in infancy
** Irregular patterns of academic achievement:
*** Hyperactivity (ADHD)
*** Poor communication skills
*** Difficulty remembering instructions
*** Irritability
*** Disorganization

== Diagnostic Criteria ==
* Cardinal features for FAS were established in the late 1970's
* The condition can be characterized by:
** A specific facial appearance
** Evidence of organic brain damage
** Growth deficiency
** Alcohol exposure during gestation
* A problem with the above criteria is the precision of measurement of each component (How many facial characteristics need to be present? How small must the child be?)
** Overcome this problem with the 4-digit diagnostic code
** 4 key diagnostic features (see above) are evaluated on a 4 point scale
** A score of 1 reflects complete absence of the FAS feature and 4 reflecting a strong classic presence of the FAS feature
** A score of 4444 denotes the most severe form of FAS while 1111 denotes a complete absence of FAS.
** Scores between 1111 and 4444 represent the broad spectrum of outcome and exposure combinations

== Risk Assessment ==
* Risk of recurrence varies and is dependent upon the woman's drinking status during future pregnancies.
* Women who do not drink during pregnancy have a 0% risk of recurrence
* Women who are chronic alcoholics are at an increased risk of having a child with FAS.
* Children with FAS have an increased risk of being alcoholics in adulthood.

== Differential Diagnosis ==
* Glue and solvent sniffing (toluene exposure) throughout pregnancy can produce infants who look strikingly like children with FAS
* Seizure medications such as phenobarbital, valproic acid, and hydantoin can result in facial anomalies and organic brain damage

== Management and Treatment ==
* Carefully monitor growth by plotting on a growth curve
** Children with FAS can be born as a SGA infant
** Or birth size can be normal and fall below the growth curve during the 1st 12-18 months of life
* Psychological and psychiatric assessments including a developmental evaluation (medication can be prescribed as necessary)
* Family therapy
* Special education in a variety of categories
* Routine ophthalmologic evaluations
* Routine audiological evaluations
* Cardiovascular clinical evaluation at time of diagnosis
* Renal ultrasounds (if patient has had a UTI or enuresis after age 8)
* Clinical evaluation for spinal curvature
* Implementing coping strategies in the home/classroom
** Maintain a structured environment
** Establish routines
** Give short and concise instructions
** Respond consistently to the child's behavior
** Acknowledge the child's successes EVERY DAY
** Redirect unacceptable behavior
** Be patient
** REPEAT…REPEAT….REPEAT

== Psychosocial Issues ==
* Biological mothers are often alcohol abusers and have a variety of health problems of their own.
* One study shows that 50% of these mothers are missing or dead within 5 years of the birth.
* 50% of children with FAS are in foster or adoptive care
* Generally the reasons for final separation from the biological parent(s) were abuse and neglect.
* This movement from home to home compounded by abuse and neglect usually has a profound effect on the child and his/her behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve">well, first we would need to discuss the variety of cultures in nepal and their particular specialties.  do buddhists have different tastes than hindus?--[[User:69.171.35.198|69.171.35.198]] 23:57, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

== Local differences need amplification. ==

The main article seems to be written from a tourist perspective that is ignorant of the various cultural practices.  

Although Kathmandu is in the &quot;Middle Hills&quot; between the high Himalaya and north of a conspicuous range of southern foothills called the Mahabharat Range, its indigenous cuisine is atypical of that region for several reasons.  The Royal Family and the Ranas who once governed Nepal have northern Indian affinities, so meat-rich dishes with Moghul influences are much more common around Kathmandu than elsewhere in the Middle Hills.  Secondly, the Kathmandu Valley is home to the Newar nationality, whose blend of Buddhist and Hindu practices are somewhat ideosyncratic. Newars freely eat meat from water buffalo, however strict Hindus find this objectionable because buffalo are cousins to cattle, whose meat is taboo.  

In other parts of the Middle Hills, upper caste Hindus eat meat only occasionally.  Meals are usually &quot;dal-bhat-tarkari&quot; - spicy lentil soup poured over boiled rice and accompanied with curried vegetables.  Since wheat is grown as a cool season crop, chapatis may partly replace boiled rice.  Vegetables are abundant during the summer monsoon, then become scarce during the cool winter and hot, dry spring months.

Lower caste groups are freer to eat pork and chicken.  Beef is strictly limited to untouchables who are allowed to scavenge the corpses of animals that have died of natural causes.  Indigenous ethnic groups living at higher elevations than rice-growing Hindus grow subtropical and temperate fruits and vegetables.  These groups may seasonally move substantial herds of sheep, goats and cattle between lowlands in the winter and subalpine pastures in summer.  Their diets are richer in vegetables and animal protein and may include pork unless Hindus live nearby.  Fields above 1,500 meters are often better suited to growing maize, millet or barley than rice, although rice is usually preferred for its greater palatability.

Outside cosmopolitan Kathmandu where so many dietary traditions overlap, Tibetan food with its emphasis on potatoes, cold-tolerant grains such as barley and millet, and yak or buffalo meat is mainly confined to the northern, higher regions.

South of the Mahabharat Range where the Middle Hills give way to lowlands a fully tropical climate supports a greater variety of fruits and vegatables.  Cultural practices and cuisine have more in common with northern India.  Among Hindus there is a greater range of castes, particularly castes below the highest &quot;bahun&quot; (brahman) and &quot;chhetri&quot; (Kshatriya) levels that are numerically predominant in the &quot;Hills&quot;.

*Teratogenic effects were first recognized in 1964.
*Numerous studies have demonstrated increased risk for congenital defects, both major and minor.
*Study conducted from 1985-1992
**332 newborns exposed to phenytoin (hydantoin, dilantin) during the 1st trimester
**A total of 15 (4.5%) had major birth defects, including:
***Cardiovascular
***Spina bifida
***Hypospadias

==Clinical Features==

*Craniofacies:
**Broad nasal bridge, wide anterior fontanelle, low hairline, broad alveolar ridge, short neck, hypertelorism, microcephaly, cleft lip/palate, low set ears, epicanthal folds, ptosis, coloboma, coarse scalp hair.
*Limbs:
**Small or absent nails, hypoplasia of distal phalanges, altered palmar crease, digital thumb, dislocated hip
*Growth:
**Mild to moderate growth deficiency, usually prenatal in onset
*Performance:
**Occasional borderline to mild mental deficiency. Performance in childhood is usually better than that predicted in infancy
*Cardiovascular (occasional abnormalities):
**Aortic valvular stenosis, coarctation of aorta, PDA, septal defects
*GI (occasional abnormalities):
**Pyloric stenosis, duodenal atresia, anal atresia
*Other (occasional):
**Small nipples that are widely spaced, umbilical and inguinal hernia.

==Risks==

*Risks of delivering a child with congenital defects is 2-3x greater for women taking dilantin than for the general population.
**Increased risk could be caused by epilepsy, the drugs, or a combination of the two. It is thought that the drugs are the causative factor.
*Risks of child having full syndrome is about 10% and the risk for having some of the effects of the disorder is an additional 33%
*Some reports have shown that phenytoin is a transplacental carcinogen. Tumors were reported to occur after in utero exposure to phenytoin in a few cases.
*Phenytoin may induce folic acid deficiency in the epileptic patient by impairing GI absorption or by increasing hepatic metabolism. Therefore, the risk for having a baby with a spinal abnormality is increased.
*Some risk of early hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Occurs during the 1st 24 hours after birth and can be fatal. Exact mechanism: unknown. Drug is thought to deplete already low levels of fetal vitamin K therefore suppressing the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Proposed treatment regimen: taking oral vitamin K during last 2 months of pregnancy, C section if difficult labor or trauma is suspected, administering intravenous vitamin K to the newborn in the delivery room (this regimen hasn't been tested in clinical controlled trials, but are logical).
*Risk of not taking phenytoin: pregnant patient can have seizures and can cause the baby to have fetal hypoxia.

==Breast Feeding==

*Phenytoin is excreted into breast milk. Milk:plasma ratios range from 0.18 to 0.54.
*Little risk to the infant if maternal levels are kept in the therapeutic range
*Drowsiness and decreased sucking were observed in one infant, no other adverse effects have been reported.
*The American Academy of Pediatrics considers phenytoin to be compatible with breast feeding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fetal Dilantin/Keppra Syndrome'''

==Contracting==
*Introductions and small talk
*Acknowledge recent hospitalization
*Confirm referring physician
*Assess understanding of the reason for the referral to genetics
*How much information has your OB given you about the possible effects of taking dilantin/ keppra while pregnant?
*Despite the increased risk of problems, there is a greater than 90% chance that the baby will be just fine.
*What concerns or questions do you have that you would like to discuss today?
*Outline session agenda
**Medical and family history questions
**Some of the possible effects that anticonvulsants can have on the pregnancy.
**Options available to you
**Discussion of concerns and questions

==Elicit Medical History==
*Pregnancy/neonatal history:
**LMP: __________
**EDC: __________
**Today's gestational age: __________
**Have you had an ultrasound?
**Date of ultrasound: __________
**Results of ultrasound: __________
**How has the pregnancy been going so far?
**Seizures last week….any others
**What medications are you taking? Dilantin and Kepra
***Amount and frequency of each. When did you start taking each?
**When did you begin having seizures?
**What type of seizures do you typically have?
**Any complications other than the seizures? Infections, colds, exposures etc. (Review and confirm information from the intake form at Bethesda)

==Elicit Family History==
(3 generations)
*Anyone with seizure disorders?
*Anyone had: multiple SAB, SB, early deaths or babies that required surgery as infants?
*Anyone born with: birth defects or mental retardation
*Has anyone had early cancers (dx. &lt;50) or chronic illnesses (heart disease, diabetes)

==Discuss possible side effects of taking anticonvulsants during pregnancy==
*Stress importance of taking medicines- to keep you healthy and therefore the baby healthy
*Although it's very important for you to take these medications, sometimes seizure medications can have some effects on a developing baby.
*All pregnancies are at a 3-5% risk of birth defects and mental retardation
*Women who take anticonvulsants are at a 2-3x increased risk for some specific problems.
*This doesn't mean that the baby will be born with a problem, it just means that we know that based on your special circumstances, your pregnancy is at an increased risk.
*Some of the things that we sometimes see in children who have been exposed to dilantin during pregnancy include:
**Subtle changes in the face..such as the shape of the eyes and nose. These are usually such subtle features that you might not even recognize them
**Sometimes we see changes in the length of the fingers (slightly shortened) and the size of the fingernails (tiny)
**But sometimes children can be born with more apparent changes such as a cleft lip/palate or an open spine.
**Occasionally we see kids who have some delays in development ranging from borderline normal intelligence to mild mental retardation.
**There is a small risk of other birth defects dealing with the heart and intestinal tract.
*Keppra: this anticonvulsant hasn't been well studied but we do know that anticonvulsants in general have been associated with an increased risk of birth defects.
*Some children who have been exposed to anticonvulsants during pregnancy have several of these features and some have none. Just based on your history I can't tell you whether or not your baby will have some or none of these features, but we do have some options that we can offer you.

==Options==
*Level II ultrasound- high resolution to look at the anatomy. ~16 weeks is a good time, but (20+ is ideal).
**High resolution u/s
**Done by an experienced technician
**Better to see more of the developing organs in greater detail
**Will be looking closely at the features of the baby….spine, heart, brain, shape of the head to make sure that these organs/tissues formed correctly.
**U/S is good to make us suspicious of some birth defects but it can't tell us everything. We won't know if there is mental deficiency by u/s. Also, u/s is dependent upon cooperation of the baby. Sometimes we just can't get a great view and may not be able to see everything we are looking for.
***However, a normal ultrasound would certainly be reassuring.

==Psychosocial Assessment==
*Who is living in your home?
*How are the childcare needs being met?
*Plans for additional children?
*Do you have any financial concerns?

==Follow-up==
*Questions?
*Registry for patients taking anticonvulsants…
*Do you plan to breast feed the baby? Dilantin is compatible with breast feeding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fetal Valproate Syndrome'''



== Contracting ==

== Medical and Brief Developmental History ==

== Family History ==

== Psychosocial Assessment ==

== Valproic Acid and Antiepileptic Drugs During Pregnancy ==

== Fact Sheet ==
* valproate is chemical present in depakote (commonly used to treat seizures or bipolar)
* Valproate can negatively affect fetal growth and development, but is still used during pregnancy because maternal seizures can be dangerous to both mom and baby
* Valproate crosses the placenta and dose fetus is exposed to may be higher than maternal dose
* Valproic acid was released in 1967 in Europe and in 1978 in the United States to treat epilepsy
* Epilepsy affects approximately 1 % of the population, and an estimated 1.1 million women in the United States with epilepsy are in the childbearing age range
* Approximately 11,500 epileptic women become pregnant each year, many of which use valproic acid
* One in two hundred pregnant women is epileptic
* By 1980, publications began linking malformed children to in utero exposure to valproic acid (greater than 500 mg/day)

== Adverse Outcomes ==
* While risks have not been established for all of the various outcomes there is data for many.
* stillbirth rates 1.3 - 14 % (ref 3)
* perinatal mortality 1.4 - 7.8 %. (ref 3)
* Congenital anomalies in babies born to mothers with epilepsy is estimated to be 2-3X's higher than general population (ref 1 and 2)which would mean about 6-15% others estimate below 10% (ref 3)
* Some studies report association with autism and speech and language difficulties
* Learning difficulties and mental retardation in approximately 29% of those with fetal valproate syndrome (ref 1)
* malformations most likely related to first trimester exposure in a dose dependent fashion
* Some of these adverse outcomes are associated with early first trimester phenomena (congenital malformations), others such as developmental delay are more likely to be associated with an exposure of greater duration, or during the third trimester.
* Causal relationship of cleft lip and palate with valproic acid has not been established, but it has been associated with most anticonvulsants (p. 1093v) HOWEVER, in the study below they found 3 cases of cleft palate rate of 4% or 40 X's that in general population. In contrast to various studies that report no association. (ref 1)
* A total of 69 cases that were solely exposed to VPA with adequate phenotypic description were identified.
* The clinical manifestations of FVS encompass a wide spectrum of abnormalities: consistent facial phenotype, multiple systemic and orthopedic involvement, central nervous system dysfunction, and altered physical growth.
* Twelve percent of affected children died in infancy and 29% of surviving patients had developmental deficits/mental retardation.
* 30% had minor skin anomalies most common were hemangiomas and nipple abnormalities
* respiratory tract abnormalities seen in 16% of patients (tracheomalacia was most common and etiology is unknown, but frequently seen with TEF)

== Characteristic Features ==
* In humans, VPA has been associated with an increased frequency of congenital malformations
* VPA use during gestation has been associated with an increase risk of spina bifida. Several human studies have suggested that use of VPA during pregnancy increases the risk of neural tube defects (NTD) 20-40X, to approximately 1-2%, as compared to the general population risk of 0.05% (comparable to that of a woman who has a previous child with a NTD)
** midfacial hypoplasia (flat nasal bridge with a broad base)
** distinctive facial appearance
** deficient orbital ridge
** inferior epicanthal folds
** anteverted nostrils
** shallow philtrum
** thin upper lip with a thick lower lip
** prominent forehead
** long thin overlapping fingers and toes, and hyper-convex nails have also been described
** congenital heart disease
** decreased postnatal growth.
* increased risk of radial limb reduction defects and hypospadias in male fetuses
* However, it is important to point out that several of the mothers in the studies were on multiple medications and it is difficult to assign causal effect as a result
** proposed mechanism of action is that valproic acid influences folate metabolism, thereby altering the closure of the spinal column resulting in spina bifida

== Review of the Literature ==
(1978-2000) (ref 1)
* A total of 69 cases that were solely exposed to VPA with adequate phenotypic description were identified.
* The clinical manifestations of FVS encompass a wide spectrum of abnormalities: consistent facial phenotype, multiple systemic and orthopedic involvement, central nervous system dysfunction, and altered physical growth.
* The facial appearance is characterized by a small broad nose, small ears, flat philtrum, a long upper lip with shallow philtrum, and micro/retrognathia.
* In this review, 62% of the patients had musculoskeletal abnormalities, 30% had minor skin defects, 26% had cardiovascular abnormalities, 22% had genital abnormalities, and 16% had pulmonary abnormalities.
* Less frequently encountered abnormalities included brain, eye, kidney, and hearing defects.
* Neural tube defects were seen in 3% of the sample.
* Twelve percent of affected children died in infancy and 29% of surviving patients had developmental deficits/mental retardation.
* Although 15% of patients had growth retardation, an overgrowth pattern was seen in 9%.

== Risk Assessment for Seizures and Schizophrenia ==
* Risk of children having epilepsy based on moms history is about 4% (Practical Genetic Counseling 4th edition 1993)
* Risk of Schizophrenia 3-5% (from same source as above risk)

== Other Antiepleptic Drugs (AED) ==
(and effects during pregnancy)
(Taken primarily from information contained in a website by ©1998 Dr. Mark Yerby, North Pacific Epilepsy Research. )
six clinical AED syndromes have been reported in the medical literature
* Fetal Trimethadione Syndrome
** Children exposed to this drug in utero were more likely to be short in stature, microcephalic, have V-shaped eyebrows, epicanthal folds, low set ears, anteriorally folded helices, and irregular teeth. Inguinal hernias, hypospadias, and simian creases were also frequently observed.
** A retrospective study of trimethadiaone exposures in 53 pregnancies revealed fetal loss or major malformations in 87 % of the pregnancies (Feldman et al. 1977).
** Follow-up studies have reported significant rates of mental retardation among the exposed infants (Goldman et al. 1986).
** Trimethadione, introduced in the 1940's for the treatment of absence epilepsy, has been largely supplanted by less toxic-more effective compounds and is seldom used in the treatment of epilepsy.
* Fetal Hydantoin Syndrome (FHS)
** Among the many dysmorphic findings associated with this syndrome, hypoplasia and irregular ossification of the distal phalanges was originally believed to be the single most characteristic feature.
** Of the five children described by Hanson and Smith, only one was exposed to phenytoin monotherapy. The infants displayed facial dysmorphism including: epicanthal folds, hypertelorism, broad flat nasal bridges, an upturned nasal tip, wide prominent lips, and in addition distal digital hypoplasia (DDH), intrauterine growth retardation and mental retardation.
** Subsequently, Hanson et al. (1976), reported a prevalence of FHS of 11%, with an additional 30% of the in utero exposed children expressing some of the syndrome's features.
** He also suggested that these children are at greater risk for the development of neural crest tumors, although subsequent prospective studies have failed to verify this initial observation.
** A prospective study from the University of Helsinki, examined 121 infants of mothers with epilepsy, 82 exposed to phenytoin, found no cases of FHS.
** Hypertelorism and distal digital hypoplasia were the only dysmorphic features associated with phenytoin exposure in this study (Gaily ''et al.'' 1988).
** As with the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, it is now common nomenclature to consider children presenting with a more limited pattern of anomalies secondary to in utero hydantoin exposure to be expressing Fetal Hydantoin Effects (FHE; Hanson, 1986).
* Primidone Embryopathy
** Affected children present with hirsute foreheads, thick nasal roots, anteverted nostrils, long philtrums, straight thin upper lips, and DDH. These children tend to be small for dates, have an increased risk for psychomotor retardation and heart defects (Rudd and Freedom 1979, Gustavson and Chen 1985).
** A case report of a family in whom all 4 siblings had clinical features of the FHE demonstrates the complexity involved in evaluating affected children.
** The first 2 children in this family were exposed to both phenytoin and primidone in utero. In an attempt to prevent dysmorphism in subsequent pregnancies, the phenytoin was discontinued.
** Unfortunately, the third and fourth children had the same dysmorphic features as their elder siblings having been exposed to primidone monotherapy (Krauss ''et al.'' 1984).
* phenobarbital
** facial dysmorphism, pre- and post-natal growth deficiency, developmental delay, and minor anomalies
** clinical features were similar to those seen with in utero exposure to both phenytoin and alcohol, hence the author felt that it should not be classified as a separate syndrome (Seip 1976).
** He also noted that all three of these compounds can result in folate deficiency and hypothesized that such a deficiency could be the common mechanism for the dysmorphism seen with such in utero teratogen exposures.
* valproic acid embryopathy (see above information)
* Fetal Carbamazepine Syndrome
** described by a single group of investigators (Jones et al. 1989)
** Dysmorphic features include: up slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, short nose, long philtrum, DDH and microcephaly. Developmental delay was also found in 20 % of exposed children, although the authors used one standard deviation from the mean as the cut-off for abnormality, rather than the customary two standard deviations.
** Applying the conventional definitions to their data, eliminates any increased risk for developmental delay in the carbamazepine exposed children.
** Reduction in fetal head circumference has been reported in carbamazepine exposed children (Hiilesmaa et al. 1981). Although smaller than controls, the head sizes were still within the normal range and the differences between the IME and controls disappeared as the children matured.

== Difficulty Determining Risks ==
* clinicians are uncertain how much of the adverse outcome difficulty is secondary to AED, maternal seizures, or simply the genetics of having epilepsy
* In one large study, The Teratogenicity of Anticonvulsant Drugs. N Engl J Med 2001; 344: 1 132-8 (April 12) showed that women with seizures who were not on AED's were not at an increased risk of having children with birth defects while those that were treated with AED's were at a significant increased risk (However, possible confounding because women not treated with meds are likely to have less severe seizure disorder)
** Controversy remains regarding the causes of the increased risk of adverse outcomes of pregnancy. AED are suspected of contributing to an increase in the risk of congenital malformations and dysmorphic features. Yet increased generalized convulsive seizures are associated with premature labor and fetal death.
** Facial dysmorphism can be difficult to quantify and is certainly not specific to any one anticonvulsant drug. Infants of epileptic mothers with similar dysmorphic features have been described in the pre-anticonvulsant era (Baptisti 1938, Philbert and Dam 1982).
** The long-term outcome and significance of these anomalies remain unclear
** In those few cases which have been followed into early childhood, the dysmorphic features tend to disappear as the child grows older in some, but not all instances (Janz 1982)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''FG Syndrome'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*Can you explain to me in your own words why you were referred to genetics?
*What questions if any do you have for us today
*What are your main concerns at this time
*Outline the session and what will occur
**Medical and developmental history
**Family history (pedigree)
**Dr. will physically examine him
**We will explain any conclusions if any that we have reached and discuss what we think might be the explanation for the concerns and problems

==Pedigree==
*Basic 3 generation pedigree unless specific findings come up and may need explore maternal side further due to X-linked pattern of FG syndrome
*birth defects
*pregnancy loss
*poor muscle tone
*chronic constipation
*hearing loss
*vision problems
**kidney problems
**problems with the digestive tract
**other chronic health problems
**mental retardation of learning difficulties
**large head size
**broad thumbs and toes
**fingernails that grow over tips of fingers
**behavioral problems

==Overview of FG==
*X-linked recessive condition
*First described 1974 by Drs. John M. Opitz and Elizabeth G. Kaveggia
*Named after initials of first patients described
*Multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome
*Characterized by MR, macrocephaly, congenital hypotonia, macrocephaly, facial dysmorphism and anomalies of the digestive tract
*No features are pathognomonic

==FG syndrome physical characteristics==
*prenatal oligohydrammios
*High degree of variability of physical features
*Hypotonia with joint hyperlaxity evolves into spasticity with joint contractures later in life
*chronic constipation is a distinctive major finding in FG (usually resolves during mid-childhood)
*hearing loss
*vision problems
*genital abnormalities (cryporchidism)
*respiratory problems
*congenital heart defects uncommon but include hypoplastic left heart, small VSD; VSD and mitral and aortic valve defect (Opitz, 1988)
*agenesis of the corpus collosum
*anteriorly positioned or imperforate anus
*kidney problems
*large head
*broad thumbs and toes
*characteristic fingerprint patterns
*webbed fingers and toes
*skeletal defects (occasionally including craniosynostosis and scoliosis)
*sacral pit
*tethered cord and Chiari I malformations
*wide set eyes
*broad nasal bridge
*low set simple ears that are small, rounded, and protruding
*thin upper lip and fuller lower lip
*cowlicks and a widow's peak hairline

==Developmental and behavioral features of FG syndrome==
*delayed acquisition of speech and motor skills
*Individuals with FG Syndrome tend to be outgoing, talkative, and crave lots of attention
*May be easily frustrated and are prone to temper tantrums
*Hyperactivity and impulsivness have been reported
*Most function in mild to moderate range of MR other reports state it is usually severe MR
**Some clinicians feel MR is universal finding in FG, but others feel there is a wide range of cognitive ability and some are in normal range
*Often language skills are underdeveloped
*&quot;Autistic-like&quot; behaviors have been discussed. This may be due to a common trait of the FG Syndrome--- sensory integrative dysfunction. However, they are not believed to be autistic
**Frequent fascinations with mechanical objects and toys, tendency to self-absorption

==Life expectancy==
*Death during infancy as high as 1/3 of patients due to bronchopulmonary problems and/or heart defects
*&quot;Once they survived infancy death is rare&quot;

==Genetics==
*presumably due to mutations on the X chromosome
*presumed to cause disruption in the development of the fetus
**X-linked recessive
**Heterogeneous condition
**mapped one gene (FGS1) to Xq13 (Briault ''et al.'') in some families using linkage analysis
**evidence for another gene locus (FGS2) at Xq28 or Xq11q12 based on fact these are breakpoints of an inversion that segregate with FG phenotype (Briault ''et al.'', 2000)
**Dr. Opitz lists a potential third gene (FGS3) at Xp22.3 (Opitz, Sep, 2001)
**9 candidate genes excluded in three families (A Lossi, A Fatima, S Briault, C Moraine, C Schwartz, 2000)

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical diagnosis
*No molecular testing available (Opitz, 2001)
*Diagnosis based on clustering of symptoms with no symptom being pathognomonic
*Some believe it is not uncommon and may account for many cases of unexplained X-linked MR

==Genetic Testing==
*Linkage analysis is possible in large families with multiple affected family members
*Prenatal testing and carrier testing only possible through such linkage analysis described above

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Fragile X syndrome
**shares feature of protruding ears and X-linked MR as well as behaviors that are sometimes described by people as &quot;autistic like&quot;
*ATR-X syndrome (X-linked alpha thalassemia, mental retardation)
**have severe MR, congenital hypotonia, genital abmormalities and a small head
**differs from FG because those with FG have macrocephaly, friendly personality and hyperactivity
*Williams syndrome
**shares personality and behavioral features with FG
**different in that there is presence of &quot;salient anxiety and internalizing symptoms in WS&quot;
*G/BBB syndrome (Opitz syndrome)
**Considerable overlap in features of G/BBB and FG syndromes
**Features that are shared with FG include: sensorineural dysfunction, behavioral problems, imperforate anus, hypoplasia or agenesis of the corpus callosum, kidney abnormalities, cryptorchidism, heart (cardiac) defects, and mental retardation.
**One form of G/BBB syndrome is inherited in X-linked recessive fashion and is due to mutations in MID1 gene
**Other symptoms of G/BBB include; dysphagia, cleft palate and or cleft lip (which are not usually seen in FG). Pulmonary agenesis or hypoplasia and tetralogy of Fallot have been seen only in the G/BBB syndrome so far.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''First Trimester Screening'''

==Overview==
*Screen low-risk population to identify those at higher risk to give birth to child with a chromosome abnormality
**Normal result does not mean that there are no abnormalities
**Abnormal result indicates that diagnostic testing by amniocentesis or CVS is warranted
*Consists of ultrasound and blood test
*Performed between 10th and 14th week of pregnancy

==Procedure==
*Biochemical screening
**Blood draw done by finger stick onto filter paper
**May be taken between 8 weeks, 4 days and 13 weeks, 3 days
**Measures levels of substances found in the blood of all pregnant women
***FreeBeta Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements
****Glycoprotein derived from the placenta
****Serum levels tend to be high in patients carrying a fetus affected with Down Syndrome (average = 1.9 MoM)
****Serum levels significantly reduced in patients carrying a fetus affected with Trisomy 18 (average = 0.18 MoM)
***Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPP-A)
****Produced by trophoblast of placenta
****Significantly reduced in blood of women carrying fetuses with Down Syndrome (average = 0.44 MoM)
****Significantly reduced in blood of women carrying fetuses with Trisomy 18 (average = 0.32 MoM)
*Ultrasonagraphic findings
**Measure nuchal translucency (NT)
***Amount of fluid that accumulates behind the neck of the baby
****Echo-free space between skin and soft tissue overlying cervical spine
****Present only during first trimester
***About 30-86% of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency have chromosomal abnormality
***Increased in fetuses with chromosome abnormalities, cardiac defects, and certain genetic syndromes
****Greater than 3.5 mm is considered out of normal range
****Increased NT is not diagnostic of chromosome abnormality
****Lymphedema seen in NT may be result of fetal cardiac abnormalities
***Usually resolves in second trimester
***No consensus on how to measure nuchal translucency resulting in conflicting results about effectiveness
**Measured transbdominally in 95% of cases and transvaginally in other 5%
**Procedure takes between 15 and 30 minutes

==Detection Rate==
*Biochemical screening without NT
**Identifies greater than 60% of Down Syndrome
**Identifies 90% of Trisomy 18
**About 1 in 25 women with an increased risk based on screening will have baby with Down Syndrome
*Biochemical screening with NT
**Identifies about 90% of Down Syndrome
**Identifies up to 97% of Trisomy 18
**False positive rate is 5%
**About 1 in 17 women with an increased risk based on screening will have baby with Down Syndrome
*Cannot screen for open neural tube defects so AFP testing still recommended in 2nd trimester
*Cannot identify all birth defects

==Benefits and Limitations of Testing==
*Benefits
**Helps reduce maternal anxiety at earlier gestational age
**Allows patient to have CVS for diagnosis in 1st trimester
**Allows for 1st trimester termination of affected fetus
**Not an invasive procedure - no risk to mother or to fetus
*Limitations
**Currently not covered by insurance
**Only screens for two out of possible thousands of genetic conditions
**Screening will miss about 10% of Down Syndrome
**Still requires invasive procedure for diagnosis
**Not as sensitive if multiple pregnancies
**Patient specific risks rely on accuracy of clinical information that is interpreted for results of test

==Research Study at Magee-Womens Hospital==
*Eligibility criteria: women 18-45 between 10 and 14 weeks
*To determine if first trimester screening is an effective method to detect Down Syndrome and other chromosome abnormalities
**If risk higher than 1 in 270, can continue routine prenatal care, undergo CVS at 10-13 weeks, or have amniocentesis after 15 weeks
**Women who choose to participate must provide information on pregnancy outcome
*Responsible for all costs, including blood sample, ultrasound, and genetic counseling

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fragile X Syndrome'''

==General Information about Fragile X syndrome==
*Most common form of genetically inherited mental impairment.
*It is inherited in a non-standard X-linked fashion (gene clinics states it is X-linked dominant other sources refer to it as X-linked recessive)
*FMR1 gene on X chromosome at Xq27.3 was sequenced in 1991
*It makes the protein FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein). There is evidence that FMRP plays a role in regulating protein synthesis.
*The number of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene determines whether someone is classified as having no mutation, a premutation or full mutation
**no mutation 6-54 repeats is typical (gene is active and not methylated)
**premutation 55-230 repeats (gene is not usually methylated) males and females usually unaffected
**full mutation &gt;230 repeats (gene is usually fully methylated and therefore inactive) males are usually affected and 50% of females are affected
**Other mutations (point mutation or deletion) in the FMR1 gene can cause Fragile X, but this occurs in &lt;1% of cases

==Genotype-Phenotype Correlations==
*The phenotype of males with an FMR1 mutation is almost entirely dependent on the nature of the mutation; the phenotype of females with an FMR1 mutation is dependent on both the nature of the FMR1 mutation and random X-chromosome inactivation
Premutation
*Males and females who have a fragile X premutation have normal intellect and appearance.
*There have been multiple reports of individuals with a premutation and typically subtle intellectual or behavioral symptoms.
Full mutation
*Males who have a full fragile X mutation generally have moderate to severe mental impairment (average IQ of 41) and may or may not have a distinctive appearance.
*About 50% of females who have a full fragile X mutation are mentally retarded; however, they are usually less severely affected than males with a full mutation. (Some sources quote 1/3 or 33% they are usually older references)
*Conversely, about 50% of females who are heterozygous for the full mutation are intellectually normal. This variability among females is believed to result from the distribution of X chromosome inactivation ratios in the brain. (Some sources quote 2/3 or 66%)

==Repeat size mosaicism==
*Although some data suggest that individuals with mosaicism perform at a higher intellectual level than individuals with completely methylated full mutations, these individuals are usually mentally retarded. (Average IQ 60)
*Rarely, patients with methylation mosaicism or completely unmethylated full mutations and normal intellect have been reported
*Mosaicism is present in about 15% to 20% of individuals with FMR1 mutations.
*Presumably these individuals produce at least some FMR1 protein because the FMR1 gene is unmethylated.
*The existence of these exceptional patients suggests that repeat expansion and methylation of the gene are not absolutely coupled.

==Risks of expansion==
*Factors influencing likelihood of expansion include:
**Gender -- expansion nearly always occurs in female meiosis
*Women with the premutation may pass fragile X to their offspring due to genetic anticipation (when egg is made # of repeats increases and expansion occurs).
*Males with the premutation will pass this premutation to their daughters without it expanding to a full mutation in the process. However, expansion can occur in her offspring and can therefore lead to affected grandchildren.
*Size of repeat-- the larger the repeat, the more likely it is to expand
*Presence of AGG interruptions --Sequences of uninterrupted CGG repeats are at higher risk to be expanded-explains why alleles with same CGG copy number have different risks for instability


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+Risk that a Mother with a Premutation will have an Affected Child with a Full Mutation
! Number of Maternal Premutation CGG Repeats !! Approximate % Risk of Having an Affected Son !! Approximate % Risk of Having an Affected Daughter 1
|-
| 56-59 || 7% || 3.5%
|-
| 60-69 || 10% || 5%
|-
| 70-79 || 29% || 15%
|-
| 80-89 || 36% || 18%
|-
| 90-99 || 47% || 24%
|-
| &gt;100 || 50% || 25%
|}

*Taken from gene clinics
*Unlike classical X-linked dominant disorders where all females with a mutation are affected, only about 50% of females with a full mutation are mentally retarded. This variability in phenotype is likely to be related to variability in X chromosome inactivation, a phenomenon independent of FMR1 mutations.

==Characteristics==
*Males are more likely to exhibit the characteristics of fragile X because they have only one X chromosome. However, females may also exhibit a few of these characteristics.
Physical Characteristics:
*Physical features may be quite subtle and people with fragile X may be normal in appearance
*See chart below for common physical features in males (From Fragile X Syndrome Diagnosis, Treatment, and Research)
*Females share some of the same features

==Cognitive Characteristics==
*Majority of boys (80%) and 50% of girls have mild to moderate mental retardation (IQ below 70). Other girls may show signs of specific learning difficulties such as in math.
*Common problems include delayed milestones (speech and language delays are common in males, but less common in females)

==Behavioral Characteristics==
*Behavior ranges from socially engaging and friendly to autistic-like and occasionally aggressive.
*They may display some or all of the behavioral characteristics in the chart on the side
*Behaviors also include short attention span and they are often initially diagnosed as ADHD (often treated with adderall, or clonidine)
*They may also have difficulty adjusting to change.
*Obsessive compulsive behavior is quite common (preservative or repetitive behavior) this may improve with SSRI's
*Psychosis may occur and is often precipitated by aging or severe stress

==Medical Concerns==
*Table from Fragile X Syndrome Diagnosis, Treatment, Research

==Treatment/Therapy/Prevention/Anticipatory guidance==
*Currently, there is no specific treatment for Fragile X. Therapy tends to focus on the behavioral and learning issues that are often associated with Fragile X Syndrome. These may include:
*Behavioral techniques to manage hyperactivity and temper tantrums
*Some boys don't sleep for long periods of time and meds can be given for this
*Medicinal treatment for management of behavioral issues
*Educational intervention (special classes, etc.)
*Therapy including: speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and sensory integration therapy (to manage sensitivity to sensory input)
*Therapeutic calming techniques and a regular routine may also help with behavior problems.

==Adults with fragile X==
*Hyperactivity tends to improve in adolescents and adults with fragile X
*Anxiety, (particularly social anxiety) is present and more common in individuals who are not impulsive or hyperactive
*Anxiety or uncertainty often leads to aggressive outbursts in new situations
*Treatments for anxiety may help
*Possibly up to 50% of adult males experience mitral valve prolapse
*Mild aortic root dilation may also occur
*Hypertension is relatively common, but may be the result of anxiety.

==Testing==
Two main DNA testing approaches:
*PCR-- (size indicates approximate number of repeats present) It is very accurate in sizing normal and premutation alleles. The efficiency is inversely related to number of CGG repeats present Large permutations and mutations difficult to analyze and may fail to yield detectable product. It also does not give information about FMR1 methylation
*Southern blot analysis - Doesn't allow precise sizing, but accurately detects alleles in all size ranges and estimates size. It also allows methylation status to be assayed.
**Labs often do both
*Research based testing available for other mutations in the FMR1 gene

==Prenatal testing==
*Possible via both CVS and amniocentesis once genetic status of parents is confirmed.
*Results from CVS testing must be interpreted with caution because the methylation status of the FMR1 gene is often not yet established in chorionic villi at the time of sampling.
*CVS may lead to a situation in which follow-up amniocentesis is necessary to resolve an ambiguous result.

==Preimplantation genetic diagnosis==
*Expensive and chance of no pregnancy
*Chance of pregnancy best determined by a reproductive endocrinologist: A woman's age and fertility potential are great determinants of chance of pregnancy with IVF-PGD
*Only performed at specific centers

==Indications for Fragile X screening==
*Individuals of either sex with mental retardation, developmental delay, or autism, especially if they have any physical or behavioral characteristics of FXS, a family history of FXS, or male/female relatives with MR of unknown etiology
*Any person who has a family member with a diagnosis of fragile X syndrome or a family history of mental retardation
*Fetuses of known carrier mothers
*Patients with cytogenetic fragile X test result that is discordant with their phenotype. These include patients with strong clinical indication and who have had negative or ambiguous cyto test result, and patients with an atypical phenotype with positive cytogenetic test result
* population screening not recommended at this time

==Differential Diagnosis==
*MR, ADHD, autistic like features can be seen in Asperger, FAS, and autism
*Coffin-Lowery shares features of prominent ears, coarse features
*Lujan Fryns syndrome - marfanoid habitus and machroorchidism
*Atkin syndrome - large ears, short stature, machroorchidism
*Fragile X has been seen in conjunction with chromosomal aneuploidy syndromes

      <text xml:space="preserve">Financial models need to be:
* '''useful''' – they need to assist the user in solving the business problem
**This needs good business analysis and design skills

* '''accurate''' – they must do exactly what they say they do
**This needs correct logic, accurate calculations &amp; relevant results

* '''flexible''', so they can evolve throughout the analytical process and beyond

* '''provable''' – the inputs, calculations and results can all be verified
This needs clear layout, good documentation, data validation &amp; results testing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A good guiding rule is to keep things as simple and as clear as possible, for example:
* using common functions rather than complex or rarely used functions
* keeping formulae short
* not being &quot;clever&quot;, which may just confuse other people
* separating the spreadsheet into clearly marked sections

''Code Complete'', the classic book on programming by Steve McConnell, says that managing complexity is ''the'' major imperative.

I think that if you cut off all the taskbars and menus from the screenshot and leave only the spreadsheet, there would be no problem marking such screenshot as fair use {{tl|software-screenshot}}. And if you  really must show some menu bars or something, don't show the window title (&quot;Excel&quot; is registered trademark). Such screenshot should also be fair use IMO. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:00, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

= Caro-Kann Defence =
In choosing the Caro-Kann, Black gives up the centre in exchange for easier development. In contrast to the French, the queen's bishop is not blocked, but the c6 square is no longer available for the knight. Black often aims to let white's pawns overextend, or develop a poor structure, and take advantage in the endgame.

White's natural move is now [[/2. d4/]] as nothing prevents him from building a strong center. Bobby Fischer sometimes played [[/2. Nf3/]] followed by 3. Nc3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Factor Theorem===

[[User:thebhgg]] asks:
I don't follow what is being said in the Factor Theorem section.  Is the point to tell students that rational roots of polynomials must be of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{a_0}{a_n}&lt;/math&gt;?  I don't see how that is a special case of the Remainder Theorem.  If that is not the point, then when is it explained to students?  It isn't an obvious fact, but it is used in this section without explanation.

If the point of the Factor Theorem is to say that if &lt;math&gt;f(a)=0&lt;/math&gt; i.e. you have found a root, then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be divided evenly by &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt; (and vice versa), then that's what should be said.

===Syllabus===

The Factor and Remainder Theorems do not seem to actually be part of C1, or at least I can't find them there in the syllabus. --[[User:Aleksev|Aleksev]] 20:21, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

Yes, the Factor and Remainder Theorems are part of the C2 curriculum --[[User:Keytotime|Keytotime]] 13:46, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Botchan}}

'''''Botchan''''' (坊っちゃん) by Natsume Soseki is one of the most popular novels in Japan. Most Japanese read it during their childhood. It is a story about morals.

=== Background ===

The story is based on Natsume's personal experience as a teacher being transferred to Matsuyama, which sets the stage for this novel. Natsume was born in Tokyo, and dwelling in Matsuyama was his first experience in other places. The novel describes his feelings during that experience, though occupational position of his own and the hero were widely different.

=== Main characters ===

* Botchan: the hero of this novel. He is born in Tokyo, and has the spirit of an Edokko. He becomes a teacher of mathematics. He has common sense and a strong moral grounding. 
* Yamaarashi (Porcupine): A fellow teacher. Yamaarashi (Porcupine) is the nickname for a teacher by the name of Hotta, born in Aizu. Yamaarashi has a great, Samurai-like sense of justice. 
* Akashatsu (Redshirt): Another fellow teacher. He is the typical intellectual. He actually represents the continental European intellectual tradition, in its modern form, as it drifts towards collectivism (socialism and communism (thus the red shirt) and relativism/nihilism. He speaks of morals but is Machiavellian, and immoral. A scandal who for a short period of time was able to deceive even Botchan. The battle for the heart and mind of Botchan, between Yamaarashi and Akashatsu represents the tensions existing in Japan at the turn of last century. Soseki clearly rejects Akashatsu and thus the modern Continental intellectual traditions. 
* Nodaiko (The Clown): Art teacher. Nodaiko is a Tokyoite, like Botchan. He prides himself with his good taste, but follows others without much thought which earns him Botchan's contempt. 
* Uranari (The Pumpkin): Uranari is a very melancholic, but refined gentleman. Botchan looks up to him. Most agree that Uranari, or some combination of Uranari and Botchan, is Soseki's representation of himself.
* Tanuki (The Badger): The principal of the school Botchan teaches at. He has a very indecisive nature.
* Kiyo: Botchan's servant in Tokyo. Now an old woman, she used to take care of him when he was young. She also is a fallen aristocrat, dealing heroically with her new situation.

=== Supporting characters ===

* Geisha: Woman entertainers. They often perform Japanese dances at banquets.
* Students of this school: Botchan thinks they are devious and they often puzzle him.

=== Main place ===

* School: the main stage of the novel. 
* Dogo Onsen: Hot spring that Botchan likes to go to. Now, thanks to the novel, the springs are known as a famous sightseeing spot throughout Japan.

=== Main themes of the novel ===
* Botchan's observations and considerations about Matsuyama, on Shikoku, one of the four main islands of Japan. Botchan lives in Tokyo until he goes there. Tokyo is a modern city, but Matsuyama is not. So Botchan is surprised at the odd customs.
* The battle for the heart and mind of Botchan between Yamaarashi and Akashatsu. Will Botchan's common sense and moral grounding become corrupted by Akashatsu, or will he team up with Yamaarashi to battle the increasing break from tradition and morals, for purely selfish gain, that Akashatsu represents.

=== Main scenes and events of the novel ===

* Botchan goes to Matsuyama: Eight days after Botchan graduates college in Tokyo his principal calls him to his office and tells Botchan that a middle school in Shikoku needs a mathematics teacher. The salary is forty yen a month and Botchan couldn't think of anything else he could become other than a math teacher.
* Botchan is disappointed in the place of his appointment.
* Fishing: Botchan recognizes that Akashatsu is a crafty quack when he and Akashatsu go fishing together.
* Locusts: The students tease Botchan by putting locusts in his bed.
* Uranari's transfer: Akashatsu schemes to transfer Uranari to another school for Akashatsu's own profit by using his authority.
* And the end of the novel: Revenge: Botchan and Yamaarashi get revenge on Akashatsu and Nodaiko. Botchan resigns his job and returns to Tokyo. He finds a job as a tramway engineer.

== Detecting Debuggers ==

It may come as a surprise that a running program can actually detect the presence of an attached user-mode debugger. Also, there are methods available to detect kernel-mode debuggers, although the methods used depend in large part on which debugger is trying to be detected.

This subject is peripheral to the narrative of this book, and the section should be considered an optional one for most readers.

== IsDebuggerPresent API ==

The Win32 API contains a function called &quot;IsDebuggerPresent&quot;, which will return a boolean true if the program is being debugged. The following code snippet will detail a general usage of this function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 if(IsDebuggerPresent())
 {
   TerminateProcess(GetCurrentProcess(), 1);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, it is easy to spot uses of the IsDebuggerPresent() function in the disassembled code, and a skilled reverser will simply patch the code to remove this line. For OllyDbg, there are many plugins available which hide the debugger from this and many other APIs.

== PEB Debugger Check ==

The Process Environment Block stores the value that IsDebuggerPresent queries to determine its return value. To avoid suspicion, some programmers access the value directly from the PEB instead of calling the API function. The following code snippet shows how to access the value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov eax, fs:[30h] 
mov eax, byte [eax+2] 
test eax, eax 
jne @DebuggerDetected  
&lt;/source&gt;

== Timeouts ==

Debuggers can put break points in the code, and can therefore stop program execution. A program can detect this, by monitoring the system clock. If too much time has elapsed between instructions, it can be determined that the program is being stopped and analyzed (although this is not always the case). If a program is taking too much time, the program can terminate.

Notice that on preemptive multithreading systems, such as modern Windows or Linux systems will switch away from your program to run other programs. This is called thread switching. If the system has many threads to run, or if some threads are hogging processor time, your program may detect a long delay and may falsely determine that the program is being debugged.

== Detecting SoftICE ==

[[w:SoftICE|SoftICE]] is a local kernel debugger, and as such, it can't be detected as easily as a user-mode debugger can be. The IsDebuggerPresent API function will not detect the presence of SoftICE.

To detect SoftICE, there are a number of techniques that can be used:
#Search for the SoftICE install directory. If SoftICE is installed, the user is probably a hacker or a reverser.
#Detect the presence of '''int 1'''. SoftICE uses interrupt 1 to debug, so if interrupt 1 is installed, SoftICE is running.

&lt;!--
Some time ago I've described different SoftICE detecting techniques in
&quot;Windows (anti)cracking techniques&quot; available at http://gim.org.pl/Windows_Anti_Cracking_techniques_english.html
I'm writing this as a comment, so someone could verify this and not to be suspected for autopromotion.

== Detecting OllyDbg ==

OllyDbg is a popular 32-bit usermode debugger. Unfortunately, the last few releases, including the latest version (v1.10) contain a vulnerability in the handling of the Win32 API function OutputDebugString(). [http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10742] A programmer trying to prevent his program from being debugged by OllyDbg could exploit this vulnerability in order to make the debugger crash. The author has never released a fix, however there are unofficial versions and plugins available to protect OllyDbg from being exploited using this vulnerability.</text>

庭を東へ二十歩に行き尽（つく）すと、南上がりにいささかばかりの菜園があって、真中（まんなか）に栗（くり）の木が一本立っている。これは命より大事な栗だ。実の熟する時分は起き抜けに背戸（せど）を出て落ちた奴を拾ってきて、学校で食う。菜園の西側が山城屋（やましろや）という質屋の庭続きで、この質屋に勘太郎（かんたろう）という十三四の倅（せがれ）が居た。勘太郎は無論弱虫である。弱虫の癖（くせ）に四つ目垣を乗りこえて、栗を盗（ぬす）みにくる。ある日の夕方折戸（おりど）の蔭（かげ）に隠（かく）れて、とうとう勘太郎を捕（つら）まえてやった。その時勘太郎は逃（に）げ路（みち）を失って、一生懸命（いっしょうけんめい）に飛びかかってきた。向（むこ）うは二つばかり年上である。弱虫だが力は強い。鉢（はち）の開いた頭を、こっちの胸へ宛（あ）ててぐいぐい押（お）した拍子（ひょうし）に、勘太郎の頭がすべって、おれの袷（あわせ）の袖（そで）の中にはいった。邪魔（じゃま）になって手が使えぬから、無暗に手を振（ふ）ったら、袖の中にある勘太郎の頭が、右左へぐらぐら靡（なび）いた。しまいに苦しがって袖の中から、おれの二の腕（うで）へ食い付いた。痛かったから勘太郎を垣根へ押しつけておいて、足搦（あしがら）をかけて向うへ倒（たお）してやった。山城屋の地面は菜園より六尺がた低い。勘太郎は四つ目垣を半分崩（くず）して、自分の領分へ真逆様（まっさかさま）に落ちて、ぐうと云った。勘太郎が落ちるときに、おれの袷の片袖がもげて、急に手が自由になった。その晩母が山城屋に詫（わ）びに行ったついでに袷の片袖も取り返して来た。

この外いたずらは大分やった。大工の兼公（かねこう）と肴屋（さかなや）の角（かく）をつれて、茂作（もさく）の人参畠（にんじんばたけ）をあらした事がある。人参の芽が出揃（でそろ）わぬ処（ところ）へ藁（わら）が一面に敷（し）いてあったから、その上で三人が半日相撲（すもう）をとりつづけに取ったら、人参がみんな踏（ふ）みつぶされてしまった。古川（ふるかわ）の持っている田圃（たんぼ）の井戸（いど）を埋（う）めて尻（しり）を持ち込まれた事もある。太い孟宗（もうそう）の節を抜いて、深く埋めた中から水が湧（わ）き出て、そこいらの稲（いね）にみずがかかる仕掛（しかけ）であった。その時分はどんな仕掛か知らぬから、石や棒（ぼう）ちぎれをぎゅうぎゅう井戸の中へ挿（さ）し込んで、水が出なくなったのを見届けて、うちへ帰って飯を食っていたら、古川が真赤（まっか）になって怒鳴（どな）り込んで来た。たしか罰金（ばっきん）を出して済んだようである。

おやじはちっともおれを可愛（かわい）がってくれなかった。母は兄ばかり贔屓（ひいき）にしていた。この兄はやに色が白くって、芝居（しばい）の真似（まね）をして女形（おんながた）になるのが好きだった。おれを見る度にこいつはどうせ碌（ろく）なものにはならないと、おやじが云った。乱暴で乱暴で行く先が案じられると母が云った。なるほど碌なものにはならない。ご覧の通りの始末である。行く先が案じられたのも無理はない。ただ懲役（ちょうえき）に行かないで生きているばかりである。

母が病気で死ぬ二三日（にさんち）前台所で宙返りをしてへっついの角で肋骨（あばらぼね）を撲（う）って大いに痛かった。母が大層怒（おこ）って、お前のようなものの顔は見たくないと云うから、親類へ泊（とま）りに行っていた。するととうとう死んだと云う報知（しらせ）が来た。そう早く死ぬとは思わなかった。そんな大病なら、もう少し大人（おとな）しくすればよかったと思って帰って来た。そうしたら例の兄がおれを親不孝だ、おれのために、おっかさんが早く死んだんだと云った。口惜（くや）しかったから、兄の横っ面を張って大変叱（しか）られた。

母が死んでからは、おやじと兄と三人で暮（くら）していた。おやじは何にもせぬ男で、人の顔さえ見れば貴様は駄目（だめ）だ駄目だと口癖のように云っていた。何が駄目なんだか今に分らない。妙（みょう）なおやじがあったもんだ。兄は実業家になるとか云ってしきりに英語を勉強していた。元来女のような性分で、ずるいから、仲がよくなかった。十日に一遍（いっぺん）ぐらいの割で喧嘩（けんか）をしていた。ある時将棋（しょうぎ）をさしたら卑怯（ひきょう）な待駒（まちごま）をして、人が困ると嬉（うれ）しそうに冷やかした。あんまり腹が立ったから、手に在った飛車を眉間（みけん）へ擲（たた）きつけてやった。眉間が割れて少々血が出た。兄がおやじに言付（いつ）けた。おやじがおれを勘当（かんどう）すると言い出した。

その時はもう仕方がないと観念して先方の云う通り勘当されるつもりでいたら、十年来召し使っている清（きよ）という下女が、泣きながらおやじに詫（あや）まって、ようやくおやじの怒（いか）りが解けた。それにもかかわらずあまりおやじを怖（こわ）いとは思わなかった。かえってこの清と云う下女に気の毒であった。この下女はもと由緒（ゆいしょ）のあるものだったそうだが、瓦解（がかい）のときに零落（れいらく）して、つい奉公（ほうこう）までするようになったのだと聞いている。だから婆（ばあ）さんである。この婆さんがどういう因縁（いんえん）か、おれを非常に可愛がってくれた。不思議なものである。母も死ぬ三日前に愛想（あいそ）をつかした――おやじも年中持て余している――町内では乱暴者の悪太郎と爪弾（つまはじ）きをする――このおれを無暗に珍重（ちんちょう）してくれた。おれは到底（とうてい）人に好かれる性（たち）でないとあきらめていたから、他人から木の端（はし）のように取り扱（あつか）われるのは何とも思わない、かえってこの清のようにちやほやしてくれるのを不審（ふしん）に考えた。清は時々台所で人の居ない時に「あなたは真（ま）っ直（すぐ）でよいご気性だ」と賞（ほ）める事が時々あった。しかしおれには清の云う意味が分からなかった。好（い）い気性なら清以外のものも、もう少し善くしてくれるだろうと思った。清がこんな事を云う度におれはお世辞は嫌（きら）いだと答えるのが常であった。すると婆さんはそれだから好いご気性ですと云っては、嬉しそうにおれの顔を眺（なが）めている。自分の力でおれを製造して誇（ほこ）ってるように見える。少々気味がわるかった。

母が死んでから清はいよいよおれを可愛がった。時々は小供心になぜあんなに可愛がるのかと不審に思った。つまらない、廃（よ）せばいいのにと思った。気の毒だと思った。それでも清は可愛がる。折々は自分の小遣（こづか）いで金鍔（きんつば）や紅梅焼（こうばいやき）を買ってくれる。寒い夜などはひそかに蕎麦粉（そばこ）を仕入れておいて、いつの間にか寝（ね）ている枕元（まくらもと）へ蕎麦湯を持って来てくれる。時には鍋焼饂飩（なべやきうどん）さえ買ってくれた。ただ食い物ばかりではない。靴足袋（くつたび）ももらった。鉛筆（えんぴつ）も貰った、帳面も貰った。これはずっと後の事であるが金を三円ばかり貸してくれた事さえある。何も貸せと云った訳ではない。向うで部屋へ持って来てお小遣いがなくてお困りでしょう、お使いなさいと云ってくれたんだ。おれは無論入らないと云ったが、是非使えと云うから、借りておいた。実は大変嬉しかった。その三円を蝦蟇口（がまぐち）へ入れて、懐（ふところ）へ入れたなり便所へ行ったら、すぽりと後架（こうか）の中へ落（おと）してしまった。仕方がないから、のそのそ出てきて実はこれこれだと清に話したところが、清は早速竹の棒を捜（さが）して来て、取って上げますと云った。しばらくすると井戸端（いどばた）でざあざあ音がするから、出てみたら竹の先へ蝦蟇口の紐（ひも）を引き懸（か）けたのを水で洗っていた。それから口をあけて壱円札（いちえんさつ）を改めたら茶色になって模様が消えかかっていた。清は火鉢で乾（かわ）かして、これでいいでしょうと出した。ちょっとかいでみて臭（くさ）いやと云ったら、それじゃお出しなさい、取り換（か）えて来て上げますからと、どこでどう胡魔化（ごまか）したか札の代りに銀貨を三円持って来た。この三円は何に使ったか忘れてしまった。今に返すよと云ったぎり、返さない。今となっては十倍にして返してやりたくても返せない。

清が物をくれる時には必ずおやじも兄も居ない時に限る。おれは何が嫌いだと云って人に隠れて自分だけ得をするほど嫌いな事はない。兄とは無論仲がよくないけれども、兄に隠して清から菓子（かし）や色鉛筆を貰いたくはない。なぜ、おれ一人にくれて、兄さんには遣（や）らないのかと清に聞く事がある。すると清は澄（すま）したものでお兄様（あにいさま）はお父様（とうさま）が買ってお上げなさるから構いませんと云う。これは不公平である。おやじは頑固（がんこ）だけれども、そんな依怙贔負（えこひいき）はせぬ男だ。しかし清の眼から見るとそう見えるのだろう。全く愛に溺（おぼ）れていたに違（ちが）いない。元は身分のあるものでも教育のない婆さんだから仕方がない。単にこればかりではない。贔負目は恐ろしいものだ。清はおれをもって将来立身出世して立派なものになると思い込んでいた。その癖勉強をする兄は色ばかり白くって、とても役には立たないと一人できめてしまった。こんな婆さんに逢（あ）っては叶（かな）わない。自分の好きなものは必ずえらい人物になって、嫌いなひとはきっと落ち振れるものと信じている。おれはその時から別段何になると云う了見（りょうけん）もなかった。しかし清がなるなると云うものだから、やっぱり何かに成れるんだろうと思っていた。今から考えると馬鹿馬鹿（ばかばか）しい。ある時などは清にどんなものになるだろうと聞いてみた事がある。ところが清にも別段の考えもなかったようだ。ただ手車（てぐるま）へ乗って、立派な玄関（げんかん）のある家をこしらえるに相違（そうい）ないと云った。

それから清はおれがうちでも持って独立したら、一所（いっしょ）になる気でいた。どうか置いて下さいと何遍も繰（く）り返して頼んだ。おれも何だかうちが持てるような気がして、うん置いてやると返事だけはしておいた。ところがこの女はなかなか想像の強い女で、あなたはどこがお好き、麹町（こうじまち）ですか麻布（あざぶ）ですか、お庭へぶらんこをおこしらえ遊ばせ、西洋間は一つでたくさんですなどと勝手な計画を独りで並（なら）べていた。その時は家なんか欲しくも何ともなかった。西洋館も日本建（にほんだて）も全く不用であったから、そんなものは欲しくないと、いつでも清に答えた。すると、あなたは欲がすくなくって、心が奇麗だと云ってまた賞めた。清は何と云っても賞めてくれる。

母が死んでから五六年の間はこの状態で暮していた。おやじには叱られる。兄とは喧嘩をする。清には菓子を貰う、時々賞められる。別に望みもない。これでたくさんだと思っていた。ほかの小供も一概（いちがい）にこんなものだろうと思っていた。ただ清が何かにつけて、あなたはお可哀想（かわいそう）だ、不仕合（ふしあわせ）だと無暗に云うものだから、それじゃ可哀想で不仕合せなんだろうと思った。その外に苦になる事は少しもなかった。ただおやじが小遣いをくれないには閉口した。

母が死んでから六年目の正月におやじも卒中で亡くなった。その年の四月におれはある私立の中学校を卒業する。六月に兄は商業学校を卒業した。兄は何とか会社の九州の支店に口があって行（ゆ）かなければならん。おれは東京でまだ学問をしなければならない。兄は家を売って財産を片付けて任地へ出立（しゅったつ）すると云い出した。おれはどうでもするがよかろうと返事をした。どうせ兄の厄介（やっかい）になる気はない。世話をしてくれるにしたところで、喧嘩をするから、向うでも何とか云い出すに極（きま）っている。なまじい保護を受ければこそ、こんな兄に頭を下げなければならない。牛乳配達をしても食ってられると覚悟（かくご）をした。兄はそれから道具屋を呼んで来て、先祖代々の瓦落多（がらくた）を二束三文（にそくさんもん）に売った。家屋敷（いえやしき）はある人の周旋（しゅうせん）である金満家に譲った。この方は大分金になったようだが、詳（くわ）しい事は一向知らぬ。おれは一ヶ月以前から、しばらく前途の方向のつくまで神田の小川町（おがわまち）へ下宿していた。清は十何年居たうちが人手に渡（わた）るのを大いに残念がったが、自分のものでないから、仕様がなかった。あなたがもう少し年をとっていらっしゃれば、ここがご相続が出来ますものをとしきりに口説いていた。もう少し年をとって相続が出来るものなら、今でも相続が出来るはずだ。婆さんは何（なんに）も知らないから年さえ取れば兄の家がもらえると信じている。

兄とおれはかように分れたが、困ったのは清の行く先である。兄は無論連れて行ける身分でなし、清も兄の尻にくっ付いて九州下（くんだ）りまで出掛ける気は毛頭なし、と云ってこの時のおれは四畳半（よじょうはん）の安下宿に籠（こも）って、それすらもいざとなれば直ちに引き払（はら）わねばならぬ始末だ。どうする事も出来ん。清に聞いてみた。どこかへ奉公でもする気かねと云ったらあなたがおうちを持って、奥（おく）さまをお貰いになるまでは、仕方がないから、甥（おい）の厄介になりましょうとようやく決心した返事をした。この甥は裁判所の書記でまず今日には差支（さしつか）えなく暮していたから、今までも清に来るなら来いと二三度勧めたのだが、清はたとい下女奉公はしても年来住み馴（な）れた家（うち）の方がいいと云って応じなかった。しかし今の場合知らぬ屋敷へ奉公易（ほうこうが）えをして入らぬ気兼（きがね）を仕直すより、甥の厄介になる方がましだと思ったのだろう。それにしても早くうちを持ての、妻（さい）を貰えの、来て世話をするのと云う。親身（しんみ）の甥よりも他人のおれの方が好きなのだろう。

九州へ立つ二日前兄が下宿へ来て金を六百円出してこれを資本にして商買（しょうばい）をするなり、学資にして勉強をするなり、どうでも随意（ずいい）に使うがいい、その代りあとは構わないと云った。兄にしては感心なやり方だ、何の六百円ぐらい貰わんでも困りはせんと思ったが、例に似ぬ淡泊（たんばく）な処置が気に入ったから、礼を云って貰っておいた。兄はそれから五十円出してこれをついでに清に渡してくれと云ったから、異議なく引き受けた。二日立って新橋の停車場（ていしゃば）で分れたぎり兄にはその後一遍も逢わない。

おれは六百円の使用法について寝ながら考えた。商買をしたって面倒（めんど）くさくって旨（うま）く出来るものじゃなし、ことに六百円の金で商買らしい商買がやれる訳でもなかろう。よしやれるとしても、今のようじゃ人の前へ出て教育を受けたと威張れないからつまり損になるばかりだ。資本などはどうでもいいから、これを学資にして勉強してやろう。六百円を三に割って一年に二百円ずつ使えば三年間は勉強が出来る。三年間一生懸命にやれば何か出来る。それからどこの学校へはいろうと考えたが、学問は生来（しょうらい）どれもこれも好きでない。ことに語学とか文学とか云うものは真平（まっぴら）ご免（めん）だ。新体詩などと来ては二十行あるうちで一行も分らない。どうせ嫌いなものなら何をやっても同じ事だと思ったが、幸い物理学校の前を通り掛（かか）ったら生徒募集の広告が出ていたから、何も縁だと思って規則書をもらってすぐ入学の手続きをしてしまった。今考えるとこれも親譲りの無鉄砲から起（おこ）った失策だ。

三年間まあ人並（ひとなみ）に勉強はしたが別段たちのいい方でもないから、席順はいつでも下から勘定（かんじょう）する方が便利であった。しかし不思議なもので、三年立ったらとうとう卒業してしまった。自分でも可笑（おか）しいと思ったが苦情を云う訳もないから大人しく卒業しておいた。

卒業してから八日目に校長が呼びに来たから、何か用だろうと思って、出掛けて行ったら、四国辺のある中学校で数学の教師が入る。月給は四十円だが、行ってはどうだという相談である。おれは三年間学問はしたが実を云うと教師になる気も、田舎（いなか）へ行く考えも何もなかった。もっとも教師以外に何をしようと云うあてもなかったから、この相談を受けた時、行きましょうと即席（そくせき）に返事をした。これも親譲りの無鉄砲が祟（たた）ったのである。

引き受けた以上は赴任（ふにん）せねばならぬ。この三年間は四畳半に蟄居（ちっきょ）して小言はただの一度も聞いた事がない。喧嘩もせずに済んだ。おれの生涯のうちでは比較的呑気（ひかくてきのんき）な時節であった。しかしこうなると四畳半も引き払わなければならん。生れてから東京以外に踏み出したのは、同級生と一所に鎌倉（かまくら）へ遠足した時ばかりである。今度は鎌倉どころではない。大変な遠くへ行かねばならぬ。地図で見ると海浜で針の先ほど小さく見える。どうせ碌な所ではあるまい。どんな町で、どんな人が住んでるか分らん。分らんでも困らない。心配にはならぬ。ただ行くばかりである。もっとも少々面倒臭い。

家を畳（たた）んでからも清の所へは折々行った。清の甥というのは存外結構な人である。おれが行（ゆ）くたびに、居（お）りさえすれば、何くれと款待（もて）なしてくれた。清はおれを前へ置いて、いろいろおれの自慢（じまん）を甥に聞かせた。今に学校を卒業すると麹町辺へ屋敷を買って役所へ通うのだなどと吹聴（ふいちょう）した事もある。独りで極（き）めて一人（ひとり）で喋舌（しゃべ）るから、こっちは困（こ）まって顔を赤くした。それも一度や二度ではない。折々おれが小さい時寝小便をした事まで持ち出すには閉口した。甥は何と思って清の自慢を聞いていたか分らぬ。ただ清は昔風（むかしふう）の女だから、自分とおれの関係を封建（ほうけん）時代の主従（しゅじゅう）のように考えていた。自分の主人なら甥のためにも主人に相違ないと合点（がてん）したものらしい。甥こそいい面（つら）の皮だ。

いよいよ約束が極まって、もう立つと云う三日前に清を尋（たず）ねたら、北向きの三畳に風邪（かぜ）を引いて寝ていた。おれの来たのを見て起き直るが早いか、坊（ぼ）っちゃんいつ家（うち）をお持ちなさいますと聞いた。卒業さえすれば金が自然とポッケットの中に湧いて来ると思っている。そんなにえらい人をつらまえて、まだ坊っちゃんと呼ぶのはいよいよ馬鹿気ている。おれは単簡に当分うちは持たない。田舎へ行くんだと云ったら、非常に失望した容子（ようす）で、胡麻塩（ごましお）の鬢（びん）の乱れをしきりに撫（な）でた。あまり気の毒だから「行（ゆ）く事は行くがじき帰る。来年の夏休みにはきっと帰る」と慰（なぐさ）めてやった。それでも妙な顔をしているから「何を見やげに買って来てやろう、何が欲しい」と聞いてみたら「越後（えちご）の笹飴（ささあめ）が食べたい」と云った。越後の笹飴なんて聞いた事もない。第一方角が違う。「おれの行く田舎には笹飴はなさそうだ」と云って聞かしたら「そんなら、どっちの見当です」と聞き返した。「西の方だよ」と云うと「箱根（はこね）のさきですか手前ですか」と問う。随分持てあました。

出立の日には朝から来て、いろいろ世話をやいた。来る途中（とちゅう）小間物屋で買って来た歯磨（はみがき）と楊子（ようじ）と手拭（てぬぐい）をズックの革鞄（かばん）に入れてくれた。そんな物は入らないと云ってもなかなか承知しない。車を並べて停車場へ着いて、プラットフォームの上へ出た時、車へ乗り込んだおれの顔をじっと見て「もうお別れになるかも知れません。随分ご機嫌（きげん）よう」と小さな声で云った。目に涙（なみだ）が一杯（いっぱい）たまっている。おれは泣かなかった。しかしもう少しで泣くところであった。汽車がよっぽど動き出してから、もう大丈夫（だいしょうぶ）だろうと思って、窓から首を出して、振り向いたら、やっぱり立っていた。何だか大変小さく見えた。

This page got added late. It's coming along, but still skeletal at this point. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 20:01, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

Does this page really still need the TODO about the bullet points? The majority have been taken out since the notice was put up, and it looks quite balanced now. [[User:Mjkaye|MJKaye]] 15:31, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

== Matt's thoughts ==

First off, this section seems to really need some pictures. Surely there are some CC-licensed images out there of students working together, or perhaps some screenshots of collaborative software in action. I just wrote a chapter on collaborative writing technologies for Writing Spaces 2. See this link: http://www.parlorpress.com/writingspaces2 (sadly, the link to my chapter is broken ATM, but the one for the whole book is available). Maybe some of that could be integrated here? In any case, it seems like it'd be worthwhile mentioning collaborative software like Google Docs and wikis here. 

The order also seems awry to me. It'd be good to put all the general advice about collaboration in one place. To be really thorough, we might also talk about collaboration at each stage of the writing process--so, how do you collaborate during research, and how is that different than collaborating during drafting or revising? 

Finally, there are lots of good quotes (Lunsford and Ede come to mind) from very successful collaborative writers. It'd be good to see some of them here, at least to follow the pattern laid out in the other chapters. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] ([[User talk:Mattbarton.exe|talk]]) 22:26, 13 January 2011 (UTC)

== Matt H's thoughts ==

	As someone who knows very little about collaborative writing, I found the “What is Collaboration?” section simple and effective.


	The “Communicating Away from Meetings” section seems outdated. It would be better if it mentioned other ways of communicating away from meetings, like on a D2L discussion list (or a general internet forum), via text message, twitter, blogs, etc.


	I agree with Matt B.—some images would liven this page up.

I edited each paragraph, outright deleting some words and lines, and merely moving some sentences and ideas to different paragraphs. It doesn't feel cohesive yet, and it's about three full pages, so I think I could still condense it quite a bit without losing too much meaning.--[[User:Matt.helm|Matt.helm]] ([[User talk:Matt.helm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Matt.helm|contribs]]) 21:28, 3 February 2011 (UTC)

== Faith's thoughts ==

As with other sections, I think what's needed is something that breaks up the text.  Students don't &quot;read&quot; a text book, they scan it,searching for information that's valuable to them.  Looking at a screen with paragraphs of information that run from the left the screen to the right of the screen is dull, certainly, but what's worse, the information becomes difficult to retain.  Images will clearly help, but also text boxes (variously placed on the page) and more work with creative bullet points. I am sure there are many ways to get creative while allowing for ease of access.--[[User:SFaithL|SFaithL]] ([[User talk:SFaithL|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SFaithL|contribs]]) 15:23, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

== Emily's Thoughts ==

I would agree with everything said before me.  

Perhaps combining ideas, would it work to briefly introduce collaboration here while linking it to other sections that mention collaboration (research, peer review, etc)?

== Karl's Thoughts ==

I agree with Matt about the pictures. They would liven up an otherwise deadly-dull page. These long blocks of text have me skimming and my retention level plummets. Bullet points might be a way to streamline yet make key information easier to retain.</text>

      <comment>/* Advantages to Collaboration */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Collaboration?==

During your educational career, and later in your professional career, you will sometimes have to write with other people. Unfortunately, few students learn how to collaborate effectively since most school writing assignments are not collaborative. Outside the classroom, however, people often compose documents collaboratively (even though only a single author may receive credit for the piece). Newspaper reporters, novelists, and magazine writers collaborate extensively with their editors. Scholars collaborate with other scholars to review and add insight to each other's work. Business writers work closely with colleagues, administrators, and consultants to ensure that their work meets the relevant standards. Even poets meet to discuss their ideas and techniques. In short, all kinds of writers collaborate.

This chapter offers some strategies for successful collaboration. It also discusses some of the common pitfalls that can wreck an otherwise promising collaborative opportunity.

==Advantages to Collaboration==
[[File:Collaboration logo.svg|thumb|left|alt=An image of two shaking hands of different races.]] 

Collaborating writers often produce strong documents because they have a greater pool of knowledge from which to draw. No two people have the exact same backgrounds, skills, knowledge bases, or thought processes. When collaborating with your team members, you can compare notes, ask each other questions, and discover how each member can best contribute. For example, perhaps one of your team members has extensive computer skills, while another is especially artistic. While these skills might seem to have little in common, they may actually end up complementing each other, which should allow your team to create a better project than any one person could do alone.

==Disadvantages to Collaboration==
Not everyone loves the idea of group work. Collaboration can take more time than individual writing, since the team will often need to meet to discuss changes or additions. Sometimes the document can become disjointed, especially if the authors have not tried to match their style and tone. Team members can also get pigeonholed into certain roles when they could be helpful in multiple parts of the project. A more common problem is that some team members do more work than others; you may end up picking up the slack for less responsible or motivated classmates or colleagues. More than one collaboration has ended with one or more team members quitting in disgust. 

===Overcoming these Disadvantages===
* Meet early on in your project to decide its direction.
* Devise a way to '''evenly''' split up the work between members.
* Create a time line for when the various sections are due.
* Set up meetings where members can gather and share progress or obstacles.
* Meet near the end of the project to make revisions.

==Conducting Meetings==
[[File:Meeting.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A meeting.]] 

===In order to have a successful meeting=== 
* Create an outline for the meeting.
* Review the outline with members before the actual meeting begins.
* When critiquing a team member's work be diplomatic.
* Smaller meetings with partial attendance can work well when warranted. 
  

===Setting an Agenda=== 

One group member is usually responsible for organizing the agenda. It is important to note that the agenda describes the purpose of the meeting.  Without it, members may become frustrated or question why they are at the meeting in the first place.  The agenda organizer should give all members a copy of the agenda well before the actual meeting takes place.  He or she may need to communicate with the other members to gather ideas for the agenda, which can be done via email before the meeting. Each group member might want to look over the assignment sheet and discuss possible items to add to the agenda. They will want to consider all the stages that need to be accomplished in order to complete the assignment. The person organizing the agenda will record the suggestions and create an agenda (or outline) which can be distributed to the members and used to guide the subsequent meetings. Including a time line can also help keep the group on task. 

'''Sample Agenda'''
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
Meeting Date:

I. Introduction (10 Minutes)
:a. Introduction of agenda and discussion of any assignment related questions 
:b. Review agenda, including timeline 
II. Discuss work completed toward the project (20 Minutes)
:a. Briefly present your work to the group
:b. Respond to members' work
III. Brainstorm future steps toward completion of the project (10 minutes)
:a. Provide suggestions for each group member

VI. Wrap up (5 minutes)
:a. Questions and answers 
:b. Decide on time and place of next meeting

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;



|caption=A sample agenda.}}

===Taking Minutes===
It is important to keep a brief and accurate record of group meetings, with infromation such as:

* Dates
* Attendees
* Discussion Points

At each group meeting, elect one member to record the discussion, or take the meeting minutes. The minutes should be a brief summary of the main points discussed, and will roughly follow the agenda format. A copy of the minutes should be distributed to each member within a day of the meeting. A record of decisions made and tasks assigned can prevent conflicts by keeping team members from playing &quot;the blame game.&quot;

==Communicating Away from Meetings==
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.&quot;|caption=--George Bernard Shaw}}

[[File:0001videoconferencing.PNG|thumb|left|alt=A videoconferencing room.|A videoconferencing room.]] 

There are other ways to communicate with team members when face-to-face meetings are impossible. E-mail allows you to quickly deliver the same message to multiple people, and the recipients can respond at their convenience. The telephone works great if you only have to call a small number of people and deliver a short message. Memos are a lot like e-mail, but will take more effort to send. A fax will also work to communicate information to other group members. All you need to do is decide which form of communication will work best for the respective message.

==Strategies for Effective Collaboration==
The two most important aspects of effective collaboration are discussion and planning. 

If group members participate in active, open discussion, the group will be more likely to share a clear understanding of the assignment. The assignment may be divided up among the group members or all aspects of the assignment may be worked on collaboratively. Open discussion can also help an individual overcome obstacles. For many students, it is easier to tackle obstacles as a team than it is to do so alone. 

It is very important to schedule group meetings when all members are able to attend. Committing to these scheduled times will help the group meet the required deadline in a timely manner. Although it is most useful to meet with the group in person, group meetings can also take place online when meeting in person is impossible.

* Be honest about your abilities. If you know you aren't good at something specific, let your group members know. They'll respect you for your honesty.
* If you're unhappy with the way a project is going, say so. This is your grade and you have a right to let your instructor know when things aren't going the way you think they should.
* Respect your group members.  Everyone has something unique to contribute to the project. You may not agree on everything, but being kind is sometimes the most important ingredient in getting things accomplished.
* Have fun. Although it's homework, this is an opportunity to get to know new people. 
* Be responsible for your part.  Do the work that's expected but don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.

==An Example of Collaborative Work/Group Conferencing==
[[File:Acrobats at Cirque du Soleils Nouvelle Experience Finale 1994.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A female acrobat balancing on top of another.|Acrobats at Cirque du Soleils Nouvelle Experience Finale 1994.]] 

Many students struggle with group/peer editing, and when they are put in small groups and told to help each other with their papers, they have no idea how to do so effectively, usually resulting in a lot of patting one another on the back, fixing a few commas, and then having a long conversation about last night's game. Little constructive work comes from these meetings. Many have created worksheets for students to follow, but these worksheets often invite brief and unhelpful comments. Students, however, can be taught how to do this well by having &quot;group conferences.&quot; A group conference consists of three steps: One, students are put into groups of three, four, or five (four is ideal) and give drafts of their papers to one another, so that each student has a copy of every other student's paper in the group. Two, students read each others' papers and fill out a &quot;group conferencing worksheet,&quot; which is very much like a peer editing worksheet; be sure to only ask open-ended questions. Three, students get together as a group with an experienced writing instructor or tutor who leads them through the worksheet, asking them the questions on the worksheet but making sure that they answer them thoroughly. The key to this is that the instructor or tutor has not read the papers. Because they don't know what the papers are about, how they are organized, how they support their arguments, or even what the purpose of the paper is, they can ask all kinds of probing questions that help the students to not only think critically about the papers they are working on, but also learn what kinds of questions make peer review effective.

If students go through this process with some guidance a couple times, their self-directed peer sessions should be more productive  afterward. Students will learn to think critically about the writing of others as well as their own. Additionally, it is more productive and interesting for students because, unlike a regular one-on-one conference with an instructor, they get the input of several readers.

Hello to the person who edited the Maple wikibooks.
I thought of making this section as a chapter where a newbee can understand how maple works (functions, semicolon, etc.), so i dont beleive that the text you added should be placed in the 1st chapter. Howver, i moved it another chapter where more advanced functionalities of Maple are shown.
Thanks

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Carthage location.png|right|frame|The red dot is where Carthage was located]]
Carthage was a small nation, first only it was a city state , founded in 814 BC. It grew prosperous by all the trade that flowed through the tiny nation. However at around 146 BC. Carthage was taken by Rome.
==What country did they live in?==
Carthage was located in northern Africa, in current day Tunisia. It was an imperial power that controlled at one point most of northern Africa and even had some colonies in preset day Spain.  However they often fought with Rome for land in Sicily and Sardinia, islands near Italy.  These fights were also known as the Punic Wars. Carthage was a country full of seafaring people, and they established settlements in western Africa and in the Mediterranean Sea, their fleet being the largest in the west Mediterranean.

==What did their buildings look like?==
The buildings in Carthage are similar to buildings in Greece and Rome. Major public buildings were made of stone and had large columns. Meanwhile common people lived in small houses made of brick or wood. We do not have Carthaginian buildings standing today because the Romans destroyed the city. We can guess at what they might have looked like by comparing Greek and Roman examples.

==What did they eat?==
People of Carthage eat food similar to that of the people there today, like dates, figs, bread, and meat from sheep and cows.

==What did they wear?==
For woman the chiton is a common sleeved tunic. It is two pieces of cloth which are sewn together, leaving room for the arms and head. Married woman wore a stola, which was a long, sleeveless tunic, which would be worn over the chiton. When going outdoors a palla could be worn over these garments. Woman of the upper class wore jewellery.

==What did their writing look like?==

The Phoenicians adopted an early Canaanite linear script in the Middle Bronze Age (2000-1500 BC). Over the centuries this evolved into numerous other scripts such as Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic and Greek. The Phoenician language evolved from the local dialects of the cities of Tyre and Sidon. The colonization of the Mediterranean spread the language as far West as North Africa and Southern Spain where it became known as Punic. This was adopted as the official language of the Carthaginian Empire.

==What did they believe?==

==What is their history?==

Carthage was founded around 800 BC at what is now Tunisia. It was originally a part of the Phoenician Empire, which was based in Lebanon. When the empire was invaded, Carthage remained safe and became a powerful nation of its own. The skills of sailing and exploration that they had got from their Phoenician relatives helped them to trade and expand their lands. They settled in Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Spain and Portugal. Carthage was one of the major powers of the Mediterranean Sea.

During the 5th and 4th Centuries BC they fought against the Greeks for control of Sicily and its trade. In the 3rd Century BC they started fighting with Rome, which was getting powerful as well.

The First Punic War was fought between Carthage and Rome to decide who would control Sicily. It took place from 264 - 261 BC. The Romans were not great sailors, but somehow, they beat the Carthaginians three times in a sea battle. In 261 BC the Carthaginians Surrendered. They lost Sicily, along with Sardinia and Corsica.

The Second Punic War was fought between 218 - 201 BC. This was the war that the great general Hannibal was famed for - he nearly defeated Rome. Hannibal marched from Spain to get to Italy over the Alps with his elephants. He defeated many Roman armies, but he could not take Rome itself. Eventually the Romans attacked Spain and Carthage itself to distract Hannibal. Hannibal was ordered to come back to Carthage to help against the Romans at the Battle of Zama. Hannibal was killed in Action and the battle ended up as a Roman victory. Carthage had to pay a lot of money to Rome and promise to recognise Rome as the greatest power. It also lost its empire in Spain and Portugal and its army was made very small.

The Third Punic War was fought in 150 BC. Carthage had recovered and attacked Numidia - a Roman land. This time, Rome invaded Carthage and totally destroyed the city so that it would never cause trouble again.

==Are some of them famous even today?==

Hannibal is by far the most famous Carthaginian. He led an almost successful invasion of the then very powerful Rome, attacking them in Spain and Northern Italy, but eventually failed. Hannibal is often connected with elephants because he used elephants against Roman Troops, however most died while crossing the Alps on the way to Rome.

Another famous Carthaginian, although from mythology, is Queen Dido. She was the ruler of Carthage when Aeneas, who had escaped from the Greek attack of Troy, landed in her kingdom. She loved Aeneas, but he needed to find Italy where he would set up the capital of the future Romans. Dido killed herself when Aeneas left Carthage.

==What is left of them today?==

Carthage was eventually destroyed in the Third Punic War.  Carthage was seized by Rome and its land was &quot;sown with salt, so that nothing could ever grow there again.&quot;  They were the bitter enemies of the Romans and had fought over power in the Mediterranean and over islands like Sicily. Hannibal nearly destroyed the Roman Empire and in revenge the Romans totally destroyed Carthage so no threat would ever appear again. Carthaginian civilization was ended with the conquest by Rome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What country did they live in?==
The Sinhala lived in Sri Lanka, an island in the Indian ocean just south of the Indian peninsula. The people are descendents of both the indigenous people who migrated from India and other migrants who have come from all over the world.

3rd century BC -  World's largest brick structures at the time close to 400 feet in height.  World's 2nd largest overall strutures at the time second only to pyramids.

Axially planned, brick court yard buildings with wooden and stone columns and clay tile roofs.

==What did their buildings look like?==
Those big builidings were in respect of Gautama Buddha who is the founder of Buddhism cause Sri Lanka is the only country practising Heenayana buddhism mainly differ in practising methods as well as some other rituals. During the kingdom of Anuradhapura time, those big mounaments were erected. A king named Dutugemunu was in back of building the great structure, called &quot;stupa&quot; in the name of Gautama Buddha.

==What did they eat?==

Mainly they ate rice and curry.

==What did they wear?==

Sinhala women wore a sort of blouse. They wore dhotis which were long cloths worn from their waist down. The men wore a sarong which was on the lower part of their body. The upper-class women covered everything. All the women were heavily bejewelled. Lower-class women wore a breast-band and the cloth cannot go below their knees. It was fashion for all women to wear a row of pearls on their breast. They wore bracelets and rings around their fingers and toes. They could have been made of glass. They wore earrings also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/rit/dress.htm|title=Lanka Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What did they believe?==
They are mainly Buddhists.

Most of the Sinhalese follow the Theravada school of Buddhism. In 1988 almost 93% of the Sinhalese speaking population in Sri Lanka were Buddhist. Buddhists include various religious elements from Hinduism in their religious practices and ancient traditions of godlings and demons, which are native to the island. Sinhalese Buddhists worship Hindu gods such as Vishnu, who has a special place in their religious practices, since he is entrusted with both protecting Buddhism in the island and the island itself. He is also recognised as bodhisattva, or &quot;awakening being&quot; to Sinhalese Buddhists.

There is also a significant Sinhalese Christian community, in the seafaring provinces of Sri Lanka. Christianity was brought to the Sinhalese by Portuguese, Dutch, and British missionary groups during their periods of rule. Sinhalese Christians mainly follow Roman Catholicism, followed by Protestantism. Their cultural centre is Negombo.

==What did their writing look like?==

The writing differed from time to time as any of the other scripts in Asia. The Sinhala script began as an offshoot from Brahmi and is found in the southern branch of this family, sharing a common root with scripts such as Malayalam, and Tamil. The writing system was originally used in inscriptions, the oldest ones dating from the 6th century BCE on pottery[, with lithic inscriptions dating from the second century B.C. By the ninth century C.E., literature written in Sinhala script had emerged and the script began to be used in other contexts. For instance, the Buddhist literature of the Theravada-Buddhists of Sri Lanka, written in Pali, used the Sinhala alphabet.

Today, the alphabet is used by about 16,000,000 people to write the Sinhalese language in very diverse contexts, such as newspapers, TV commercials, government announcements, graffiti, and schoolbooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thermal physics deals with the changes that occur in substances when there is a change in temperature.

==Internal energy==

When you heat up a material, it may change state. The molecules vibrate with a greater amplitude, and break apart from one another. The material has been supplied with energy and you can feel it getting hotter. The increased kinetic and potential (from their greater separation) energy of the particles is an increase in what we call '''internal energy'''. Internal energy is defined as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The internal energy of a system is the sum of the randomly distributed kinetic and potential energies of its molecules.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore, an increase in temperature for a material means an increase in its internal energy.

==The thermodynamic temperature scale==
The Celsius scale of temperature depends on the properties of water. 0°C is the freezing point of water, and 100°C is the boiling point of water. It is a relative scale, because it is relative to the freezing and boiling points of water. The '''thermodynamic scale of temperature''' (represented by the letter ''T''), however, is an absolute scale of temperuture, and does not depend on the properties of any particular substance. It is also directly proportional to the amount of internal energy a substance possesses. 

===Absolute zero===

This scale of temperature is defined in terms of internal energy, and is measured in kelvins (K). 0K is defined as the temperature at which a substance will have minimum internal energy, and is the lowest possible temperature. This temperature is known as '''absolute zero'''. It is at this point at which molecule stop vibrating and electrons stop spinning and orbiting.

===Converting between K and °C===

The divisions of the kelvin scale are identical to the divisions of the Celsius scale, so that an increase of 1°C is equal to an increase of 1K. This makes it simple to convert between the two, and if you know that absolute zero is -273.15°C, you can simply use the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;K = \ ^\circ C + 273.15&lt;/math&gt;

to convert between °C and K.

==Heating up substances==
When you apply heat to a substance, the temperature does not simply increase in a straight line. Some extra energy is required to break bonds between particles.
===Energy and temperature changes===

If we were to heat a block of ice at a steady rate and plot a graph of the temperature against time, we would get the following graph:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Temperature-time graph for water.png|400px]]&lt;/center&gt;

This shape is rather surprising. You would expect the line to increase in a straight line, with none of the breaks that you can see above. We should consider what is happening to the molecules of the water at each section of the graph to understand why this is so:

*'''AB'''
:The ice is below freezing point, but the temperature is increasing. The molecules are vibrating slowly, but begin to vibrate more.
*'''BC'''
:At 273K (0°C) the ice is at melting point. The bonds between molecules are being broken and molecules have greater potential energy. This is the Latent Heat of Fusion
*'''CD'''
:The water now increases in temperature towards boiling point. The molecules vibrate even more and move around rapidly as their kinetic energy increases.
*'''DE'''
:At 373K (100°C) the water is now at boiling point. Molecules completely break away from each other and their potential energy increases. DE is much larger than BC because ALL bonds need to be broken for a gas to form. (The Latent Heat of Vapourisation.)
*'''EF'''
:The water is now steam and the molecules are moving around much faster than before. Their kinetic energy continues to increase as energy is supplied.

At the sections BC and DE, where there is a change of state, the molcules do not increase in kinetic energy, but increase in potential energy. The heat energy being supplied does not change the temperature at these sections, but is instead used to break the bonds between molecules.

===Specific heat capacity===

Some materials will heat up quicker than others. For example, metals are good conductors of heat, and provided they are the same mass and that the energy is supplied at the same rate, copper will increase in temperature quicker than water.

The '''specific heat capacity''' can tell us how much energy is required to increase the temperature of a substance, and is defined as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The specific heat capacity of a substance is numerically equal to the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1kg of the substance by 1K (or by 1°C).
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This can be represented as:

&lt;math&gt;C=\frac { Q }{ m\Delta t } &lt;/math&gt;

Or rewritten,

:&lt;math&gt; { Q } = m C \Delta T&lt;/math&gt; 

Where &lt;math&gt;{ Q }&lt;/math&gt; is the energy supplied, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the substance, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat capacity, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the change in temperature

===Measuring the specific heat capacity===

To find the specific heat capacity of something, we can control all of the possible variables and then use them to calculate it. From the equation above, we can see that &lt;math&gt;c = \frac {Q}{m \Delta T}&lt;/math&gt;. This means that if we can supply a known amount of energy to a material of known mass, and measure the change in temperature, we can insert the values into the equation and obtain the specific heat capacity.

To supply a known amount of energy, we can use an electric heater. You may recall that electrical energy can be found by &lt;math&gt;E = IVt&lt;/math&gt;, so by measuring the voltage, the current and the time that the circuit is switched on, we will have a value for the energy supplied to the material.

In the same time period that the circuit is switched on, we must take measurments for the change in temperature. An ordinary mercury thermometer may be used, although it is recommend to use a temperature sensor with a computer to make more precise and accurate measurements.

Once we have taken readings of the temperature and energy at regular intervals of time, we can plot a graph of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; against &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;. We can calculate the gradient, making sure to use as much of the line in our calculation as possible, and divide it by the mass of the material to obtain the value of the materials specific heat capacity.

===Specific latent heat===

When you heat up a substance so that it changes state, the temperature stays the same during the change. Different substances will require more energy to change state than others. The '''specific latent heat''' will tell us how much energy a substance requires to change state and is defined as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The specific latent heat of a substance is numerically equal to the energy that must be supplied to change the state of 1kg of the substance without any change in temperature.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This can be written as the equation:

&lt;math&gt;{ L}=\frac { Q }{m} &lt;/math&gt;

Or, rewritten,

:&lt;math&gt;Q = m L&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the energy supplied, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the substance, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the specific latent heat.

==The gas laws==
There are four properties of a gas, that are related to each other. These properties are the pressure, the temperature, the volume and the mass of the gas, and these relationships are expressed as the gas laws.

===Boyle's law===

Boyle's law relates the pressure of a gas to its volume. Specifically, it states that:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The pressure of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume, provided that the temperature remains constant.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;p \propto \frac{1}{V}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;pV = constant&lt;/math&gt;.

You can picture this at the molecular level, if you were to imagine the number of collisions the particles of a gas make with the container of a particular size, and then imagine the increased number of collisions when the container is reduced in size but the number of particles remain the same. This is observed as an increase in pressure of the gas.
===Charles' law===

Charles' law relates the volume of a gas with its temperature on the thermodynamic temperature scale, and that:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure is proportional to its temperature on the thermodynamic temperature scale.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;V \propto T&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac {V}{T} = constant&lt;/math&gt;.

It is a little more difficult to understand why this is the case, because a gas will always take up the entire volume of its container. If you think about how a particle behaves when it is heated up, it will vibrate more and cause an increase in pressure, or harder and faster collisions of the molecules against the container. However, since pressure is to be kept constant in this case, the volume of the container will need to increase. Therefore by increasing the temperature of the gas, we have increased its volume.

===Pressure law===
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The pressure of a fixed mass of gas at constant volume is proportional to its thermodynamic temperature.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;p \propto T&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac {p}{T} = constant&lt;/math&gt;.

===Equation for an Ideal Gas===

&lt;math&gt;pV = nRT&lt;/math&gt;


n is the number of moles of gas,

R is the Ideal Gas Constant, R = 8.3144621 ≈ 8.31 J/(mol･K)

T is the ABSOLUTE temperature,

p is the Pressure in Pascal,

V is the Volume in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Properties of an Ideal Gas===

1) Its particles should be monatomic

2) The particles are infinitely small

3) There are no bonds between the particles, hence all the energy is kinetic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Definitive timescales are in doubt and dispute. Further it is not relevant to learning process for the audience intended in this subject.  Unsubstantiated conjecture should not be part of the learning process.

:Excuse me, but can you be specific about what you think is in dispute?  If you can provide scientific references contradicting anything here then it will certainly be taken into consideration.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 21:08, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

::Time scales are not unsubstantiated.  Actual bone is left from many pleistocene mammals and that bone can be dated precisely with Carbon 14.  Older materials are dated using stratigraphic analysis.  The more precise way to categorize these fossil cats is to use &quot;faunas&quot; rather than periods.  The entire Earth did not change abruptly at the end of worldwide periods, rather it changed in individual fauna groups which do not neatly line up with periods.  Matter of factly, I used to be a taxonomist back in the way backs.  It is truly amazing what can be done using well-tested and carefully conducted techniques.

:::Yes, but I get the feeling that our friend here doesn't understand this.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 02:17, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== Carnivorous/Carnivore distinction ==

It is worth remembering that although meat-eating is a characteristic of all Carnivora (even the giant panda eats meat if it gets the chance), not all meat-eating mammals (insectivores, cetaceans, and great apes) are members of this order. I have tinkered with the introduction to exclude such creatures as shrews, chimpanzees, dolphins, and whales as Carnivora even if they are adept hunters. It's also worth remembering that many of the Carnivora are not cats even if they have some very cat-like (especially Big Cat) behavior. Who hasn't seen cat-like behavior and physique among dogs?    ∼∼∼∼ 

== Illustrations ==

I really like the idea of this as part of the Big Cats book.  Unfortunately we're scant on illustrations.  I added the cave lion painting, but the only other thing we have pictures of are saber-toothed tigers at [[commons:Smilodon]] (couldn't find any usable flickr museum pictures).  I rather like [[: Image:Smilodon californicus.jpg]], but if skeletons are judged inappropriate [[: Image:Smilodon.jpg]] could work.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 21:06, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

While a run-on sentence, also known as a fused sentence, might just seem to be the type of sentence that goes on and on without a clear point, the technical grammatical definition of a run-on sentence is one that fuses, or &quot;runs together,&quot; two or more independent clauses (basically, clauses that express a complete thought and could stand on their own as full sentences) without punctuation to separate them. They may have nothing between them, or they may have a coordinating conjunction (and, or, nor, but, for, so yet) between them but not the comma that needs to accompany the coordinating conjunction when separating two independent clauses.

You can often find run-on sentences in your work by reading it aloud. The run-on sentences will trip you up: you'll want to pause or otherwise come to some sort of end when you hit the end of an independent clause, but a run-on, with its lack of punctuation, doesn't signal you to do that. Try reading the following examples of run-on sentences out loud, and notice where two clauses seem to collide:

==Examples of run-on sentences==
* ''Every day, millions of children go to daycare with millions of other kids there is no guarantee that none of them are harboring infectious conditions.''
* ''Many daycare centers have strict rules about sick children needing to stay away until they are no longer infectious but enforcing those rules can be very difficult.''
* ''Daycare providers often undergo extreme pressure to accept a sick child &quot;just this once&quot; the parent has no other care options and cannot miss work.''

==Fixing run-on sentences==
Once you find a run-on sentence and notice where the two independent clauses &quot;collide,&quot; you can then decide on how best to separate the clauses:
* You can make two complete sentences by inserting a period; this is the strongest level of separation.
* You can use a semicolon between the two clauses if they are of equal importance, and you want your reader to consider the points together.
* You can use a semicolon with a transition word to indicate a specific relation between the two clauses.
* You can use a coordinating conjunction and a comma, also to indicate a relationship.
* Or, you can add a word to one clause to make it dependent.

==Examples of fixed run-on sentences==
Notice how the sentences above have been punctuated in the following examples.

* ''Every day, millions of children go to daycare with millions of other '''kids. There''' is no guarantee that none of them are harboring infectious conditions.''
* ''Many daycare centers have strict rules about sick children needing to stay away until they are no longer '''infectious; however''', enforcing those rules can be very difficult.''
* ''Many daycare centers have strict rules about sick children needing to stay away until they are no longer '''infectious, but''' enforcing those rules can be very difficult.''
* ''Daycare providers often undergo extreme pressure to accept a sick child &quot;just this once&quot; '''because''' the parent has no other care options and cannot miss work.''

&lt;b&gt; ^, &lt;/b&gt; (insert comma) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

When you begin a sentence with a word or group of words that provides some background, introductory, or otherwise preliminary information, put a comma between this word or phrase and the rest of your sentence. The comma here tells your reader to pause, take the background information into consideration, and get ready to move on to the main part of the sentence.

To help you recognize places in your sentences where you are missing commas after introductory clauses, read your writing out loud. Chances are good you'll naturally pause after introductory phrases. You can also check the beginning of each sentence to look for words or phrases that add information about time, place, or manner or for words that serve as transitions; these are all common introductory elements. 

&lt;b&gt; EXAMPLES &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">As I see it, everything begins with communication.  If you can communicate, you win because people listen to you since you know how to say what you want to speak about.  

How do you get something valuable to say (the content of your discussions)?  Start by thinking about a topic - any topic.  Read, study, participate through letters to the editor, on-line discussions, even get out there and volunteer and/or put out more effort at work than the next person.  This will get you to act and BE the leader you can become so you can contribute better.  

By learning to communicate, well, you become the best you can be.  Of course, one must gain Subject knowledge in tandem with the development of communication skills (written and verbal).  

You will find that the second topic you speak about is easier since the skills you learned on communication are transferrable.  And so on.  In no time you become confidently verbose, loquacious and even erudite while others see you as the sagacious one you secretly are!

==Winemaking at home==
Until the early 20th century, most wine drinkers produced their own wines at home out of necessity; the average bottle of commercial wine could cost up to a month's wages for a farmer or factory hand. As can be imagined, the quality of these homemade wines was uneven and the alcohol content sometimes greater than would be expected.

In the last thirty years, however, the task of home winemaking has become easier and results more predictable. Nearly every good-sized city in North America and Western Europe has at least one shop catering to home brewers and winemakers. Kits make it possible to produce decent table wine at a fraction of the cost of the cheapest wine in the liquor store.

Making wine at home isn't necessarily easy. There's a lot of work involved, especially in cleaning and sanitizing, but the sense of accomplishment the winemaker can get from producing 30 bottles of extremely drinkable white wine for less than $2 a bottle cannot be overstated.

===Required equipment===


[[Image:Airlock2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Plastic airlock for fermentation]]

[[Image:Gärröhrchen.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Glass airlock for fermentation]]

Although one could theoretically make wine with nothing more than grapes, a big barrel and some young maidens to stomp the grapes, most winemakers find the following equipment necessary to produce decent wine on a predictable basis:
* A 30-litre or larger food-grade plastic container (similar in shape to a garbage can) with a non-airtight lid and a mark at the 23-litre point
* A 23-litre glass or food-grade plastic [[w:carboy|carboy]] (demijhon)
* An [[w:airlock|airlock]] and bung (a rubber stopper with a hole in it) for the carboy
* A [[w:hydrometer|hydrometer]] to check the specific gravity (sp. gr.) of the wine
* A long, narrow tube or jar to hold the wine while you're checking its specific gravity (generally the tube the hydrometer comes in works fine)
* A dairy thermometer
* A long piece (at least 1.5m or five feet) of food-grade plastic tubing
* A long spoon that can fit into the neck of the carboy and reach to the bottom
* A [[w:wine thief|wine thief]] to remove the developing wine from the carboy without having to tip it

It is '''essential''' that any plastic items that are in contact with the wine be made of food-grade plastic. Regular plastic will leach [[w:polymer|polymer]]s into the wine, which will give it an odd plastic taste.

These items will last forever and most wine stores stock a reasonably priced starting kit. If you decide to brew [[w:beer|beer]] as well, you can use most of this equipment, but you will need a separate 30-liter plastic container (the taste of the wine will remain in the plastic) and you should make sure your carboy is glass.

===Ingredients===
For every batch, you will also need the following:
* Something to ferment. Generally, that means grape juice, but wine has been made from almost all fruits, especially crabapples and elderberries. Winemaking stores sell kits containing eight to thirteen liters of concentrated grape juice varieties such as Riesling, Merlot and Chardonnay. If you are not into a specific variety, you can use unpasteurized grape juice, but it tends to be more expensive and your results might not be as predictable.
* Good quality water. Generally this means filtered water. Heavily chlorinated can skunk your wine.
* Wine yeast. The type of yeast you use will affect the flavor of the finished wine. Bread yeast can be used in a pinch (say, if you're making wine behind enemy lines during a war), but generally if you're not in dire circumstances you want to use a wine yeast tailored for the type of grape or other fruit you're using.
* Something to settle the wine. You can use sterilized bentonite, isinglass, or (in a pinch) egg whites. The first two are readily available at any winemaking store.
* Something to stop fermentation. You can use a little pure ascorbic acid (Vitamin C, but ''do not'' use vitamin pills containing sugar or flavoring), or you can buy a packet of potassium sorbate at the wine store.
* Bottles and corks. You can reuse bottles, and unless you are making champagne, it does not really matter what type of bottle you use as long as you get it clean. The best way to do this is to remove any residue in the bottles, soak them in water with strong detergent to remove the labels and the glue, wash them again in new water and detergent, rinse well, and sanitize. New bottles are also available at a reasonable price and can be reused indefinitely. You will need 30 bottles for a standard 23-liter recipe. Both natural and synthetic corks work well (although the natural is cheaper); you will need longer corks if you plan to keep the wine for longer than six months.
* Sodium metabisulfite for sanitizing. '''Warning &amp;mdash; Do NOT use this under any circumstance if you or anybody in your family has a sufite allergy or sensitivity. Use iodophor or bleach instead.''' You must sanitize if you do not want your wine to turn out as vinegar. Sodium metabisulfite is the most convenient form of sanitizing. If you must use iodophor, follow the instructions on the label and rinse well. If you use bleach, soak your items for 10 minutes in a 5% bleach dilution, and then rinse at least six times thoroughly. Sodium metabisulfite is perfectly safe for the average person, but it can cause a serious reaction in asthmatics, so heed the warning.
* Detergent. Dish detergent is probably not strong enough. Wine stores sell strong, unscented detergents that do a better job at removing labels, old smells, etc.

===Making the wine===
The process of actually making the wine is simple but somewhat tedious. Kit wines must be prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Otherwise, the following are good rules:
* Make sure the area in which you are making your wine is at a stable temperature below 23C or 75F. At higher temperatures, the chances of your wine turning into vinegar are increased.
* Clean and sanitize everything just before it touches the wine. That includes any funnels, cups, bowls and other items. If you have to use them on two consecutive days, clean and sanitize before every use. A good yeast will outgrow the odd bacterium that gets in, but the sloppier you are the more likely something like [[w:acetobacter|acetobacter]] is going to get in and turn your wine to vinegar.
* Pour your juice into the large plastic container. If you are using a concentrate, top up with filtered water to 23 liters. You want the finished product to be between 65 and 75 F or 18 to 23 C. Test with your sanitized dairy thermometer when you're up to 20 liters, and add hot or cold juice or water at the end to adjust the temperature.
* Stir vigorously.
* Add yeast.
* Check your specific gravity by putting the sanitized hydrometer right in the container. It should show a specific gravity of 1.010 or greater. If it is less, you probably want to add a bit of sugar syrup and stir, then check again. Remove the hydrometer.
* Put the lid on. Cover the container with a big plastic sheet and tie it closed with some string or twine around the middle of the container.
* In a day or two, your wine should be bubbling away. Soon after that the yeast will drop to the bottom of the container and you will not see it working, but it will still be fermenting.
* After a week, clean and sanitize the carboy, the bung, the airlock and the plastic tubing. Siphon the wine into the carboy. Leave out as much of the sedimentation on the very bottom as you can. Attach the bung and the airlock, making sure to fill the airlock halfway with water. 
* Cover the carboy with a dark, clean, thin sheet if you are doing this in an area where light can get to it.
* Wait ten days and check the specific gravity. The best way to do this is to use the wine thief to transfer a little wine from the carboy to the measuring tube (the one the hydrometer came in), then use the hydrometer to check the specific gravity. If you started out at 1.010, you are looking for a specific gravity of 0.998 or lower. Check this once a day until the specific gravity is the same on two separate days.
* Remove the bung and airlock and add whatever you are using to stop fermentation and to encourage settling. Stir for five minutes straight. Make sure to stir up all the sedimentation on the bottom. Replace the bung and the airlock.
* Fourteen days later, clean and sanitize your bottles and your tubing. Siphon the wine into the bottles and cork them. You can buy a corking machine, or you can rent or borrow one from your friendly wine store - many stores lend them free of charge to their customers. Most corks are sold pre-sanitized, but you can soak them in a sulfite solution if you cannot buy them already prepared.
* Let the bottles sit upright for three days, then let them sit on their side for at least a month. If you have made red wine, you should leave it for a year. If you do hold wine for over six months, you may wish to add a bit of sulfite to prevent discoloration, unless, of course, someone in the house has sulfite allergy or sensitivity.

frag &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;i&gt; Sentence fragments. Might sound good at first! More trustworthy. Because they're simple. Not trying to complicate things. Like when a sentenc goes on and on. Making you lose track of the ideas. Not like straight talk. &lt;/i&gt;

We use fragments constantly when talking, emailing, IMing: They save time and space and sound &quot;natural.&quot; Advertisements frequently use them to draw attention to key concepts. In academic writing, however, all but the most occasional use of fragments is considered inappropriate: too folksy, too speech-like and colloquial.

There are a number of grammar-technical ways to recognize fragments, but &lt;b&gt; the best way to find them in your writing is to read your work out loud. &lt;/b&gt; Listen for any sentences that may end in a period or other end punctuation but seem to leave you hanging, as if you want to say, &quot;Well ... ? Now what? Go on, finish it up!&quot; The end punctuation may tell you to express &quot;ending&quot; (our voice usually falls when we're reading out loud and get to a period), but the thought won't be finished.

Try reading the following paragraph out loud and seeing if you can pick out the fragments -- that is, the sentences that seem to leave you hanging.

::: &lt;i&gt; Getting published is simultaneously one of the most exhilarating and taxing goals writers writers can set for themselves. Calling for equal parts patience and persistence. It is often a team effort among several players. Such as, the writer, perhaps an agent, friends and peers who will edit and respond to the work, and previously published writers who can provide advice. Another tension writers must negotiate when pursuing publication is audience appeal and personal integrity to one's work. What is often called &quot;being true to oneself.&quot; Because getting published calls on writers to be flexible yet unique at the same time.&lt;/i&gt;    


As you can see in the revised version below, &lt;b&gt;fixing fragments&lt;/b&gt; is usually a matter of 
* hooking up the fragment to the sentence before or after it (whichever one it seems to relate to), often using a comma, colon, or em dash; 
* adding the missing actor (noun) or action (verb); or
* fleshing out the thought to express what was previously not &quot;spelled out.&quot;

Another tension writers must negotiate when pursuing publication is audience appeal and personal integrity to one's &lt;b&gt;work: what&lt;/b&gt; is often called &quot;being true to oneself.&quot; Because getting published calls on writers to be flexible yet unique at the same &lt;b&gt;time, it can be the most challenging yet most rewarding experience writers undertake. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subject agreement is that the agreement of subjects and verbs

==Examples==
* '''Singular''': ''The '''whale''', which doesn’t mature sexually until six or seven years old and which has only one calf per year, '''is''' at risk for extinction because '''it reproduces''' so slowly.''
* '''Plural: ''During election season, several civic '''groups sponsor''' public debates in which '''candidates present''' their views and audience '''members ask''' questions.''
* '''Singular''': '''''Digging''' a few inches into the dunes, even at 750 feet above the valley floor, '''reveals''' wet sand.''
* '''Plural''': ''The '''dunes comprise''' small '''rocks''' and dry, sandy '''soil''' that constantly '''form''' strange designs under the ever-present wind.''

==What is subject-verb agreement?==
Subject-verb agreement is something most native speakers know pretty automatically, but we can make mistakes when writing, especially when several words separate a particular subject and verb. As you can see in the following examples, “of” phrases can be misleading, too. The trick is to find the “root” noun: the one actually performing the action of the verb. There are two easy ways to spot the subject of a sentence: 1) Find the verb and ask the question, &quot;Who or what is performing this act?&quot; 2) Cross out all prepositional phrases. These simply tasks should lead you right to the subject of the sentence.

==Examples==
* '''''Characteristics''' of the middle child often '''include''' an equitable temperament and high feelings of security and self-esteem.''
* ''The opportunity '''cost''' of loaning out the funds '''is''' usually reflected in the interest rate.''
* ''A certain '''percentage''' of the cars produced by major manufacturers '''meets''' stricter emission standards in order for the company to sell their products in regulated regions.''

==Other guidelines==
Other guidelines for making subjects and verbs agree include:
* Noncount nouns — those that don’t have a singular or plural form, such as ''furniture, baggage, poetry, melancholy'' — take a singular verb. 
* Two or more singular nouns joined by an “and” take a plural verb: ''A timely, relevant '''topic''' and an '''environment''' of trust '''produce''' a good class discussion.''
* When two nouns differing in number are joined by “or,” the verb should take the form of the noun closest to it: ''Most viewers of the painting assume that either the monkey’s '''antics''' or the handler’s '''chagrin''' causes the young men’s laughter.''

If you struggle with problems in subject-verb agreement, leave time to edit your paper once through just for that error: go through each sentence, underlining each subject and verb pair and checking that they agree.

&lt;b&gt; agr &lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt; n-p agr &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Rules==

Pronouns (words such as ''it'', ''her'', ''them'', ''this'', ''someone'', ''who'', ''him'', ''they'', ''themselves'', ''herself'', etc.) replace specific nouns (persons, places, or things) so you don't have to keep repeating them. Like subjects and verbs, pronouns and nouns need to agree in &quot;'''number'''&quot;: in whether they are singular or plural. They also need to agree in '''gender''': masculine, feminine, or inclusive (both).

Errors in noun-pronoun agreement usually simply result from writing quickly and not editing closely enough. Three specific instances, though, can cause problems:
# The nouns ''each'', and ''one'' are all singular and take singular pronouns; ''either'' or ''neither'' is singular unless it specifically refers to plural alternatives.
# When using singular nouns that refer to both sexes or for which the gender is not known, use both masculine and feminine pronouns together (''him or her, he or she, himself or herself, his or her'') or rewrite the sentence to make the noun and the pronoun both plural. (If all of the members of a group are of one gender, it is acceptable to use the male or female pronoun, as in &quot;Each member of the football team will take '''his''' gear onto the bus.&quot;)    
# Some nouns can be either singular or plural: ''audience'', ''group'', ''team'', ''unit'', ''class'', and others. Use a singular pronoun if the group is acting as a unit, as in &quot;The audience expressed its appreciation with loud applause.&quot; Use a plural pronoun if the group is acting as individual members, as in &quot;The team went their separate ways, some showering, some leaving the stadium, some drinking champagne, and some going home to sleep.&quot; [In the second example, it's a good idea to write &quot;team members&quot; to be clear.]
# The words &quot;They&quot; and &quot;Their&quot; are third-person plural personal pronouns in Modern English. The &quot;singular&quot; they and their is used as a gender-neutral singular rather than as a plural pronoun, but the correctness of this usage is disputed.

==Examples==
* Every one of the studies indicated &lt;s&gt;their&lt;/s&gt; '''its''' methodology.
* Neither Jackson nor Juarez believed &lt;s&gt;they&lt;/s&gt; '''he''' had been represented unfairly.
* Each researcher included a control group with &lt;s&gt;their&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s&gt;his&lt;/s&gt; '''his or her''' test group.
* By 1999, the lacrosse team had outgrown &lt;s&gt;their&lt;/s&gt; '''its''' space.
* Neither a crocodile nor a lion &lt;s&gt;are&lt;/s&gt; '''is''' a suitable pet.
* Either Ed or Bill &lt;s&gt;are&lt;/s&gt; '''is''' a plumber.   

But -- 

* Neither crocodiles nor lions &lt;s&gt;is&lt;/s&gt; '''are''' suitable pets.
* Either Ed and Bill or Ted and Jeff &lt;s&gt;is&lt;/s&gt; '''are''' plumbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;notice metadata&quot; style=&quot;background: #f2fff2; border: 2px solid #bfffbf; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 8%; width: 50%&quot;&gt; '''Editing symbols:'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; ^' &lt;/b&gt; (insert apostrophe) or &lt;b&gt; poss &lt;/b&gt;(make possessive) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


For such a little piece of punctuation, the apostrophe is really noticeable when it’s used wrong. And, there seems to be a lot of confusion about how it’s used: a casual look at ads, signs, and other everyday writing reveals a wildly exotic sprinkling of apostrophes in all kinds of places. That’s why mastering the apostrophes' uses can really bolster your credibility in writing: so many people get them wrong!


The main thing to know is that &lt;b&gt; apostrophes’ primary jobs are to form possessives and to stand in for missing letters in a contraction. &lt;/b&gt; Apostrophes are only &lt;i&gt; very &lt;/i&gt; rarely used to form plurals.


You use possessive forms when you want to indicate ownership, or “belonging to.” &lt;b&gt; Possessives are almost always formed by adding an apostrophe and an “s” to the end of a noun (a person, place, or thing). &lt;/b&gt; In contrast, &lt;b&gt; plurals &lt;/b&gt; are usually formed by adding an “s” or “es” to the end of a noun &lt;i&gt; without&lt;/i&gt; an apostrophe.

&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLES&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Possessives use apostrophes. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt; The amendment’s language clarifies the terms left undefined in the original law. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt; “language” belongs to “amendment”; “terms” is plural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt; A review of the month’s headlines reveals nine front-page pieces about the local school board election.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt; “headlines” belongs to “month”; “headlines” and “pieces” are plural &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Sara Jones’ study of language use and class is considered a classic in the field. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt; “study” belongs to “Jones”; the apostrophe moves to the end because the noun ends in “s” &lt;/b&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Plurals do not take apostrophes. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Three key &lt;b&gt;ideas&lt;/b&gt; emerged in the introduction. &lt;br&gt;
The organization was restructured after &lt;b&gt;decades&lt;/b&gt; of poor performance. &lt;br&gt;
All &lt;b&gt;animals&lt;/b&gt; have an innate evolutionary drive to pass along &lt;b&gt;genes&lt;/b&gt; to offspring. &lt;/i&gt;


&lt;b&gt;But plurals that are also possessive do use apostrophes. Notice how the position of the apostrophe moves depending on whether the plural ends with “s” or not. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt; The book traces the &lt;b&gt;Kennedys’&lt;/b&gt; influence on national politics. &lt;br&gt;
The library science degree offers a special emphasis in &lt;b&gt;children’s&lt;/b&gt; literature. &lt;br&gt;
The board changes the policy after the &lt;b&gt;stakeholders’&lt;/b&gt; objections. &lt;/i&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Apostrophes are also used to stand in for missing letters in a contraction. &lt;/b&gt; 

&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLES&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt; The conclusion &lt;b&gt;doesn’t [does not]&lt;/b&gt; follow from the evidence. &lt;br&gt;
Remove the test tubes from the sterilizer when the &lt;b&gt;cycle’s [cycle is]&lt;/b&gt; finished. &lt;br&gt;
This committee will file a final report when &lt;b&gt;we’re [we are]&lt;/b&gt; done with the applications. &lt;/i&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Do not use an apostrophe to form the plurals of numbers or acronyms. &lt;/b&gt; 

&lt;b&gt;EXAMPLES&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
1980&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
eight&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
three CEO&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
these JPEG&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt; vt  &lt;/b&gt; (verb tense) or &lt;b&gt; shift &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==What is a tense shift?==
Verbs are action words. “Tense” refers to the time when an action takes place: past, present, or future. Necessary tense shifts simply make it clear to your reader when actions have taken, are taking, or will take place. When you “shift tense unnecessarily,” however, it means you change the times when actions are taking place within a chunk of text in a way that doesn’t seem to make sense. Notice how the tense changes cause confusion in the following examples.

==Examples of confusing tense shifts==
* ''In February 2003, the Sefton City Council '''passed''' an ordinance that '''limited''' the number of dogs city residents '''could keep''' on their property to three. Several residents '''objected''' and formally '''petitioned''' the council to repeal the ordinance, but the council '''upheld''' it. Their reasoning '''is''' that having more than three dogs '''creates''' potentially dangerous situations. In November 2004, however, changes in the Council’s membership '''resulted''' in the ordinance being repealed.''&lt;!-- &quot;repealed&quot; is not a past tense verb here; it's acting as an adjective. --&gt;
* ''While St. Cloud '''struggles''' with keeping rental housing from dominating the housing market, other communities in central Minnesota '''undertook''' several initiatives to build more apartments and condominiums.''

The best way to find unnecessary tense shifts is to read a piece of writing through one time just looking for tense and asking yourself whether each verb tense accurately reflects the time period it took place, takes place, or will take place in. Start by using a highlighter to mark each verb, and then ask yourself if the “time” is correct for each one.

The correction:

* ''In February 2003, the Sefton City Council '''passed''' an ordinance that '''limited''' the number of dogs city residents '''could keep''' on their property to three. Several residents '''objected''' and formally '''petitioned''' the council to repeal the ordinance, but the council '''upheld''' it. Their reasoning '''was''' that having more than three dogs '''creates''' potentially dangerous situations. In November 2004, however, changes in the Council’s membership '''resulted''' in the ordinance being repealed.''&lt;!-- &quot;repealed&quot; is not a past tense verb here; it's acting as an adjective. --&gt;

(No reason exists to believe that those who then thought that three or more dogs in a household created a dangerous situation have changed their minds or that dogs' behavior in a group of three or more has changed. The composition of the council had changed, and the composition of the city council having changed, the city council voted differently).  


* ''While St. Cloud '''struggled''' with keeping rental housing from dominating the housing market, other communities in central Minnesota '''undertook''' several initiatives to build more apartments and condominiums.''

if referring to a situation in the past -- or --

* ''While St. Cloud '''struggles''' with keeping rental housing from dominating the housing market, other communities in central Minnesota '''undertake''' several initiatives to build more apartments and condominiums.''

if referring to a current situation.

&lt;b&gt; dc &lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt; no , &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Disruptive commas are simply those that aren't needed -- those that &quot;disrupt&quot; the flow of the sentence. Here are some guidelines about places where you &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; need to use commas.

; Don't put a comma between a noun and the action it's doing, even when several words come between them.
: ''Most organic '''compounds  &lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt;  contain''' oxygen, nitrogen, and halogens.''
: ''In the Islamic bayaa ceremony, prominent '''citizens  &lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt;  pledge''' allegiance to a newly elected leader.''
: ''A '''visit''' to The City Museum's exhibit on the origins of photography '''&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt;  provided''' an inspiring start to the class.''

; Don't put a comma before these words unless there is an independent clause on each side: and, or, but, for, so, nor, yet.
: ''The town was first settled in 1865 '''&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt;''' and incorporated in 1868.''
: ''The study sample was the correct size '''&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt;'''  but insufficiently diversified.''
: ''The Australian conductor Richard Bonynge was born in Sydney '''&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt;''' and returned there after studying in London.''

; Don't put a comma before a list.
: ''The neighborhood contains several examples of classic mid-century architecture, including '''&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt;''' the Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Kennedy homes.''
: ''The recommended treatment focuses on changes in diet, such as '''&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt;''' increased fiber, less fat, and fewer processed foods.''
: ''The group of benefits considered standard is made up of '''&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt;''' health insurance, disability insurance, and a retirement account.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Friedreich Ataxia'''

==Contracting==
*Acknowledge prior contact
*What do they know about Friedreich Ataxia?
*Do they have any questions?

==Etiology==
*Slowly progressive ataxia with onset usually during adolescence
*Autosomal recessive inheritance
*Majority of cases caused by mutations in X25/FRDA gene
**Found on chromosome 9q13
**&lt;1% of patients who meet the clinical diagnostic criteria do not have an identifiable mutation in this gene
**96% of patients with FRDA1 are homozygous for a GAA expansion in the X25 gene
***Normal alleles have 7-38 repeats
***Premutation alleles have 34-60 repeats
***Disease-causing alleles 66-1700 triplets
***GAA repeat length is unstable during germ line transmission:
****Maternal transmission gives both contractions and expansions
****Paternal transmission usually contracts repeat size but premutation alleles may expand in size
***Larger expansion size correlates with earlier onset of disease
*X25 gene codes for a protein called frataxin
**Found in inner mitochondrial membrane
**Putative iron transporter to regulate mitochondrial iron content

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*Population frequency of 2-4 per 100,000
*Carrier frequency is 1/60-1/100

==Clinical Features==
*Obligatory diagnostic criteria:
**Progressive ataxia of gait and limbs
**Absent reflexes in legs
**Dysarthria
**Decrease in position sense and/or vibration in lower limbs
**Muscle weakness
**Motor nerve conduction velocity of &gt;40 m/s with reduced or absent sensory nerve action potential
*Additional findings:
**Scoliosis
**Pes cavus
**Cardiomyopathy (66%)
***Usually in later stages of disease but may precede ataxia
***2/3 of patients have abnormal EKG
**Optic nerve atrophy (25%)
**Sensorineural hearing loss (10%)
**Diabetes mellitus (10%) or glucose intolerance (20%)

==Natural history==
*Ataxia usually develops in childhood or early teens
*Rate of progression is variable
**Mean age of loss of ambulation is 25 years
**Death usually occurs in 30's
***Cardiomyopathy
***Diabetes
***Pneumonia due to dysphagia
*25% of patients have atypical findings
**Late-onset FRDA (LOFA)
***Approximately 15% of patients with FRDA
***Age of onset greater than 25 years of age
***Usually have repeat size smaller than 500
**FRDA with retained reflexes (FARR)
***12% of patients with FRDA
***Show brisk tendon reflexes for up to 10 years after disease onset
**FRDA with slowly progressive disease
***Disease progression slower in Acadian patients
***Age on onset and neurological manifestations similar

==Testing==
*Molecular genetic testing can be used to identify mutations in X25/FRDA
**Shortest repeat length causing disease has not yet been determined for sure
**&lt;1% of patients who satisfy clinical diagnostic criteria have no identifiable mutation
*Carrier testing
**Can be offered if two disease-causing mutations are identified in proband
**Alleles in premutation range may be transmitted unchanged or may expand
*Prenatal testing
**Clinically available for couples at 25% risk for having child with FRDA1 if both disease causing mutations are known
**DNA from amniocentesis at 16-18 weeks or CVS at 10-12 weeks can be analyzed

==Management==
*No therapy is known to stop, delay, or reverse disease progression
*Future therapies may include:
**Drug therapy
**Gene therapy
**Other pathophysiology-based treatments
*Support
**Psychological support
**Prostheses, walking aids, and wheelchairs may help patients maintain an active lifestyle
**Physical therapy
**Speech therapy
**Orthopedic intervention for scoliosis and foot deformities
**Treatment of cardiac disease and diabetes

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Demyelinating form of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I (HMSNI or CMT1)
**Childhood symptoms may be similar
**Nerve conduction studies or DNA testing can determine definitively
*Vitamin E deficiency
**Should be considered in cases that don't show a GAA expansion
**Fulfill diagnostic criteria for FRDA but often have titubation and hyperkinesia
**Treated with Vitamin E supplements
*Other early onset ataxias present with different clinical findings

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Feelings of guilt, anxiety
*Pregnancy issues: preimplantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal testing, possible pregnancy termination
*Discussion with other family members about risk, inheritance
*Disruption of work, school, social life for those affected

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;notice metadata&quot; style=&quot;background: #f2fff2; border: 2px solid #bfffbf; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 8%; width: 15%&quot;&gt; '''Editing symbol:'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; dm &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==What Is a Dangling Modifier?==
A common way to save words and combine ideas is by starting a sentence with a phrase that provides additional information about an element in the sentence without having to make a whole separate sentence to say it. In the following example, notice how three choppy sentences condense into one smoother sentence with the use of such an opening phrase, which is called a modifier:
* '''Original''': ''The Student Council exists to represent students to the faculty and administration. It also oversees student organizations. The Student Council plays an important role in campus life.''
* '''Rewrite''': ''Responsible for representing students to the faculty and administration and overseeing student organizations, the Student Council plays an important role in campus life.''

Here are some other examples of sentences that begin with a phrase providing this sort of additional information:
* ''An example of bottom of the pyramid targeting, microcredit ventures lend small amounts of money to those with minimal assets.''
* ''Found in tropical southern Asia, the Asian Koel belongs to the cuckoo order of birds.''
* ''After completing the experiment, the most bacteria appeared in the scraping taken from the drinking fountain.''

Notice something odd about the last one? The modifier -- &quot;After completing the experiment&quot; -- doesn't match what follows it: The ''bacteria'' didn't complete the experiment (presumably, a researcher did)! The rule for using modifiers at the beginning of a sentence is that '''the thing being modified must immediately follow the modifier.''' Sometimes this requires you to rearrange the sentence; other times you have to &quot;spell out&quot; what is being modified if you didn't include it.

===Examples===
* '''Dangling modifier''': ''Covering most of Minnesota, the illustration showed the glacier that left the state with its thousands of lakes.''
* '''Corrected''': ''Covering most of Minnesota, the glacier left the state with its thousands of lakes, as depicted on the illustration.''
* '''Dangling modifier''': ''Trekking across the desert, fierce winds swirled around the riders.''
* '''Corrected''': ''Trekking across the desert, the riders were assaulted by fierce winds.''
* '''Dangling modifier''': ''First coined in 1980, historian Linda Kerber used the term &quot;republican motherhood&quot; to describe a phenomenon occurring after the Revolutionary War in which women were encouraged to promote the ideals of liberty and democracy to their children.''
* '''Corrected''': ''First coined in 1980, the term &quot;republican motherhood&quot; was used by historian Linda Kerber to describe a phenomenon occurring after the Revolutionary War in which women were encouraged to promote the ideals of liberty and democracy to their children.''

==What Is a Misplaced Modifier?==
Whereas a dangling modifier is &quot;left hanging,&quot; so to speak, with its referent missing in action, a misplaced modifier's referent is present and accounted for, but as its name implies, the modifier itself is out of place within the sentence, such that it seems to modify another referent in the sentence, resulting in ambiguity or confusion.

&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;notice metadata&quot; style=&quot;background: #f2fff2; border: 2px solid #bfffbf; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 8%; width: 15%&quot;&gt; '''Editing symbol:'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; mm &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===Examples===
* '''Misplaced''': Erik couldn't ride his bicycle ''with a broken leg''.
* '''Misplaced''': The little girl walked the dog ''wearing a tutu''.
* '''Misplaced''': ''Just'' don't stand there.

* '''Correct''': ''With his broken leg'', Erik couldn't ride his bicycle
* '''Correct''': ''Still wearing a tutu'', the little girl walked the dog.
* '''Correct''': Don't ''just'' stand there.

==What Is a Squinting Modifier?==
Unlike a dangling modifier or a misplaced modifier, a squinting modifier is placed right next to the word it refers to, but it is also near another word that it might be modifying, which can cause confusion. 

===Examples===
* '''Squinting''': Cycling uphill ''quickly'' strengthens the leg muscles.

* '''Correct''': ''Quickly'' cycling uphill strengthens the leg muscles. 
Or
* '''Correct''': Cycling uphill can ''quickly'' strengthen the leg muscles.


* '''Squinting''': Using modifiers ''clearly'' will improve your writing.

* '''Correct''': ''Clearly'' using modifiers will improve your writing.
Or
* '''Correct''':  Using modifiers will ''clearly'' improve your writing.

      <comment>Clearing up confusing 'this&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Getting your grammar and punctuation right in your writing is easier than you think. That’s because, for the most part, writers don’t make every mistake. Instead, we tend to make a few of the same mistakes multiple times, such as always missing the comma after an introductory clause, or forgetting to match up our nouns and pronouns in the right way. This means that you don’t have to worry about learning every grammar and punctuation rule; chances are, you follow most of them already. 

Following patterns allows you then to focus only on the mistakes you make habitually — and often a writing instructor or writing center tutor can help you identify what those are. Once you know what they are, it’s a matter of making sure you understand how to find those errors when editing your own writing and how to correct them. 

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;It is perfectly okay to write garbage — as long as you edit brilliantly.&quot; |caption= C.J. Cherryh, science fiction and fantasy writer}}

Don’t worry about having to memorize the grammar and punctuation rules you need to implement or learning them so deeply that you’ll never again make certain errors. Both of these things usually come in time, but what’s most important when you’re first diving into the world of punctuation and grammar are these two habits: &lt;br&gt;
* &lt;b&gt; leaving time to edit at the sentence level after you’ve finished drafting. &lt;/b&gt; The best writers don’t write error-free; rather, the best writers edit their work.
* &lt;b&gt; having and consulting resources when correcting your mistakes. &lt;/b&gt; Why do you think there are hundreds of writer’s handbooks online and at the bookstore?! It’s precisely because writers of every stripe make mistakes in grammar and punctuation and need to frequently (and repeatedly) look up the answers. You may internalize the rules for using a colon after you’ve looked them up twenty-nine times — or you may not, so your handbook might just start falling open to that page. That’s just fine; the important thing is having a handy place to look up rules when you’re editing.

*What questions or concerns would you like to address today?

==Interim History==
*Which physicians are you seeing? When are your follow-up appointments scheduled?
*Recent tests: video swallowing study, audiologic evaluation, O2 saturation studies?
*How have things been going since the cleft palate repair? Any complications? Current feeding issues?
*Developmental assessment questions
**Rolling over?
**Sitting when supported?

**Babbling? Any consonant sounds? Words?
*Are you satisfied with OT/PT services? Have you noticed improvements?

==Psychosocial Assessment==
*Who lives in the home with you?
*Are you working outside the home? Who cares for him when you are at work?
*Do you have any help with his care? Do you feel like you need help?
*Do you have support from family and friends?
*What is most concerning for you?
*Do you have any pets? Air conditioning (concern because of trach)?
*Possible psychosocial issues:
**Burden of caring for a child with complicated medical history
**Disruption of family, lifestyle
**Guilt, shock, denial, anger, fear about diagnosis
**Social stigma, poor self-esteem for child with disfiguring condition

==General Overview of Condition==
*Rare condition in which the midface does not develop normally
**Affects the head and face
**May cause widely spaced eyes, a flat broad nose, and a vertical groove in middle of face
*Cause is not known but can be sporadic or familial

==Etiology==
*Anomalies explained by single malformation
**Nasal capsule fails to develop properly causing disruption in the positioning in the eyes and lack of formation of nasal tip
**Considered nonspecific developmental field defect
*Most cases sporadic
**Some reports of familial aggregation but may be misdiagnosis
**Reported in dup(2q) syndrome
*Can occur as one feature in multiple malformation syndrome with recurrence risk is for syndrome

==Clinical Features==
*Variability in severity of expression
*Eyes
**Hypertelorism
**Lateral displacement of inner canthi
*Forehead
**Widown's peak
**Defect in midline frontal bone (cranium bifidum occultum)
*Nose
**Varies from notched broad nasal tip, divided nostrils with hypoplasia, absence of prolabium and premaxilla with cleft lip
**Broad nasal root
**Lack of formation of nasal tip
*Occasional abnormalities
**Accessory nasal tags
**Anomalies of optic disk, optic nerve, retina, or eye (colobomas, cataracts)
**Preauricular tags, low-set ears
**Conductive deafness
**Mental deficiency (8-20%)
***Seems to be more severe when extracephalic anomalies occur or when hypertelorism is very severe
***Probability low if features above are not as sever
**Frontal cutaneous lipoma or lipoma of corpus callosum
**Agenesis of corpus collosum
**Anterior basal encephalocele
**Tetralogy of Fallot
**Cleft lip and/or cleft palate
*Usually requires radical cosmetic surgery to repair
*Natural history and lifespan depend on severity and complications but usually not significantly different from expected

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Oculo-auricular-vertebral spectrum
*Frontofacionasal dysostosis - autosomal recessive inheritance
*Craniofrontonasal dysplasia

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Galactosemia'''

==Introduction==
*Disorder of galactose metabolism
*Usually caused by deficient activity of enzyme galactose-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT)
*Autosomal recessive inheritance

==Diagnosis==
*Detected in virtually 100% of affected infants if included in newborn screen
*Presents with poor suck, failure to thrive, bleeding diathesis, and jaundice, hypoglycemia, hepatocellular damage, and hyperammonemia
*If untreated in infants can result in
**Liver damage
**Sepsis
**Mental retardation
*If suspected remove lactose from diet while tests are pending
*If placed on lactose - galactose restricted diet than symptoms quickly resolve and can prevent permanent damage
*Despite early treatment still at increased risk for
**developmental delays
**speech problems
**abnormalities of motor function
**poor growth
**poor intellectual function
**premature ovarian failure in women
*With continued dietary management-- many individuals with galactosemia have good health, and are able to lead independent lives
*Outcome can be based on GALT activity, genotype, age at diagnosis and compliance with lactose restriction
*Diagnosis made by measuring erythrocyte GALT activity and isoelectric focusing of GALT
**Done for infants who have a positive newborn screening test, symptoms, or a positive clinitest reaction (copper oxidizing aldehyde) and a negative glucostix reaction (glucose oxidase impregnated strip)
**Classic galactosemia G/G homozygote activity less than 5% of control
**Heterozygote G/N GALT activity about 50% of control
**Duarte variant activity between 5-20% (express stronger activity bands, which move toward the anode and lower pH)
*Mol gen testing of GALT gene (chromosome 9p13) clinically available for biochemically confirmed galactosemia and is used for:
**prognostic information
**heterozygote detection
**genetic counseling,
**prenatal diagnosis
*Biochemical assays also necessary for diagnosis and as therapeutic parameters include:
**Erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate -- metabolism of this precursor is blocked in the GALT reaction sequence --Concentration of erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate exceeds 2mg/dl in untreated individuals and can be used to monitor the effectiveness of therapy.
**Galactitol is a product of an alternate pathway for galactose metabolism and can be measured in the urine. Correlation with other measures may not be perfect.
**Total body oxidation of 13C-galactose to 13CO 2 in breath is a good predictor of outcome and differentiates forms of galactosemia that reduce GALT activity in erythrocytes, but not liver
Variant Galactosemia
*partial impairment of GALT activity (2% to 10% residual activity)
*some aspects of classical galactosemia, such as early cataracts, mild mental retardation with ataxia, and growth retardatio
*may have dyspraxic speech, and females may have amenorrhea or early menopause

==Common Long Term Problems==
*memory problems
*neurological problems (tremors and trouble with balance and gait).
*Cataracts

==Prevalence==
*Classic galactosemia -- based on the results of newborn screening programs, is approximately 1/30,000
*Carrier rate is 1:112
Genotype-Phenotype Correlations
*Significant correlations being found
*arginine substitution for a glutamine at amino acid position 188 (Q188R) accounts for about 70% of the G alleles in the Caucasian population with northern European ethnicity. Homozygotes have no enzyme activity
*some studies found greater proportion of patients with a poor outcome were homozygous for the Q188R mutation, and a greater proportion with a good outcome were not homozygous for the Q188R
*Duarte variant is the allele in which an aspartate substituted for asparagine at position 314 (N314D) imparts bioinstability to the GALT enzyme.
*In the homozygous state (D/D or N314D/N314D), erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity is reduced by only 50%.
*Compound heterozygotes with this mutation (i.e., D/G or N314D/Q188R) have good prognoses and it is not clear whether dietary intervention is required
*The S135L allele, in which a leucine is substituted for serine at amino acid 135, is prevalent in Africa. African-Americans with galactosemia and this allele in either homozygous or compound heterozygous state have a good prognosis because of lack of neonatal hepatotoxicity and chronic problems if therapy is begun early
*An asparagine substitution for a lysine at position 285 (K285N) is prevalent in southern Germany, Austria, and Croatia and has a poor prognosis for neurological and cognitive dysfunction in either the homozygous state or compound heterozygous state with Q188R.

==Differential Diagnosis==
*for neonatal hepatotoxicity
**infectious diseases
**obstructive biliary disease
**other metabolic diseases such as (Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C1 and Wilson disease).
*Galactokinase deficiency
**should be considered in patients who have cataracts and galactosemia but healthy
**have normal GALT activity
**reduced galactokinase activity is diagnostic and is what causes cataracts
*Epimerase deficiency
**should be considered in patients who have liver disease, sensorineural deafness, failure to thrive, and elevated galactose-1-phosphate, but normal GALT activity
**Detection of reduced epimerase activity is diagnostic

==Management==
*Immediate dietary intervention is indicated in infants whose GALT activity is less than 10% of control activity
*Human milk, cow's milk and many formulas have lactose. There are currently many infant formulas that do not contain lactose, to choose from. These include soy-based formulas, such as Isomil or Prosobee, specialty formulas based on hydrolysed casein, such as Nutramigen or Alimentum and formulas based on cow's milk, in which the lactose has been removed and replaced with other sugars, including Similac Sensitive and Enfamil Lactofree. Additionally, it is important to know that Galactosemia may be less severe in some infants, allowing for partial breastfeeding. 
*Ideally blood gal-1-p level below 3 to 4 mg/100 ml
*galactose-restricted diet should keep blood gal-1-p at this level, while containing enough nutrients for normal body function
*The diet allows most protein-containing foods other than milk and milk products. Fruits, vegetables, grains, breads, fats and sugars are acceptable, as long as they do not have ingredients that contain galactose
*Food labels should be read carefully
*Medicines should be checked because lactose often an inactive ingredient
*Dietary supplements only taken when recommended because inactive ingredients not listed
*people with galactosemia should have a regular daily supplement of calcium either from a soy formula or tablets
*Dietary restrictions on all lactose-containing continue throughout life
*Uridine supplements have not been of value.
*Recent research suggests that despite exogenous galactose restriction, endogenous galactose production may approach 2.0 g per day
*The efficiency of restricting lactose in the diets of women who are at risk for having a child with galactosemia is unknown.
*Agreement has not been reached on whether individuals with variant forms of galactosemia with residual GALT activity in the range of 3% to 20% should be restricted from galactose intake during infancy and early childhood --possible that dietary restriction of galactose might prevent sequelae such as cataracts, ataxia, dyspraxic speech, and cognitive deficits.
Risk To Family Members
*Unaffected parents of an affected individual are obligate heterozygotes and carry at one disease-causing GALT allele
*Such carriers are asymptomatic and do not develop galactosemia
*Appropriate and can be important to determine the disease-causing GALT alleles in the parents of an affected child to establish the risk for galactosemia in future pregnancies
*Affected individuals have a risk for premature ovarian failure, but may have children. Children born to one parent with (G/G) galactosemia and one parent with two normal alleles (N/N) are obligate heterozygotes (N/G)
*If one parent is affected (G/G) and the other parent is a carrier for a G allele (N/G or D/G), the child has a 50% chance of being a heterozygote and a 50% chance of having G/G galactosemia

==Prenatal Testing==
*possible for fetuses at 25% risk for classical (G/G) galactosemia using either GALT enzyme activity or molecular genetic testing if the disease-causing GALT mutations in the family are known
*Enzyme analysis and molecular diagnosis rely upon cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at about 10-12 weeks' gestation* or amniocentesis at 16-18 weeks' gestation.

==Preparation: Review medical history==

==Welcome client: Contracting==
*Review the medical history and family history
*Talk about the condition itself/ how child is doing with it
*Talk about nutritional issues

==What are your major concerns?==
*Dietary guideline and restrictions. (make sure DR. Leslie understands Mom has gotten many different opinions from her old center and she wants straight answers that won't change.
*The multivitamin for the calcium

==Review medical history==
*The initial illness, changes since the diet adjustment
*Current diet, current questions about diet

==Review family history==
*Son was tested prenatally - a carrier
*What about daughter?
*No testing for either parent

==Review the condition==
*Galactosemia is a condition where the sugars in the body can not be broken down. Specifically, the body can not break down galactose. Because Lactose is a larger molecule that contains galactose, it can not be broken down either. When the sugar can't be broken down, it creates a buildup of different substances that can be toxic to the body.
*Treatment, as you know is to eliminate lactose and galactose from the diet.
*Autosomal recessive
**Risks to your other children
**Risks to her children (definite carriers)

==Review the dietary restaints==
*Read labels look for the bad stuff: casein, sodium caseinate, whey, curds, lactose, galactose, creamed, butteed, breaded vegetables, dehydrated and canned soups. Commercial cakes, cookies, candies, and puddings.
*Read labels for the good stuff: lactate, lactic acid, lactalbumin, stearoyl-2-lactylate
*Supplementation with calcium and vitamin D: recommend a multivitamin

==Possible counseling issues==
*Effect of feeding restraints on other kids/family
*Guilt issues for mom about restricting the diet
*Difficulty maintaining the diet for child

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Gastroschisis'''

==Check on maternal age for risks of chromosomal stuff==

==Check on smoking during pregnancy?==

==Introductions==
*How are you doing/ how's the pregnancy going?
*How far along are you?

==Contracting==
*We want to explain what this finding means for your baby and your pregnancy
*Ask a few questions about your pregnancy and family history

==Tell me a little about how the pregnancy has been going==
*Any infections?
*Cigarette use?

==Gastroschisis==
*What have you been told? I know that it was recently diagnosed
*The basics
**A hole through which the baby's intestines are outside of the body
**Do you want to see a picture of what it will look like? -
*Cause
**Usually gastroschisis is isolated and there are NO other abnormalities
**believed to be related to the improper regression of the arteries/veins involved in the umbilical cord.
**Basically during development, the baby has to go through a lot of changes as it grows. Connected to the mom through the yolk which becomes the umbilical cord. The yolk sac is the biggest thing until the baby starts to grow = the baby folds up and the umbilical cord becomes smaller. As these changes occur the baby's body folds across it's tummy around the umbilical cord.
*Other things possibly associated with gastros. - work most of these in through the management plans
**12.5% risk of stillbirth (usually late in third trimester)
**20-40% other gastrointestinal disruptions (including malrotation, atresia, volvulus(twisting of the intestine causing blockage), infarction(lack of blood flow)
**77% have IUGR
**1/3 preterm labor - usually because of polyhydramnios
**0-8% have cardiovascular malformations (VERY RARE)
**NOT associated with chromosomal abnormalities (previous studies have shown 1/128 cases of gastroschisis had chromosomal abnormality (trisomy 18) 0/57 cases had chromosomal abn. THEREFORE: quote maternal age risks for risk of aneuploidy. QUOTE 1% risk
*Management during pregnancy
**ultrasounds to monitor the status of the bowel
**biophysical tests starting at 30 weeks to monitor the status of the baby
***nonstress test - the belt around the mom's belly to make sure the baby is &quot;happy&quot;.
***measures the amnioic fluid level and the baby's growth
**echo to monitor heart??
**plans for induction/C-Section (always C-section at Good Sam)
**offering of amniocentesis (insert outline)
***explain genes and chromosomes
***common chromosomal abnormalities
*Treatment
**surgery (2 types)
***Primary closure (70%) - requires one time surgery. Reduced hospital stay, faster recovery to oral feeds. Ability depends on how much area is affected. Hospital stay usually 7-14 days.
***Silo creation - the placement of a mechanism that allows for gradual return of the intestines to their appropriate location. Takes 3-5 days to finish. Requires a second surgery to remove the silo. May remain in hospital for weeks.
*What can happen after birth
**Risk of death from complications (91% survival rate) prematurity, sepsis(infection by an organism or toxin), bowel ischemia
**Postoperative infections (intestinal dysfunction, intestinal ischemia (anemia due to blood restriction), bowel infarction, necrotizing enterocolitis (death of the cells of the membrane of distal portion of the intestine)
**Delayed feeding issues (can't take food orally - usually short term, sometimes indefinitely)
**Possible recurrent bowel obstructions - watch the feeding/bowel movements closely
**Possible esophageal reflux
**Hydronephrosis (swelling of kidney due to blockage) and urinary tract abnormalities (4/12 in a recent study)

==Recurrence issues==
*Gastroschisis is usually sporadic and there is a very low recurrence chance
*A study has shown 4.5% recurrence risk for siblings in families based on general pop. studies
*6 families have been identified to have the condition in an AD pattern
*Next pregnancies we will monitor with ultrasounds.

==Psychosocial issues throughout==
*Plans for this baby - not what you expected
*Difficulty feeding
*Surgery and hospitalization immediately following birth
*Insurance issues?
*Family support?
*Coping style?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Gaucher Disease'''

==General facts==
*most common lysosomal storage disease
*most common genetic disorder among Ashkenazi Jews
*less than 1/40,000 in gen pop affected
*autosomal recessive inheritance
*deficient activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase
*enzyme needed to break down glucocerebroside (lipid result of breakdown of worn out RBC and WBC)
*lack of causes accumulation in lysosomes of macrophages (which are responsible for recycling and breaking it down)
*accumulation of these cells primarily in liver, spleen, and bone marrow (sometimes lungs)

==3 types of Gaucher Disease==
*type 1 - nonneuronopathic, most common type (99% of patients)
*type 2 - infantile type (early onset and severe CNS involvement and death early childhood)
*type 3 - onset of mild CNS in adolescence or early adult

==Symptoms of type 1==
*variable extent of involvement and symptoms even in siblings with same mutation
*generally later in life symptoms appear less likely severe disease
*enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) most common sign
*anemia and thromocytopenia secondary to enlarged spleen and accumulation in bone marrow
*skeletal involvement in 70-100% includes: osteopenia, lytic lesions, chronic bone pain, acute episodes of &quot;bone crisis&quot;, bone infarcts, osteonecrosis, subchondral joint collapse w/ secondary degenerative arthritis, (femur, vertebrae, humerus, tibia most dramatically affected)
*more than half have erlenmeyer flask deformity of femur
*bone problems cause greatest morbidity and long-term disability

==Diagnosis==
*most efficient and reliable is assay of enzyme activity (blood leukocytes or can use skin fibroblasts)
*individual with adult Gaucher will have 10-30% of normal values
*heterozygotes have reduced levels, but range overlaps normal population so not good for carrier testing
*bone marrow biopsy may provide suspicion due to lipid-laden macrophages, but enzyme tests must confirm because can look similar to other cells in other diseases (see differential)
*prenatal dx available amnio or CVS

==gene testing==
*gene maps to 1q2.1
*more than 150 mutations identified
*carrier freq. in AJ pop is 1 in 14 to 1 in 18 (4 mutations, N370S, 84GG, L444P, IVS2+1, account for &gt;90% in symptomatic patients)
*non-Jewish - much lower carrier frequ and L44P, N370S, D409H, R463c, and IVS2 +1 most common
*mutation testing can determine carrier status
*detects about 84% of all carriers and 90% of AJ carriers
*tests most common alleles (N37OS most common AJ pop, L444P most common world wide, 1Vs2, 84GG, V394L
*gene sequencing on research basis

==genotype phenotype correlation==
*homozygous N370S associated with less severe phenotype and no CNS involvement (some homozygotes in AJ pop. may be asymptomatic and not come to medical attention)
*homozygous L444P early CNS symptoms common in type 2 and 3

==Treatment==
*traditionally was periodic blood transfusions, partial or total spleen removal, pain relievers
*regular evaluations to monitor rate of progression
*type 1 and some type 3 responds to ERT with purified macrophage-targeted human beta-glucocerebrosidase (aglucerase injection)
*ERT reduces liver and spleen size, decreased bone pain, resolves anemia and thrombocytopenia
*does not seem to correct osteonecrosis, osteosclerosis, vertebral compression
*IgG antibodies to aglucerase reported in 13% of patients (usually with no clinical effect and diminish with continued therapy)
*But antibodies associated with increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions
*high cost of ERT $100 per pound of weight every 2 wks

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Pseudo-Gaucher cells-seen in chronic granulocytic leukemia, thalassemia, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin Disease, lymphomas, acute lymphocytic leukemia
*Organomegaly - seen in Nieman-Pick type A,B,C, Wolman Disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, oligosaccharidoses
*Other lysosomal storage diseases

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*stress of living with chronic illness
*difficulty accepting that we may not know if some of the symptoms really are related to Gaucher
*difficulty accepting the metabolic changes that are often occur once on ERT
*possible lifestyle limitations due to arthritis and pain
*many don't appear sick, so may not have support from others
*uncertainties about symptom severity and onset
*coping with pain and fatigue
*how supportive are family and friends
*is she involved with a support group
*insurance and financial issues

Very good results were observed with the active substance AminHSTH

==Introduction==
*Discuss the reason for referral.
*Elicit prior knowledge about Gaucher Disease.
*Assess concerns and set goals for the session.
*Provide overview of topics for counseling session.

==Intake &amp; Family History==

==What is Gaucher Disease?==
*The most common lipid-storage disorder and the most common genetic disease affecting Jewish people of Eastern European ancestry.
*Gaucher disease results from a specific enzyme deficiency in the body caused by a genetic mutation received from both parents.
*The disease course if variable, ranging from no outward symptoms to server disability and death. Symptoms can appear at any time from infancy to old age.
*Testing is available to identify potential parents who are carriers of the gene and to accurately diagnose people who have the disease.
*There are three types of Gaucher disease, and enzyme replacement therapy is available for one type.

==Etiology &amp; Incidence==
*History
**Gaucher disease was first described in 1882.
**In 1934, the fatty compound, glucocerebroside was isolated from the spleens of affected individuals.
**In 1965, it was demonstrated that glucocerebroside accumulated because of a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase.
*The basis of Gaucher disease
**Cells called macrophages act in humans to remove old cells by degrading and recycling them.
**The old cells are degraded inside cell compartments called lysosomes.
**Glucocerebrosidase is located inside the lysosomes and breaks down glucocerebroside into glucose and ceramide.
**In people with Gaucher disease, glucocereroside remains stored in the lysosomes because people lack the functional enzyme.
**Enlarged macrophages with undigested glucocerebroside are called Gaucher cells.
**Gaucher cells most often accumulate in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.
**They may also accumulate in the lymphatic system, lungs, skin, eyes, kidney, heart, and nervous system.
**An organ that contains Gaucher cells becomes enlarged and does not function properly.
*Affected organs
**When Gaucher cells accumulate in the spleen, it becomes enlarged and overactive.
***The spleen breaks down red blood cells more rapidly than they can be produced and a deficieny developes resulting in anemia.
***A deficiency of white blood cells or platelets can also occur.
**The liver may also become enlarged and function abnormally.
***The effects of abnormal liver function are usually minor.
***Some people may develop cirrhosis.
**Concentrated Gaucher cells reduce normal bone marrow function.
***Gaucher cells can interfere with the production of blood cells.
***Bones may be thinner or weaker than normal, or they may be deformed.
***They may become brittle and fracture more easily.
***If bone fractures occur in the spinal column, they are called compression fractures and can cause nerve damage.
***&quot;Bone crises&quot; can occur when there is a sudden lack of oxygen in an area where Gaucher cells have interfered with normal blood flow.
***Blood flow restriction can also result in the destruction of bone tissue (called aseptic necrosis) which leads to permanent mobility problems
*Incidence
**Type 1
***Approximately 1 in 40,000 people in the general population are affected
***In Jews of Ashkenazi descent the incidence ranges from 1 in 400 to 1 in 600 people.
***Approximately 1 in 10 people in the Ashkenazi population are carriers.
**Type 2 &amp; 3
***Approximately 1 in 100,000 people
***Does not appear to be concentrated within any particular ethnic group
***A number of cases with Type 3 symptoms have been reported in Scandinavia, particularly Sweden.

==Clinical Features &amp; Natural History==
*Variability
**Timing and severity of symptoms vary greatly.
**In general, the later in life the first symptoms appear, the less likely that the disease will be severe.
**The course of the disease varies upon classification into one of the three types.
*Type 1 Gaucher disease
**The most common type
**Formerly called adult Gaucher disease
**Individuals of all ages can be affected
**May be referred to as &quot;non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease&quot;
**Symptoms vary greatly in severity and include:
***Generalized fatigue with lack of energy and stamina
***Abdomen
****Enlarged spleen and liver
****Pain
****Compression of the lungs causing decreased ability to provide oxygen to the blood
***Skeletal system
****Growth retardation in children
****Pain and degeneration of joints and tissue that covers bones
****Loss of bone density that leads to widening of bones along the knee joint, curvature of the bones, or spontaneous fractures
****Acute bone infarctions known as &quot;bone crises&quot;
****Bone necrosis
****X-rays often reveal a characteristic deformity called the &quot;Erlenmeyer flask deformity&quot; in the thigh bones
***Disruption of normal kidney function
***Skin
****Yellow-brown pigmentation
****Non-raised, round, puplish-red spots, especially around the eyes
***Blood
****Increased bleeding tendency such as nosebleeds and bruising
****Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia
****Elevated levels of acid phosphatase and plasma proteins
***Loss of appetite and intestinal complaints
*Type 2 Gaucher disease
**Characterized by severe neurological involvement in the first year of life.
**Rapidly progresses and affects the brain as well as the organs that affect Type 1 Gaucher disease
**Formerly called infantile Gaucher disease
**Also called &quot;acute neuronopathic Gaucher disease&quot;
**Affected child usually does not live past the age of 2 due to nervous system involvement.
*Type 3 Gaucher disease
**Formerly called juvenile Gaucher disease
**Characterized by a slowly progressive neurologic disease
**Signs and symptoms often appear in early childhood.
**Symptoms resemble Type 1 but there is nervous system involvement like Type 2.
**Affected individuals who reach adolescence may survive into the 3rd or 4th decade of life.

==Inheritance==
*Autosomal recessive
**Chromosome location of the glucocerebrosidase gene is 1q21
**If one parent is a carrier and the other is not, there is a 50% chance of carrier child.
**If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance with each pregnancy of having an affected child. There is a 50% chance of having a carrier child, and a 25% chance of having a non-affected, non-carrier child.
**If one parent is affected and the other is not affected nor is a carrier, all children will be carriers but will not be affected.
**If one parent is affected and the other is a carrier, there is a 50% chance of having an affected child and a 50% chance of having a carrier child.
**If both parents are affected, all children will be affected.

==Diagnosis==
*Indications for Gaucher disease:
**Gaucher disease is suspected in individuals with characteristic bone involvement, visceral and hematologic changes, or CNS involvement.
***Clinical findings alone are NOT diagnostic.
**Bone marrow examination may reveal Gaucher cells, but this is not a reliable diagnostic test.
*Definite Diagnosis
**Diagnosis is made by the demonstration of deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme activity in peripheral blood leukocytes or other nucleated cells.
***In affected individuals, enzyme activity in peripheral blood leukocytes is 0-15% or normal activity.
***This method is unreliable for carrier testing due to overlap in enzyme activity between carriers and non-carriers.
**Mutational analysis of the glucocerebrosidase gene is available in clinical laboratories for the 4 most common gene mutations.
***N370S, L444P, 84GG, IVS2+1
***These 4 alleles account for 90% of the disease-causing alleles in the Jewish population and 50-60% in the non-Jewish population.
***More than 150 gene mutations have been described
***Abnormal alleles include exonic missense and nonsense mutations, splice junction mutations, deletions and insertions, and complex alleles resulting from gene conversion or recombination.
***Mutations often result in mRNA instability, and/or a severely truncation protein, or an enzyme with altered activity and/or conformation.
**Molecular testing can identify carriers in famililis in which the disease-causing mutations are known.

==Differential Diagnosis==
*No other phenotypes have been associated with mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene.
*At symptom presentation, it may be necessary to rule out leukemia and arthritis.
*Saposin C deficiency or prosaposin deficiency
**Saposin C is a co-factor for glucocerebrosidase in the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide
*Hepatosplenomegaly is observed in Niemann-Pick disease, Wolman disease, the mucopolysaccharidoses, and the oligosaccharidoses

==Management and Treatment Options==
*Management issues
**A comprehensive baseline evaluation and serial monitoring should be done to evaluate severity and rate of disease progression.
**Symptomatic treatment may be necessary especially in patients not receiving enzyme therapy
***Partial or total splenectomy for splenomegaly and persistent thrombocytopenia
***Transfusion of blood products for anemia and bleeding
***Analgesics for bone pain
***Joint replacement surgery for chronic pain or function restoration
**Therapy to reduce glycosyl/ceramide accumulation
***Bone marrow transplantation (BMT)
****Primarily for those with neurologic involvement
****Engraftment can correct metabolic defect, improve blood counts, and reduce increased liver volume
****Morbidity and mortality associated with BMT limits its use in type 1 and type 3 Gaucher disease
***Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
****Imiglucerase or Cerezyme is a recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme preparation based on the human gene sequence.
****Cerezyme is modified to expose the alpha-mannosyl (carbohydrate) residues for enhanced uptake by the macrophage.
****Regular intravenous infusions have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in reversing the features from hematologic and visceral involvement
****Patients with type 1 Gaucher report improved health-related quality of life after 24-48 months of ERT
****The effectiveness of ERT for bone and neurological disease remains to be established.
****Treatment is usually initiated with a dose of 20-60 units per kg of body weight every 2 weeks.
****10-15% of patients develop antibodies to the infused enzyme, although in most cases these patients remain asymptomatic. Patients who show adverse effects such as pruritus and hives can be treated with antihistamines as a premedication.
***Substrate synthesis inhibitors (SSI)
****SSI is under clinical investigation.
****Relies on limiting the production of substrate and on the clearance of accumulated lipids by the residual enzyme activity.
****A potential concern is its non-specificity
****Combination therapy with SSI and ERT may be possible
***Gene therapy
****Involves the introduction of the glucocerebrosidase gene into hematopoietic stem cells.
****Gene therapy is currently under investigation.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Uncertainty because symptoms and severity vary widely
**Uncertainly may make goal-setting and future planning problematic
*Feelings of isolation, loneliness, and despair.
*Frustration due to ignorance about the disease.
*Coping with chronic pain and fatigue
*Burden of dealing with a chronic, rare, progressive disease
*Body image and self-esteem issues due to spleen or liver enlargement or growth retardation
*Guilt about passing on the gene to one's children.
*Family dynamic changes
**Stress in the marriage
**Sibling relationships
**Family members may feel guilty or resentful
*Depression and frustration about the requirement for lifelong management.
*Shock, fear, and denial over the diagnosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Genes and Chromosomes'''

==Assess the client's knowledge of DNA, genes, and chromosomes==
*Reassure that we will start with the basics (will go back to H.S. biology)
**Explain that I have some pictures that we can look at
**Feel free to interrupt me with questions at any time

==Chromosomes==
*Our bodies are made of hundreds of thousands of cells
**We have skin cells, muscle cells, stomach cells
**Take one of those cells and break it open
***inside the nucleus of the cells are our chromosomes
***chromosomes are the packets that contain all of the genetic information that we inherit from our moms and dads
***we can look at them by using a microscope (show metaphase spread)
***explain that these chromosomes are the same in every one of our cells

==Karyotypes==
*This looks very messy and it is hard to see exactly what is going on, so we match up the chromosomes in pairs and line them up from biggest to smallest to make a karyotype (show pictures)
*23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total)
**we have 2 copies of each chromosome, 1 from mom and 1 from dad
***the first 22 pairs are called autosomes (body chromosomes) and are the same in both men &amp; women
***the last pair are the sex chromosomes (XX women, XY men)
*There should always be 46 chromosomes and they should always come in pairs
**Eggs and sperm only have 23 chromosomes so that when they join during fertilization, they will make a zygote that has 46 chromosomes (with half coming from the mom and half from the dad)
**Sometimes there can be an error when the egg or sperm are being made (nondisjunction) &amp; a baby can be born with too many or too few chromosomes
***show karyotypes of Trisomy 21 and Turner syndrome

==Genes &amp; Mutations==
*Chromosomes are made up of a lot of genes that are lined up along them, so our chromosomes the packages that hold all of our genes
*Our genes are made up of DNA that has all the instructions for how our body is formed and how it grows
**genes have the recipe that tells our body how to make the proteins that do all the work in our cells &amp; are what makes us have our eye color
**any change in our genes will change the way that our bodies form and grow
**so, there can be a change in the number of chromosomes or the way that they are arranged (by changing the genes that make them up)
***either of these changes can result in birth defects

==Analogy - Set of Encyclopedias==
*Think of the chromosomes as being a set of encyclopedias lined up on a shelf.
**You have 2 copies of book 1 (one that your mom gave you and one that your dad gave you), 2 copies of book 2, 2 copies of book 3, etc.
**The genes are like each of the words on the pages.
**Each of the words is made up of letters, just like each of the genes is made up of DNA.
*Sometimes there can be an extra copy of a book (trisomy) or there can be a book missing (monosomy)
**this is a numerical change
*Other times, there could be a typo within one of the words inside the book
**this is a structural change within a gene
***a word could be repeated (duplication) or a word could be missing (deletion) or the words could be in the wrong order (inversion) or a word could be misspelled (point mutation)

----
The Zeroth law of Thermodynamics can be stated as:

''If two thermodynamic systems A and B are in thermal equilibrium, and B is also in thermal equilibrium with another system C, then A and C are in thermal equilibrium.''
                                     OR
&quot;&quot; If a body isolated from the other environment is in thermal equilibrium with one body &amp; is separately in thermal equilibrium with the another body then three bodies are said to be in the thermal equilibrium with each other.&quot;&quot; 

This may seem obvious as we are quite familiar with this experiment. When we place in a cup of water (System A) a thermometer (System B) we wait a period of time until they reach equilibrium then read the measurement on the thermometer.

It is called the Zeroth Law as it is not derivable from the other laws and is often useful to understand the concept before presenting the other laws of thermodynamics.

It also states that at absolute zero temperature( i.e. zero Kelvin ) all molecular motion inside a crystal ceases.

The application of zeroth law is mainly seen in the thermodynamic properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Gorlin - Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome'''

==Contracting==
*Introductions
*How did you first learn about Gorlin syndrome? (Tell us about that experience), What were you told at the time? How did you feel, what did you think? How have you coped with the diagnosis? Did you think about contacting genetics then? What motivated you to contact genetics now?
*Assess main concerns of patient
**Are there any specific questions or concerns we can address?
**What issues would they like to discuss?
**What do they hope to gain from the session?
*Overview of today's session
**Restate patient's concerns
**Medical history, family history, physical exam

==Gather Medical and Family History==
*State that we are going to get some information about your family history and medical history to help give us clues to whether or not the syndrome you have may have been passed down through the family
*Jaw keratocysts
*Skin findings (cysts, bumps, tags)
*Cancers: skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma), medullablastoma, other cancers
*Birth defects: cleft lip/palate, eye problems, polydactyly
*Other
**major health concerns
**others with cancer
**benign conditions, required biopsies, had polyps
**thyroid problems
**female problems
**mental retardation or learning disabilities
**anything you think may be inherited
*Ethnic background

==Risk Assessment==
*About 70-80% of probands have inherited the condition from a parent and about 20-30% of probands have a de novo mutation
*Offspring will have a 50% chance of inheriting the deletion

==Inheritance==
*Hereditary cancers are caused by a change in a specific gene
*Have you ever taken a biology class, do you know about genes and chromosomes, review of genes so we are on the same page:
*Explain genes and chromosomes (use recipe analogy)
*Explain autosomal dominant inheritance
**Autosomal - The changed gene can be inherited either from a mother or father, because the gene is carried on an autosome
**Dominant - Only one copy of the changed gene is needed to be at an increased risk for cancer
**Show diagram of autosomal inheritance
**Carrier has a ½ or 50% risk of passing changed to gene to children, if it is not inherited they would not be at increased risk for cancer and could not pass it on.

==Clinical Diagnosis==
*diagnosed in individuals with two major and one minor criteria or one major and three minor criteria
Major criteria
*Lamellar (sheet-like) calcification of the falx or clear evidence of calcification in an individual &lt;20 years of age. Falx calcification is nearly always present and observed on AP and lateral X-rays* of the skull after age 20 years.
*Jaw keratocyst (odontogenic keratocyst histologically; seen on orthopantogram as an area of translucency)
*Palmar/plantar pits (two or more). Plantar/palmar pits are particularly useful in diagnosis and are more pronounced when the hands and feet are soaked in warm water for up to ten minutes. They may appear as white &quot;punched out&quot; or pink &quot;pin prick&quot; lesions.
*Multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) (more than five in a lifetime) or a basal cell carcinoma before the age of 30 years.
*First degree relative with NBCCS
Minor criteria
*Childhood medulloblastoma (also called primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor [PNET])
*Lympho-mesenteric or pleural cysts
*Macrocephaly (OFC &gt;97th centile)
*Cleft lip/palate
*Vertebral anomalies observed on chest x-ray and/or spinal x-ray: bifid/splayed/extra ribs; bifid vertebrae.
*Polydactyly that is either pre-axial or post-axial
*Ovarian/cardiac fibroma
*Ocular anomalies (cataract, developmental defects, and pigmentary changes of the retinal epithelium)

==Testing==
*NBCCS is caused by germline mutations of the gene PTCH (chromosomal locus 9q22.3)
*In about 60-85% of individuals fulfilling diagnostic criteria, it is possible to identify the underlying gene mutation.
*Uses of testing: confirmatory diagnostic testing, predictive testing, prenatal testing
*Cost is $1700.00 (from GeneDx)
*Testing Methods:
**Sequence analysis. Sequence analysis of the PTCH coding region is available on a clinical basis and detects mutations in up to 85% of patients with typical clinical findings of NBCCS.
**Southern analysis for large deletions. In patients with typical clinical findings of NBCCS who test negative for a mutation by sequence analysis, Southern analysis may be performed to detect large deletions.
**Linkage analysis. When a known disease causing PTCH mutation is not identified in a family, linkage analysis can be considered in families with more than one affected family member. It is 98-99% accurate. Linkage testing is not available to families with only a single affected individual.

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*Incidence is 1 / 40 000, but may be underestimated due to missed milder cases

==Clinical Features==
*NBCCS is characterized in 90% of patients by the development of multiple jaw keratocysts typically observed in the second decade of life and/or basal cell carcinomas usually seen from the third decade onwards.
*About 60% of individuals with a PTCH mutation have a recognizable appearance with macrocephaly, bossing of the forehead, coarse facial features, and facial milia
*Findings in their usual order of appearance are:
**Macrocephaly. The first feature likely to be observed is relative macrocephaly. A large proportion of babies with NBCCS require delivery by Caesarian section due to large head size. Head circumference increases above the 97th centile until 10-18 months and then maintains its centile. Large head size may also contribute to some delay in motor milestones, although as yet there is no psychometric evidence for more global delay.
**Birth defects. Congenital malformations, found in about 5%, include cleft lip/palate (5%), polydactyly, and severe eye anomalies. Severe skeletal defects due to multiple rib/vertebral anomalies have been reported. Open spina bifida is uncommon.
**Medulloblastoma. About 5% of individuals with NBCCS develop the childhood brain malignancy medulloblastoma (now often called primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor [PNET]) The tumor tends to be of desmoplastic histology and to have a favorable prognosis. Peak incidence of medulloblastoma in NBCCS is about two years of age compared to seven years in its sporadic form.
**Jaw keratocysts. Although these can start at about five years of age, the peak occurrence of jaw keratocysts is in the teenage years. They usually present as painless swellings. Untreated, they can lead to major tooth disruption and fracture of the jaw. Jaw cysts become less frequent after age 30 years, after which it is unusual for de novo keratocysts to occur.
**Basal cell carcinomas. Browny/pink/orange basal cell nevi may occur in early childhood and may lie quiescent without evidence of aggressive behavior. A 75% risk of developing BCCs by age 20, a 90% risk by age 40. They can occur in early childhood, but in general do not present until late teenage/early adulthood. 10% of individuals with NBCCS never develop a BCC. Individuals with type 1 skin (white skin that burns, but never tans) and individuals with excessive ultraviolet light exposure seem especially prone to developing large numbers of BCCs. Clinically, some patients seem to be particularly radiosensitive, with new BCCs appearing in the field of radiation following radiotherapy.
**Other skin manifestations. Other skin manifestations include facial milia, which can be numerous, and meibomian cysts in the eye lids. Sebaceous cysts and dermoid cysts are also common. Skin tags (especially around the neck) often have the histological appearance of basal cell carcinomas but do not act aggressively.
**Other. Cardiac and ovarian fibromas occur in about two and 20% of individuals respectively. Cardiac fibromas are usually present at birth or soon after. They can be asymptomatic or can cause arrhythmia or obstruction of cardiac flow. Ovarian fibromas are usually an incidental finding on ultrasound examination or at Caesarian section. They may cause torsion of the ovary, but are not thought to affect fertility. They can become large and calcified; however, malignant transformation rarely occurs.
**Morbidity/mortality. Life expectancy in NBCCS is not significantly different from average. The risk of other malignant tumors is not clearly increased, although lymphoma and meningioma have been reported. No other tumors occur at a frequency that warrants surveillance above that offered to members of the general population. The major problem is with the cosmetic effect of treatment of multiple skin tumors and usually, to a lesser extent, treatment of jaw keratocysts. A poor cosmetic outcome can lead to social difficulties such as holding employment.

==Management and Treatment==
*Medulloblastoma. Awareness of the risk of medulloblastoma in the first years of life is important and may justify developmental assessment and physical examination every six months
*Jaw keratocysts. There is probably justification for regular (every 12-18 months) jaw x-rays (orthopantograms) from around eight years of age. Keratocysts identified early in life usually need surgical excision. Any symptomatic or expanding keratocysts should be excised.
*Skin. Strong advice about avoiding excessive sun exposure is important. Patients are advised to use complete sunblock and cover the skin by using long sleeves, high collars and hats. Radiotherapy should be avoided in the treatment of tumors in NBCCS unless absolutely necessary. The skin should be checked at least annually and patients should have close follow up if they have skin problems in the meantime. Some physicians recommend examinations of the skin by a professional every three to four months. The sheer number of lesions means that early treatment is essential to prevent long-term cosmetic problems particularly on the face.
*Other features. Surveillance is probably not necessary for the other disease features.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Contracting - coping with diagnosis, sense of well being (how have you been doing, how have you been coping); motivations for making the appointment, why didn't she come when she was first diagnosed.
*Family History - support, assess closeness with family, do they live in the area, do they know about the diagnosis, has she shared with the family that she is here?
*Other:
*Concern over what issues to anticipate with NBCCS
*Feelings of guilt over passing gene, or risk of passing gene, to the children
*Social stigma and self consciousness due to multiple skin tumors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Heart Defects - Isolated'''

==Introduction==
*What do you understand about why you are coming to genetics today?
*What concerns do you have that you would like to have addressed today?
*What do you hope to get out of this session?

==Intake and Family History==
*Update Pedigree
*Determine if there are any other family members with congenital heart disease

==Medical History==
*Update medical history since last seen
*Determine what surgeries have been done to fix complex heart defect
*Determine if there have been any other health problems
*Assess developmental ass.

==Etiology and Natural History==
*Most heart development occurs between the 2nd and 8th weeks of gestation
*20-45% of congenital heart defects occur along with other anomalies
*10% of congenital heart defects occur as part of a complex syndrome
**patient has normal chromosomes
**patient has no deletion 22q (confirmed by FISH)

==Prevalence and Inheritance==
*Heart defects occur in 8/1000 live births
*90% of congenital heart defects have no known cause
*isolated heart defects have multifactorial inheritance meaning they are caused by a combination of genes and environment

==Recurrence Risks==
*The general population risk is ~1%
*For parents with one affected child the recurrence risk is between 2-5%
*For parents of two affected children the recurrence risk is 10-15%

==Management/Treatment==
*Description of specific heart defects
**Truncus arteriosus
**Coarctation of the aorta
**Patent ductus arteriosus
**VSD
**ASD
**Aortic valve stenosis
***Repair of the defects
**surgeries that have already been done
**Procedures still need to be done
***Long term monitoring of heart function
***Monitor development
**Provide services if needed

==Prenatal diagnosis==
*Future pregnancies can be evaluated with a level 2 ultrasound to look for heart defects
*Fetoechocardiogram can also be used to detect heart defects prenatally

==Psychosocial Issues==
*How do you feel about the diagnosis?
*How are you dealing with the multiple surgeries?
*Does this affect how you relate to and look at your child?
*Are other family members aware of the condition?
*Do you feel this affects you and your child's everyday life?
*Are you concerned about risks for future children?
*Reassure that there is nothing that could have been done to prevent this
*Reassure that this is very common
*Would you be interested in talking to other families with children with congenital heart defects?

==Follow - up/ Resources==
*Birth defects groups
*Follow up letter

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hemoglobin C'''

==Overview of Hemoglobin and genes==
*Hemoglobin is the protein in blood that carries oxygen and gives blood its red color
*There are hundreds of different types or variants of hemoglobin
**Hemoglobin A is the most common type of hemoglobin that is made in children and adults
**Hemoglobin C is one of the many hemoglobin variants
*The kind of hemoglobin our body makes depends on the genes we inherit
*Genes are the units of inheritance that tell our bodies how to grow and develop
*Some genes tell our bodies how to make protein chains that are essential components of hemoglobin
*One pair of genes, called beta globin, tells the body how to make one of the components of hemoglobin
*Changes in these beta globin genes can alter the instructions and can result in different types of changes in the structure of hemoglobin
*We usually get one copy of the beta globin gene from our mother and one from our father
**We know that you inherited one gene that was altered and results in the variant hemoglobin C being made
**The other gene produces the usual type of hemoglobin Hb A
**The presence of only one altered copy of the beta globin gene almost never causes symptoms or health problems for the individual (There have been rare instances where Hb C carriers have had some eye problems)
**When an individual has one altered and one unaltered copy of a gene, we say that they are carriers

==Potential Risks for future offspring==
*A carrier for Hemoglobin C is at an increased risk for having children with a genetic condition (Hb SC disease) similar to, but less severe than sickle cell anemia.
*Are you familiar with sickle cell anemia?
*Sickle cell anemia occurs only if a person has inherited two hemoglobin S genes, one from each parent (Hb S is another variant of the beta globin gene and is even more common than hemoglobin C)
*Symptoms of sickle cell anemia include:
*Increased susceptibility to frequent infections
*Anemia (that is not corrected with iron supplementation)
*Painful episodes caused by the blood cells blocking blood flow to body tissues
*The risks to children of a carrier are dependent on whether or not the other partner carries a hemoglobin variant
*The fact that you are a carrier for Hb C means that there may be potential risks to your children, but this is only possible if your partner has sickle cell trait or Hb C trait
*If the father of the fetus tests positive for sickle cell trait or hemoglobin C trait there is a 25% chance that the fetus will have either hemoglobin SC disease or a mild form of anemia, a 1 in 50% chance that the fetus will be a carrier like one of the parents, and a 25% chance that the fetus will make only the usual hemoglobin (type A).

==Symptoms of Hemoglobin SC disease==
(also called Hemoglobin C disease)
*Hemoglobin SC disease is milder than sickle cell disease
*Sometimes the symptoms don't arise until middle or late in life
*Only physical sign is an enlarged spleen in 65% of individuals with Hb SC disease
*Mild (hemolytic) anemia may result, accompanied by a mild-to-moderate reduction in the red cell lifespan
*Patients may have sporadic episodes of joint pain.
*Continued hemolysis may produce pigmented gallstones, an unusual type of gallstone composed of the dark-colored contents of red blood cells. (The cause of pigment stones is uncertain.)
*Often goes unrecognized until a serious complication which may include
*blood in the urine (hematuria)
*pain in the hip where part of the leg bone tissue has died (aseptic necrosis of the femoral heads)
*eye problems (proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR)) which can result in bleeding in the eye and retinal detachment
*In large study in Jamaica, 1/3 with Hb SC disease had PSR at varying stages

==Hb C (homozygous)==
*mild hemolytic anemia with splenomegaly
*red blood cells contain less water
*less deformable and are not in circulation as long
*also have a decreased oxygen affinity
*may develop gallstones
*no special treatment necessary

==Incidence of sickle cell trait and Sickle cell anemia==
*Sickle cell trait occurs in about 8% (or 1 in 12) African Americans
*Prevalence among Hispanics whose families originated from the Caribbean, Central America, or South America is approximately 4% (or 1 in 24)
*Carrier rate among 2 million screened over 4 years in California showed 6,921 nonblack infants had sickle cell trait ( .35% or approximately 1 in 300)
*58 out of 2 million non black children had sickle cell disease from Calif. Newborn screen
*Carrier rate in Caucasians has been reported to be 1 in 600

==Frequency of hemoglobin SC disease and Hb C trait==
*In the US: Hemoglobin SC disease has an incidence of 0.017% less than 1 in 5000 n African Americans.
*Internationally: In northern Africa, the incidence of Hb C disease is approximately 0.03%.
*Hb SC disease is more common in individuals of African descent, but it also has been reported in people of Hispanic and Sicilian ancestry
*Gene frequency in African Americans is about 1 in every 100 to 1 in every 50 (1-2%)
*Gene frequencies are highest in Ghana and Upper Volta approaching about 1 in 7 (15%)

==Possible to have Hb C with other beta globin variants==
*Hb C and Beta Thalassemia if the Beta thal mutation is null (resulting in not functional beta chain production)
*Causes similar symptoms and problems as Hb SC disease

==Testing==
*Discuss ability to do simple blood test for partner to determine if they carry a Beta globin variant or Beta thalassemia so we can clarify risks for future children (hemoglobin electrophoresis with an A2 quanitiation to identify possible beta thalassemia)
*Covered by most insurance companies and can be ordered by primary care physician
*Some may require preauthorization so you may want to find out if this is necessary before ordering testing
*Direct mutation analysis by PCR possible but I will not discuss this because Hb electrophoresis should be sufficient
http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/dnadiagnostic/betavariants.htm (lab performs complete gene sequencing and testing of known mutations once electrophoresis has been performed)

==Psychosocial concerns==
*May be nervous and think it is more serious initially
*May be a lot of information to understand at once so talk about how it will be in letter
*Guilt about possibly passing on something that could cause health problems
*Ethnic issues surrounding the higher prevalence among minority populations that have been oppressed in the past.

==Other Facts about Hb C==
*Hemoglobin C is composed of 2 normal alpha-chains and 2 variant beta-chains, where lysine has replaced glutamic acid at position 6
*This unstable hemoglobin is less soluble and it tends to crystallize
*Intracellular crystals lead to a decrease in red cell deformability and blood that is more viscous
*The spleen effectively removes these crystal-containing cells
*Hemoglobin C trait is not detected by solubility testing or by a sickle cell preparation.
*Heterozygotes have as much as 35% hemoglobin C

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Symbolic Integration with Maple==
Tired of looking up tables of integrals? In case you don't have access to Maple, here's a cheatsheet that is extremely useful for your reference:  [http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/cheat.pdf Tables of Integrals, Trig Identities, Advanced Mathematics, and much more]

Want to check the correctness of your hand-worked solution? Want an easy way to generate/learn mathematical LaTeX?

To make sure that the typed integral is right, before asking Maple to actually evaluate it, use the inert command ''Int'':
 &gt;Int((cos(omega*t + phi))^2,t=0..2*Pi/omega);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2\pi/\omega} {\cos(\omega t + \phi)}^2 dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To evaluate the integral use the command ''value''.
 &gt;value(%);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Symbolic Differentiation with Maple==
The inert differentiation operator is ''Diff'':
 &gt;Diff(ln(x),x);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\ln(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt;value(%);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Solving partial fraction decompositions with Maple==
A borrowed trick from Matlab (using the fundamental theorem of calculus):

To integrate it, it will probably have to do a partial fraction expansion, so we let it do the expansion when it integrates, then differentiate to get our rational expression converted/decomposed into partial fractions:
 &gt;diff(int((5*x+1) / (x^2-1),x),x);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{x-1} + \frac{2}{1+x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Maple has partial fraction expansion built in, though, if you want to do it directly.
The command is 
 &gt;convert( (5*x+1) / (x^2-1), parfrac, x);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{x-1} + \frac{2}{1+x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Disadvantages are the bread and butter of negative strategy. As opposed to arguments about the &quot;case&quot;, they are normally described as &quot;off-case&quot; arguments and are expected to be flowed on separate pieces of paper from the sheets used to flow the 1AC. Almost self-evidently, disadvantages represent the opposite of the affirmative advantages. They present possible undesirable effects of the plan action, usually effects that are somewhat distinct from the plan advantages. In theory, disadvantages and case turns are hard to distinguish, but in practice they diverge. Normally, disadvantages are more complex arguments, frequently presenting several instances of cause and effect. By virtue of presenting the argument on separate sheets of paper, the negative also stresses the importance of the argument and forces its discussion in an isolated and contained manner.

A disadvantage is usually composed of several basic components.

The first is the uniqueness, in which a debater states that the disadvantage is not occurring under the status quo. This is usually the most recent piece of evidence in the DA.  Alternatively, the debator may choose to run what is called an &quot;internal link.&quot; Internal links are those where a plank from the affirmative plan is used as both the link and the uniqueness.  For example, if plank 1 of the affirmative plan advocates using the Supreme Court to overturn inherency, then the internal link of the disadvantage can be that the Supreme Court is used, and thus the affirmative must allot for the impacts described in the disad shell.

The next is the link which states that the AFF plan causes the DA if it is passed. 
 
Third is the internal link which connects the first link to the impacts. This is not always necessary.

Finally, the impacts are run. These are the so what of the DA. This is what the judge is supposed to vote on in the round. 

A good strategy in running a DA is to ask the judge to envision that he is a policymaker in the real world. Make him think that he is the President of the US and must decide to pass the legislation(plan) or not. Say that the impacts happen if passed, and that nothing is bad with the Status Quo.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A few notes here. First, we don't want to spend too much time working on this section. We don't want to make grammarians out of people. Instead, they need to know just enough to stop from doing things that will detract from their ethos as writers. They don't really need to know all the terms for things; just how to write sentences that are free of errors. Many of us love grammar for its own sake, but it tends to scare students. Most students will try to use these pages to figure out problems their teachers have identified in their writing. We should write clear explanations and plenty of examples--all the while avoiding jargon. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 01:34, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

I changed some terms and some capitalization in the headers for the errors list because of inconsistency and logic problems: if we're going to call them errors, &quot;subject-verb agreement&quot; isn't an error, it's a topic area. &quot;When subjects and verbs don't agree&quot; is an error. I agree to a certain extent about the jargon, but some terms are unavoidable and are helpful for clarity and brevity, both in presenting and learning; a few select terms and brief definitions are helpful tools to arm writers.   -- Parrhesia

Sounds good to me. BTW, if you look at the toolbar that pops up when you edit the page, one button looks like a signature. It's a useful tool for leaving your name and time. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 17:14, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

== Links  ==

I think the links at the bottom could use some brief annotations. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 19:17, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

== Other stuff ==

I was wondering about the possibility of adding sections such as:
who/whom, &quot;to lay versus to lie&quot;, &quot;affect&quot; versus &quot;effect&quot; -- just some common errors writer's tend to make.  Comments?  Are they located somewhere else in the book?  --[[User:Kyoung|Kyoung]] 03:31, 14 November 2007 (UTC)

They may be in the editing section, but seems like a &quot;usage&quot; or &quot;common mistakes&quot; section would be a good addition. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 20:26, 29 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hemoglobinopathy Screening and Hemoglobin D-Punjab'''

==Family History==
*Some of the things I'm looking for in your family history include:
**Birth defects
**History of pregnancy losses
**learning difficulties or MR
**chronic health problems
**anemia or blood problems
**anyone that has difficulty breathing or fatigues easily
**anyone who has had pregnancy losses
**anyone who died at a young age or unexpectedly
**Anything else that you think might be running in your family
**Ask details about country where relatives are from because Hemoglobin D trait is more common in some ethnicities
*In Punjab region of India and Pakistan it is much more common (up to 3% of the population is has hemoglobin D trait)
*Also more common in people of English, Irish, or Scottish descent than other ethnic groups
*Estimated prevalence among American blacks is .1-.4% (Zago MA and Costa FF (1988))
**Ask about consanguinity

==Hemoglobin D-trait==

==Overview of Hemoglobin and genes==
*Hemoglobin is the protein in blood that carries oxygen and gives blood its red color
*There are hundreds of different hemoglobin variants
**Hemoglobin A is the usual type of hemoglobin that is made in children and adults
**Hemoglobin D is one of the many hemoglobin variants
*The kind of hemoglobin our body makes depends on the genes we inherit
*Genes are the units of inheritance that tell our bodies how to grow and develop
*Some genes tell our bodies how to make protein chains that are essential components of hemoglobin
*One pair of genes tells the body how to make a component of hemoglobin are called beta globin genes
*Changes in these beta globin genes can alter the instructions for the cell and can result in different hemoglobinopathies
*We usually get one copy of the beta globin gene from our mother and one from our father
**We know that ____ inherited one gene that was altered and results in the variant hemoglobin D being made and one gene that is unchanged and results in the usual hemoglobin, hemoglobin A.
**The presence of one of the normal genes is enough to keep an individual form having any symptoms we call these people carriers

==Potential Risks for future offspring==
*If a person has two genes that are variants then they may have some health problems, but whether they do and the extent of problems depends on the variants they have
*One of the more common variants of the beta globin gene is one that causes sickle cell trait and sickle cell anemia due to a specific change
*Are you familiar with sickle cell disease
*Sickle cell disease only occurs if a person has two beta globin genes with the specific change present
*A person has sickle cell trait if they have one of the normal genes and one of the variant genes called S (and like those with hemoglobin D trait they do not have symptoms)
*Sickle cell trait is more common than hemoglobin D trait
*Sickle cell trait occurs in about 8% of African Americans
*Prevalence among Hispanics whose families originated from the Caribbean, Central America, or South America is approximately 4%
*Carrier rate among 2 million screened over 4 years in California showed 6,921 nonblack infants had sickle cell trait ( .35%)
*58 out of 2 million non black children had sickle cell disease from Calif. Newborn screen
*When one partner has hemoglobin D trait and the other has sickle cell trait there is a 1 in 4 or 25% chance with each pregnancy that the child will have what is called sickle/D disease or (SD disease). (draw punnett square)
*SD disease is similar to Sickle cell Disease
*They can have severe hemolytic anemia (when they are asymptomatic the Hb D is usually a different variant)
*May have enlarged spleen, periods of severe pain called crisis, and often require blood transfusions
*They can have some of the serious life-threatening complications seen in individuals with sickle cell anemia such as increased risk of infections that will require prompt medical treatment
*(Perea F J ''et al.'' 1999) reported 4 people with SD had chronic hemolytic anemia and similar course to those with severe sickle cell anemia
*Child reported in 1984 had severe life threatening complications
*Early diagnosis and education to recognize problems and treat promptly can decrease mortality rates

==Also possible to have Hb D-Punjab with other variants==
*Hb D (homozygous)
*Most reports show that Hb D homozygous individuals do not have symptoms (Adekile, A D ''et al.'' (1996) and Zago, MA &amp; Costa FF (1988).)
*Hematology is essentially normal in these individuals (Adekile AD ''et al.'' (1996)).
*Hb D and beta thalassemia trait reportedly to be even more rare than Hb D homozygotes
*Showed to not cause problems in at least 13 individuals reported worldwide as of 1999
*(Perea FJ ''et al.'' 1999) reported 3 patients with Beta thal / HbD with similar values to beta thal/ beta A heterozygote and showed microcytic and hypochromic anemia, but no harmful consequences

==Testing==
*Discuss ability to do simple blood test for parents to determine if they are carriers for the variants so we can clarify risks for future children (hemoglobin electrophoresis with an A2 quanitiation to identify possible beta thal)
*Covered by most insurance companies
*Some may require preauthorization so you may want to find out if this is necessary before ordering testing
*Also possible to perform this testing on future partner of _____ to determine if her children are at risk for any of the hemoglobinopathies and she may want genetic counseling when she reaches a point in her life where she is considering having a family.
*Direct mutation analysis by PCR possible (see below)

==Beta Globin Variants==
*Gene: ß globin
*Test: Direct mutation analysis by PCR for Hb C, E, O-Arab, D-Punjab, or other KNOWN variants as specified by the referrer.
*CPT Codes:
*(For descriptive purposes only) 83891 x1
*83894 x2
*83898 x1
*83904 x2
*83912 x1
*Sensitivity: Should be high
*Turnaround Time: Up to 3 weeks
*Cost: $200 per individual
*$600 per fetus
*Special Considerations: We require hemoglobin electrophoresis &amp; other relevant clinical confirmation with each sample.
*This test is for molecular confirmation of a known beta globin variant. If the beta globin variant is unknown, please order the beta globin complete gene sequencing test.
*http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/dnadiagnostic/betavariants.htm

==How does the screening test determine which category a baby fits?==
*Newborn screening test done in Utah since Sep 2001 measures the percentage of different types of hemoglobins using hemoglobin electrophoresis

==Psychosocial concerns==
*may be nervous and think there is something serious
*may be a lot of information to understand at once so talk about letter
*guilt about passing on something
*May be concerned about risks for future pregnancies

==Facts about Hb D==
*Hb D most common form is called Hb D-Punjab after the area in India and Pakistan where it is most frequent
*Hb D-Punjab is also referred to as Hb D-Los Angeles and by other names
*Hemoglobin D co-migrates with hemoglobin S at alkaline pH
*Hb D does not sickle
*Hb D is fourth most frequently occurring Hb variant
*Hb D results from a GAA -&gt;CAA mutation at codon 121 glutamic acid changed to glutamine
*Quantity in heterozygote is ~40% and has been found in combination with Hb S, Hb C, Hb E, beta-thal, alpha-thal, and homozygous state

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hemophilia and Von Willebrand Disease'''


Hemophilia (- term to include hemophilia A (factor 8), hemophilia B (factor 9) and von Willebrand's Disease)

==Von Willebrand Disease (Vascular Hemophilia or pseudohemophilia)==
*Caused by lack of von Willebrand factor
**Usually helps in the clotting process by binding to the surface of the wall and then making platelets bind to the surface of the blood vessel wall. Once they bind, it brings other platelets to clump on the surface=blood stops flowing and a clot is formed.
**It is the thing that locates the platelets to the correct spot = affects platelet adhesion process.
**People may have a smaller amount of protein produced or they have a change in function.
**von Willebrand protein is also a carrier protein for Factor 8 = if it is not working properly you have decreased factor 8 as well.
*Prevalence = up to 1/100 (1%) of the population
*Characteristics - VARY even in families
**Easy bruising is the major problem
**Recurrent nosebleeds
**Heavy menstrual cycles
**Bleeding after surgery
**Bleeding at delivery of a baby (during pregnancy you get increased vWf )
*Diagnosis
**Best done by clinical diagnosis and family history
**Also done by homeostasis screening tests (but they can be normal in mild cases)
***Bleeding time - a test that gets messed up by taking aspirin
***Antigenic levels of vWf - an immunoassay
****mild = 25-35% normal amount
****severe = &lt;5%
****affected by blood type = A, B, AB have higher levels 48-240 u/dl and O have 36-160 u/dl.
***Platelet aggregation studies - only aggregation with ristocetin would be informative
***Von Willebrand factor activity = looks at ristocetin co-factor. Usually low if above is low.
***Von Willebrand multimers = look to see if the reason it is not functioning is because the larger multimers are not present.
**Direct DNA testing for Type IIA or IIB
**Problems with pregnancy, newborn period, times of stress or agitation
*Inheritance
**AR (severe or Type III)
**AD (mild, Type IIA and IIB)
**You can be a symptomatic or asymptomatic carrier depending on other factors.
**Chromosome 12
*Treatment
**Either drug or blood products - intravenously
**Type I = DDAVP (Stimate) - synthetic agent that releases vWf from storage sites. Only works if there is some vWf present.
**Type IIA = DDAVP
**Type IIB = Humate-P or cryoprecipitate
**Severe = Humate-P or cryoprecipitate
**Platelet type = platelet concentrates
**Factor 8 concentrates Do NOT work because they don't have enough vWf.
*Lifestyle
**Mild = treatment only before surgery
**Severe = avoid taking aspirin and avoid activities with high risk of injury. Take Tylenol instead.

==Hemophilia A and B==
*Caused by decrease of lack of Factor 8 or 9
**Coagnulation is a process of activation of a variety of factors in sequence (I-XIII)
**Deficiency in the factors can be Type I (reduced concentration) or Type II (defect in function)
**Factor 8 is called the Antihaemophilic globulin
**Factor 9 is the Christmas factor
*Characteristics
**Muscle or joint bleeding
**&lt;5% the normal value have spontaenous bleeding (esp. &lt;2%)
**&gt;5% have bleeding after sugeries
*Inheritance
**X-linked recessive
*Diagnosis
**The two in indistinguishable clinically = they have to determined by specific factor assays.
**Clotting factor assays

==Hemophilia A==
*Incidence 1/10,000
*Genetics/inheritance
**X linked recessive
**In 1/3 cases it is a new mutation
**The gene is close to the tip Xq.
**Heterogenetic
*Values
**plasma levels of factor 8: normal = 0.5-1.5 iu/ml
**Carriers = 50% normal value typically (can be affected by lionization)
**&lt;.02 iu/ml = severe
**0.02-0.05 iu/ml = moderate
**&gt;0.05 iu/ml = mild
*Characteristics
**spontaneous recurrent bleeding in the knees, elbows, ankles, shoulders (large joints and muscles!!!)
**bleeding occurs 2-4 times per month
**Starts around 6 months (mobility)
**Can lead to lots of pain and loss of cartilage and osteoartrithis
**There can be intrcranial bleeding = death in adults
*Diagnosis
**Reduced factor 8
**Normal vWf, Rcofactor, and bleeding time
*Treatment
**Provide Factor 8 concentrates to arrest bleeding immediately
*Prenatal testing
**Traditionally a two step process: sexing (by amnio at16 weeks) and then blood drawing(19-20 weeks)
**CVS can be done with gene probes that have been determined by the mother and family prior to testing.

==Hemophilia B==
*Prevalence
**1/5 that of Hemophilia A
*Cause
**Deficiency of Factor 9 which is Vitamin K dependant
*Genetics/Inheritance
**X-linked recessive
*Characteristics
**same as above
*Treatment
**Give frozen plasma
**Give factor 9 concentrate
*Values
**Vary greatly but generally use above values for A

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hereditary Breast Cancer - BRCA1 and BRCA2'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*Introduce myself as a GC student
*Elicit any questions or concerns
*Find out about how she first found out that she had cancer
*Assess what she knows about hereditary breast cancer
*Find out how she feels about testing
*Address any immediate concerns
*Outline what will be done during visit
**Other concerns will be answered in more detail
**Review medical and family history
**Hereditary vs. nonhereditary cancer
**Genes associated with breast/ovarian cancer
**General risks and risk for you and your family

==Family and Medical History==
*Review their medical history
*Explain the pedigree (looking for anything that might have a genetic component, but focusing in detail on cancers in the family)
*Obtain information on the family
*Affected members
**Current age
**Age of onset
**Type and location of primary cancer (unilateral/bilateral)
***Stage of cancer
***Stage 0 is a noninvasive tumor
***Stage I is a small locally invasive tumor w/out lymph node involvement
***Stage II is a medium-sized tumor with or without lymph node involvement
***Stage III is a locally advanced cancer, usually with axillary node matastases
***Stage IV has already metastasized to distant sites
**Other cancers
**Environmental exposures
**Any other health concerns
*Unaffected members
**Current age
**Health history
**If deceased -age and cause

==Hereditary vs. Sporadic Cancer==
*Everybody is at risk for developing cancer and there are both non-genetic and genetic risk factors that may increase a person's risk for breast cancer (* are the main ones to mention)
**Gender (99% of breast cancer occurs in women)
**Age (77% occur after age 50)
**Menarche before age 9 (RR 1.2)
**Menopause after age 50-52 (RR 2.0)
**Nulliparity (RR 2.0) except for BRCA mutation carriers, it makes them more likely to develop breast cancer by age 40 than nulliparous carriers
**Previous history of breast biopsies
**Atypical hyperplasia diagnosed by breast biopsy
**Obesity
**Hormone replacement therapy increase risk of breast cancer if used for more than 5-10 years. However HRT seems to decrease risk of ovarian cancer
**Oral contraceptives may slightly increase risk, but it is dependent on dosage of progestin and estrogen. (Those using lower doses of estrogens and progestins did not seem to have an increased risk while those using the early contraceptives that were higher dosage did have some slight increase.)
**Major cancer susceptibility genes may account for 5-10% of breast cancer
**Less than 1 % associated with genetic syndromes such as Cowden, Bloom, Peutz-Jeghers, and Werner's syndromes.
*Lifetime risk of breast cancer in women is 11-12%
*Usually when a person gets breast cancer it is sporadic meaning the individual did not inherit a genetic predisposition for breast cancer
*A small percentage get cancer that is inherited (hereditary cancer)
**5-10% of breast cancer is inherited (2/3 (66%) of these are associated with BRCA1/2)
**5-10% of ovarian cancer is inherited (90% are BRCA1/2)
*Clues we look for in determining whether cancer is hereditary
**Cancer in 2 close relatives on same side of family
**More than one affected generation
**Early age at diagnosis (under age 45-50 for breast cancer)
**Bilateral/ multiple primary tumors
**Rare/ unusual cancers (i.e. male breast cancer)
**Combination of tumors consistent with specific cancer syndrome (i.e. individual with both breast and ovarian cancer)
*15-20% of individuals with breast cancer are not likely to have a single gene predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer, but have more family members with breast cancer than we would expect simply by chance. These individuals have familial cancer. The reason for the higher prevalence of cancer in these families is unknown, but it may be the combination of a few predisposing genes as well as environmental factors.
*Explain the reasons we think their family is or is not at risk of having hereditary cancer

==Genes Associated with Cancer==
*Hereditary cancers are caused by a change in a specific gene
*Explain genes and chromosomes
*Explain location of the known genes that predispose a person to breast and ovarian cancer
**BRCA1: chromosome 17q (women with it carry a 56-87% lifetime risk of breast cancer 5-8 X's the risk of general population)
**BRCA2: chromosome 13q (37-85% lifetime risk of breast cancer, 10-20% risk of ovarian cancer compared to 1.5% for other women, 6% lifetime risk for male breast cancer which is over 100 fold increase compared to general pop risk in males)
*These are both tumor suppressor genes that control whether our cells are allowed to divide
*When there is a change in the gene it is turned off or doesn't function properly
*Changes in our genes are happening all the time due to environmental factors and to mistakes that can be made when a cell divides
*When both copies of the gene are inactivated, the cell doesn't know when it is allowed to divide and it will therefore divide uncontrollably.
*This can lead to cancer
*In the case of sporadic cancer both copies of the gene in the same cell have to be altered
*In heritable cancer, if you inherit an altered nonfunctional gene you only need one change to occur in the other copy of the gene in one cell to get cancer. So you are essentially one step closer to cancer and this may explain why we see earlier onset of hereditary cancer and a higher risk.

==Risk Assessment==
*Background risks:
**Ashkenazi Jewish - 1/40 risk of carrying one of the 3 specific BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations
**Non-Ashkenazi: 1/400 risk of carrying any mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2
*Risks can be estimated based on the family history
*Various models used to estimate risks of having one of these genes in the family
*When this was done for your family it was found that your risk of having BRCA1 or BRCA2 was _______________
*Just because someone has a mutation in one of these genes doesn't mean they will develop cancer but their risks of developing certain types of cancer increase
*Some individuals with a cancer predisposing gene will survive to an elderly age without developing cancer
*Among those that do develop cancer the age of onset varies
*It is uncertain why some individuals will have multiple primary cancers before age 50 while others with the same predisposing gene may not develop cancer until age 70
*The lifetime chance of getting breast cancer in the general population of women is about 11-12%.
*The risk is significantly increased in women with a mutation (50-85% for both BRCA1/2)
*The chance of having a second breast cancer that is not a recurrence is also very high in mutation carriers (40-60% BRCA1).
*The chance of having ovarian cancer is also significantly increased from about 1-2% in the general population up to about 15-45% in BRCA1 carriers and 10-20% in BRCA 2 carriers
*Males can be mutation carriers also and develop breast cancer (males that carry BRCA2 mutations have about 6% chance, a 100 fold increase)
*Other cancers possibly increased risk with BRCA1 mutation (prostate RR=3.3 and colon RR=4.0)
*BRCA2 mutation associated with increased prostate, laryngeal and pancreatic cancer risks (unknown magnitude of increased risk)

==Testing Options==
*BRCA1/BRCA2 testing is offered if the risk is calculated to be 10% or higher
*Testing usually begins with an affected family member because if they are found not to have a mutation then it tells us more information than if an unaffected member did not have a mutation in one of these genes
*If a mutation is found in that family member than it is less expensive to test unaffected family members because they look for that same mutation
*Types of testing
**Comprehensive BRACAnalysis
***sequencing of both BRCA1 and BRCA2
***Myriad cost is $3100
**Rapid BRACAnalysis
***same as BRACAnalysis, but results in 7-10 days
***Myriad cost is $3680
**Single site BRACAnalysis
***Single mutation analysis for individuals with known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in the family
***Myriad cost is $440
**Multisite 3 BRACAnalysis (detects about 83% of mutations in this population 17% are carriers of other mutations)
***Three mutation analysis for Ashkenazi individuals
***Myriad cost is $535
***If a negative result can do full sequencing

==Test Results==
*3 possible results
*NEGATIVE --Neither of the two genes have changes in them. If this were the case it wouldn't rule out the suspicion that the family has a hereditary form of breast cancer. However, if there is no history of ovarian cancer it might ease their mind because then it could be assumed that their risk of ovarian cancer is probably not likely to be increased above the population risk
*VARIANT OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE --There is a change but we are unsure of what it means and whether it would lead to an increased cancer risk (estimated to occur about 10% of time)
*POSITIVE --A change is found in the gene that would cause it not to make a functional protein and would therefore lead to an increased cancer risk
*Test results back in about 4-6 weeks
*The lab will call when they are about to send the results and we will make a follow-up appointment to go over what the results mean and what the options are

==Testing Pros==
*Know your risk more definitively
*Know risk to your children of carrying the gene
*Reduce anxiety often associated with not knowing
*Choose prevention options based upon results

==Testing Cons==
*Cost of the procedure
*Insurance issues ( i.e. whether or not they want their insurance company to pay for the test, but this is probably more of an issue for those that don't already have cancer)
*Fear of genetic discrimination, although there is no evidence that this is a problem (Should not be a problem if on a group health insurance plan due to HIPAA.)
*Adverse psychological effects
**Transmitter guilt
**Survivor guilt
**Depression
**Anxiety
*Other family members may not want to know
*Result may not be informative if a variant is found of uncertain significance and this may provoke even more anxiety and uncertainty

==Screening Options==
*More aggressive screening may be considered when there is an increased risk for developing breast or ovarian cancer
**Breast screening
***Mammography every year beginning at age 25-35 for mutation carriers
***Clinical breast exam every 6 months beginning by age 20
***Monthly self-breast exam beginning by age 18
**Ovarian screening
***Not shown to be effective in large-scale clinical trials
***Transvaginal U/S w/ color doplar imaging, CA-125, and pelvic exam every 6-12 months starting age 25-35

==Possible Prevention Options==
*Prophylactic surgeries
*prophylactic mastectomy
*reduces breast cancer risk by 90% and death by 81% (Mayo Clinic retrospective study between 1960-1993 that did not include mutation status, but many were probably mutation carriers)
*reconstruction (TRAM transverse rectus abdominal muscle, silicone or saline implants)
*most women satisfied with mastectomy but may cause body image and self-esteem problems and they lose nipple sensitivity
*in individuals with mutations risk of second cancer if breast tissue remains is estimated to be 60% by age 70
*prophylactic oophorectomy
*reduces risk of ovarian cancer (BUT no guarantee because ovarian cancer can arise in the peritoneum so risk is reduced to about 2-5%)
*reduces breast cancer risk by up to 70% if removed before age 40 and 40% if removed between 40-49, not really significant change if removed after 50
*recommended after child bearing is complete
*Chemoprevention
*tamoxifen reduces breast cancer risk by 45% in high-risk women (but unknown if BRCA carriers have the same benefit) data suggest that in mutation carriers it is effective at reducing risk of second primary cancer in long term survivors and reduces contralateral breast cancer by 50-75%
*raloxifene may reduce breast cancer risk
*birth control pills used for a total of 6 years or more reduces ovarian cancer by 60% in BRCA mutation carriers and after 3 years reduces it by 40-50%, but may slightly increase breast cancer risk

==Psychosocial Assessment==
*Are there any other questions or concerns?
*Determine interest in options?
*Why does the person want or not want testing?
*What will the client do with the result (both positive and negative result)?
*Will she change medical management?
*Who will she share the result with?
*If testing is decided on determine if they would want to bring someone back with them when they receive their results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) and Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*Thank you for filling out the forms that we sent you
*I reviewed the information and understand that you have some questions and concerns about breast cancer, HNPP specifically genetic testing, heart disease and allergies.
*Do you have other questions or concerns?
*Do you (B) have any questions or concerns?

==Pedigree==
(already put together from intake, but ask some more questions)
*Anyone else with a diagnosis of HNPP?
*Anyone in the family have muscle weakness
*Anyone with sensory loss (i.e. insensitive to heat or cold or touch)
*Anyone with toes or feet that are mishapen or look unusual
*Anyone with difficulty walking or moving
*Anyone else with cancer in the family
*Anyone with birth defects (spina bifida, heart defects, cleft lip)
*Anyone with MR or LD
*Consanguinity and ethnicity
*Review who has allergies and heart disease (anyone else?)
*Anything that you didn't already mention in the form you filled out that you are concerned might be hereditary?

==Medical and Psychosocial History==
*Could you explain how you were diagnosed with HNPP?
*When did you first notice symptoms?
*What symptoms do you have?
*Does it interfere with your daily activities?
*What have you done to help deal with the symptoms?
*What is the most difficult part of having HNPP?
*Do you have any concerns about the diagnosis?
*Has anyone explained the inheritance of HNPP?
*Do you have any other health problems?
*Assess if he works or attends school
*How is his support network
*Do friends know about diagnosis

==Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)==
*Tumor that is confined to the lobule (milk producing glands) of the breast
*Noninvasive tumor that is not believed to progress to cancer
*Behaves differently from the more common invasive cancers
*Risk is increased for breast cancer though, in women with LCIS
**Study of 211 patients followed for 30 years and only 36 developed invasive cancer (13%)
**These cancers occurred in either breast and were not confined to original LCIS location
**Some experts therefore believe that LCIS is not a true precancer
*Only 6 of the 36 died of cancer and none of those six came back for regular exams
*Other studies since show range of invasive breast cancer risk after LCIS between 16-27% over 30 years.
*Relative risk for breast cancer if diagnosed with LCIS is 7.2 (chart from Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book and calculated using the study of 211 patients)
*Prevention options include:
**Bilateral mastectomy-some choose because they want to know they have done everything they can to prevent cancer
**Follow-up exams every 6 mos and yearly mammograms.
**Take tamoxifen for less than 5 years (shown to decrease chance of breast cancer 56% in women with LCIS)
*There is no need to make an immediate decision
*Radiation and chemo are not necessary
*No reason to obtain clean margins since it doesn't become cancer itself

==Hereditary Breast Cancer==
*All cancers are due to changes in the genetic material of cells
*However, most cancer is sporadic (meaning that a person does not usually inherit a genetic predisposition that makes them more susceptible to cancer)
*In about 5-10% of breast cancers, the woman has inherited a single predisposing gene for breast cancer and we call this hereditary breast cancer.
*Although LCIS increases risk for breast cancer in an individual, it is not related to hereditary breast cancer and does not increase your risk of having inherited a mutation in one of the predisposing genes
*The two known genes that account for most hereditary breast cancer are BRCA1 and BRCA2
*These genes act like brakes on a car and help tell the cell when to stop dividing
*If there are changes in these genes it is like the brakes of a car went out and the cell can continue to divide and may lead to cancer
*In families that have a mutation in one of these genes we see a number of characteristics that are clues that there is a hereditary cancer
*These include-(show visual aid)
*Based on family history we can calculate the chance of having a BRCA mutation, but we don't use LCIS in the calculation because it is not associated with an increased risk for these mutations. (We only use individuals with invasive cancer in the risk assessment)
*Even in families that have a couple of these clues their chance of having a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 can still be quite low
*For instance, I saw a patient last week with breast cancer dx in her 40's and her mother and maternal grandmother had breast cancer in their 60's, but their chance of having a mutation was only around 10%
*These families, if they do not have a mutation found, are more likely to fall into a category called familial breast cancer (where we see more breast cancer than expected by chance which is probably due to a number of factors, but these factors are unknown at this time)

==Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies==

==Overview==
*Disorder of peripheral nerves (nerves traveling to the limbs)
*Predisposes individuals to repeated pressure neuropathies (i.e. carpal tunnel syndrome and peroneal palsy with foot drop)
*Slowly progressive, hereditary, neuromuscular disorder which makes an individual susceptible to nerve injury from pressure, stretch or repetitive use.
*When injured, the nerves demyelinate or lose their insulating covering
*Pressure palsies are episodes of numbness and weakness in the injured area
*Recovery is often complete (if not the resulting disability is usually mild)
*Some have signs of mild to mod peripheral neuropathy

==Prevalence==
*Uncertain, but estimated to be 2-5 cases per 100,000 (may be higher due to undiagnosed cases)

==Description==
*Recurrent sensory and motor neuropathy in a single nerve beginning in adolescence or young adulthood
*Most common symptom is acute onset of non-painful mononeuropathy
*History of physical compression of nerve may or may not be present
*Usually starts in 20's to 30's but range is 10-70's
*Some asymptomatic and some may have just one episode
*Most common sites
**Peroneal nerve causing foot drop
**Ulnar nerve causing weakness, atrophy and sensory loss over hand
**Median nerve at wrist causing carpal tunnel syndrome and sensory loss over thumb and index finger
*Full recovery in days to months occurs in ½ of episodes
*Remaining symptoms rarely severe
*Some develop diffuse polyneuropathy (% unknown)
*Absent ankle reflexes (50-80%)
*Diffusely reduced tendon reflexes (15-30%)
*Mild to moderate pes cavus foot deformity (20% of symptomatic individuals)
*One case reported with severe respiratory insufficiency (gene deletion and proximal muscle atrophy)

==Diagnosis==
*Established in adults who have recurrent focal compression neuropathies and a family history consistent with AD inheritance
*Presence of underlying neuropathy further supports dx
*Other phenotypes besides typical presentation
**Recurrent positional short-term sensory symptoms
**Progressive mononeuropathy
**CMT-like polyneuropathy
**Chronic sensory polyneuropathy
**Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy-like
*Some patients can be asymptomatic
*Delayed nerve conduction may be present
*Prolongation of distal nerve conduction latencies (found in virtually all patients even if no symptoms)
*General nerve speed is normal, but some have diffuse polyneuropathy
*Key diagnostic features (Mouton 1999)
**Bilateral slowing of sensory and motor nerve conduction at carpal tunnel with at least one abnormal finding for motor conduction in one peroneal nerve
*Sural nerve biopsy often shows demyelination and focal enlargement of nerve (tomaculous change) but this is not specific for HNPP

==Genetics==
*Due to changes or deletion of PMP22 gene (peripheral myelin protein 22) located at 17p11.2
*Gene is similar to growth arrest specific gene in mouse and rat
*There are flanking repeat sequences at the locus which may be mechanism for deletion
*Likely that there is gene dosage effect because mutations are not gain of function
*Normal gene product present in compact myelin and this PMP22 protein decreased in peripheral nerve of those affected

==Inheritance and Risks==
*Autosomal Dominant (AD) inheritance with most individuals inheriting it
*Parents may serve as carriers without showing signs or symptoms
*Child has a sporadic mutation
*Parent is asymptomatic or mildly affected and was not diagnosed
*50% risk to sibling if parent affected
*No instances of germline mosaicism, but theoretically possible
*50% risk to children of affected

==Genetic testing==
*DNA testing for deletion that includes PMP22 gene
*Detects 80% of patients and available clinically
*Remaining 20% have a point mutation producing frameshifts, premature termination or other abnormalities of protein (a number of which can be tested for clinically)
*There are some geneotype phenotype correlations for frameshift and point mutations
*Can test at risk adults who are asymptomatic
**Should discuss motivation for testing (Why would it be helpful to them to be tested)
**Discuss life, health, disability insurance coverage and employment discrimination
*Do not test asymptomatic children due to it being adult onset
**Removes their choice to not know
**Possibility of stigmatization

==Prenatal testing==
not offered because not clinically available

==Related disorders and Differential Diagnosis==
*(Charcot Marie Tooth) CMT1A and some patients with CMT4 also have mutations in the gene PMP22
*pressure palsies most commonly result of environmentally acquired compression
*those with underlying neuropathy (i.e. if have diabetes mellitus), increased risk of compression neuropathies
*acquired type of pressure palsies same as those in HNPP
*Charcot Marie Tooth
*Sometimes HNPP involves brachial plexus and can overlap symptoms of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (distinct disorder maps to 17q)

==Management==
*No treatment for biochemical defect or special diet or vitamins alter HNPP
*Risk factors for PP's
**Sitting with legs crossed
**Occupations with repetitive wrist motions
**Leaning on elbows prolonged period
**Rapid weight loss
*Bracing may be useful (wrist splint or ankle-foot-orthosis (AFO) for foot drop)
*Controversial whether surgical decompression of nerve is beneficial

== Contracting ==
* Introductions
* What are your main concerns? What do you hope to learn today?
* What do you know about colon cancer?

== Review Family and Medical History ==
* Medical History
** How have you gotten to this point?
** Screening practices?
** Other significant illnesses, hospitalizations?
* Family History
** Other individuals with any type of cancer?
** If affected:
*** Age and date at diagnosis, death
*** Current age
*** Type, location, stage of primary cancer
*** Secondary cancer - metastasis or new primary
*** Environmental exposures
** If unaffected:
*** Current age
*** Health and history of illness
*** If deceased, cause and age at death
** Screening practices
** Family thoughts on cause of cancer?

== Colon Cancer ==
* Third leading cause of cancer in men and women
** 9% of new cancer diagnoses, 11% of all cancer deaths
** Incidence is over 130,000 new cases per year
** About 5-10% of all colorectal cancers are hereditary
*** 3-5% due to HNPCC
*** 1% due to FAP
** About 10-30% of colorectal cancers are familial
* Caused by uncontrolled proliferation of cells in colon or rectum
** Symptoms may include blood in stool, diarrhea, constipation, stomach cramps, frequent bloating, weight loss, or unusual and continuing lack of energy
** Cancer cells may enter blood or lymphatic system and metastasize to form secondary tumors in other parts of body
* Multifactorial disorder involving both genetic and non-genetic factors
** Non-genetic factors
*** Diet: high fat, low fiber, high red meat intake
*** Colorectal polyps (adenomatous polyps)
*** Alcohol, cigarettes
*** Chronic disease of bowel (Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis)
*** Obesity
** Genetic factors
*** Hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes
**** HNPCC and FAP
**** Rare colorectal syndromes: Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, Juvenile Polyposis Coli
*** All cancers have genetic component but not all are hereditary

== Genetic Etiology of Hereditary Colon Cancer ==
* Autosomal dominant inheritance
** Each child of mutation carrier has 50% chance of inheriting mutation
** Mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes
*** MSH2 at 2p22
*** MLH1 at 3p21
*** PMS1 at 2q31
*** PMS2 at 7p22
*** MSH6 at 2p16
*** 60% of HNPCC due to mutations in MSH2 or MLH1
** Carcinogenesis due to loss of heterozygosity of one of genes above
*** Causes defective mismatch repair
*** Mutations accumulate throughout the genome
** Microsatellite instability (MSI)
*** Provides indirect evidence for presence or absence of germline mutation
*** Due to genome wide instability of replication and repair of repeat sequences
*** 10-15% of sporadic tumors show MSI, &gt;95% of HNPCC tumors show MSI
* Penetrance variable - use lifetime cancer risks for mutation carriers
** Mutation also increases risk for other types of cancer besides colorectal cancer
** 30% risk of second primary 10 years after original diagnosis
** 50% risk of second primary 15 years after original diagnosis

== Cancer Risk Assessment ==
* Features of hereditary colorectal cancer
** More than one generation affected
** Early age at diagnosis
** Bilateral or multiple primary cancers
** Combination of tumors consistent with specific cancer syndrome
* Strengths and limitations of cancer risk assessment
** Knowledge of family history may be limited
** Cancer occurs with or without hereditary cancer syndrome
** Can't diagnose on the basis of family history information alone
* Features associated with HNPCC
** Polyps present in small numbers or not at all
** Proximal (right-sided) colon cancer
** Mean age at diagnosis is 45 years
* Individual risk based on personal/family history: ________
* Muir-Torre Syndrome
** Variant of HNPCC
** Associated with MSH2 or MLH1 mutations
** Typical features of HNPCC
** Also includes sebaceous gland tumors and keratoacanthomas
* Turcot Syndrome
** Rare hereditary syndrome of multiple colorectal adenomas and brain tumors
** Two subtypes
*** APC mutations associated with medulloblastomas
*** MMR mutations associated with glioblastomas

== Genetic Testing ==
* Diagnostic/Testing Criteria for HNPCC
** Amsterdam Criteria
*** Family must meet ALL of the following
**** Three cases of colorectal cancer
**** One affected person is first-degree relative of other two
**** Two successive generations affected
**** One diagnosis &lt; 40 years
**** FAP excluded in cases of colon cancer
**** Tumors verified by pathology
*** Failure to meet these criteria DOES NOT exclude HNPCC
** Modified Amsterdam Criteria
*** Family must meet ALL of the following
**** Three relatives with HNPCC-related cancer
**** One person is first-degree relative of other two
**** Two successive generations affected
**** One diagnosis &lt; 50 years
**** FAP excluded in cases of colon cancer
**** Tumors verified by pathology
*** HNPCC-related cancers include colorectal, endometrial, small bowel, ureter, renal pelvis)
** Bethesda Guidelines for eligibility for MSI testing
*** Family or proband meets at least one criteria
**** Family fits either Amsterdam criteria
**** Proband has two HNPCC-related cancers
**** Proband has CRC plus 1st degree relative with HNPCC-related cancer or CRC adenoma &lt;45 years
**** Colorectal or endometrial cancer diagnosed before 45 years
**** Right-sided colon cancer if undifferentiated diagnosed before 45 years
**** Signet-ring cell type colorectal diagnosed before 45 years
**** Colon adenomas diagnosed before 45 years
*** If high MSI, proceed to germline mutation testing
* Common adult cancers may be due to one of several genes or genetic and environmental interactions
** Negative result difficult to interpret since it can be more than one gene
** Preferable to identify mutation in relative with cancer before testing other at-risk relatives
** General population screening not appropriate for this reason
** DNA banking is option to defer testing until sometime in future
* Testing procedures
** Process
*** Blood drawn here and sent to outside lab (Myriad)
*** Results usually take about 4 weeks
** Payment methods
*** Patient pay with check, money order, credit card
*** Insurance claims
**** Submit patient insurance authorization with sample
**** Requires 20% copay or insurance verified patient portion
*** Medicare claims - Medicare Waiver of Liability required
*** Institutional pay - Myriad bills institution directly
** Current prices
*** Comprehensive COLARIS (MLH1 and MSH2 sequencing) $1950
*** Single Site COLARIS (known family mutation) $315
*** Micorsatellite Instability $600
**** Used to screen before DNA testing
**** Must be done on tumor tissue
**** Cannot be billed to insurance
** Practice guidelines for testing
*** If positive for Bethesda criteria, start with MSI
*** If MSI high, consider genetic testing
*** If MSI low or negative, consider testing if Amsterdam positive
*** If Bethesda and Amsterdam negative, manage based on family history
* Mutation identified
** Increased risk for cancer
** Gene could be passed on to children
** Other at-risk relatives should be informed and offered counseling
** Important to establish management plan
** Insurance issues
* Mutation not identified
** Inherited cancer can't be ruled out since mutation may have been missed or exist in another gene
** May be no genetic explanation for cancer in family
** Person with cancer who does not have mutation may be sporadic case
** Relatives may still be at risk and should discuss family history with their doctor
* Limitations of testing
** Can't predict when a person with a mutation will develop cancer
** Not all persons with mutation will develop cancer
** Some mutations may be missed or can't be interpreted
** Efficacy of screening for some related cancers (e.g. ovarian) is unknown
* Benefits of testing
** May provide information
*** Explanation for cancer in family
*** Increased surveillance or plan for future
*** Clarify risks to children and other family members
** Reassurance
** Colon surveillance in at risk persons proven to reduce mortality
* Risks of testing
** Insurability
** Employment issues
** Confidentiality
** May alter family relationships
** Adverse psychological effects
*** Survivor guilt
*** Transmitter guilt
*** Depression
*** Anxiety
* Not appropriate to offer testing for adult onset disorders for prenatal diagnosis or to anyone under age 18

== Screening and Management Options ==
* Screening guidelines
** Colonoscopy
*** Starting at age 25 or 5-10 years before age of first colorectal cancer diagnosis
*** Repeat every 1-2 years
*** Surveillance decreases mortality by 65%, decreases CRC by 62%
*** Promotes early detection, improved survival
** Endometrial and ovarian cancer
*** Transvaginal ultrasound, CA-125 levels starting 30-35 every 1-2 years
*** Endometiral biopsy annually starting at age 25
** Stomach
*** If previous family member affected
*** Upper GI endoscopy every 1-2 years starting at age 30
** Urinary tract
*** If previous family member affected
*** Ultrasound and urine cytology every 1-2 years starting at age 30
* Prophylactic surgery
** Effectiveness unknown so no recommendations for or against surgery
** Does not eliminate cancer risk
** Subtotal colectomy
** Hyterectomy with or without oophorectomy
* Chemoprevention
** Current multicenter trial recruiting patients with known mutation or high MSI tumors and Amsterdam positive family history
** No chemopreventive therapies for HNPCC.
** NSAIDs can reduce number of adenomas in FAP and may work for HNPCC too

== Psychosocial Issues ==
* Motivation for undergoing testing

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Holoprosencephaly'''

==Contracting==
*Introduce myself
*Elicit concerns of the family- what questions do they have?

==Interim Medical History==
*Who are the doctors that Lil' Jane is currently seeing? Dr. Doktour- pediatrician?
*Has she had any illnesses since we saw her last? Does it take her longer to recover from colds than you would expect?
*Surgeries/hospitalizations?
*Recent test/procedures?
*Hearing (ABER) and vision test results? Did Lil' Jane see endocrinology? Results? Any pituitary involvement? Recommendation for hormone replacement therapy?
*When is she seeing cardiology again?
*Is she taking any medications?
*Is Lil' Jane still receiving EI services? PT and OT? How often?
*Address Dr. H's concern about hypertonia of the hip. Did increased PT help?
*Has she had any seizures?
*Trouble breathing? Turning blue?
*Diarrhea or constipation?
*What is she eating? How often?
*Developmental assessment- minimal: tell me what kinds of things Lil' Jane is doing? Is she babbling at all? Rolling over, smiling etc…

==Interim Family History==
*Have there been any new births, deaths, or diagnoses on either side of the family?

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Who is living in your home?
*How is the family coping?
*Support network?
*Who is helping with Lil' Jane's needs?
**Does a home health care nurse still help out during the week? How often?
*Do mom and dad work outside of the home? Occupation?
*Any plans of becoming pregnant?
*Are you happy with the care that Lil' Jane is receiving?
*How does the family feel? Anxious? Worried?
*Insurance? Any financial concerns?

==Recurrence Risks==
*The risk for recurrence in this family is very low, 1-2 %, given that both parents have normal karyotypes.

==Definition==
*Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a structural anomaly of the brain (occurs during the 3rd week of gestation) in which the developing forebrain fails to divide into two separate hemispheres and ventricles. There is incomplete cleavage of the forebrain (prosencephalon) into right and left hemispheres, into the telecephalon and diencephalon, and into the olfactory and optic bulbs and tracts.

==Genetic Etiology==
*An extremely variable phenotypic expression occurs both in sporadic HPE and among members of the same family with an inherited form of HPE
*Environmental
**Teratogen: Maternal diabetes; 1% risk of fetus having HPE
**Alcohol
**TORCH
*Genetic mechanism
**Chromosomal: 25-50% of HPE cases are caused by a chromosome abnormality
***Numerical: Trisomies 13, 18 and Triploidy
***Structural: Reported in virtually all chromosomes
****Most common include duplications or deletions at (13q), del (18p), del (7)(q36),
****Can occur due to a de novo rearrangement or from an inherited from a normal parent with a balanced rearrangement.
**Monogenic (gene penetrance ~ 30%): syndromic
***Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and multifactorial inheritance can be seen.
***At least 25 different conditions have been described in which HPE is an occasional finding; the majority of these disorders are rare.
**Monogenic: nonsyndromic
***The nonsyndromic forms of HPE that are best understood at a molecular genetic level are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
***Genes associated:
****SHH (7q36), ZIC2 (13q32), SIX3 (2p21), TGIF (18p11.3)

==Prevalence==
*HPE is the most common forebrain defect in humans, with a prevalence of 1:250 in embryos and 1:10,000-1:12,000 at birth.

==Categories==
*HPE encompasses a variety of brain malformations, with different degrees of severity.
**Alobar HPE, the most severe, in which there is a single ventricle and no separation of the cerebral hemispheres.
**Semilobar HPE, the left and right frontal parietal lobes are fused and the interhemispheric fissure is only present posteriorly.
**Lobar HPE, the mildest form, in which the left and right central hemispheres and the lateral ventricles are separated, but the most rostral aspect of the telencephalon, frontal lobes, are fused ventrally.
**Middle interhemispheric fusion variant (MIHF or syntelencephaly), in which there is failure of separation of the posterior frontal and parietal lobes, with varying lack of cleavage of the basal ganglia and thalami, and absence of the body of the corpus callosum but presence of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. It is debated whether MIHF is part of the HPE spectrum or a separate entity.

==Clinical Features==
*HPE is accompanied by a spectrum of characteristic craniofacial anomalies in about 80% of patients.
*In the majority of patients with HPE, a correlation exists between the facial anomalies and the subtype of HPE. (Of note, patients with all subtypes can have a relatively normal facial appearance).
*The spectrum of facial anomalies begins with cyclopia and extends in an unbroken sequence to the normal face as seen in nonpenetrant carriers of autosomal dominant HPE.
*Malformations of the nose:
**complete absence
**agenesis of the nasal cartridge, and
**proboscis (flat nose with a single central nostril without nasal bones)
*Palatal anomalies:
**midline and lateral clefts
**midline palatal ridge,
**bifid uvula
**absence of the superior labial frenulum
**A single central incisor may be present. Although a single central incisor is a non-specific finding, it is a distinctive microform in autosomal dominant HPE.



{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+Subtypes of HPE and the Range of Possible Craniofacial Findings
! Subtype of HPE !! Facial Findings
|-
| Alobar HPE || 
*Cyclopia: single eye or partially divided eye in single orbit with a proboscis above the eye
*Cyclopia without proboscis
*Ethmocephaly: extreme ocular hypotelorism but separate orbits with proboscis between the eyes
*Cebocephaly: ocular hypotelorism with single-nostril nose
*Premaxillary agenesis with median cleft lip, ocular hypotelorism, flat nose
*Bilateral cleft lip
*Ocular hypotelorism only
*Anophthalmia or microophthalmia
*Relatively normal facial appearance
|-
| Semilobar HPE || 
*Bilateral cleft lip with median process representing the philtrum-premaxilla anlage
*Flat nasal bridge
*Absent nasal septum
*Flat nasal tip
*Midline cleft (lip and/or palate)
*Ocular hypotelorism

*Anophthalmia/microophthalmia
*Relatively normal facial appearance

*Bilateral cleft lip with median process
*Ocular hypotelorism
*Flat nose

|-
| MIHF || 
*Relatively normal facial appearance
|}



*Developmental delay is present in virtually all individuals with the HPE spectrum of CNS anomalies. The degree of delay is variable, correlating with the severity of the brain malformation.
*Seizures are common.
*Hydrocephalus can occur.
*Hypothalamic and brainstem dysfunction may lead to instability of temperature, heart rate, respiration, and swallowing difficulties.
*Pituitary dysgenesis is manifested by partial or complete panhypopituitarism with abnormal function of any or all of the anterior and/or posterior pituitary hormones.
*Feeding problems sometimes require gastrostomy tube. Excessive intestinal gas/colic, irritability, and constipation frequently occur.
*Aspiration pneumonia can be a complication of poor coordination of swallowing.
*Erratic sleep patterns can occur.

==Natural History==
*Age of onset: newborn period, when facial features warrant further investigation
*A significant proportion of more mildly affected children survive past 12 months.
*Among patients with a normal karyotype, an inverse relationship exists between the severity of the facial phenotype and survival length.
*Individuals with cyclopia generally do not survive beyond one week of age
*Approximately one half of children with alobar HPE die before the age of 4-5 months and 20% live past the first year of life.
*Among individuals with isolated semilobar or lobar HPE, without significant malformations of other organs, more than 50% are alive at the age of 12 months.
*Almost all survivors have apparently normal vision and hearing; they smile and demonstrate memory.

==Testing==
*Imaging of the brain by CT scan or MRI confirms the diagnosis of HPE, defines the subtype, and identifies associated CNS anomalies such as hydrocephalus and pituitary involvement.
*Chromosome analysis of blood
*Molecular genetic testing of the genes known to cause HPE is currently available on a research only basis.

==Management==
*Most children benefit from a multidisciplinary team approach.
*A major aspect of treatment is support and counseling of the parents.
*Hormone replacement therapy has been successful in some children with pituitary dysfunction.
*Anticonvulsive therapies can help decrease the frequency and intensity of seizures.
*Feeding difficulties and failure to thrive may be managed with gastrostomy tube placement.
*Placement of a shunt may be necessary in children with HPE and hydrocephalus.
*In older children, surgical repair of cleft of the lip and /or palate may be indicated

==Risk of Recurrence==
*Dependent upon the mode of inheritance
*AD nonsyndromic HPE = 50% recurrence risk
*Numerical Chromosomal HPE = 1% or less (depends on the abnormality and the maternal age)
*Structural chromosomal HPE = depend on the type of structural rearrangement
*Sporadic: low - 50% (if gonadal mosaicism)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Value Types==
Data types, such as integers and floating-point numbers that are copied when they are passed as arguments (that is, they are [[w:passed by value|passed by value]]). In the .NET Framework, these are called value types. The runtime supports two kinds of value types: [[#Built-in|Built-in value types]] and [[#User-defined|User-defined value types]].

Value types are stored as efficiently as primitive types, yet you can call methods on them. You can create instances of value types, pass them as parameters, store them as local variables, or store them in a field of another value type or object. Value types do not have the overhead associated with storing an instance of a class and they do not require constructors.

For each value type, the runtime supplies a corresponding boxed type, which is a class that has the same state and behavior as the value type. When you define a value type, you are defining both the boxed and the unboxed type.

Value types can have fields, properties, and events. They can also have methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Huntington Disease'''

==Contracting==
*What have you been told already about HD and the reason you were referred to see us?
*Wondering what questions or concerns you might like to discuss with us today?
*How has your diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder changed your life the most?
*Since HD is usually passed on by a parent I like to begin by taking a family medical history to see if any other family members may have had symptoms of HD. Sometimes HD can be misdiagnosed as something else like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease because they share some of the same symptoms and other times family members have passed away before symptoms of HD develop
*We can then discuss the cause of HD and details about the genetic testing we have to offer you.
*Dr. ____ will also be in later to perform a short physical examination and further discuss HD

==HD overview==
*An inherited progressive brain disease
*It often causes uncontrolled movements (chorea), problems with coordination, difficulty with memory and mental processing, and emotional or personality changes

==Incidence==
*A rare disease, occurring in 3-7 people per 100,000 people in populations of western European descent
*About 1 in 10,000 in N. America
*HD is less common in Japan, China, Finland, and African Americans

==Disease Manifestations==
*Presently no effective therapy to halt progression of disease
*Most often symptoms develop between age 30-50
*Approximately 25% of patients with HD exhibit the first symptoms after age 50
*About 10% have juvenile Huntington disease with onset before age 20
*Epileptic seizures are common in early onset cases with 30-50% of juvenile patients being affected
*Chorea is not common in children with juvenile HD
*Early symptoms
*subtle changes in coordination
*involuntary movements (chorea)
*non-repetitive, non-periodic, jerking of limbs, face or torso
*present in over 90% of patients with HD
*continuously present during the waking hours, cannot be suppressed voluntarily and are worsened by stress
*difficulty in mental planning
*depressed or irritable mood
*memory impairments
*As HD progresses there is increased difficulty with voluntary movement
*May have outbursts of aggressive behaviors and social disinhibition
*A global decline in cognitive capabilities occurs in all HD patients
*Personality changes may develop; some develop affective psychosis or schizophrenic psychosis
*Suicide occurs in up to 12% of patients
*Behavioral disturbances such as intermittent explosiveness, apathy, aggression, alcohol abuse, sexual dysfunction and deviations, are frequent
*Delusions, often paranoid, are also common
*Hallucinations are less common
*In the late stages of HD, behavior problems are gradually lessened, but motor disability becomes severe and the patient is often totally dependent, can't speak, and can't control bladder function, weight loss often becomes a concern
*Disease usually progresses slowly over a 15-20 year period after which death occurs

==What Causes Huntington Disease?==
*In order to understand what causes HD and to understand the testing for HD it is helpful to review some genetics
*Review chromosomes, genes, DNA, nucleotides
*Gene IT-15 (discovered in 1993)
**located on chromosome 4
**area in the gene where there are tri-nucleotide repeats
**Most individuals have between 9 and 26 repeats
**Alleles of 27-35 CAG repeats are considered intermediate alleles. A person with an allele in the intermediate range do not develop HD, but they may have children with HD if the number of repeats increases when the gene is passed on
**An allele in the range of 36-41 is associated with reduced penetrance for symptomatic HD (they may or may not develop symptoms of HD)
*The HD gene produces a protein (Huntingtin)
**widely expressed
**function unknown
**CAG expansion causes altered structural and biochemical properties
**The protein has been shown to accumulate in neurons within the brain
**Uncertain if this accumulation is what causes symptoms
*Inverse correlation between CAG repeat length and the age of onset
**Patients with adult onset of symptoms usually have an expansion that ranges from 40-55 CAG repeats
**Patients with juvenile onset of symptoms usually have expansions about 60 repeats
**Repeat length does not correlate with any other clinical feature, exact age of onset, or rate of progression

==Inheritance==
*AD inheritance
**Homozygotes are no more severely affected clinically than heterozygotes
*Offspring of an individual with a mutant allele have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease-causing mutation
*Approximately 3% of individuals with HD have no family history of condition
*Reasons family history may be negative
**Alternate paternity
**Adoption
**Early death of a parent
**Failure to recognize symptoms or misdiagnosis
**Late age of onset in a parent
**Presence of intermediate allele or reduced penetrance allele in a parent
**New mutations are rare
*Genetic anticipation
**Disease severity or decreasing age of onset can occur in successive generations
**Anticipation occurs more commonly in paternal transmission of the mutated allele
**The risk of expansion of intermediate allele into the disease range is about 2.5% when transmitted by the father
**This phenomenon arises from instability of the CAG repeat during spermatogenesis
**Large expansions in CAG repeat size occur almost exclusively through paternal transmission

==Diagnostic Testing==
*Diagnosis of HD rests on a positive family history, characteristic clinical findings, and molecular DNA testing the reveals an expansion of the CAG repeat in the HD gene
*Imaging studies including MRI, CT, SPECT, and PET may provide additional support for the clinical diagnosis. (used mainly to determine whether other conditions are contributing to the neurologic dysfunction)

==Direct DNA testing==
*Blood test
*Measures number of CAG repeats
*98.8% sensitive, 100% specificity
*Sometimes results are uninformative, but if CAG repeat is within the normal range likely that your symptoms are due to a different neurodegenerative disorder
*Cost of testing is approximately $270
*Insurance - already symptomatic

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*Probably beyond initial reaction to diagnosis of progressive neurodegenerative disorder
*Encourage to carry on normally as long as possible
*Others with HD have said it helps to try and live in the moment
*Families should expect to deal with a variety of emotions
*Realizing that this may be genetic and if children will inherit it
*Watching things you used to do slowly slip away
*Family members having to watch as loved one slowly looses their motor and cognitive skills
*Moodiness, aggressiveness, emotional outbursts can be difficult for caregiver
*Plans and potential concerns for the future
***How are you coping with the likelihood that you will have to eventually give up work
***Legal, financial, health insurance
***Being dependent on others
***Caregivers having time for themselves (not being selfish)
*What have you told other family members?
*How is the rest of the family reacting?
***Do they know it could be genetic?
***Different family members react differently based on their personalities, fears, and types of coping strategies
*If testing were to come back showing you have HD how do you think you will react?
*Would this be different if it came back showing you don't have HD
*If positive for HD there is a support group
*Don't be too reassuring, but provide hope that a lot of research is ongoing to try and understand the disease better
*HD can provide challenges to family relationships
***Roles and family dynamics may change
***Have you come across any of these challenges
***How have you dealt with problems in the past
***Changes in sexual activity

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Differential diagnosis include other conditions that involve chorea, dementia, and psychiatric disturbances
*Many non-inherited conditions are associated with chorea
*These include tardive dyskinesia, thyrotoxicosis, cerebrovascular disease, cerebral lupus, and polycythemia
*Usually be excluded by other clinical features in a patient with suspected HD
*Neuroancanthocytosis -- considered if muscle wasting, absent lower limb tendon reflexes, and signs of neuropathy are present
*Benign hereditary chorea usually presents with nonprogressive chorea without dementia
*Creutzfeld-Jakob disease progresses more rapidly then HD and has myoclonus as a prominent involuntary movement
*For children, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, and other metabolic diseases must be excluded when there is no known family history of HD
*SCA

==Management==
*Limited to symptomatic treatment
**Choreic movements can be partially suppressed by neuroleptics
**Anti-Parkinsonian agents may ameliorate hypokinesia and rigidity
**Psychiatric disturbances such as depression, psychotic symptom, and outbursts of aggression may respond well to psychotropic drugs
*Cognitive impairment is not amenable to treatment
*There is no effective therapy to slow down disease progression

==Reproductive Options==
*There are alternative reproductive options for those not wishing to risk transmitting the disorder to offspring
**Prenatal testing is possible using DNA that has been extracted via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS).
**Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is also available. This technology uses in vitro fertilization (IVF) to produce embryos, which are tested for the HD mutation. Only embryos without the CAG expansion are implanted into the uterus.
***You can have this procedure done without knowing if you actually carry the mutation
***Consider cost per IVF cycle and success rates

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hypoplasia - Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum'''

==Definition== 
*underdevelopment (hypoplasia) complete absence (agenesis) of the CC

==Corpus collosum==
*The area of the brain (large fiber tract) which permits the exchange of information between the left and right cerebral hemispheres.
*&quot;the seat of the soul&quot;. Used to be that the thickness of its body was related to the level of intelligence.
*Function is uncertain because there is no consistent pattern when it is malformed or absent.
*Embryology: forms between 9-16 weeks of development. anterior to posterior.

==Indicence==
rare; no specific numbers

==Diagnosis==
*ACC is usually diagnosed between 0-2 years (by MRI or CT scan) but may never be dx.
*May occur as severe syndrome, a milder condition, or an asymptomatic finding
*Signs and Symptoms:
**Seizures (infantile spasms)
**Feeding problems
**Delays in holding head erect, sitting, standing and walking
**microcephaly

==Possible clinical impairments==
*Deficit or delay in mental and physical development, hand-eye coordination and/or visual and auditory memory
*Could also include: hydrocephaly, seizures, dyskinesia, repetitive speech, headaches

==Etiology==
*Most are isolated/sporadic
*Males and females equally affected
*May be caused by a genetic syndrome such as:
**Aicardi's syndrome: ACC, infantile spasms, severe mental retardation and chorioretinal lacunae
**Grubben syndrome
**Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome: chromosome abnormality
**Opitz-Frias syndrome
**Joubert syndrome
**X-linked syndromes: Bertini, Opitz-Kaveggia, Orofaciodigital, Proud, Pyruvatedehydrogenase
*May be associated with other cerebral anomalies such as Arnold-Chiari malformation, Dandy-Walker syndrome, Andermann syndrome, schizencephaly, holoprosencephaly and migrational anomalies
*Sometimes associated with complex multi-system anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 13 and 18).

==Management==
*No specific treatment. May involve managing treatment of other conditions such as hydrocephaly and seizures if they occur

==Prognosis==
*Excellent in most isolated cases
*Does not cause death in vast majority
*Many will lead normal lives and have average intelligence
*Children w/ ACC and DD and/ or seizures should be screened for metabolic disorders.
*Mental retardation is not progressive

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a setup guide for AT&amp;T Mobility '''[http://www.wireless.att.com/businesscenter/plans/dataconnect.jsp Data Connect]''' (as distinct from [http://www.wireless.att.com/learn/messaging-internet/media-entertainment/media-net.jsp MEdia Net]).
'''Important Notes:'''
* This information is provided as a public service '''without warranty''' of any kind. '''Use at your own risk.'''
* Items not covered here should be left at default values unless you really know what you are doing.


== Differences between Data Connect and MEdia Net ==

* [http://www.wireless.att.com/businesscenter/plans/dataconnect.jsp Data Connect] uses AT&amp;T Data Connect profiles (settings) to provide standard Internet connections with AT&amp;T as the ISP (Internet Service Provider). Connections can be configured with or without [[AT&amp;T Mobility FAQ#What is Data Acceleration?|Data Acceleration]] (which significantly boosts throughput by means of image compression [which reduces image quality], caching, and transport optimization). Data Connect is more expensive than MEdia (as of this writing).

* [http://www.wireless.att.com/learn/messaging-internet/media-entertainment/media-net.jsp MEdia Net] uses the AT&amp;T WAP profile (settings) to support most types of Internet access (''e.g.,'' HTTP [Web browsing], SMTP/POP3/IMAP Email, FTP, Telnet, SSH, SSL). However, not all protocols seem to be fully supported, so problems may be seen with such things as VPN, and [[AT&amp;T Mobility FAQ#What is Data Acceleration?|Data Acceleration]] is not available. Note that MEdia will not work with AT&amp;T Data Connect profiles. MEdia is less expensive than Data Connect (as of this writing).

== Handset (Phone) Configuration ==

If WAP isn't already working on the handset, the handset and SIM must first be configured for AT&amp;T WAP:

* This is best accomplished by asking AT&amp;T Support (dial 611) to &quot;push&quot; WAP settings to the handset (normally done automatically by SMS when a WAP package [''e.g.,'' MEdia] is added to the account).
       
* Alternative: [http://onlinecare.cingular.com/device-support/index.do Cingular On-line Phone &amp; Device Support]&lt;br&gt;Select your Network, and handset Manufacturer and Model (or a similar device) to access Device Setup.

* Another alternative (untested), for Sony Ericsson devices, is to use the ''Configurator'' on the [http://www.sonyericsson.com/ Sony Ericsson website]. Select ''Configurators'', Phone model, ''WAP Read more'', and then follow the prompts. (Email and MMS can also be configured this way.)  

This configuration is sufficient for WAP and/or Web browsing with the handset alone. It's also sufficient for Email given an Email client in the handset that has been properly configured (including selection of the WAP profile for connections).

=== Using Windows XP Dial-Up Networking ===

* '''Create a handset modem entry.''' If your handset connection (serial cable, USB cable, IrDA, Bluetooth) created a modem entry for your handset (''e.g.,'' Standard Modem over Bluetooth link), then you can skip to next major step (Create DUN connection); otherwise:
** Obtain the latest handset modem driver. 
** Make sure your handset connection (serial cable, USB cable, IrDA, Bluetooth) is installed properly, and note the COM port assigned. Make sure the handset is connected and powered on.
** Use ''Control Panel'' &amp;rarr; ''Modem'' to Add the handset modem. Windows should detect the modem, and then search for the best driver. When it does, give Windows the location of the modem driver, and complete the installation. (If auto-detection fails, try to Add the modem manually using the appropriate COM port with the driver.)

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Email ===

* The usual problem when sending email from a handset with SMTP capability is the outgoing SMTP server. Thanks to spammers, outgoing SMTP servers now generally require some form of '''authentication''' when you're off the provider's network. You should be able to find out what kind(s) of authentication are supported by contacting the email provider (''e.g.,'' your ISP). Finding out what your handset supports may be a bigger challenge -- documentation is often woefully inadequate in this area.

* If the email provider supports '''POP3 before SMTP authentication''', then you need to find a way to have the handset do a POP3 check or download before sending mail.

* Some handsets (''e.g.,'' Sony Ericsson Z600) now have support for SMTP-AUTH (Authenticated SMTP, different from POP3 before SMTP). For this to work, you usually need to configure the handset with a valid mailbox id and password for the email provider.

* On the AT&amp;T network you can use '''cwmx.com''' (preferred, no footer added) or '''photo.mycingular.com''' (adds a photo messaging footer) as an outgoing SMTP server. Since you're authenticated by being on the AT&amp;T network, no further authentication is required.

=== Speed ===

* Handsets and PC Cards do not all have the same data performance -- maximum speeds are limited by GPRS/EGPRS/EDGE Multislot Class (and the carrier). In general, all reasonably recent GPRS/EGPRS/EDGE-capable devices from Ericsson and Sony Ericsson support Class 8 (4+1) and Class 10 (4+2, max of 5), whereas most Nokia devices (as of this writing) are limited to slower Class 4 (3+1) and Class 6 (3+2, max 4). Motorola has both Class 4 and Class 8 devices. (The first number is the maximum number of downlink slots, and the number after the &quot;+&quot; is the maximum number of uplink slots.) This can translate into a substantial difference in throughput -- if supported by the carrier, Class 8 is 33% faster on downlink than Class 4.

* Connections between handsets and &quot;tethered&quot; devices (''e.g.,'' notebook computer, PDA) are typically implemented as a serial port, either real or virtual, and port speed usually defaults to 115 Kbps. (Bluetooth is typically implemented on a computer as a virtual serial port that will go as fast as 921.6 Kbps, but which runs at only 115.2 Kbps by default.) While 115 Kbps is generally fast enough for GPRS, it can be a bottleneck for EGPRS(EDGE) (as well as UMTS/HSDPA). In general, port speed should be at least 230 Kbps for GPRS and 460 Kbps for EGPRS(EDGE) (920 Kbps for UMTS/HSDPA).

=== WAP ===

* WAP as built into many handsets is much more limited than standard HTTP -- much of the Internet (World Wide Web) cannot be accessed through WAP.

      <comment>Just in Time (JIT) and application of KANBAN</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">JIT (Just in Time) production concepts originated with the Japanese.  JIT is a philosophy focusing on the elimination of waste in and management or production system. This waste can be in any form, waste materials, wasted effort, lost time though inefficient processes, etc. One area where waste is eliminated is in the movement of work in process in a manufacturing system where material is pulled through by demand from the next step in the process, thus production is limited to the needs of the next step or internal customer in the system. The technique called KANBAN is run by using a series of signals which tell production when to reorder inventory. This historically can be as simple as a product missing from the shelf or an empty container or can be signalled by use of a card or indicator. 

JIT was first developed by Toyota, but is now in used in most manufacturing industry.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;font: 2em sans-serif;padding;1em&quot;&gt;Reflexion: Building custom attributes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Annexes: Building custom attributes ==

''Original text for this page authored by [[User:Scott98390|William &quot;Scott&quot; Baker]]''

=== Attributes Summary ===
''Attributes'' are a way to &quot;tag&quot; elements of your code's metadata with descriptive information that can be accessed at runtime using reflection.  Attributes must derive from '''System.Attribute''', either directly or indirectly.  A multitude of attributes exist in the .NET framework; you can also define your own.  There are three aspects to using attributes in your code:
#Defining a custom attribute class, which involves:
##Assigning the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute to your class. 
##Writing the code to define your custom attribute class.
##Creating the parameters for your class.
#Assigning an attribute to a code member.
#Retrieving attribute information at runtime.

=== Creating a Custom Attribute Class ===
As previously mentioned, there are several predefined attributes in the .NET Framework; you may have already used them in your code.  The XML parser in particular relies heavily on attributes when (de)serializing objects.  You can also define your own custom attributes, as we will show here.  Defining a custom attribute involves three steps:
#Assigning the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute to your class. 
#Writing the code to define your custom attribute class.
#Creating the parameters for your class.
==== Assigning the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;AttributeUsageAttribute&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; To Your Class ====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;The &quot;scope&quot; and other characteristics of your attribute should be specified by the use of the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute.  &lt;br&gt;'''Note:'''  In Visual Basic, use of the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute is ''required'' on all custom attributes.  Applying the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute to a class:
 &lt;font color = blue&gt;[&lt;font color=red&gt;AttributeUsage&lt;/font&gt;(AttributeTargets.All, AllowMultiple = true, Inherited = false)]&lt;/font&gt;
 public Class QualityCheckAttribute : '''System.Attribute''' 
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ...&lt;/font&gt;
 }
Notice the use of &quot;&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsage&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&quot; vs. &quot;&lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.  By convention, all attributes are named with the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Attribute&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; suffix - but the suffix can be omitted when used in code.  This holds true for user defined attributes as well; the &lt;tt&gt;QualityCheckAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute could be referenced as either: 
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;[QualityCheck] &lt;font color=green&gt;// or... &lt;/font&gt;
 [QualityCheckAttribute]&lt;/font&gt;
The &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; has three members: &lt;tt&gt;''ValidOn, AllowMultiple''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''Inherited''&lt;/tt&gt;.  

* The &lt;tt&gt;ValidOn&lt;/tt&gt; member accepts &lt;tt&gt;AttributeTargets&lt;/tt&gt; enum values, and restricts your attribute to the code types you specify. The default value is &lt;tt&gt;AttributeTargets.All&lt;/tt&gt;.  You can confine your attribute to classes, enums, return values or any of the list below:
 All (''any element'')   Delegate    GenericParameter    Parameter
 Assembly            Enum        Interface           Property
 Class               Event       Method              ReturnValue
 Constructor         Field       Module*             Struct
 
 ''*Module'' refers to a portable executable (''.exe'' or ''.dll''), and not a Visual Basic standard module.
You can also combine target types as a bitwise OR operation to specify multiple acceptable values:
 [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Method)]
* &lt;tt&gt;AllowMultiple&lt;/tt&gt; is a boolean value that determines whether or not an attribute can be applied more than once to a given member.  The default value is &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;.  The example below illustrates multiple instances of the same attribute on an element of code:
 [QualityCheck(&quot;Scott Baker&quot;, &quot;02/28/06&quot;, IsApproved = true,
    Comment = &quot;This code follows all established guidelines.  Release approved.&quot;)]
 [QualityCheck(&quot;Matt Kauffman&quot;, &quot;01/15/06&quot;, IsApproved = false,
    Comment = &quot;Code quality much improved. Minor revision required.&quot;)]
 [QualityCheck(&quot;Joe Schmoe&quot;, 01/01/06&quot;, IsApproved = false,
    Comment = &quot;This code is a mess and needs a complete rewrite&quot;)]
 public class MyClass
 {
 &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
* The &lt;tt&gt;Inherited&lt;/tt&gt; member determines whether attributes set on a class will be inherited by classes further down the inheritance tree.  The default value is '''true''':
 [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
 public class AttrOneAttribute : Attribute
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
 
 &lt;font color=green&gt;// This attribute will not be inherited &lt;/font&gt;
 [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, &lt;font color=blue&gt;Inherited = false&lt;/font&gt;)]
 public class AttrTwoAttribute : Attribute
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
 
 [AttrOne]
 [AttrTwo]
 public class ClassOne 
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
 
 &lt;font color=green&gt;// This class inherits AttrOne from ClassOne, 
 // but not AttrTwo &lt;/font&gt;
 public class ClassTwo : ClassOne
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
&lt;/div&gt;

==== Defining A Custom Attribute Class ====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;
* Attributes are classes that inherit from &lt;tt&gt;System.Attribute&lt;/tt&gt;, either directly or indirectly:
 public Class QualityCheckAttribute : '''System.Attribute''' &lt;font color=green&gt;// direct &lt;/font&gt;
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ...&lt;/font&gt;
 }
 
 public Class FinalCheck : QualityCheckAttribute  &lt;font color=green&gt;// indirect &lt;/font&gt;
 {
 &lt;font color=green&gt;// ...&lt;/font&gt;
 }
* Attribute classes have the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; attribute:
 &lt;font color = blue&gt;[AttributeUsage(AllowMultiple = true, Inherited = false)]&lt;/font&gt;
 public Class QualityCheckAttribute : System.Attribute
 {
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ...&lt;/font&gt;
 }
 
&lt;i&gt;As previously mentioned, the use of &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; is required in VB.  In C#, it is automatically applied with the default values if not declared.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==== Creating Parameters For An Attribute ====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;Attributes accept two types of parameters:  ''positional'' and ''named''.  Positional parameters are defined by public constructors in your class, must be in the order defined and are ''required''; named parameters are defined by public properties, can be in any order and are optional.

===== Positional Parameters =====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;Positional parameters for an attribute are defined by the constructors in the class.  As with any class, constructors can be overloaded and a default constructor that takes no parameters can be defined.  As with any other class, the signature of the positional parameters must match the signature of a constructor in the attribute class:
 public class QualityCheckAttribute : Attribute
 {
   public QualityCheckAttribute(string Name, string Date)
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// ... &lt;/font&gt;
 }
&lt;/div&gt;
===== Named Parameters =====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;Named parameters for an attribute are defined by public properties defined in the class.  Named parameters are optional and are declared &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; any positional parameters.  The &lt;tt&gt;IsApproved&lt;/tt&gt; property demonstrates a named parameter:
 public class QualityCheckAttribute : Attribute
 {
   private string _name;
   private string _date;
   private bool isApproved;
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;public bool IsApproved
   {
     get {return isApproved;}
     set {isApproved = value;}
   }&lt;/font&gt;
   public QualityCheckAttribute(string Name, string Date)
   {
     &lt;font color=green&gt;// ...&lt;/font&gt;
   }
 }

Keep in mind that a variable in your code can be &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; a positional parameter &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a named parameter.  If we were to add public properties for the &lt;code&gt;_name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_date&lt;/code&gt; fields we could use them either as named parameters or positional parameters.  Of course, this is not a recommended practice:  required parameters should be positional and optional parameters should be named.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== Assigning An Attribute To A Code Member ===
You have already seen examples of assigning an attribute to a code member.  However, there are some points that must be clarified.  
*''Disambiguation'' is the clarification of the use of an attribute on a code member.  
*''Syntax'' - there is more than one way to apply multiple attributes.

==== Disambiguation ====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;The code below isn't clear as to whether &lt;tt&gt;SomeAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; applies to the method &lt;tt&gt;MyMethod&lt;/tt&gt; or to its &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; value:
 public class MyAttribute : Attribute
 {
   &lt;font color=blue&gt;[SomeAttribute(&quot;Hello&quot;)]&lt;/font&gt;
   public string MyMethod(aString)
   {
     return aString;
   }
 }
Disambiguation resolves these issues.  By specifying the code type the attribute is applied to, we are able to resolve the confusion.  The code below shows that the attribute applies to the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; value:
 public class MyAttribute : Attribute
 {
   [&lt;font color=blue&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; : SomeAttribute]
   public string MyMethod(aString)
   {
     return aString;
   }
 }
The table below lists all declarations where attributes are allowed; for each declaration, the possible targets for attributes on the declaration are listed in the second column. Targets in bold are the defaults.
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Declaration               Possible targets'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
 assembly                  '''assembly'''
 module                    '''module'''
 class                     '''type'''
 struct                    '''type'''
 interface                 '''type'''
 enum                      '''type'''
 delegate                  '''type''', return
 method                    '''method''', return
 parameter                 '''param'''
 field                     '''field'''
 property — indexer        '''property'''
 property — get accessor   '''method''', return
 property — set accessor   '''method''', param, return
 event — field             '''event''', field, method
 event — property          '''event''', property
 event — add               '''method''', param
 event — remove            '''method''', param
 
 *''Reference: [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b3787ac0(VS.80).aspx Disambiguating Attribute Targets (C# Programming Guide)]''
One would think that the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute's AttributeTargets&lt;/tt&gt; in an attribute's definition would help to prevent this confusion:  one would be wrong.  The compiler does not use the &lt;tt&gt;AttributeUsageAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; information when resolving conflicts.  Even if you define an attribute to apply only to a specific type, for instance &lt;tt&gt;AttributeTargets.Return&lt;/tt&gt;, you must still clarify that it applies to the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; type when applying the attribute or the compiler will use the default target &lt;tt&gt;method&lt;/tt&gt; type, and throw an error.
&lt;/div&gt;

==== Syntax: Applying Multiple Attributes ====
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:2%&quot;&gt;When applying more than one attribute to a member, there are two ways to do so:
 [AttrOne(...), AttrTwo(...)]  
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// or...&lt;/font&gt;
 [AttrOne(...)]
 [AttrTwo(...)]
The two are equivalent.  Keep in mind that if you are going to specify more than one attribute in a single brace, they must apply to the same target type.  If not, you must give each type a separate declaration:
 [return : AttrOne(...), method : AttrTwo(...)]  &lt;font color=red&gt;// &lt;-- invalid!&lt;/font&gt;
   &lt;font color=green&gt;// instead, you must...&lt;/font&gt;
 [return : AttrOne(...)]
 [method : AttrTwo(...)]
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Retrieving Attribute Information At Runtime === 
Being able to declare and apply attributes is not very helpful unless we can retrieve that data and do something with it.  Fortunately, its a straightforward process.  There are three basic scenarios that will be addressed:
#Retrieve a single attribute from a member.
#Retrieve multiple attributes from a member.
#Retrieve attributes of a single type from multiple members.
==== Retrieving A Single Attribute From A Member ====
To access attribute information:
#Declare an instance of the attribute type.
#Use the &lt;tt&gt;Attribute.GetCustomAttribute(''type'', ''typeof'') method to read the attribute into the instance.
#Use the properties of the instance to read the values.
The example code below declares a class &lt;tt&gt;ExampleClass&lt;/tt&gt; with a &lt;tt&gt;QualityCheck&lt;/tt&gt; attribute. The &lt;tt&gt;GetSingleAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; method accepts a target member type and the type of attribute you're looking for. The &lt;tt&gt;Attribute.GetCustomAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; method retrieves the attribute information into the &lt;tt&gt;attr&lt;/tt&gt; object, from which we can read the all-important &lt;tt&gt;IsApproved&lt;/tt&gt; property:
 [QualityCheck(&quot;Scott Baker&quot;, &quot;02/04/2006&quot;, IsApproved = false)]
 public class ExampleClass
 {
 
   public static void Main()
   {
     GetSingleAttribute(typeof(ExampleClass), typeof(QualityCheck))
   }
  
   public static void GetSingleAttribute(Type targetType, Type attrType)
   {
     typeof(attrType) attr = (attrType)Attribute.&lt;font color=blue&gt;GetCustomAttribute&lt;/font&gt;(targetType, typeof(attrType));
   
     if (attr == null)
     { &lt;font color=green&gt;//...&lt;/font&gt; }
     else
     {
       Console.Writeline(attr.IsApproved);
     }
   }

An important factor to keep in mind is that the &lt;tt&gt;GetCustomAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; method is designed to read '''one and only one''' attribute.  &lt;tt&gt;GetCustomAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; actually checks to see if more than one attribute matches - if there is no match it returns &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt;, but if there is more than one match it will throw an &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;tt&gt;AmbiguousMatchException&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;. When checking for attributes the only time it is safe to use &lt;tt&gt;GetCustomAttribute&lt;/tt&gt; is when the attribute's definition states &lt;tt&gt;[AttributeUsage(AllowMultiple=&lt;font color=blue&gt;false&lt;/font&gt;)]&lt;/tt&gt;.
==== Retrieving Multiple Attributes From A Member ====
Reading multiple instances of an attribute on a member isn't much different than reading one; to read multiple attributes use the plural &lt;tt&gt;GetCustomAttributes&lt;/tt&gt;, which returns an array of attributes.  You can then iterate through the resultant array and read the values:

 QualityCheck[] attrArray = (QualityCheck[])Attribute.GetCustomAttributes(t, typeof(QualityCheck));
 
 foreach (QualityCheck attr in attrArray)
 {
   Console.Writeline(attr.IsApproved);
 }
==== Retrieving A Single Attribute Type From Multiple Members ====
What if you want to do something a little more complex, like checking each method in a class for a QualityCheck attribute?  Thanks to the &lt;tt&gt;System.Reflection&lt;/tt&gt; namespace, we don't have to even break a sweat.  Simply read all the members (methods, in this instance) into a &lt;tt&gt;MemberInfo&lt;/tt&gt; array and iterate through them:
 
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;using System.Reflection&lt;/font&gt;
 
 public class ExampleClass
 {
   public static void Main()
   {
     RetrieveAttributes(typeof(ExampleClass));
   }
 
   public void RetrieveAttributes(Type t)
   {
     MemberInfo[] methodList = t.GetMethods();
     foreach (MemberInfo m in methodList)
     {
       QualityCheck[] attrArray = (QualityCheck[])Attribute.GetCustomAttributes(m, typeof(QualityCheck));
       foreach (QualityCheck attr in attrArray)
       {
         Console.Writeline(attr.IsApproved);
       }
     }
   }
 }

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels for children written by C. S. Lewis. They present the adventures of children who play central roles in the unfolding history of the realm of Narnia, a place where some animals talk, magic is common, and good is fighting evil. The stories illustrate aspects of Christianity in a way that is accessible to younger children.

Pauline Baynes illustrated the original books in the series.

This page will try to discuss some of the different, important terminology, and it may even contain a listing of some of the acronyms used in this book.

== Types of Chips ==

There are a number of different types of chips that we will discuss here.

;Microprocessors: These chips contain a processing core, and occasionally a few integrated peripherals. In a different sense, Microprocessors are simply CPUs found in desktops.
;Microcontrollers: These chips are all-in-one computer chips. They contain a processing core, memory, and integrated peripherals. In a broader sense, a microcontroller is a CPU that is used in an embedded system.
;Digital Signal Processor (DSP): DSPs are the &quot;best of the best&quot; when it comes to processing signals. DSPs frequently run very quickly, and have immense processing power (for an embedded chip). Digital Signal Processors, and the field of Digital Signal Processing is so large and involved, that it warrants its own book -- [[Digital Signal Processing]].

== Grades of Microcontrollers ==

Microcontrollers can be divided up into different categories, depending on several parameters such as bus-width (8 bit, 16 bit, etc...), amount of memory, speed, and the number of I/O pins:

;Low-end: Low-end chips are frequently used in simple situations, where speed and power are not a factor. Low-end chips are the cheapest of the bunch, and can usually cost ''less than a dollar'', depending on the quantity in which they are purchased. Low-end chips rarely have many I/O pins (4 or 8, total), and rarely have any special capabilities. Almost all low-end chips are 8 bits or smaller.
;Mid-level chips:mid-level chips are the &quot;basic&quot; microcontroller units. They don't suffer from the drawbacks of the low-end chips, but at the same time they are more expensive and larger. Mid-level chips are 8 bits or 16 bits wide, and frequently have a number of available I/O pins to play with. Mid-level chips may come with ADC, voltage regulators, OpAmps, etc... Mid-level chips can cost anywhere between $1 and $10 for reasonable chips.
;High-end chips:High end chips are used in situations where power and speed are a must, but a conventional microprocessor board (think a computer motherboard) is too large or expensive. High-end chips will have a number of fancy features, more available memory, and a larger addressable memory range. High end chips can come in 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit or even 64 bit, and can cost anywhere between $10 to $100 each.

== Acronyms ==

This will be a functional list of most of the acronyms used in this book

;ADC: ADC stands for '''Analog to Digital Converter'''. ADCs are also written as &quot;A/D&quot; or &quot;A2D&quot; in other literature.
;DAC: The exact opposite of an ADC, a DAC stands for '''Digital to Analog Converter'''. May also be called &quot;D/A&quot; or &quot;D2A&quot;
;RAM: '''Random-Access Memory'''. RAM is the memory that a microcontroller uses to store information when the power is on. When the power goes off, RAM is erased.
;ROM: '''Read-Only Memory''', ROM is memory that can be read, but it can't be written or erased. ROM is cheaper than RAM, and it doesnt lose its information when the power is turned off.
;OTP: OTP means '''One-Time Programmable'''. OTP chips can be programmed once, and only once, usually by a physical process or burning extra wires inside the chip. If an OTP chip is programmed incorrectly, it can't be fixed, so be careful with them.

== Downloading ==

In this book, the terms &quot;burning&quot;, &quot;flashing&quot;, &quot;installing&quot;, or &quot;downloading&quot; all mean the same thing -- the (semi-)automated process of putting the executable image into the non-volatile memory of the embedded system.

After a person tweaks the source code and compiles a new executable image on the PC, that person connects a downloader between the PC and the embedded system, and clicks the &quot;go&quot; button. Then the PC streams the image into the downloader, and the downloader burns the image into the embedded system.

A downloader is variously called a &quot;downloader&quot;, &quot;burner&quot;, &quot;flasher&quot;, &quot;flash downloader&quot;, &quot;programming interface&quot;, or -- confusingly -- a &quot;programmer&quot;.

* [[Embedded_Systems/PIC_Microcontroller#downloaders]]
* [[Embedded_Systems/Atmel_AVR#Programming_Interfaces]]

== Programming ==

There are many similarities between a desktop PC and an embedded system, including the terminology used. Unfortunately some terms have wildly different meanings when used in each of these domains. The word &quot;programming&quot; is one such term. 

In the desktop PC world, &quot;programming&quot; means the overall process of a person writing software on a PC, going through many edit-compile-test cycles, to create an executable image. The ''person'' accomplishing this task is called the &quot;programmer&quot;. 


For embedded systems the word &quot;programming&quot; usually means the specific steps for transferring the executable image to the device ('installing' in PC terms). The &quot;programmer&quot; is a ''device'' for burning the compiled code into the chip. 
The ''person'' that writes the code for the device is generally called the ''developer''.

In this book, we use the term &quot;programming&quot; to describe what a human being does to create and test software source code.

Be aware that other texts may use the term &quot;programming&quot; -- such as when talking about &quot;high-voltage programming&quot;, &quot;gang programming&quot;, etc. -- to describe what we would call &quot;installing&quot;.

Texts that talk about &quot;C++ programming&quot;, &quot;assembly programming&quot;, &quot;pair programming&quot; etc. -- use &quot;programming&quot; the same way we do.
&quot;C++ programmer&quot;, &quot;Python programmer&quot;, &quot;pair programmer&quot;, etc. refer to human beings that do the programming.

== Further reading ==

* We mentioned [[Electronics/Op-Amps | op amps]]. A long time ago, &quot;analog computers&quot; were once built entirely out of such operational amplifiers, resistors and capacitors. Today most embedded systems have few, if any op-amps -- they are still useful for some sensor signal amplifiers, anti-aliasing filters before the ADC, anti-aliasing filters after the DAC, and a few op-amps embedded in power supply circuits.</text>

I'm guessing the answer would be &quot;kind of.&quot; The queen's English doesn't have an infix, but I have seen that in US vernacular (see the article on expletive infixation; linguistics is concerned with descriptive grammar as well as prescriptive grammar). 
Other languages do have it in their prescriptive form; Tagalog is commonly cited as an example (see [http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryofLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnInfix.htm this SIL site]).--[[User:RMann|RMann]] 22:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[wikipedia:Hello World|Hello World]] was seen as early as 1974 in [[wikipedia:Bell Labs|Bell Laboratorie's]] internal memorandum by Kernighan &amp;mdash;''Programming in C: A Tutorial''&amp;mdash; which shows the first known version of the program:
 main( ) {
     printf(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
 }

In this tutorial we will use one [[wikipedia:variable|variable]] named '''message''' to display a [[wikipedia:String_literal|string]] of text.

== Putting it Together ==
These files should always be created using a program that doesn't include formating, and saves to a non-rich text format such as  '''notepad.exe (Win32)''', '''Pico (Command line)''', '''Kedit (KDE)''', or '''Gedit (GNOME)'''.

'''PHP:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

 &lt;?php
  $message = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
  echo $message;
 ?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''ColdFusion:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

 
  &lt;cfset message = &quot;Hello World!&quot;&gt;
  &lt;cfoutput&gt;#message#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
 

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Line Breakdown ==
This is a very simple example because they both do the same thing, in the same amount of code. Not too hard so far eh? Lets see what actually makes them tick...

'''PHP:'''
 '''07''' &lt;?php
 '''08'''  $message = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
 '''09'''  echo $message;
 '''10''' ?&gt;

 '''Line#07 &lt;?php''' Starts allowing php code to be parsed
 '''Line#08''' Stores '''$message''' with the value ''Hello World!''
 '''Line#09 echo''' Dumps the value ''Hello World!''
 '''Line#10 ?&gt;''' Ends php

'''ColdFusion:'''
 '''07''' &lt;cfoutput&gt;
 '''08'''   &lt;cfset message = &quot;Hello World!&quot;&gt;
 '''09'''   #message#
 '''10'''  &lt;/cfoutput&gt;

 '''Line#07 &lt;cfoutput&gt;''' Starts the ability to output to the browser
 '''Line#08 &lt;cfset''' Stores '''#message#''' with the value ''Hello World!''
 '''Line#09 #message#''' Dumps the value ''Hello World!''
 '''Line#10 &lt;/cfoutput&gt;''' End the ability to output to the browser

== What the Browser Sees ==
Either way, these two scripts produce the '''same exact''' page, the only thing different are the [[wikipedia:HTTP#Sample|server headers]].
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

Hello World!

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
== Displayed in Browser ==
 Hello World!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Inserting Variables ==
Both languages allow you to insert variables at any point. This is very useful if you have many lines of HTML, but only need to insert something simple. We will use the variable we created above.

'''PHP:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
Message holds: &lt;?=$message; ?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
(Note: This will ''not'' work in php if [http://www.php.net/ini.core#ini.short-open-tag short open tags] are disabled. This was enabled by default as of php 4.0.0)

'''ColdFusion:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
Message holds: &lt;cfoutput&gt;#message#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
(Note: It is considered poor form in CFML to place &lt;cfoutput&gt; tags at the beginning and end of a page, as the parser must evaluate every word for variables).

Both examples will print: ''Message holds: Hello World!''

      <text xml:space="preserve">When it comes to web design, many languages exist to create the structure for web-based applications. We will be comparing the languages [[wikipedia:PHP|PHP]] and [[wikipedia:ColdFusion|ColdFusion]].

PHP and ColdFusion are both created to help design web pages scripted in [[wikipedia:HTML|HTML]]. Alone, HTML cannot create dynamic content, connect to databases to perform queries, manipulate files or handle form data. This is where PHP and ColdFusion come in. The code between these languages may be completely different, however both have thousands of different functions that let you do everything from data encryption to image editing. We will be showing code examples between the two.

This section will guide you through the formatting techniques of the text. ''Formatting'' tends to refer to most things to do with appearance, so it makes the list of possible topics quite eclectic: text style, spacing, etc. If ''formatting'' may also refer to paragraphs and to the page layout, we will focus on the customization of words and sentences for now.

A lot of formatting techniques are required to differentiate certain elements from the rest of the text. It is often necessary to add emphasis to key words or phrases. ''Footnotes'' are useful for providing extra information or clarification without interrupting the main flow of text. So, for these reasons, formatting is very important. However, it is also very easy to abuse, and a document that has been over-done can look and read worse than one with none at all.

LaTeX is so flexible that we will actually only skim the surface, as you can have much more control over the presentation of your document if you wish. Having said that, one of the purposes of LaTeX is to take away the stress of having to deal with the physical presentation yourself, so you need not get too carried away!

==Spacing==

===Line Spacing===

If you want to use larger inter-line spacing in a document, you can change its value by putting the
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\linespread{factor}
}}

command into the preamble of your document. Use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\linespread{1.3}&lt;!----&gt;}} for &quot;one and a half&quot; line spacing, and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\linespread{1.6}&lt;!----&gt;}} for &quot;double&quot; line spacing. Normally the lines are not spread, so the default line spread factor is 1.

The {{LaTeX/Package|setspace}} package allows more fine-grained control over line spacing. To set &quot;one and a half&quot; line spacing document-wide, but not where it is usually unnecessary (e.g. footnotes, captions):

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{setspace}
%\singlespacing
\onehalfspacing
%\doublespacing
%\setstretch{1.1}
}}

To change line spacing within the document, the &lt;tt&gt;setspace&lt;/tt&gt; package provides the environments &lt;tt&gt;singlespace&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;onehalfspace&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;doublespace&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;spacing&lt;/tt&gt;:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
This paragraph has \\ default \\ line spacing.
 
\begin{doublespace}
  This paragraph has \\ double \\ line spacing.
\end{doublespace}
 
\begin{spacing}{2.5}
  This paragraph has \\ huge gaps \\ between lines.
\end{spacing}
}}

{{Warning|The line spacing value is contained in the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\baselineskip&lt;!----&gt;}} [[LaTeX/Lengths|length]], but it is not recommended to change its value since it will have an impact on other types of content than paragraphs, which will result in an undesired effect.}}

===Non-breaking spaces===

This ''essential'' feature is a bit unknown to newcomers, although it is available on most WYSIWYG document processors. A non-breaking space between two tokens (e.g. words, punctuation marks) prevents the processors from inserting a line break between them. Besides a non-breaking space cannot be enlarged. It is very important for a consistent reading.

LaTeX uses the '~' symbol as a non-breaking space.
You would  usually use non-breaking spaces for punctuation marks in some languages, for units and currencies, for initials, etc.
In French typography, you would put a non-breaking space before all two-parts punctuation marks.

Examples:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
D.~\textsc{Knuth}
50~€
}}

===Space between words and sentences ===

To get a straight right margin in the output, LaTeX inserts varying amounts of space between the words. By default, it also inserts slightly more space at the end of a sentence. However, the extra space added at the end of sentences is generally considered typographically old-fashioned in English language printing. (The practice is found in nineteenth century design and in twentieth century typewriter styles.) Most modern typesetters treat the end of sentence space the same as the interword space. (See for example, Bringhurst's ''Elements of Typographic Style''.) The additional space after periods can be disabled with the command

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\frenchspacing
}}

which tells LaTeX not to insert more space after a period than after ordinary character. Frenchspacing can be turned off later in your document via the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\nonfrenchspacing&lt;!----&gt;}} command.

If an author wishes to use the wider end-of-sentence spacing, care must be exercised so that punctuation marks are not misinterpreted as ends of sentences. TeX assumes that sentences end with periods, question marks or exclamation marks. Although if a period follows an uppercase letter, this is not taken as a sentence ending, since periods after uppercase letters normally occur in abbreviations. Any exception from these assumptions has to be specified by the author. A backslash in front of a space generates a space that will not be enlarged. A tilde ‘{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=~&lt;!----&gt;}}’ character generates a non-breaking space. The command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\@&lt;!----&gt;}} in front of a period specifies that this period terminates a sentence even when it follows an uppercase letter. (If you are using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\frenchspacing&lt;!----&gt;}}, then none of these exceptions need be specified.)

===Stretched spaces===

You can insert a horizontal stretched space with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hfill&lt;!----&gt;}} in a line so that the rest gets &quot;pushed&quot; toward the right margin.
For instance this may be useful in the header.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
Author Name \hfill \today
}}

Similarly you can insert vertical stretched space with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vfill&lt;!----&gt;}}. It may be useful for special pages.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\maketitle
\vfill
\tableofcontents
\clearpage

\section{My first section}
% ...
}}

See [[LaTeX/Lengths|Lengths]] for more details.

===Manual spacing===

The spaces between words and sentences, between paragraphs, sections, subsections, etc. is determined automatically by LaTeX. It is against LaTeX philosophy to insert spaces manually and will usually lead to bad formatting.
Manual spacing is a matter of macro writing and package creation.

See [[LaTeX/Lengths|Lengths]] for more details.

==Hyphenation==

LaTeX hyphenates words whenever necessary. Hyphenation rules will vary for different languages. LaTeX only supports english by default, so if you want to have correct hyphenation rules for your desired language, see [[LaTeX/Internationalization|Internationalization]].

If the hyphenation algorithm does not find the correct hyphenation points, you can remedy the situation
by using the following commands to tell TeX about the exception. The command
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=\hyphenation{word list} }}
causes the words listed in the argument to be hyphenated only at the points marked by “-”. The argument of the command should only contain words built from normal letters, or rather characters that are considered to be normal letters by LaTeX. It is known that the hyphenation algorithm does not find all correct American English hyphenation points for several words. A log of known exceptions is published periodically in the ''TUGboat'' journal. (See a 2008 list: http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb29-2/tb92hyf.pdf)

The hyphenation hints are stored for the language that is active when the hyphenation command occurs. This means that if you place a hyphenation command into the preamble of your document it will influence the English language hyphenation. If you place the command after the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{document}&lt;!----&gt;}} and you are using some package for national language support like babel, then the hyphenation hints will be active in the language activated through babel. The example below will allow “hyphenation” to be hyphenated as well as “Hyphenation”, and it prevents “FORTRAN”, “Fortran” and “fortran” from being hyphenated at all. No special characters or symbols are allowed in the argument. Example:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\hyphenation{FORTRAN Hy-phen-a-tion}
}}

The command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\-}} inserts a discretionary hyphen into a word.  This also becomes the only point where hyphenation is allowed in this word.  This command is especially useful for words containing special characters (e.g., accented characters), because LaTeX does not automatically hyphenate words containing special characters.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{minipage}{2in}
I think this is: su\-per\-cal\-%
i\-frag\-i\-lis\-tic\-ex\-pi\-%
al\-i\-do\-cious
\end{minipage}
|render=&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}\mbox{I think this is: supercalifragi-}\\
\mbox{listicexpialidocious}\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

LaTeX does not hyphenate compound words that contain a dash&lt;ref&gt;{{LaTeX/Package|hyphenat}} package documentation, p3&lt;/ref&gt;. There are two packages that can add back flexibility. The {{LaTeX/Package|hyphenat}} package supplies the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hyp}} command. This command typesets the dash and then subjects the constituent words to automatic hyphenation.  After loading the package:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{hyphenat}
}}

one should write, instead of electromagnetic-endioscopy:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
electromagnetic\hyp{}endioscopy
}}

The {{LaTeX/Package|extdash}} package also offers features for controlling the hyphenation of compound words containing dashes &amp;mdash; as opposed to the words themselves which it leaves to LaTeX.  The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=shortcuts}} option enables a more compressed syntax:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[shortcuts]{extdash}
}}

Typical usage is as follows, assuming the compressed syntax.  In both cases, LaTeX can break and hyphenate the constituent words, but in the latter case, it will not break after the L:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
electromagnetic\-/endioscopy
L\=/approximation
}}

One or more words can be kept together on the '''one line''' with the standard LaTeX command:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\mbox{text}
}}

This prevents hyphenation and causes its argument to be kept together under all circumstances.  For example:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
My phone number will change soon. It will be \mbox{0116 291 2319}.
}}

{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fbox}} is similar to {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mbox}}, but in addition there will be a visible box drawn around the content.

To avoid hyphenation altogether, the penalty for hyphenation can be set to an extreme value:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\hyphenpenalty=100000
}}

You can change the degree to which LaTeX will hyphenate by changing the value of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tolerance=1000}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hyphenpenalty=1000}}.
You'll have to experiment with the values to achieve the desired effect. A document which has a low tolerance value will cause LaTeX not to tolerate uneven spacing between words, hyphenating words more frequently than in documents with higher tolerances.
Also note that using a higher text width will decrease the probability of encountering badly hyphenated word. For example adding
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{geometry}
}}
will widen the text width and reduce the amount of margin overruns.

== Quote-marks ==

LaTeX treats left and right quotes as different entities. For single quotes, &lt;tt&gt;`&lt;/tt&gt; (on American keyboards, this symbol is found on the tilde key (adjacent to the number 1 key on most) gives a left quote mark, and &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; is the right. For double quotes, simply double the symbols, and LaTeX will interpret them accordingly. (Don't use the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; for right double quotes: when the &lt;tt&gt;babel&lt;/tt&gt; package is used for some languages (e.g. German), the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is redefined to produce an umlaut accent; using &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; for right double quotes will either lead to bad spacing or it being used to produce an umlaut). On British keyboards, ' &lt;tt&gt;`&lt;/tt&gt; ' is left of the ' 1 ' key and shares the key with ' ¬ ', and sometimes ' ¦ ' or ' | '. The apostrophe (') key is to the right of the colon/semicolon key and shares it with the ' @ ' symbol.

The right quote is also used for apostrophe in LaTeX without trouble.

For left bottom quote and European quoting style you need to use T1 font encoding enabled by:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
}}

See [[LaTeX/Fonts|Fonts]] for more details on font encoding.

The package {{LaTeX/Package|csquotes}} offers a multi-lingual solution to quotations, with integration to citation mechanisms offered by BibTeX. This package allows one for example to switch languages and quotation styles according to babel language selections.

== Diacritics and accents ==

Most accents and diacritics may be inserted with direct keyboard input by configuring the preamble properly. For symbols unavailable on your keyboard,
diacritics may be added to letters by placing special escaped metacharacters before the letter that requires the diacritic.

See [[LaTeX/Special Characters|Special Characters]].

==Margin misalignment and interword spacing==

Some very long words, numbers or URLs may not be hyphenated properly and move far beyond the side margin. One solution for this problem is to use {{LaTeX/Environment|sloppypar}} environment, which tells LaTeX to adjust word spacing less strictly. As a result, some spaces between words may be a bit too large, but long words will be placed properly.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
This is a paragraph with
a very long word ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRST;
then we have another bad thing
--- a long number 1234567890123456789.

\begin{sloppypar}
This is a paragraph with
a very long word ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRST;
then we have an another bad thing
--- a long number 1234567890123456789.
\end{sloppypar}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX sloppypar.png|450px|border]]
}}

Another solution is to edit the text to avoid long words, numbers or urls approaching the side margin.

==Ligatures==
Some letter combinations are typeset not just by setting the different letters one after the other, but by actually using special symbols (like &quot;ﬀ&quot;), called [[wikipedia:Typographical ligature|ligatures]].
Ligatures can be prohibited by inserting {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={}&lt;!----&gt;}} or, if this does not work, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={\kern0pt}&lt;!----&gt;}} between the two letters in question. This might be necessary with words built from two words. Here is an example:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\Large Not shelfful\\
but shelf{}ful
|render=
[[Image:Latex example ligatures.png|200px]]
}}

Some tools are unable to perform search in documents that contain ligatures (a search for &lt;code&gt;&quot;'''fi'''nally&quot;&lt;/code&gt; wouldn't find the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;'''ﬁ'''nally&quot;&lt;/code&gt;). If one desires, for greater accessibility, to disable ligatures altogether in the whole document, the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\DisableLigatures&lt;!----&gt;}} from the [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/microtype/ microtype package] can be used:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{microtype}
\DisableLigatures{encoding = *, family = *}
}}

Note that this will also disable ligatures such as &quot;--&quot; to &quot;–&quot;, &quot;---&quot; to &quot;—&quot;, etc.

If you are using XeLaTeX and OpenType fonts, the fontspec package allows for standard ligatures to be turned off as well as fancy swash ligatures to be turned on.

Another solution is to use the {{LaTeX/Package|cmap}} package, which will help the reader to interpret the ligatures:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[resetfonts]{cmap}
}}

==Slash marks==
The normal typesetting of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=/&lt;!----&gt;}} character in LaTeX does not allow following characters to be &quot;broken&quot; onto new lines, which often create &quot;overfull&quot; errors in output (where letters push off the margin). Words that use slash marks, such as &quot;input/output&quot; should be typeset as &quot;{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=input\slash output&lt;!----&gt;}}&quot;, which allow the line to &quot;break&quot; after the slash mark (if needed). The use of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=/&lt;!----&gt;}} character in LaTeX should be restricted to units, such as &quot;{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=mm/year&lt;!----&gt;}}&quot;, which should not be broken over multiple lines.

== Fonts ==

To change the font family, emphasize text, and other font-related issues, see [[LaTeX/Fonts|Fonts]].

== Formatting macros ==

Even if you can easily change the output of your fonts using those commands, you're better off not using explicit commands like this, because they work in opposition to the basic idea of LaTeX, which is to separate the logical and visual markup of your document. This means that if you use the same font changing command in several places in order to typeset a special kind of information, you should use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newcommand&lt;!----&gt;}} to define a &quot;logical wrapper command&quot; for the font changing command.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\newcommand{\oops}[1]{\textit{#1}&lt;!----&gt;}

Do not \oops{enter} this room,
it’s occupied by \oops{machines}
of unknown origin and purpose.
|render=
Do not ''enter'' this room, it’s occupied by ''machines'' of unknown origin and purpose.
}}

This approach has the advantage that you can decide at some later stage that you want to use some visual representation of danger other than {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textit&lt;!----&gt;}}, without having to wade through your document, identifying all the occurrences of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textit&lt;!----&gt;}} and then figuring out for each one whether it was used for pointing out danger or for some other reason.

See [[LaTeX/Macros|Macros]] for more details.

==Text mode superscript and subscript==

To superscript text in text-mode, you can use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textsuperscript{}&lt;!----&gt;}} command. This allows you to, for instance, typeset 6th as 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
Michelangelo was born on March 6\textsuperscript{th}, 1475.
}}

Subscripting in text-mode is not supported by LaTeX alone; however, several packages allow the use of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textsubscript{}&lt;!----&gt;}} command. For instance, [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/bpchem/ bpchem], [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/ KOMA-Script2], and [http://ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e fixltx2e] all support this command.  Of these, [http://ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e fixltx2e] is perhaps the most universal option since it is distributed with LaTeX and requires no additional packages to be implemented. 

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
% In your preamble, add:
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
...

% In your document:
It is found that height\textsubscript{apple tree} is
different than height\textsubscript{orange tree}.
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\text{It is found that height}_\text{apple tree}\text{ is different than height}_\text{orange tree}\text{.}\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

If you do not load a package that supports {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textsubscript{}&lt;!----&gt;}}, the math mode must be used. This is easily accomplished in running text by bracketing your text with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$&lt;!----&gt;}} symbol. In math mode subscripting is done using the underscore: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=_{}&lt;!----&gt;}}. 

For example, the formula for water is written as:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
H$_2$O is the formula for water
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\text{H}_2\text{O is the formula for water}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Note that in math mode text will appear in a font suitable for mathematical variables. In math mode, to generate roman text, for example, one would use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathrm&lt;!----&gt;}} command:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
This is $\mathrm{normal\ roman\ and}_\mathrm{subscript\ roman}$ text
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\text{This is }\mathrm{normal\ roman\ and}_\mathrm{subscript\ roman}\text{  text}&lt;/math&gt;
}}
Note the use of \&lt;space&gt; to insert a space in math mode.

Similarly, you can superscript using:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
This is $\mathrm{normal\ roman\ and}^\mathrm{superscript\ roman}$ text
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\text{This is }\mathrm{normal\ roman\ and}^\mathrm{superscript\ roman}\text{  text}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

A very common use of subscripts within the text environment is to typeset chemical formulae. For this purposes, a highly recommended package is [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mhchem/ mhchem]. This package is easy to use, and works with your text fonts (rather than math fonts). To insert a chemical formula, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ce{}&lt;!----&gt;}} with the text-equivalent formula, for example:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
% In your preamble, add:
\usepackage[version=3]{mhchem}
...

% In your document:
Ammonium sulphate is \ce{(NH4)2SO4}.
|render=
[[Image:Ammonium sulphate mhchem.png]]
}}

See also [[LaTeX/Chemical Graphics|Chemical Graphics]] for chemical symbols and formulas.

==Text figures (&quot;old style&quot; numerals)==

Many typographers prefer to use titling figures, sometimes called lining figures, when numerals are interspersed with full caps, when they appear in tables, and when they appear in equations, using [[w:Text figures|text figures]] elsewhere.  LaTeX allows this usage through the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\oldstylenums{}&lt;!----&gt;}} command:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\oldstylenums{1234567890}
}}

Some fonts do not have text figures built in; the {{LaTeX/Environment|textcomp}} package attempts to remedy this by effectively generating text figures from the currently-selected font.  Put {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{textcomp}&lt;!----&gt;}} in your preamble.  {{LaTeX/Environment|textcomp}} also allows you to use decimal points, properly formatted dollar signs, etc. within {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\oldstylenums{}&lt;!----&gt;}}.

One common use for text figures is in section, paragraph, and page numbers.  These can be set to use text figures by placing some code in your preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{textcomp}

% Enclose everything in an \AtBeginDocument{}
\AtBeginDocument{%
  % Make \section{} use text figures
  \let\myTheSection\thesection
  \renewcommand{\thesection}{ \oldstylenums{\myTheSection} }

  % Make \paragraph{} use text figures
  \let\myTheParagraph\theparagraph
  \renewcommand{\theparagraph}{ \oldstylenums{\myTheParagraph} }

  % Make the page numbers in text figures
  \let\myThePage\thepage
  \renewcommand{\thepage}{ \oldstylenums{\myThePage} }
}
}}

Should you use additional sectioning or paragraphing commands, you may adapt the previous code listing to include them as well.

;Note
A subsequent use of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagenumbering&lt;!----&gt;}} command, e.g., {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagenumbering{arabic}&lt;!----&gt;}}, will reset the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thepage&lt;!----&gt;}} command back to the original. Thus, if you use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagenumbering&lt;!----&gt;}} command in your document, be sure to reinstate your {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\myThePage definition&lt;!----&gt;}} from the code above:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
...
\tableofcontents
\pagenumbering{roman}
\chapter{Preface}
...
\chapter{Introduction}
...
\pagenumbering{arabic}
% without this, the \thepage command will not be in oldstyle (e.g., in your Table of Contents}
\renewcommand{\thepage}{ \oldstylenums{\myThePage} }
\Chapter{Foo}
...
}}

==Dashes and hyphens==
LaTeX knows four kinds of dashes: a [[w:hyphen|hyphen]] (-), [[w:Dash#En dash|en dash]] (–), [[w:Dash#Em dash|em dash]] (—), or a [[w:Plus and minus signs#Minus sign|minus sign]] (−). You can access three of them with different numbers of consecutive dashes. The fourth sign is actually not a dash at all—it is the mathematical minus sign:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
Hyphen: daughter-in-law, X-rated\\
En dash: pages 13--67\\
Em dash: yes---or no? \\
Minus sign: $0$, $1$ and $-1$
|render=
[[Image:Latex dashes example.png|200px]]
}}

The names for these dashes are: ‘-’(-) hyphen , ‘--’(&amp;ndash;) en-dash , ‘---’(&amp;mdash;) em-dash  and ‘&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;’(&amp;minus;) minus sign. They have different purposes:

[[Image:dashes.png]]

Use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hyp{}&lt;!----&gt;}} macro from {{LaTeX/Package|hyphenat}} package instead of hyphen if you want LaTeX to break compound words between lines.

The commands {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textendash}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textemdash}} are also used to produce en-dash (&amp;ndash;), and em-dash (&amp;mdash;), respectively.

== Ellipsis (…) ==

A sequence of three dots is known as an ''[[wikipedia:Ellipsis|ellipsis]]'', which is commonly used to indicate omitted text. On a typewriter, a comma or a period takes the same amount of space as any other letter. In book printing, these characters occupy only a little space and are set very close to the preceding letter. Therefore, you cannot enter ‘ellipsis’ by just typing three dots, as the spacing would be wrong. Instead, there is a special command for these dots. It is called {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ldots&lt;!----&gt;}}:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
Not like this ... but like this:\\
New York, Tokyo, Budapest, \ldots
|render=
[[Image:Latex example text dots.png|200px]]
}}

Alternatively, you can use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textellipsis&lt;!----&gt;}} command which allows the spacing between the dots to vary.

==Ready-made strings==

There are some very simple LaTeX commands for typesetting special text strings:
[[Image:Latex ready-made strings.png|center|300px]]

{{-}}
{{TODO|Describe &lt;tt&gt;microtype&lt;/tt&gt; package -- hanging punctuation, font expansion, additional kerning.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Up until the 19th century, '''atoms''' were once thought to be the smallest building blocks of matter, and that matter could not be broken down any further. We now know that atoms are made up of smaller, sub-atomic, particles. This has also helped us to understand the nuclear processes such as '''fission''' and '''fusion'''.

==Structure of the atom==
[[Image:Plum_pudding_atom.svg|100px|thumb|right|Plum pudding atom]]
Near the end of the 19th century, it was widely accepted that the atom was neutral as a whole, and had areas of concentrated negative lumps within a larger positive structure. This model of the atom was called the '''plum pudding model''', where the pudding was positive, and the plums were the negative electrons. This is also called the '''chocolate chip cookie model'''.

===Discovery of the nucleus===

In 1906, [[w:Ernest Rutherford|Ernest Rutherford]] was investigating the passage of α particles through gold foil. What he found was that most of the α particles passed straight through the foil, and there was some that were deflected by an angle of greater than 90°. It was known that α particles were smaller than atoms and had a positive charge, and from this Rutherford concluded that the atom is mostly empty space and has a positively charged '''nucleus''' at the center, which was repelling the α particles. This experiment disproved the plum pudding model, and the new '''nuclear model''' was now the widely accepted model. He also calculated that the nucleus had a diameter of around &lt;math&gt;10^{-14} m&lt;/math&gt;.

Later, the negative &quot;lumps&quot; that originally led to the plum pudding model were found to actually be electrons orbiting the nucleus with a relatively large radius of about &lt;math&gt;10^{-10} m&lt;/math&gt;, also confirming that an atom is mostly empty space.

===Discovery of the proton===

The next step was to find out what the nucleus was made up of. The '''proton''' was discovered, again by Rutherford, in 1919. To find the protons, he placed a source of α radiation inside a cylinder of nitrogen gas. The cylinder had an opening at one end, which was covered by a sheet of aluminium foil. A screen was placed outside the opening, and flashes of light were observed on the screen. The flashes of light were caused by particles hitting the screen, but since it was known that aluminium foil prevents α particles from passing through, another, smaller, particle must have been hitting the screen. Rutherford asked two of his research students, Geiger and Marsden, to take measurements of the deflection angles of the particles, and he found by calculations that the proton was smaller than most nuclei, and had a positive charge which was the same magnitude of an electron. The distribution of the deflected alpha particles is different for different forces (for example, magnetic, hard sphere etc.). Rutherford was able to be sure that the nucleus was positively charged.

===Discovery of the neutron===

In 1932, [[w:James_Chadwick|James Chadwick]] discovered a particle that was slightly greater in mass than the proton and had no electric charge, which he called the '''neutron'''. He used α radiation from polonium, and directed it towards some beryllium. The beryllium emitted neutrons when it was bombarded with the α radiation, but since they have no charge, they were hard to detect. Chadwick placed some paraffin wax in the path of the neutrons, and the paraffin wax emitted high energy protons (paraffin wax contains a large amount of hydrogen). This showed that there were particles hitting the atoms of the paraffin wax without being slowed down by the positively charged nucleus of the atoms, and that they collide elastically with atoms.

===Evidence of crystal structure===

A beam of X-rays can be directed at a piece of crystalline material, and the resulting dots on the screen behind it are a regularly spaced pattern. The regularly spaced dots are evidence that the atoms in the material have a crystal structure. If the atoms weren't in a crystal structure, the resulting pattern would be smeared rings.

X-rays are used because the wavelength of X-rays are roughly the same as the spacing between atoms, and therefore the diffraction is greatest. An electron beam can also be used to provide the same evidence.

===Evidence of the size of nuclei===

A beam of '''high-energy electrons''' can be used to find the radius of nuclei. High-energy electrons are electrons that have been accelerated to high velocities, so that their [[A-level Physics/Electrons and Photons/Quantum physics|de Broglie wavelength]] could be changed to match the spacings of nuclei. The electrons are diffracted around different nuclei and calculations are done to find the radius of a nucleus from the angle of diffraction.

===Relative sizes===

The size of various particles were found from the above experiments as:

*'''radius of proton''' ≈ '''radius of neutron''' ≈ &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;m
*'''radius of nucleus''' ≈ &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;m to &lt;math&gt;10^{-14}&lt;/math&gt;m
*'''radius of atom''' ≈ &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;m
*'''radius of molecule''' ≈ &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;m to &lt;math&gt;10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;m

==Nuclear processes==

===Nuclear equations===
[[Image:Atom.png|right|100px|thumb|A helium atom]]
If we look at a helium nucleus, we can see that it has two neutrons and two protons. It can be represented like this:

:&lt;math&gt;\ ^4 _2He&lt;/math&gt;

The 4 at the top represents the number of nucleons in the nucleus, and is therefore called the '''nucleon number''', and sometimes the '''mass number'''. It is sometimes denoted by the letter A.

The 2 at the bottom represents the number of protons, and is therefore called the '''proton number''', or '''atomic number''', and is sometimes denoted by the letter Z. To be more precise, however, the proton number represents the charge of the nucleus, so that an electron is represented by:

:&lt;math&gt;\ ^0 _{-1}e&lt;/math&gt;

In all nuclear processes, there is always a balance. The number of neutrons and protons are always the same before and after a process, and so the nucleon and proton numbers must stay the same. Consider the reaction:

:&lt;math&gt;\ ^2 _1H + \ ^2 _1H = \ ^4 _2He&lt;/math&gt;

Here 2 hydrogen nuclei fuse to form a helium nucleus. You can add the nucleon numbers together, to give &lt;math&gt;2+2=4&lt;/math&gt;, and you can add the proton numbers together, to give &lt;math&gt;1+1=2&lt;/math&gt;. As you can see, both sides of the equals sign are balanced.

===Nuclear fission===
The splitting up of nucleus into two approximately equal fragments.

===Nuclear fusion===
It is when smaller nuclei combines to form larger stable nuclei.

==Isotopes==
Isotopes have same number of protons but different number of neutrons.

| Sample position for K+Q vs. K mate
}}

This book is an exact analysis of the KQK endgame, where one player has a King and a Queen and the other player has only a King.  It is relatively easy to generate a computer database, called a [[wikipedia:Tablebase|tablebase]], which has all the possible positions and the number of moves to checkmate for each position.  Although this tablebase provides a complete solution to the KQK endgame, it is in a format that can only be used by a computer.  This book shows the optimum method for forcing checkmate in a human-understandable format.

In normal play, there is no need to follow an optimal algorithm.  A much simpler algorithm like the one in the [[Chess/The_Endgame#King_and_Queen_vs._King|Chess Wikibook]] will deliver checkmate only a few moves later than the optimal algorithm, but easily within the [[wikipedia:Fifty move rule|50-move limit]].

In all the positions given, by convention the stronger side is White.  The number of moves to checkmate is the number of moves required by White, including the checkmating move.  For example, in the sample position given, &quot;White to play mates in 5&quot; means that White's fifth move is the checkmating move, e.g. 1.Kb5 Kc7 2.Qe6 Kd8 3.Qf7 Kc8 4.Kc6 Kd8 5.Qd7#.  If it is Black's move, &quot;Black to play loses in 5&quot; means that White's fifth move (which is numbered 6) is the checkmating move, e.g. 1... Kc6 2.Qd3 Kb7 3.Qd7+ Kb8 4.Kb5 Ka8 5.Kb6 Kb8 6.Qd8#.  The results are for optimal play by both sides.  If Black plays less than optimally, he could get checkmated sooner, and if White plays less than optimally, it could take longer to checkmate.

| Stalemate position D
}}
There are a total of 23,048 drawn positions in the KQK endgame.  The drawn positions consist of only positions where Black is [[wikipedia:Stalemate|stalemated]] or the white queen is [[wikipedia:Chess terminology#E|en prise]].

There are four stalemate configurations, which are shown in the diagrams.  If the black king is in the corner, the three flight squares can be covered by the queen as shown in stalemate position A.  The white king can be on any of the remaining 59 squares, so considering rotations and reflections, there are 59 x 8 = 472 positions of this type.  If the white king covers two of the flight squares (stalemate position B), the queen only needs to cover one square.  If the white king is on b6, the queen has to attack along the diagonal, so there are five possible squares, while if the white king is on a6, it can also attack along the file, so there are ten squares.  Considering rotations and reflections, there are 15 x 8 = 120 positions of this type.

With the black king on the side of the board, there are also two types of stalemate.  In Stalemate position C, the queen covers four of the five flight squares, and the white king covers the fifth square, which it can do from five possible squares.  The same thing happens with the position shifted 1, 2, 3, or 4 files to the right.  When shifted 5 files to the right there are only two places for the white king.  Thus, with rotations and reflections, there are 27 x 8 = 216 positions of this type.  Stalemate position D shows a fourth type of stalemate.  The queen covers four of the five flight squares again, but the fifth square is now next to the black king instead of diagonal from it.  There are two squares the white king can be on, and the position can be shifted 1, 2, or 3 positions to the right.  So with rotations and reflections, there are 8 x 8 = 64 positions of this type.

Next, we need to calculate the number of positions with the queen en prise.  There are 64 possible positions for the black king.  The white queen must be next to the black king, so there are three possibilities if the black king is in the corner, five possibilities if it is on the side, and eight possibilities if it is in the middle.  The white king can not be next to the black king, as that would create an illegal position, and it can not be next to the queen, as it would then be protecting the queen from capture.  The following table shows the number of possibilities for the white king for each configuration of white queen and black king.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;

The 22,176 positions with queen en prise plus the 872 stalemate positions account for the 23,048 drawn positions.

| Type C checkmating position
}}

There are a total of 364 checkmating positions, which appear as &quot;Black to move loses in 0&quot; in the tablebase.

All of the checkmating positions have the black king on the side of the board or in the corner.  With the black king in the middle of the board, there are two cases: the queen sitting next to the black king and the queen at least two squares away.  If the queen sits next to the black king, it must be protected by the white king.  As a result, the white king does not cover any squares not already covered by the queen, and the queen can not cover all the squares.  If the queen is at least two squares away, it can only cover four squares in addition to giving check, and the white king can only cover three.

The checkmate positions fall into three major categories.  In positions of type A, the kings are in [[Chess/The_Endgame#The_Opposition|opposition]], with the queen checking from the side.  The queen needs to be at least two squares from the black king, so there are six positions with the king on a8 and five each with the king on b8, c8, or d8.  When the black king is on a8, the white king can be on b6 as well as a6, so there are six additional positions for a total of 27, so including rotations and reflections there are 27 x 8 = 216.

In positions of type B, the queen stands next to the black king, protected by the white king.  There are two positions with the king on a8 and three each with the king on b8, c8, or d8.  With the king on a8, the queen can also be on b7, so there are three more positions for a total of 14.  Since one of the positions has all three pieces on the diagonal, rotations and reflections give (1 x 4) + (13 x 8) = 108 positions.

In positions of type C, the white king is on the file adjacent to the black king, and the queen checks from the side, two squares away.  The square left uncovered by moving the king to the side is covered by the queen.  There is one position with the black king on b8, and two each with the black king on c8 and d8 for a total of five, or 40 with rotations and reflections.

That gives a total of 216 + 108 + 40 = 364 positions, which are all the checkmating positions.

Positions of type C only make an evaluation difference for themselves and positions one ply previous.  For example, going back from the diagram position, the queen must have moved last, and it could only have come from one of the following squares: a4, b5, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e7, f7, g6, or h5, since it could not have been giving check.  If it was on e7 or f7, White could have chosen to checkmate on c7 instead of e8.

If the white queen was on one of the other squares and Black moved from b8, White would have missed a (Type A) checkmate.  If Black moved from either d7 or d8, he could have moved to one of e7, d7, or d8 instead of c8, escaping checkmate for a while.  The analysis is similar for the position moved one file to the right or one, two, or three files to the left, which are all the Type C positions.  Thus, Type C positions can be safely ignored unless White has an immediate checkmate.

{{-}}
==White mates in 1==

There are 2,448 positions where White mates in 1.  With the black king in the corner, there are 744 positions.  If the position is rotated and reflected to put the black king on a8, the white king will be on either a6 (376 positions), b6 (320 positions), or c6 (48 positions).  With the black king on the side of the board, there are 968 positions with the kings in opposition and 736 with White's king one square to the side.

==The longest position==

}}

There is only one position (8 with rotations and reflections) that is mate in 10 with White to play.  Since there are 8 squares the black king might have come from, there are 8 positions that are lost in 10 with Black to move.  Since two of these have all the pieces on the same long diagonal, there are 56 total positions including rotations and reflections.

From the diagram, any move except 1.Qd5+?? and 1.Qc6+?? will work.

{{-}}

==General algorithm==

The next logical step in this process is to provide a general algorithm that can be used for all positions.  I have not completed this analysis yet.  I am having difficulty generating a list of possible moves from a given position (yeah - it seems really simple, but there are thousands of positions).  I need to verify that all the moves that fit the pattern are actually optimal.

The general outline of the algorithm is:

1. Restrict the black king to either:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a. the rank or file at the edge of the board

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;b. the two ranks or two files at the edge of the board

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;c. the same half of the board as the white king, or

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;d. the same quarter of the board as the white king

2. Bring the white king near the black king

3. Force the black king to the edge of the board

4. Deliver checkmate

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use==

; Apostrophes are used to indicate possession and in contractions.
: Add an 's when the noun does not end in an &quot;s&quot; (driver's) or when the noun is singular and ends in an &quot;s&quot; (Lois's).
:: However, if the pronunciation of a word would be awkward with the &quot;s&quot; added, it is acceptable not to use the extra &quot;s&quot;.
: If the noun is plural and ends in &quot;s&quot;, you don't need to add an apostrophe (diplomas' instead of diploma's).

; Joint Possession
: If there is a compound noun, add the possessive apostrophe to the last noun.  
:: Example: ''I went to see Anthony and George's new apartment.''  (The apartment belongs to both Anthony and George.)
: If the compound noun indicates individual possession, add the apostrophe to both nouns. 
:: Example:  ''Mary's and Brian's sense of style was quite different.'' (Mary and Brian have individual senses of style.)   

; Compound Nouns
: If a compound noun uses dashes, place the apostrophe after the last nouns. 
:: Example:  ''My brother-in-law's house''

==Common Misuses==
* Do not use apostrophes in nouns that are not possessive.  Example:  Some parent's are more strict than mine.  (Apostrophe is not necessary)
* Do not use an apostrophe in possessive pronouns such as its, whose, his, hers, ours, yours, and theirs.

==Various==
A laundry list of primitives is not very useful on the first page of this doc. Useful maybe in an appendix or separate pages.

== Turing complete ==

&quot;Turing complete&quot; in &quot;TeX is Turing complete&quot; is a poor expression to use to address a general audience.

== Naming policy violation ==

This book ''does'' violate Wikibooks naming policy, so I don't understand why template informing about it is constantly being removed from its main page. Backslash is not slash and pages like [[TeX\bye]] appear as separate books in statistics like &quot;Random book&quot; or [http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm].

I see no reason why subpages in this book couldn't be named [[TeX/bye]] instead of [[TeX\bye]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:22, 5 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Using quoted material within your own writing */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use==
Quotation marks are used to mark direct quotations. This is to give the original writer or speaker credit for their work. If you are paraphrasing, you do not need quotation marks.  

* If you are using a long quotation (long is constituted by 4 or more typed lines), instead of quotation marks, you should indent the quotation.  If the quote is two or more paragraphs, indent the first line of the paragraphs an additional five spaces (plus the indent of the rest of the quote).  When indenting to quote, you do not need to use quotation marks.
* If your quote has a quote within it, the inner quote needs one quotation mark and the outer quote needs two quotation marks.  
* Use quotation marks around the titles of short works such as newspapers and magazine articles, poems, short stories, songs and chapters.
* Periods and commas should be placed inside the quotation marks.  Colons and semicolons should be placed outside the quotation marks.  Question marks and exclamation points should be placed inside the quotation marks, unless the punctuation applies to the whole sentence (not just the quote).
* You can set off words by using quotation marks instead of italicizing or underlining them.

==Using quoted material within your own writing==

* If a quotation is introduced formally, use a colon.
* If a quotation is being used with &quot;he said&quot; or &quot;she said,&quot; use a comma.
* If a quotation is blended into the writer's sentence, you can use a comma, although no punctuation may be more appropriate.
* If a quotation is used at the beginning of a sentence, use a comma after the quote unless the quote ends in a question mark or exclamation point.
* If you choose to break up the quotation with your own words, use commas to offset the quotation from your explanation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''IgA Nephropathy'''

==What is IgA Nephropathy?==
*the most common non-diabetic kidney disease
*IgA, a normal component of the blood, collects in the kidney as damaging deposits
*due to either increased production or reduced clearance of the immune protein IgA and associated antigen complexes
*deposits collect in small blood vessels in the glomeruli (the filtering structure of the kidney)
*20%- 30% of patients will suffer eventual kidney failure within 10-20 years
*more likely if they have high levels of creatinine in blood at time of diagnosis
*will require life saving dialysis and/or a kidney transplant
*a large proportion of patients who present with symptoms have a mild form of the disease
*most people probably never know they have the disease or discover it at a late stage

==Warning Signs of Kidney Disease==
*tea colored urine (hematuria - blood in the urine)
*very foamy urine (proteinuria - protein in the urine)
*puffiness around the eyes, hands, or feet (edema - fluid retention)
*high blood pressure
*pain in the small of the back just below the ribs not aggravated by motion.
*frequent urge to urinate especially at night, and/or reduced amount of urine produced

==Treatment==
*no medical treatments except in the latest stages of the disease
*transplant success rate is good (symptoms mild, though deposits will appear in the transplanted kidney after one year)
*some therapies can delay the deterioration of kidney function for many years
*ACE inhibitors, fish oil, steroid treatment, tonsillectomy
*control of associated hypertension is important

==Diagnosis==
*the presence of blood and/or protein in the urine
*some nephrologists may microscopically examination urine and red blood cell casts
*to confirm a diagnosis, it is necessary to perform a renal biopsy and examine kidney tissue microscopically for the presence of the characteristic IgA deposits in the glomeruli
*no genetic testing available

==Causes==
*unknown (recurrence risk also unknown)
*genetic influences may play a role in the development of the disease
*seems to cluster in certain families and in certain areas of the world
*associated with major histocompatibility HLA and certain other genetic markers
*HLA-DR4 is detectable in about 50% of patients

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Incontinence'''

==General Information==
*Refers to inability to retain urine in bladder
*Due to neurologic or mechanical disorder
*Normal bladder function
**Detrusor muscle provides propulsive force for emptying bladder
***Smooth muscle under parasympathetic autonomic control
***Involves pelvic nerves from sacral spinal cord
**Layer of smooth muscle of trigonal part of bladder acts as involuntary internal sphincter
***Helps prevent incontinence even if no voluntary control
***Innervated by motor fibers from T11 to L2
**External sphincter and perineal muscles under voluntary control of pudendal nerves
**Sensory tracts of pain, temperature, and distention pass from bladder to pelvic nerves to sacral spine to medulla of brain to cortical centers
*Infants and adults with spinal damage above S2 urinate spontaneously when bladder fills

==Causes of Incontinence==
*Detrusor instability
**Bladder prone to uncontrollable contractions
**Caused by damage to inhibitory neural pathways (70% of incontinence among elderly)
***Cerbrovascualr accidents
***Alzheimer's disease
***Neoplasia
***Hydrocephalus (?maybe?)
**Could also be caused by bladder or pelvic infection or tumor, fecal impaction, uterine prolapse, and prostate hypertrophy
**May be treated with Imipramine or calcium channel blockers
*Stress incontinence
**Common in postmenopausal parous women
**Structures of female urethra atrophy when deprived of estrogen
***Pass urine under increased abdominal pressure during coughing, sneezing, climbing stairs
***Physical activity may result in small amount of urine escaping
*Mechanical incontinence
**Congenital anomalies, extrophy of bladder, patent urachus, and ectopic ureteral openings
**Correctable by surgery only
**May also be caused by prostate surgery, pelvic surgery, or irradiation of uterus or rectum
*Overflow or paradoxical incontinence
**Large residual volumes of urine
**Secondary to obstruction at bladder neck or urethra, or neurologic damage
**May occur in diseases that produce autonomic peripheral neuropathy
***Diabetes mellitus, uremia, hypothyroidism, chronic alcoholism, Guillain-Barre syndrome, collagen vascular diseases, and toxic neuropathy caused by carcinomas
***Also may be due to prolonged distension of bladder
**May be treated surgically if obstruction or with bethanechol chloride
*Psychogenic and funnctional incontinence
**Occurs in children and some adults
**May be to draw attention to themselves
**May have psychological cause from abuse or other traumatic experiences
*Enuresis
**Involuntary passage of urine at night during sleep
**Considered normal under age of 2 years as neurological controls are still developing
***Approximately 10% of children have some degree of enuresis beyond age of three
****May be due to delay in maturation of bladder control
****May be familial
***Usually ceases by age of puberty unless disease interferes
****Urinary tract infections, obstructive lesions, neurovesical dysfunction, and polyuric conditions that overload the bladder
****Usually incontinent during the day also if one of these conditions

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Infertility'''

==Much more than &quot;just a female problem&quot;==
*Infertility is a condition of the reproductive system. It refers to actively trying to conceive for one year without achieving a pregnancy.
*Infertility includes difficulty conceiving, as well as the inability to carry a pregnancy to term that results in a live birth.
*There are two types of infertility. Primary infertility refers to cases where there has never been any evidence of pregnancy. Secondary infertility refers to cases of miscarriage (where a pregnancy has previously been indicated).
*Infertility may have one or several causes and is diagnosed with a series of tests comprising an &quot;infertility work-up&quot;.
*Approximately 40% of infertility is due to a female factor and 40% is due to a male factor. In 10% of the remaining cases, the infertility results from problems due to the combination of factors in both partners. The other 10% of cases cannot be explained.
*Infertility affects 14-20% of married couples in the United States.

==Common Causes of Infertility==
*Female:
**advanced maternal age (past 35, it becomes harder for the pituitary to stimulate the ovaries)
**history of pelvic inflammatory disease
**history of miscarriage
**tubal factors (blockage from infection or adhesions)
**peritoneal factors (endometriosis)
**inability to ovulate (polycystic ovarian disease, premature ovarian failure, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactemia)
**uterine factors (fibroids, polyps, septum or other abnormality)
**cervical factors (hostile environment, anti-sperm antibodies, too little or too much mucus, surgery/biopsy scars)
*Male:
**low semen volume (producing less than 1 or 2 cc)
**low sperm count (less than 20 million per cc)
**inappropriate sperm morphology
**poor sperm motility
**inability of the sperm to progress or move forward

==Infertility Testing: What can we do?==
*physical examination of both partners - determine their general state of health and to evaluate physical disorders that may be causing infertility. Usually both partners are interviewed about their sexual habits in order to determine whether intercourse is taking place properly for conception.
*If no cause can be determined at this point, more specific tests may be recommended. For women, these include an analysis of body temperature and ovulation, x-ray of the fallopian tubes and uterus, and laparoscopy. For men, initial tests focus on semen analysis.
*karyotyping - check the couple's chromosomes for aneuploidy, rearrangements, or balanced translocations

==Infertility Treatments: What are the options?==
*Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) is a collective term which refers to a variety of medical procedures used to achieve a pregnancy
*in vitro fertilization (IVF) - sidesteps tubal factors by bypassing the fallopian tubes
*hormone treatments - eliminates ovulation problems by using medication (such as Clomid) to stimulate the ovaries
*intrauterine insemination - bypasses cervix factors
*surgery - eliminates uterine factors by removing a septum or treating endometriosis
*Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) - uses IVF (which only requires one sperm) to avoid male sperm factors
*donor eggs, donor sperm, surrogate carriers
**Please keep in mind. . .Infertility often creates one of the most distressing life crises that a couple has ever experienced together. The long term inability to conceive a child can evoke significant feelings of loss. Coping with the multitude of medical decisions and the uncertainties that infertility brings can create great emotional upheaval for most couples. Couples often feel anxious, depressed, out of control, and isolated.**

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Value Types==

An iterator is a section of code that enables one to tranverse a data structure and return each element of the same type in turn.

The iterator code uses the yield return statement to return each element in turn. When the yield return statement is reached, the current location is stored. Execution is restarted from this location the next time the iterator is called.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Keratoconus'''

==Assess Knowledge==
*What do you already know about Keratoconus?
*What are your concerns today? What issues to you wish to discuss?

==Intake and Family History==
*Discuss prepared pedigree to confirm the known cases of keratoconus

==Etiology==
*the underlying reason for its development remains obscure; currently the topic of much research
*usually an inherited corneal disorder, often in an autosomal recessive fashion
*family members may have it, but it also can be random with no other family members affected (sporadic)
*most likely that the cause is due to more than one factor
**the path that leads to the thinning of the cornea may start with a &quot;trigger&quot;, followed by a cascade of events in the eye tissues
**the primary trigger is not known.
***possible options include hormonal changes in the patient, genetic predisposition to altered cytokines and/or their receptors in the patient's cornea, or a pattern of eye-rubbing that could release factors
**abnormal levels of degradative protease activity may then lead to a slow, progressive dissolution of Bowman's layer and the epithelial basement membrane
**the epithelium then comes into contact with the stroma, cytokines/growth factors are released, and as a result, the cells begin to produce scar tissue and proteases
*a disorder with local micro-environmental changes rather than a situation where the entire cornea is involved
**within a single keratoconus cornea there are areas of increased protease activity (thinning) and other areas of ongoing wound healing (scar tissue buildup)
*recent advances in molecular techniques make it possible to examine the molecular components in wounded or diseased corneas
**CD45 (leukocyte common antigen or T200), a transmembrane phosphotyrosine phosphatase (normally found associated with blood cells), has been found to be present in more cells within keratoconus corneas than normal
***these cells may represent the source of some of the proteolytic enzymes reported to be associated with keratoconus
**a gene product referred to as glucose regulated protein (GRP78) has been found in greater quantity in normal corneas
***a protein that aids or &quot;chaperones&quot; the folding and secretion of other proteins produced in cells
***the reduction in GRP78 could affect the secretion and folding of the major structural proteins of the cornea which are reduced in the keratoconus cornea.

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*some cases have a hereditary component and studies indicate that about 8% of patients have affected relatives
*most cases appear to be sporadic
*the actual incidence is uncertain, large studies estimate 50 to 230 per 100,000
*according to one study, the estimated prevalence in first-degree relatives is 3.34%, which is 15 to 67 times higher than that in the general population (0.23-0.05%). (Am J Med Genet 2000 Aug 28;93(5):403-9 )
*occurs in all ethnic groups
*has a slight female preponderance
*is more common in contact lens wearers and nearsighted eyes
*some researchers believe allergy may play a role

==Clinical Features==
*non-inflammatory eye condition in which the normally round dome-shaped cornea progressively thins causing a cone-like bulge to develop
**results in significant visual impairment
*a degenerative condition where the cornea thins in affected areas and scar tissue develops
**can lead to astigmatism - often regular at first but becoming increasingly irregular as the disease progresses
*surface thinning can create several optical zones that individually focus the same image to different areas of the retina, thus creating multiple perceived images
*has been associated with other medical disorders including atopic disease, Down's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan's syndrome, craniofacial dysostosis and osteogenesis imperfecta
*not a blinding disorder, but does result in increasing near-sightedness (things far away are out of focus) and irregular astigmatism (things look tilted)
*is almost always bilateral (90% of cases)

==Natural History==
*in the earliest stages, slight blurring, distortion of vision, and increased sensitivity to glare and light occur
**symptoms usually first appear in the late teens and early twenties
**mean age of onset is 16; onset as young as 6 yrs has been recorded
**rarely develops after age 30
*may progress for 10-20 years and then slow in its progression
**may halt at any stage from mild to severe
*each eye may be affected differently
**disease develops asymmetrically: diagnosis of the disease in the second eye generally occurs about five years after diagnosis in the first
*patients may endure discomfort and reduced vision over a long period of time

==Testing==
*can usually be diagnosed with slit lamp examination of the cornea
*early cases may require corneal topography, a test that makes a stereo image which gives a topographic map of the corneal curvature
*when advanced, the cornea will be thinner in areas and this can be measured by pachymetry
*the biomicroscope is the only tool which allows a clinician to observe many classical signs of keratoconus: Fleischer's ring, stress lines of Vogt, corneal thinning and scarring, various types of staining with and without lens wear, increased visibility of corneal nerves, and corneal hydrops.

==Management and treatment==
*eyeglasses or soft contact lenses may be used to correct the mild nearsightedness and astigmatism of early stages
*as the disorder progresses and the cornea continues to thin and change shape, rigid gas permeable contact lenses can be prescribed to correct vision
**contact lenses must be carefully fitted, and frequent checkups and lens changes may be needed to achieve and maintain good vision
**rigid contact lenses aid in flattening the corneal surface and provide optimal visual correction
*in severe cases, a corneal transplant may be needed due to scarring, extreme thinning or contact lens intolerance
**a surgical procedure that replaces the keratoconus cornea with healthy donor tissue
**20-25% of those with keratoconus ultimately require corneal transplant surgery
***success rate of greater than 90%
**corneal transplant is warranted when the cornea becomes dangerously thin or when sufficient visual acuity to meet the individual's needs can no longer be achieved by contact lenses due to steepening of the cornea, scaring or lens intolerance
**the more severe the keratoconus is, the more likely it is to see a dramatic improvement immediately after surgery
**the majority of keratoconus patients have their sutures removed 6-12 months after surgery (depends on healing rate)
**a small percentage of transplant patients do obtain uncorrected vision good enough that neither glasses nor contacts are needed after surgery, but in the majority of cases, some form of vision correction is needed after surgery

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Klinefelter Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*The most common sex chromosome abnormality
*The most common cause of male hypogonadism and infertility
*Characterized by the addition of at least one extra X chromosome to a 46,XY male karyotype
**Most descriptions refer to 47,XXY karyotype
**Over 50% of males with Klinefelter syndrome have 47,XXY karyotype
**Those with mosaicism or other chromosome complements may have different prognosis
*Presentation and prognosis are quite variable
*In 1942, Dr. Klinefelter described testicular dysgenesis (defective development), elevated urinary gonadotropins (hormones that stimulate the gonads) microorchidism (small testes), eunuchoidism (deficient hormone production by the testes), azoospermia (no spermatozoa in the semen), and gynecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue)
*The clinical features are not present until mid to late adolescence, so it is technically correct to refer to fetuses, newborns, and children as having 47,XXY
**Reserve the term Klinefelter syndrome for affected adolescents and adults

==Diagnosis==
*Most are identified by a karyotype as part of a work-up for infertility or by prenatal diagnosis detected by amniocentesis performed for other indications

==Incidence==
*Estimated to be 1/500 to 1/1000 male births
*But many are probably never diagnosed

==Clinical Manifestations==
*Lifespan is normal
*Development
**By adolescence, most boys are at or above the 80th percentile for height
**There is a tendency toward slightly delayed motor and language milestones
**2/3 of boys with 47,XXY are delayed in walking
**Key language milestones may be delayed in up to 50% affected but are often within normal limits
**Sensorimotor integration problems may arise by age 6-7 years
***May include hypotonia, apraxia, primitive reflex tension, and problems with bilateral coordination and visual perceptual motor integration
**On average, intellectual skills are slightly diminished and learning problems are increased, but this varies widely
**Cognitive difficulties are largely limited to the area of verbal skills
**Reading skills are the area of academic progress that can be most problematic for boys with 47,XXY
**Often boys are unable to demonstrate success in physical achievements as compared to male peers
*Behavior
**Tend to be shy, nonassertive, and immature
**Language difficulties contribute to the reluctance for interpersonal interactions
**Aggressive behavior can occur due to prolonged frustration but are not characteristic of this group
**Some investigators have reported an increased occurrence of ADHD but others have not
**Adolescent males are often reluctant to speak freely and lack confidence
**Some may experience serious psychological distress due to limited athletic and academic success and continued learning difficulties
**There are few reports on the adult adaptation of men with 47,XXY
**Sexual functioning is typically normal, although sexual drive is often low if supplemental testosterone therapy is not utilized
**There is no evidence for increased aberrant sexual behavior
**There is normal gender orientation
*Endocrine
**Sexual development is normal in infancy and during childhood
**There is an adolescent elevation of testosterone that begins to plateau around age 14 years, then serum levels remain in the low to low normal adult range
**By mid-puberty, boys have FSH and LH levels 5-10 times the normal range
**Due to endocrine changes, testicular growth is arrested
***Testicular volume and size is decreased
***The number of Leydig cells (testosterone-secreting cells) is decreased
**Gynecomastia is seen in about 15% of cases
***Increased breast tissue is common in adolescent males, but it may not always regress in some adolescents with 47,XXY
***Supplemental testosterone does not usually prevent or diminish gynecomastia but simple mastectomy can be performed
**Facial hair, axillary hair, and pubic hair all increase during puberty, but this may occur to a lesser degree than in 46,XY males
***Hair pattern is male
**Older literature described fat distribution as being female, but this is not true
*Infertility
**Sexual function is normal, but ejaculate contains no sperm
**A few cases of fertility have been reported in the literature, but it is thought that cryptic mosaicism may be present in some of the men
**Men on testosterone therapy will not attain fertility
**Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
***Some men with 47,XXY have been shown to have a few sperm in their testes, even when no sperm are present in ejaculate
***After testosterone therapy and testicular biopsy, sperm have been recovered and utilized in the ICSI procedure to achieve pregnancy and birth
***Preimplantation/prenatal diagnosis is necessary to rule out chromosomal aneuploidy
***The process of testicular sperm extraction, ICSI, and preimplantation diagnosis is not routinely offered at this time
***For most 47,XXY males, the most realistic prospects for fatherhood are by utilization of artificial insemination by donor or adoption
*Neoplasia
**There is a 1% lifetime risk for developing extragonadal germ cell tumors, usually in the mediastinum
***For unknown reasons, Klinefelter syndrome is a predisposing factor to the aberrant migration of primordial germ cells
***Affected males may present with respiratory symptoms due to the mass size
***Some cases of precocious puberty in boys with 47,XXY have been caused by germ cell tumors that secrete hCG.
***The ages of susceptibility are early adolescence to age 30
**Increased risk of breast cancer, probably up to 3% lifetime risk
***This is a 20-fold increase over the normal male population
***This risk does not warrant routine screening
*Immunologic
**Adults are at a slightly increased risk for certain autoimmune disorders
***Such as systemic lupus erythematosis, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disorders
**It has been suggested that sex hormones may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases
*Cardiovascular
**Mitral valve prolapse has been reported but a baseline cardiac echo is NOT warranted
**There is a risk for cardiovascular disease associated with elevated cholesterol levels
**Chronic leg ulcers are seen in approximately 6-13% of patients

==Management==
*Adolescents and adults with Klinefelter syndrome are unable to produce normal quantities of testosterone, so supplemental testosterone can maintain levels in the normal range
**This enables them to stimulate and maintain androgen-dependent processes
**In many cases, it promotes increased sense of well-being
**Helps to maintain secondary sex characteristics including facial and body hair
**Can increase and maintain muscle mass and promote weight gain
**Can increase energy and sex drive and lower cholesterol levels
**Can stimulate bone mineralization and prevent loss of bone mass which can lead to osteoporosis
*Testosterone therapy is usually considered in mid to late adolescence because serum testosterone levels do not plateau until about age 14 years in most affected males
**Therapy can begin as early as age 12 however
*Serum testosterone levels should be carefully monitored during the initiation process
**Excess testosterone can lead to inappropriate sexual behavior
**There are some reports of aggressiveness when higher concentrations are administered
*Intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate or cypionate have been the most common method of testosterone replacement
**The standard adult dose is 200mg every 10-14 days
**In an adolescent, the initial dose is considerable lower, usually 100mg every 4 weeks
**Because this method does not mimic normal physiologic production, there may be fluctuations in mood and physical functioning
**Usually injected into deep muscle in the thighs or buttocks
**Because testosterone ether is dissolved in an oil base, the injections can be slow and painful
*Transdermal testosterone patches can provide a more normal physiological availability of testosterone
**Patches are replaced every 24 hours
**Scrotal patch is effective in postpubertal males, but adolescents in one study were resistant to daily application to their genitalia
**A nonscrotal patch can be worn on the thighs, abdomen, trunk, or upper arm
**Side effects are rare but include: acne, leg edema, breast tenderness, and local skin reactions
*Oral testosterone is not generally available in the U.S.
*New formulations of testosterone currently being investigated include implantable pellets, sublingual tablets, and long-lasting injections

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Karyotype analysis may be indicated with the following features:
**Learning disabilities, language difficulties, attention deficits, psychosocial problems, small testes, infertility
*Kallman syndrome
**Characterized by hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell)

==Etiology==
*Nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes during the first or second meiotic division of gametogenesis in either parent causes chromosomal aneuploidy
*The extra X chromosome is contributed only slightly more frequently by the mother than the father
**There are no apparent differences in phenotype or imprinting effects
*AMA is slightly associated with the extra X chromosome; there is no paternal age effect
*There are no predisposing or preventative factors
**This is important for parents to understand

==Other Male X Chromosome Aneuploidy==
*Few cases of variants of 47,XXY have been followed prospectively so the natural history is not known
**Most information is from case reports of abnormal individuals
**This ascertainment bias could mean that individuals with a variation of the 47,XXY karyotype are actually more mildly affected than reported here
*Mosaicism
**46,XY/47,XXY mosaicism is the most common form of 47,XXY mosaicism
**The normal cell line modifies the risk for developmental delay
**Fertility may be possible
**Testosterone supplementation is probably not indicated
*48,XXYY
**The most common variant of Klinefelter syndrome
**Similar physical phenotype to 47,XXY, but males are taller and have disproportionately longer lower extremities
**IQ is typically reduced and ranges from 60 to 80; however, at least 10% of reported cases had IQs ranging from 80 to 111
**Speech and motor delays are common, and behavior may be shy or impulsive and aggressive
**Hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism is similar to that in males with 47,XXY and testosterone treatment is the same
**Genitalia may be small
*48,XXXY (3 X chromosomes)
**Results from the addition of an extra X to a 47,XXY karyotype
**A more abnormal phenotype including facial anomalies such as hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, simplified ears, and mild prognathism (projection of the jaw beyond the forehead)
**Tall stature is common
**May be skeletal anomalies such as clinodactyly, elbow abnormalities, and radioulnar synostosis
**Generally, there is mild to moderate mental retardation (IQ=40-60)
**Behavior is usually passive and cooperative
**Genitalia may be small, and gynecomastia is frequently reported
*49,XXXXY (4 X chromosomes)
**This is the most severe variant of Klinefelter syndrome
**Abnormal facial features include hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, broad nasal bridge, low-set and malformed ears and prognathism
**Cardiac defects, usually patent ductus arteriosus, are present in 15-20% of cases
**Males have short stature, short, broad neck, narrow thorax, radioulnar synostosis, and hyperextensible joints
**Genitalia are hypoplastic
**Cryptorchidism (failure of testes to descend) is often present at birth
**Range of mental retardation is broad (IQ is generally 20 to 70)
**Speech and motor sills are severely impaired
**Behavior ranges from placid to aggressive
*46,XX males
**Males who have clinical features of Klinefelter syndrome but normal female karyotype
**Occurs in about 1 in 20,000 male births
**Clinical features
***Shorter than males with 47,XXY, and extremities are not disproportionately long
***Genitalia are usually normal male, but there is an increased risk for hypospadias or ambiguous genitalia
***Testes are small and azoospermia is present
***IQ is generally higher than with 47,XXY males, and the risk for learning disabilities and behavior problems is lower
**Over 90% have a portion of Yp containing the SRY gene translocated to the paternally derived X chromosome
***This material is no always cytogenetically visible, but can be detected by FISH
**The remaining 10% are thought to be the result of an autosomal or X chromosome mutation
***These males are more likely to have genital abnormalities

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Lupron Exposure'''

==Contracting==
*Introductions and small talk
*Confirm referring physician
*Assess understanding of the reason for the referral to genetics
*What concerns or questions do you have that you would like to discuss today?
*Outline session agenda
**Medical and family history questions
**Some of the possible effects that lupron can have on the pregnancy
**Options available to you
**Discussion of concerns and questions

==Elicit Medical History==
*Confirm LMP: __________
*EDC: __________
*Today's gestational age: __________
*Have you had an ultrasound?
*Date of ultrasound: __________
*Results of ultrasound: __________
*How has the pregnancy been going so far?
*When did you first find out you were pregnant
*What medications are you taking?
**Amount and frequency of each.
**When did you start taking each?
*Do you have any other medical problems?
*Any complications with the pregnancy

==Elicit Family History==
(3 generations)
*Anyone had: multiple SAB, SB, early deaths or babies that required surgery as infants?
*Anyone born with birth defects such as cleft lip or palate, spina bifida, or heart problems
*MR/LD
*Has anyone in family had cancer (dx. &lt;50) or chronic illnesses (heart disease, diabetes)
*Anyone with muscle weakness or muscular dystrophy
*Anyone with bleeding disorders
*Anyone with any other genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, PKU, etc.

==Discuss possible side effects of taking lupron at time of conceptions==
*All pregnancies are at a 3-5% risk of birth defects or mental retardation
*There may be an increase in risks to the fetus when a woman is on lupron at conception.
*HOWEVER, this doesn't mean that the baby will be born with a problem, it just means that we know that based on your special circumstances, your pregnancy may be at an increased risk for miscarriage or maybe even a birth defect
*The reasons we believe there might be an increased risk are based on a small number of women who were exposed to lupron during pregnancy as well as animal studies
*We can tell you what has been reported, but the numbers are too small to make any real conclusions
*125 women who were exposed to lupron at the time of pregnancy have been identified and reported as of Feb 2002
**35 of them miscarried (28%), one was terminated for trisomy 18, three were ectopic pregnancies (2.4%)
**2 of the 125 infants had congenital anomalies which included bilateral inguinal hernia and other atretic kidney (positive family history for atretic kidney)
**14 were still ongoing pregnancies and 71 had babies with no malformations or health problems
*6 children (around age 7) who were exposed to lupron or a similar medication (GnRH agonist).
**1 had a cleft palate
**1 had a seizure disorder
**3 had ADHD
**HOWEVER this is a very small number of children and is not enough to base any conclusions on
**Also, it was unclear how they were defining ADHD because they all had normal psychological tests
*Most of the studies regarding the risks that lupron poses for a pregnancy have been done on rabbits and rats.
**These studies are often not directly related to effects and risks for humans because these animals are different enough that drugs can have a different effect on them when compared to a human fetus.
**Increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights in rabbits when given 1/30th and 1/3rd the human dose and for rats at 1/3rd the human dose
**Although not all agree with the interpretation, studies on rabbits suggest that there may be an increase in some birth defects, which include hydrocephalus or vertebral anomalies (dose related at 1/300th, 1/30th and 1/3rd the human dose)
**Rats showed no increase in birth defects
*We therefore don't really have a lot of conclusive information, but the main concern would seem to be an increased risk for pregnancy loss.
*This increase in fetal mortality is likely due to alterations in hormonal levels brought about by the drug (estrogen and progestin levels reduced to levels within the menopausal range)

==Options==
*Level II ultrasound -- performed at 18 -20 weeks
**Done by an experienced technician
**Can detect many birth defects
**Developing organs will be looked at in detail
**Can often detect abnormalities in the formation of the limbs, spine, heart, and brain
**U/S is good to make us suspicious of some birth defects but it can't tell us everything
**We won't know if there is mental deficiency by u/s
**Also, u/s is dependent upon cooperation of the baby. Sometimes we just can't get a great view and may not be able to see everything we are looking for
**But it can usually provide some reassurance to see that organs and body parts have formed properly

==Maternal Serum Marker Screening==
(Unrelated to any risks due to exposure there is a blood test that is routinely offered to all pregnant women)
**MSAFP at about 16-18 weeks
**Screening performed on a sample of your blood
**Can provide an indication that a fetus may be at a higher or lower risk than the general population to have an ONTD, but it will not tell us for certain if there is a neural tube defect
**Detects about 80-90% of ONTD's (so it can miss some)
**Will also tell if fetus is at an increased risk above your age-related risk for a chromosome abnormality
**Blood test can also look at other markers in the blood and determine if there may be an increased risk for two chromosomal abnormalities (for which you are not at an increased risk for based on your history of seizures and medications)

==Discuss CF carrier screening==

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*Guilt over doing something that may cause birth defects
*Anxiety because we don't know what to expect
*Was this a planned pregnancy and is she excited to be pregnant or was this unexpected
*Any other health concerns or circumstances that would make this a difficult pregnancy
*Assess support system and coping strategies

==Follow-up==
*Questions?
*Schedule level II ultrasound

==Lupron Facts==
*GnRH - agonist - mimicks GnRH, but is more potent
*Considered category X drug (meaning benefits to women don't outweigh potential risk to fetus and it is contraindicated for women who could potentially get pregnant)
*Not known if transfers to human milk, but structure makes this unlikely
*No breast feeding data are available
*Triggers release of LH and FSH (hormones that stimulate ovary in preparation for ovulation)
*First taken then any LH and FSH stored in pituitary is released, but further production and release is blocked
*When LH and FSH blocked, ovarian follicle and egg don't grow and less estrogen produced by ovary
*Initial release of FSH and LH may cause one last cycle before suppressing ovarian activity
*Should therefore use backup protection during the first month of treatment
*Lupron is used in preparation for infertility treatments and when it is used in this fashion before conception there has been no increased risk of fetal anomalies reported to be associated with the infertility treatment.

*Chromosome location: 2p15, 1q22, 12p13.3, 7q21-q22, 6q23-q24
*Molecular genetics: Phenotype caused by mutation in any of several genes involved: in peroxisome biogenesis (peroxi-1, -2, -3, -5, -6, or -12).
*Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles that play a role in lipid metabolism--these are absent

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*Incidence is 1 in 40,000. Males and females are affected equally.

==Clinical Features==
*Craniofacial Features
**Flat occiput and face
**Anteverted nares
**Epicanthal folds
**Brushfield spots
**High forehead
**Large fontanels
**Shallow orbits
*Ocular Features
**Cataracts
**Hypoplastic optic disk
*Auditory Features
**Abnormal helices
**Deafness
*Neurological Features
**Early developmental delay
**Seizures
**Brain migrational abnormalities
**MR in survivors
**Brain malformations including microgyria, heteropias, subependymal cysts, astrocytosis and gliosis, hypoplastic corpus callosum, hypoplastic olfactory lobes

==Age of Onset, Natural History, Life Span==
*Most babies are born breech and exhibit failure to thrive. Some developed icterus and bloody stool.
*Vast majority of children die within the first year of life. Those who survive have profound mental retardation. Average life span is 12-13 weeks.

==Testing==
*Diagnosis is made through DNA testing.
*Increase in plasma and fibroblasts of very-long-chain fatty acids and lack of dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (DHAP-AT) are biochemical markers for this syndrome

==Surveillance, Management, and Treatment Options==
*Multidisciplinary early intervention
*Oral administration of plasmalogens
*Restricted phytanic acid intake
*OT, PT, hearing aids, nutrition
*Skeletal surveys (X-rays, CT and MRI)
*Renal and abdominal ultrasounds

==Differential Diagnoses==
*Down syndrome is the most common

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''XXX Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*Greet family and acknowledge prior contact.

==Contracting==
*Discuss the reason for referral - amniocentesis results.
*Express empathy over what a surprise the diagnosis was for the family.
*Assess their main questions and concerns and find out what they hope to gain from the session.
*Find out how much reading/research they have done on XXX Syndrome and assess the degree of their knowledge about heredity and genetics.
*Explain our intent to address their concerns and questions about Triple X. Explain that we will share information about the syndrome, discuss the test results, how the syndrome is caused, recurrence risks, problems associated with Triple X, and medical management.

==Elicit Medical History==
*Maternal and paternal age
*Ethnicity
*Consanguinity
*Chronic illnesses

==Elicit Family History==
*Construct pedigree
*Identify possible risks

==Pregnancy History==
*Review information from intake.
*G (# of pregnancies), P (# of live births), SAb, EAb
*Exposures/medical complications (infection, fever, rash, medication, smoking, alcohol, recreational drugs, x-rays, bleeding)

==Genetics of XXX Syndrome==
*47, XXX karyotype
*Inheritance pattern: chromosomal abnormality caused by non-disjunction (possible correlation to advanced maternal age)
*Prevalence: 1 in 1,000 females
*Recurrence risk: less than 1%

==Natural History and Clinical Features of XXX Syndrome==
*At birth, girls with Triple X show no physical stigmata and are normally developed. The infants may have a lower than normal birth weight.
*These girls are described as being quiet and passive babies with a lower assertive age during childhood.
*They are usually delayed in motor, speech, and psychosocial development with delayed emotional maturation.
*Tall stature (at the 80th percentile by adolescence, with an average adult height of 172 cm).
*Comparatively low weight in comparison to height.
*Lower head circumference (25th - 35th percentile)
*Back problems may develop due to weak musculature.
*Lower IQ (average is approximately 90) - however, mental retardation is very rare. May have learning difficulties in school that require outside help.
*Normal puberty and average onset of menstruation.
*Fertile, with the possibility of early menopause.
*No increased risk of disease or mental illness.

==Diagnosis and Testing of XXX Syndrome==
*Diagnosis by amniocentesis, CVS, or chromosome testing.
*Recurrence risk of less than 1%.
*There is a theoretical increased risk of X aneuploidy for the children of women with Triple X, however, this has not been shown in practice. A less than 1% risk figure is quoted, but genetic counseling is suggested to explain the possibility of prenatal diagnosis if desired.

==Management==
*Early intervention programs with mental, social, and motor stimulation are suggested to help prevent possible developmental delay.
*Speech therapy is recommended to counteract speech delays.
*Participation in team sports and group activities is suggested to improve motor skills and psychosocial adaptation.
*Schools should provide special education or resource help for learning difficulties.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Self-fulfilling prophecy leading to a behavior problem
*Should they tell their pediatrician?
*Should they tell their daughter's teachers?
*Should they tell their daughter?

*Type I
**variable phenotype
**sesorineural hearing loss
***congenital, non-progressive, uni- or bilateral
***most common type is profound bilateral
**white forelock
***may be present at birth or appear later
***may become normally pigmented over time
**eyebrows and eyelashes may also be hypopigmented
**leukoderma
***white skin patches, frequently on the face, trunk, or limbs
***often have hyperpigmented borders
**spina bifida and cleft lip and palate have been described in multiple families
*Type 2
**if the average W index across a family is less than 1.95, the diagnosis is WS2
**sensorineural hearing loss and heterochromia iridum are the two most characteristic features of WS2
*Type 3 (Klein-Waardenburg Syndrome)
**individuals have a combination of typical WS1 features and hypoplasia or contractures of the limb muscles or joints, carpal bone fusion, or syndactyly
*Type 4
**Individuals having a rare combination of pigmentary abnormalities, hearing loss, and Hirschsprung disease

==Natural History==
*does not affect lifespan or intelligence

==Testing==
*Clinical Diagnosis
** An individual must have two major or one major plus two minor criteria to be considered affected by WT1**
**Major Criteria
***Congenital sensorineural hearing loss
***White forelock, hair hypopigmentation
***Pigmentation abnormality of the iris
***Complete heterochromia iridum (eyes of different color)
***Partial/segmental heterochromia (two different colors in same iris, typically brown and blue)
***Hypoplastic blue irides, or brilliant blue irides
***Dystopia canthorum, W index &gt;1.95*
***Affected first-degree relative
**Minor Criteria
***Skin hypopigmentation (congenital leukoderma)
***Synophyrys/medial eyebrow flare
***Broad/high nasal root, prominent columella
***Hypoplastic alae nasi
***Premature gray hair (before age 30 years)
*W index: The measurements necessary to calculate the W index (in mm) are as follows:
**inner canthal distance (a), interpupillary distance (b), and outer canthal distance (c).
***Calculate X = 2a - (0.2119c + 3.909)/c
***Calculate Y = 2a - (0.2479b + 3.909)/b
***Calculate W = X + Y + a/b
**An abnormal W index result is &gt;1.95.

* When ICD (a) and OCD (c) are the only measurements available, IPD (b) can be calculated according to the formula: [(c - a)/2] + a.  This can be used when IPD (b) is already known to compare measured and calculated values.

*Molecular genetic testing
**available by sequencing the PAX3 gene (chromosomal locus 2q35)
**can be used to confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases
**primarily used for genetic counseling of at-risk family members
**detects over 90% of disease-causing mutations
***most mutations are unique
**available clinically
*Prenatal testing
**available for pregnancies at 50% risk in which a parent has been identified as having a PAX3 mutation
**performed on fetal cells obtained by CVS or amniocentesis
**can determine whether or not the fetus has inherited the PAX3 mutation, but it cannot determine the clinical manifestations nor their severity
**not available for families who have not had molecular genetic testing of the PAX3 gene or do not have a PAX3 gene mutation

==Management and Treatment==
*folic acid supplementation in pregnancy is recommended for women at increased risk of having a child with WS1, given the possibly increased risk of neural tube defects in association with WS1
*congenital hearing loss can be identified through universal screening of newborns
*management of hearing loss
**as a minimum, all children with a risk for hereditary hearing loss should receive screening audiometry
**the team evaluating and treating the deaf individual should consist of an otolaryngologist with expertise in the management of early childhood otologic disorders, an audiologist experienced in the assessment of hearing loss in children, a clinical geneticist, and a pediatrician
**the expertise of an educator of the Deaf, a neurologist, and a pediatric ophthalmologist may also be required
**sequential audiologic examinations are essential to document the stability or progression of the hearing loss and to identify and treat superimposed hearing losses, such as middle ear effusion
***an important part of the evaluation is determining the appropriate habilitation option
****possibilities include hearing aids, vibrotactile devices, and cochlear implantation
****cochlear implantation can be considered in children over 12 months of age with severe-to-profound hearing loss

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

The use of soy protein in this recipe increases the [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]'s natural flavor. This bread is very easy to prepare.

==Ingredients==

* 30g (1oz) of fresh yeast
* 2 Eggs
* 1 cup of oil
* 3 cups of warm milk
* 1 table spoon of sugar
* 1 table spoon of salt
* 1 cup of TSP (texturized soy protein)
* 8 cups of flour

==Procedure==

# Heat the milk until it is about to boil, then add the salt and the soy protein. Mix it for the salt to be well dissolved. Let it rest until is warm again.
# Put on the blender the milk and the rest of the ingredients, including the yeast. Mix it for a few seconds until it is homogeneous.
# Pour the mixture on a bowl and start adding the flour while mixing to keep the bread homogeneous all the time.
# Work the bread with your hands all the time, always keeping it smooth. You may have to add some extra flour while you work with it. Keep doing this until the bread stops being sticky.
# Let it rest for about 25 minutes at a warm place, with approximate constant temperature.
# Separate several small balls of bread of about 1 inches (2.5 cm) in diameter and half of it in height.
# Put the breads on a oven tray with some distance between them and leave them for other 15 minutes.
# Pre heat the oven at about 200°C and put the tray in a medium position inside the oven.
# Let them cook for about 20 minutes.

==Variations==

* You may increase the amount of oil by half a cup to make it more moist and increase its lifetime.
* You may add minced provolone into the mixture (not filling) to give it a delicious subtle taste of cheese. 
* You may of course fill it as well.
* You may cook it in different shapes that the small bread

==Overview==
*Liver is the second most frequently metastatic organ, after lymph nodes
**Rich dual vascular supply and cell-promoting humoral factors
*In US/Europe, liver mets are much more frequent than primary liver tumors
*Primaries most commonly going to liver:
**Adults: the eye, colon, stomach, pancreas, breast, and lung 
**Children: neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, and leukemia
*Seeding: 77% both lobes, 10% single lesions. Multiple mets often vary in size, suggesting seeding from primary in waves
*Imaging: With an equivalent specificity, PET is the most sensitive (vs. U/S, CT, MRI)
*Treatment options:
**Surgery
**Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE)
**Ablation (Cryoablation, Microwave ablation, EtOH ablation, RF ablation, Laser ablation
**RT historically not used due to low median liver tolerance, but now increasing interest with conformal therapy and stereotactic radiotherapy
*Survival:
**Colorectal primary: resection can offer cure, 5-year survival 20-40%
**Breast, lung, pancreas primary: poor due to usually widespread metastatic disease outside of liver



==Treatment==
Most studies include both mets and primary liver cancer; for now they are kept together. 
&lt;p&gt;'''Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Liver/Treatment|Liver/Treatment]] page'''.


===Surgery===
*'''MSKCC; 2007''' (1985-1994) PMID 17925551 -- &quot;Actual 10-year survival after resection of colorectal liver metastases defines cure.&quot; (Tomlinson JS, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 10;25(29):4575-80.)
**Retrospective. 612 consecutive patients, 102 10-year survivors 
**Outcome: If survive 10 years, 97% DSS; if survive 5 years, 66% DSS
**Initial factors: 50% N+, 39% &gt;1 met, 35% tumor size &gt;5cm, 25% bilobar mets, 7% synchronous disease
**Conclusion: Almost 20% cure in well-selected patients with CRC liver mets</text>

      <comment>/* Epidemiology */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Radiation Oncology:TOC}}
'''Hepatocellular carcinoma'''
==Epidemiology==
*6th most common cancer in the world.  14.7 per 100,000 men and 4.9 per 100,000 women.  3 to 1 ratio male to female.  Highest risk areas are East and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
*In North America, only 1-3 per 100,000 people.  Incidence is increasing due to hepatitis virus.
*Death rate equal to (or exceeds!) the incidence.  There are more deaths than new cases because of the poor outcome and because metastatic disease to the liver is mistakenly attributed to liver cancer in statistics.

==Risk==
*Roughly 80% of HCC is attributable to either HBV or HCV, of which HBV accounts for ~55% and HCV 25% &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16879891]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Persistent HBV infection: 100x-250x risk
*Chronic HCV and cirrhosis: 100x
*Ethanol is carcinogenic. Higher risk of HCC than in non-alcohol-drinkers with HCV.
*Other chemicals: alfatoxin B, nitrites, hydrocarbons, solvents, organochlorine pesticides, primary metals, polychlorinated biphenyls

==Prevention==
*Treatment of HCV with interferon alpha decreases risk of developing HCC

==Clinical presentation==
Asymptomatic in early stages.  Detected with AFP and ultrasound in patients with liver disease.  Many patients are asymptomatic even in advanced stages.  The majority of symptoms are from liver disease itself.  Tumor-related symptoms are palpable mass in abdomen, acute onset pain from hemorrhage, dull pain, abdominal fullness, low grade fever, obstructive jaundice, and splenomegaly.  

==Biology==
*Rapid doubling time of 41 days

==Workup==
*Triphasic CT scan is most sensitive imaging modality (more than MRI). Since AFP has a 10-15% false positive rate and may be elevated in HCC, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), or some colon metastases, since 2005, the AASLD has recommended the triphasic CT scan as the distinguishing test of choice for radiologic diagnosis of HCC. 
*Metastases are rare at presentation
*Indocyanine green (IDG) 15-minute retention rate for determining eligibility for resection

==Staging==
===Current staging===
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;
Note: Staging applies only to hepatocellular carcinoma (no longer includes intrahepatic bile ducts)

''Primary Tumor:''
*T1 - Solitary tumor without vascular invasion
*T2 - Solitary tumor with vascular invasion or multiple tumors none more than 5 cm
*T3
**T3a - Multiple tumors more than 5 cm
**T3b - Tumor of any size involving a major branch of the portal vein or hepatic vein
*T4 - Tumor with direct invasion of adjacent organs, other than the gallbladder, or with perforation of visceral periteonum

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - no
*N1 - yes
:Regional nodes include: hepatic artery, portal vein, hilar, hepatoduodenal ligament, inferior phrenic, caval lymph nodes

''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - none
*M1 - yes

''Stage Grouping:''
*Stage I: T1 N0 M0
*Stage II: T2 N0 M0
*Stage IIIA: T3a N0 M0
*Stage IIIB: T3b N0 M0
*Stage IIIC: T4 N0 M0
*Stage IVA: N1
*Stage IVB: M1

===Older staging editions===
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br&gt;
Note: staging was also used for intrahepatic bile ducts

*T1 - Solitary, &lt;= 2cm, without vascular invasion
*T2 - Solitary &lt;= 2cm with vascular invasion; multiple, limited to one lobe, &lt;= 2cm, without vascular invasion; solitary, &gt;2 cm, without vascular invasion
*T3 - Solitary, &gt;2cm, with vascular invasion; multiple, one lobe, &lt;= 2cm, with vascular invasion; multiple, one lobe, any more than 2cm
*T4 - Multiple tumors, involving more than one lobe; invasion of a major branch of portal or hepatic veins; invasion of adjacent organs other than gallbladder; perforation of visceral peritoneum

*Stage I: T1 N0 M0
*Stage II: T2 N0 M0
*Stage IIIA: T3 N0 M0
*Stage IIIB: T1-3 N0 M0
*Stage IVA: T4
*Stage IVB: M1

==Prognosis==
*Fibrolamellar variant has a better prognosis

==Treatment==
Most studies include both mets and primary liver cancer; for now they are kept together. Please see the main [[Radiation_Oncology/Liver|Liver]] page.


*HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) tumors can be classified as resectable (can be removed by an operation) and unresectable (cannot be removed by an operation).  Only 10-15% of cases can be effectively treated with surgical resection.
*Surgical resection with 2-cm margin of liver for T1-3 N0.  Minimum of 1-cm is recommended but literature is mixed on the exact margin required.  
*For unresectable, chemoembolization, intraarterial infusional chemo, cryosurgery, ethanol injection, radioimmunotherapy, conformal radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation. 
*For stage IV, chemotherapy, but low response rates.

*The radionuclide 131-Lipiodol treatment is believed to offer a significant reduction in recurrence rate for resectable HCC.  A 1999 Lancet study by WY Lau et al (PMID 10459961) report an improvement in the 3-year survival rate from 46.3% (control group) to 86.4% (treatment group).  This treatment is not yet approved in the United States, but it is in Phase III clinical trials in Singapore and can be administered in Hong Kong.


===SBRT===
*'''Princess Margaret''' (2003-2006)
**Phase I. 41 patients, unresectable HCC (n=31) or IHC (n=10). SBRT 6 fractions; dose dependent on NTCP calculations. Toxicity risk escalated from 5% to 10% and 20%. Median tumor size 173 mL (9-1913 mL); had to have &gt;=800 mL uninvolved liver; Child-Pugh A liver function. Median dose 36.0 Gy (24.0 - 54.0 Gy). CTV=GTV+8mm, PTV=CTV+5mm or more
**'''2008''' PMID 18172187 -- &quot;Phase I Study of Individualized Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.&quot; (Tse RV, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 2 [Epub ahead of print]). Medium F/U 1.5 years
***3 month toxicity: No dose-limiting toxicity or RILD; 24% Grade 3 liver enzymes, no Grade 4/5; 23% experienced progression to Child-Pugh B liver function. Late toxicity 2 patients (6%): 1 patient dead from GI bleed from tumor-duodenal connection, 1 patient SBO requiring surgery.
***Outcome: median OS HCC 11.7 months, IHC 15.0 months
***Conclusion: Individualized 6-fraction SBRT safe
**'''2006''' PMID 16982550 -- &quot;Individualized image guided iso-NTCP based liver cancer SBRT.&quot; (Dawson LA, Acta Oncol. 2006;45(7):856-64.) 
***Phase I/II. 79 patients with HCC (33), IHC (12) or liver mets (34). 
***RT: prescription based on NTCP to maintain given risk of RILD to max 60/6 (median dose 36.6/6)

*'''Hokkaido; 2007''' (2001-2004) PMID 17869660 -- &quot;Intercepting radiotherapy using a real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy system for highly selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma unresectable with other modalities.&quot; (Taguchi H, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Oct 1;69(2):376-80.)
**Retrospective. 18 HCC tumors, 15 patients. Real-time tumor tracking with implanted 2.0 mm fiducial marker. Median dose 48/8 (median BED 76.8 Gy). Mean F/U 1.7 years
**Outcome: 2-year OS 39%, LC 83% (92% with re-irradiation)
**Toxicity: 1 Grade 3 transient gastric ulcer, 2 transient LFT elevation
**Conclusion: Fiducial marker-guided RT effective at delivering focal high dose


===TACE and RT===
*'''Meta-analysis; 2008''' PMID 19042048 -- &quot;Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in combination with radiotherapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.&quot; (Meng MB, Radiother Oncol. 2008 Nov 28. [Epub ahead of print])
**Meta-analysis. 17 trials and 1476 patients, 5 RCT. 
**Conclusion: TACE + RT is more therapeutically beneficial than TACE alone

==Survival==
*Unresectable: less than 10% 5-year survival
*Resectable: 5-year survival 50-73% stage I, 30-56% stage II, 10-29% stage III, 10% stage IV.

==Patterns of failure==
*Local tumor recurrence and intrahepatic recurrence are the predominant sites of failure.


==Fibrolamellar Carcinoma==
*Considered a variant of HCC comprising &lt; 1%; however, evidence suggests it is uniquely distinct in both epidemiology and better prognosis
*Associated with cirrhosis in &lt;10% patients, typically presents in a background of normal liver function and histologic architecture
*50-60% solitary, rest satellite lesions next to primary mass; rarely diffuse involvement
*Surgery (hepatic resection/transplant) is primary treatment alternative
*Radiotherapy
**'''Hopkins 1985-90''' PMID 10025374 -- ''Metastatic nonresectable fibrolamellar hepatoma: prognostic features and natural history.'' ('''1999 Epstein''' BE, Am J Clin Oncol. 1999 Feb;22(1):22-8.)
***Retrospective. 17 patients with met disease. Matched control analysis with HCC patients
***Median survival: 14 months vs. 7.7 months (p&lt;0.001)

== Cauchy-Schwartz inequality ==

The Cauchy-Schwartz inequality states that the magnitude of the inner product of two vectors is less than or equal to the product of the vector norms, or:
&lt;math&gt;| \langle x,y \rangle |  \le  \| x \| \| y \| &lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==

For any vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in an inner product space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and denote it by &lt;math&gt;x \bot y&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y \rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Orthogonal complement and matrix transpose ==

== Applications ==

=== Linear least squares ===

=== How to orthogonalize a basis ===
Suppose to be on a vector space V with a scalar product (not necessarily positive-definite), 
&lt;br&gt;
'''Problem:''' Construct an orthonormal basis of ''V'' starting by a random basis ''{'' ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''}''.
&lt;br&gt;
Solution: Gram-Schidt for non isotropic vectors, otherwise choose v_i + v_j and reiterate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==PHP==
PHP, which stands for 'PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor', is an open source scripting language.  It can be embedded in html, similar to how JSP.  Here's the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php wikipedia page].
===Type===
PHP is a little hard to classify. The creators declare that it's a web development scripting language and, well, it is.  Though it's largely proceedural and has slowly gone towards being an object oriented language (PHP 5).  So, really PHP can be what you want it to be.  Though note, it's an interpreted language, which can be compiled down some. 
[http://us2.php.net/manual/en/introduction.php PHP.net's introduction pages]
===Execution Entry Point===
PHP is generally accessed from a webserver processing an html page with some php in it, or a php file.

In an html file: 

 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 Hello World! &lt;br&gt;
 Today is 
 &lt;?
    $date = date('D M dS');
    echo $date;
 ?&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
   
Or you can create an entire php file by enclosing the entire thing in the &lt;? and ?&gt;.  The general trend is to call these files .php files for files that render something like html and .inc files for library files.

===General Syntax===

Variables contain a '$' in front of them and do not need to be declared.  Lines end with a semicolon, like in C. As with most web development scripting languages, there are a few global variables, like $_SESSION and $_POST, $_GET, and $_REQUEST.

A general assignment goes like this: 
 $a = 'bar';
 $b = 4;

===Comments===

 // this is an inline comment.  Everything after the // is a comment.
Block comments are specified by a starting /* and ending */  They can span multiple lines.
 /*
  * this is a block comment 
  */

Php contains phpdoc - where you can create an html manual from comments before the function declaration.  They look like this:

 /**
  * Function description
  *
  * @param  &lt;datatype&gt;   &lt;$name of var&gt;   &lt;description of var&gt;
  * 
  * @return &lt;datatype&gt;
  */

There's a few other @ types you can use here.  Sources of how to generate phpdocs are needed.  More to come. 

===Variable Declarations===

declare i as an integer 
 $i = 1;

Or:
 $str = 'string';

There's no datatype declaration required, so you can change a variables datatype though assigning it to something else:

 $foo = 1;
 $foo = 'string';

One stumbling block with this is that you need to know how to concat strings versus adding values. 

For concating strings you can use the &quot;.&quot; or &quot;.=&quot;.  If you want to add values use &quot;+&quot; or &quot;+=&quot;.  

If you do this: 
 $foo = 'string';
 $foo += ' is cool';

You'll end up with some number verus &quot;string is cool&quot;, as you've added strings and not concatinated them. 

===Method Declaration/Implementation===

Function declaration: 
 function foo( $param1, $param2 ) {
     return 'hello';
 }

You can default parameters like this:
 function foo( $param1, $param2=100 ) {
     return 'hello';
 }

You don't need to declare any return value.

When you declare a function to use with in a class, it looks just the same as the one shown above, with the only difference is with it being physically located inside a class boundary. 

 class Foo { 
  function bar () {
      return 'something';
  }
 }

===Scope===

All variables have a single scope in PHP.  If it's in a function, then it has local scope. If it's outside a function, then it has global scope.  

You can create a global variable in two ways.  The first way is by putting it outside a function.  The second way is to declare it this way:

 global $foo;

This makes it available from anywhere. 

To access a global value from inside a function you need to declare that you're using it, otherwise php thinks it's completely different from the global variable. 

YES: 
 $foo = 2;
 function foo() {
     global $foo;
     $bar = 1;
     return $foo + $bar;
 }

NO:
 $foo = 3;
 function foo() {
     $bar = 1;
     return $foo + $bar;
 }

PHP will create the $foo inside of the function and not associate it with the global $foo. The two $foo's are completely different entities in the &quot;NO&quot; example. 

$bar is local and it's scope is limited to the function. 

PHP has excellent [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php documentation] on scoping available. 

===Conditional Statements===
There's the typical if/else statements:

 if( $a == $b ) {
     $c = $d;
     // can put more statements here
 } else if ( $b == $c ) {
     $c = $e;
     // can put more statements here
 } else {
     $c = $f;
     // can put more statements here
 }

Braces can be removed as long as there's only a single statement after the condition:
 if( $a == $b ) 
     $c = $d; // only one statement allowed
 else 
     $c = $f; // only one statement allowed

Another valid way to write an if statement is like this: 

 $bar = (($foo == true) ? 'test' : 'not test');

The first two are a bit easier to read. 

There's also a case/switch conditional:

 switch ($foo) {
     case 'foo':
        echo 'bar';
        break;// breaks out of the switch case, to prevent us from running 
              // the stuff below this. 
     case 'bar':
        echo 'foo';
        break; // breaks out of the switch case, to prevent us from running 
               // the stuff below this. 
     default: 
        echo 'empty';
 }

Please visit [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.control-structures.php php's structure page] for more information and alternate ways conditions can be written. 

===Looping Statements===
PHP includes the tradional loops - a for loop, while and do while. There's a foreach loop as well.

For: 
 // prints out the numbers from 0 to 4, as soon as $i equals 5 it stops. 
 for(
     echo $i;
 } 

PHP has a special foreach loop that's useful for dealing with arrays:

 foreach( $fooArray as $key=&gt;$value ) {
     // starting at the begining of the array it will give the key (index) 
     // and value for each item.
 }

 // you can also just say:
 foreach( $fooArray as $value ) {
     // you don't need to use $key
 }

While: 
 
 // this counts backwards from 100 printing out each number like this 
 // &quot;100...99...98...&quot; and so on until it reaches 0, then stops
 $i = 100;
 while( $i &gt; 0 ) {
     echo &quot;$i...&quot;;
     $i--;
 }

 or

 // keeps checking the $cond variable and stops when it equals false
 // if $cond == false from the start, the stuff in the loop will never execute. 
 while( $cond != true ) {
     // do something
 }


Do while: 

 // this does the same thing as the above &quot;for&quot; loop, only it always executes 
 // at least once before it checks if the condition ($i &lt;5) has been met, 
 // or is still good. 
 $i = 0;
 do {
     $i++
     echo &quot;$i...&quot;;
 while( $i &lt; 5 );

Please visit [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.control-structures.php php's loop page] for more information on loops and alternative ways of writing them.

===Output Statements===


Here's how to print out 'Hello World!' in PHP. 

 echo 'Hello World!';

When you want to include a PHP variable inside the string you need to use double quotes, as PHP will not parse the data between single quotes, it will just print it out. 

 $foo = 'bar';
 echo &quot;foo$foo&quot;; 

 // prints out foobar;

It's good to use single quotes when there's no variables in the string as it saves processing time.

===Error Handling/Recovery===
&lt;Describe error handling and recovery.  Give examples as appropriate.&gt;

===Containers===
PHP has an array as a native data type. To use: 

 // example 1
 $ages = array();
 $ages['Bobby'] = 12;
 $ages['Rob'] = 12;

 // example 2
 $foo = array();
 $foo[0] = 8;
 $foo[1] = 9;
 $foo[] = 10; // puts 10 in $foo[2]

 // example 3
 $bar[0] = 12; // don't need to specifically declare $bar, it's just nice to. 
 $bar['total'] = 3;
 $bar[] = 13; // put's 13 in $bar[1]

Arrays in PHP are very powerful and useful.  They can be used like a hash, as in the first and third example - you can use index's and strings into the arrays.  You don't necessarily need to declare the array, though it's a good practice.  Also, you can just write two brackets, as in $foo[], to signify that you want the data to go into the next index, as in example 2.   

===Algorithms===
&lt;List algorithms or references to lists of algorithms available natively for this language.  List ways to incorporate algorithms if they are not native to the language.  Or, if not available, describe that.&gt;
===Garbage collection===
&lt;Describe whether the garbage collection is automatic or manual.&gt;
===Physical Structure===
&lt;Describe how the files, libararies, and parts are typically divided and arranged.&gt;
===Tips===
&lt;Please include tips that make it easier to switch to this language from another language.&gt;
===Web References===
There's a great PHP library at [http://www.php.net php.net].  This has the manual there as well as library pages - so it's probably appropriate for any user who's famililar with programming to some degree.  You'll definitely need this page as a reference for the libaries.

===Books and Articles===
&lt;List additional books and articles that may be helpful. Please include for what level reader the references are appropriate. (beginner/intermediate/advanced)&gt;

Please do not perform copy and paste moves.  Use the [[Help:Renaming (moving) a page|page move]] tab to rename pages.  That's what it is for.  I've done a history merge to clean up the mess.  But I leave it to you to check that the current version of the article is the latest version (which is sometimes not the case after history merges) and revert to the correct version if it is not. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 17:43, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
:Unfortunately, your cleaning has made &quot;Climate Change&quot; and &quot;Climate change&quot; both be redirect pages, which lead no where. I will use the revert method that I found in the help section to revert &quot;Climate Change&quot; back to it's previous form. Thanks for the advice though. I wanted to use move, but there was some trouble because &quot;Climate Change&quot; was already a page (empty though, and possibly made by me). Probably there is a simple way to deal with that situation, but I thought cutting and pasting was the most straight forward way, especially considering the very small number of pages linking to Climate C/change right now.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Picking the right editor is essential for web designers. Here we will cover some of the pros and cons of working with certain editors.

==Studio 8==
[[wikipedia:Studio|Studio]] is a software suite from Adobe Systems that includes Dreamweaver, Flash, and Fireworks 8, in addition to Contribute 3 and FlashPaper 2.

Cost: $900 US

'''Pros'''
:'''Easy to Use:''' Simple, some more complicated functions in Flash, but no coding necessary.
:'''Standards Compliant:''' Complies with W3C

== Frontpage 2003 ==
[[wikipedia:Frontpage|Frontpage]] is a very neat and handy utility. It offers people to create websites who know zero [[wikipedia:HTML|HTML]].

Cost: $199 US

'''Pros'''
:'''Easy to use:''' Anyone who can use word, can use Frontpage.
:'''Projects:''' You can create projects and Frontpage will automatically re-link documents when filesystem changes occur.

'''Cons'''
:'''Doesn't play nice:''' Frontpage has a tendency to re-write your document to structure code. This usually wipes out PHP code in the document.
:'''Overly Re-writes:''' I dont know how many times i've looked at code by Frontpage to only see a plethora of CSS styles. Can get annoying if you are used to a certain way of coding.
:'''Poor Design:''' Code is non-W3C complient and hard to use.
:'''Lack of Support:''' No longer supported by Microsoft.

== Notepad ==
[[wikipedia:Notepad|Notepad]] requires you to know pretty much every aspect of HTML, however a wise choice for people who dont like to be told how to code.

Cost: Free

'''Pros'''
:'''Runs fast:''' No matter what the system (Windows), notepad always preforms.
:'''No Re-writes:''' Notepad doesn't re-write anything, because it can't.

'''Cons'''
:'''No Projects:''' No way to manage your documents without external applications or by manually re-writing.
:'''No Indent Holding:''' Notepad does not keep your indents, making you tab in over and over.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Biochemistry]] 

[[Biochemistry/Enzymes|&lt;&lt; Enzymes]] | [[Biochemistry/DNA and RNA|DNA and RNA &gt;&gt;]]
----
What is life? What makes life work? Life is not static; it is defined by activity. A cell has to perform certain tasks to stay alive. This activity has to be powered by fuel; the fuel is converted into energy, to keep the cell running, building blocks for new biomolecules, and waste products. This process is called '''metabolism'''.

== ATP as an intermediate energy carrier ==
We have [[Biochemistry/Metabolism and energy|already seen]] how ATP is a universal &quot;energy currency&quot; in the cell, and how its high-energy phosphate can store and release this energy efficiently. But ATP is only a short-term energy storage; a hard-working human can use up to one pound of ATP per minute. How can that be?

The answer lies in the medium- and long-term energy storage molecules, notably ''phosphoenol pyruvate'' (PEP), ''acetyl phosphate'', and ''creatine phosphate''. Each of these molecules carries a phosphate group with an ever higher transfer potential than that of ATP. ATP is continuously regenerated by transferring phosphate groups from these molecules to ADP. For example, the reaction of creatine phosphate is
&lt;center&gt;Creatine phosphate + ADP + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ⇋ ATP + creatine&lt;/center&gt;
a reaction which is catalyzed by the creatine kinase, and highly in favor of the &quot;ATP side&quot; of the equation.

== Electron carriers ==
Most of the energy of eucaryotic lifeforms derives from oxidating fuel molecules, that is, the transfer of electrons from fuel molecules to oxygen. The fuel molecules are oxidized, while the oxygen is reduced. A rather radical form of oxidation is fire, which oxidizes its fuel directly with oxygen. As spontaneous combustion one ones cells is rather unpleasant, the electrons are carried through several steps from the fuel molecules to the final electron acceptor, oxygen. The flow of electrons causes a proton gradient in the mitochondrial membranes, which in turn is used by the enzyme ''ATPase'' (or ''proton pump'') to generate ATP. This process, utilizing an''[[Biochemistry/Electron Transport Chain|electron transport chain]]'', is called ''oxidative phosphorylation''.

The electron carrier molecules of choice are ''NADH'' and ''FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. They are ''pyridine nucleotides'' (also called ''flavions'').

Both molecules are also for biosyntheses that require reducing power. Especially a variant of NADH, ''NAD'''P'''H'', is used for this purpose.

With all these high-energy bonds and electron-carrying molecules around, one would expect to see wild, uncontrolled chemical reactions occurring in the cell. However, the opposite is the case: ''Without a catalyst'', ATP is quite slow to hydrolize and give its phosphate group to water. Also, all three electron-carrying molecules, NADH, NADPH, and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are slow to react with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''without a catalyst''.

==Cancer Cell Metabolism==
'''Glutamine addiction: a new therapeutic target in cancer'''

The Warburg observation that cancer cells use up an unusually high level of glucose and produce more lactic acid has been around since the 1920’s.  It wasn’t noted till 1955 by Eagle, that cancer cells also use up a high level of the amino acid glutamine.  In the article, Glutamine addiction: a new therapeutic target in cancer, Wise and Thompson highlight the role glutamine plays in cancer cell growth, protein translation, anaplerosis, and macromolecular synthesis.

Glutamine is the chief donor of nitrogen to cancer cells for the cells to multiply.  When glutamine gives up its amide, it is converted into glutamic acid, which is the main nitrogen donor for nonessential amino acid synthesis.  This amino acid biosynthesis makes glutamine a main ingredient for the cancer cells’ need for protein translation.  Stemming off of biosynthesis is Myc, a basic protein that binds 11 of the genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis.  Myc activation is a commonly observed in cancer and is identified as the driving force behind the spread of lymphomas and small cell lung cancer.  Myc facilitates glutamine consumption and supports the change of glutamine into glutamic acid, and finally into lactic acid.  This satisfies the Warburg observation of the unusual lactic acid production of cancer cells. 

The target of rapamycine (TOR) controls many cell functions such as cell growth, reproduction, motility, and protein synthesis.  The “master regulator of protein translation, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex (TOR), is responsive to glutamine levels” (Wise and Thompson, 2010).  This was initially discovered in yeast, where TOR activation was found to be dependent on glutamine levels. 

The article also describes how glutamine adds to macromolecular (DNA, RNA, and proteins) synthesis by producing NADPH (nicotinamide adenide dinucleotide phosphate, a reducing agent in anabolic reactions) and providing the cancer cell with a substrate source which refills the mitochondrial carbon pool (anaplerosis).  This refilling of the carbon pool is necessary for the synthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides.  

All of these facts relating glutamine importance to cancer cells may be a potential target in altering cancer cell metabolism.  However, it is still unknown if this is a viable target for the treatment of cancer.  Ideas include suppressing the glutamine uptake, TOR activation, or the anaplerosis of the cancer cells.  Using an enzyme to lower blood glutamine levels is another possible method.

&lt;div class=&quot;boilerplate metadata&quot; id=&quot;stub&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#cef2e0;&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Marfan Syndrome'''

==Introduction and contracting==
*What is your understanding of why you were referred to genetics
*What are your main concerns
*Explain that they are there to determine if they might have a genetic condition called Marfan syndrome and give overview of Marfan

==Outline session==
*I will begin by taking a family history
*Our resident _____ will take a medical history
*She and Dr. Doktour will perform a physical examination
*We will then discuss whether or not we believe a diagnosis can be made or if there are other tests that need to be performed
*If a diagnosis is made we will discuss Marfan syndrome in more detail
*We will also answer any questions you have

==Overview of Marfan syndrome==
*A heritable disorder of the connective tissue that affects many organ systems, including the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart and blood vessels.
*The condition affects both men and women of any race or ethnic group
*occurs in 1-2 people per every 10, 000

==Symptoms of Marfan syndrome==
*high degree of clinical variability
*ocular findings: myopia, displacement of the lens, retinal detachment, glaucoma, early cataract formation
*skeletal findings: bone overgrowth, joint laxity, long extremities, pectus excavatum or carinatum, scoliosis, high arched palate, positive wrist and thumb signs, reduced upper to lower segment, arm span to height ratio &gt;1.05, flat feet
*cardiovascular findings: dilatation of the aorta, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, triscupsid valve prolapse, enlargement of the pulmonary artery
*other systems involved: pulmonary, skin, nervous

==Diagnosis of Marfan==
*Diagnosis is made clinically (see diagnostic criteria below for details)
*based on family history and the observation of characteristic findings in multiple organ systems
*no family history? 2 major criteria and 1 minor (3 systems)
*with a family history? 1 major and 1 minor (2 systems)
*sometimes we're very confident in the diagnosis (and sometimes sure of a negative diagnosis), sometimes we're just not sure and we may follow a person for a while, sometimes we think there may be another diagnosis
*What will a diagnosis mean
*predisposition for aortic rupture and other heart problems so must have cardiology exams for echocardiograms (monitor aortic root growth - beta-blockers may be prescribed)
*orthopedist exams (for early detection of scoliosis and pectus)
*yearly ophthalmology exams (due to various eye problems that can often be treated with corrective lenses, but sometimes require surgery)
*potential for complications during pregnancy (rapid progression of aortic root enlargement) must be closely monitored
*50% chance that future children will inherit Marfan syndrome

==Age of Onset, natural history, and life span==
*Some signs of the syndrome are present at birth
*The serious vascular complications may develop at any time from fetal life through old age and are the chief cause of death in these individuals
*The use of b-adrenergic blockers has been associated with a decrease in aortic dilatation and thus increased life
*The mean age for survival for men = 43 and women = 46
*However, with appropriate management, individuals are reportedly living until their 70's.

==Genetics==
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
*75% have an affected parent
*25% due to new mutations
*The disrupted gene is FBN1 - codes for Fibrillin (a protein constituent of connective tissue).
*Located at 15p21
*Molecular genetics
**&gt;100 mutations leading to abnormal splicing of the mRNA have been reported
**The gene is &gt;110 kb and is composed of 65 exons
***A common motif is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) like domain. This domain occurs 47 times
***Each EGF domain contains 6 conserved cysteine residues that from 3 disulfide bonds
***43 of the EGF domains contain a consensus sequence for calcium binding which facilitates inter and intramolecular interactions
***Mutations in any of the conserved calcium binding sequences or the conserved cysteine residues lead to classical Marfan syndrome
*The syndrome is fully penetrant, although the manifestations can vary considerably

==Recurrance Risks==
*If parent affected 50% chance future children will also be affected
*If parent of affected child is not affected then they have a much smaller chance of having another affected child (rare cases of germline and somatic mosaicism)

==Genetic Testing==
(available, but often not used)
*Because FBN1 mutations have been detected in individuals with other fibrillinopathies, the presence of a mutation doesn't by itself confirm the diagnosis.
*Mutations have not been detected in at least 25% of subjects with Marfan syndrome.
*There exists the possibility that the Marfan syndrome phenotype may be produced by mutations in at least one other gene, for this reason, a definitive DNA-based test is not available
*molecular genetic testing for mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene on chromosome locus 15q21.1
*direct mutation screen cumbersome and inefficient due to large size
*up to 70% show positive results
*mutation is not identified in large number of individuals with Marfan syndrome
*If a specific mutation is known within a family, that specific mutation can be tested individuals suspected to be affected
*many mutations in FBN1 cause phenotype different from Marfan syndrome
*mutational screening available on research basis
*Linkage analysis
**Markers are highly informative and are within the FBN1 gene
**Nearly completely informative
**Not available if only one affected individual in family
**Although usually informative caution needed because locus heterogeneity not definitively excluded
*Protein based methods
**Being explored
**Further research needed to determine specificity
**Immunofluorescence studies of extracellular microfibrils with fibrillin antibodies are available as diagnostic aids

==Prenatal Testing==
*Available using linkage analysis if linkage has been established in affected family members
*Or using mutational analysis when disease-causing mutation has been identified
*Ultrasound exam in first two trimesters cannot detect manifestations of Marfan

==Geneotype-Phenotype Correlations==
*Few and none are definitive
*Those with most severe and rapid termed &quot;neonatal Marfan syndrome&quot; have alterations in center of gene exons 24-32 (but not all with severe form have identified mutations and others with mutations in this region have classic or mild variants of Marfan)
*In general mutations causing in-frame gain or loss of coding sequence associated with more severe disease
*Premature termination result in rapid degradation of transcripts associated with mild conditions that fail to meet diagnostic criteria
*Individuals with mutation preventing C-terminal propeptide processing had only skeletal manifestations
*Amino acid substitution may have functional or not have functional importance

==Diagnostic Criteria==
*Diganosis can be made clinically if: 2 organ systems are involved in the presence of an affected first degree relative
*Or, involvement of the skeleton and two or more organ systems is required, as well as the presence of at least one major criterion
*Note: skeletal system qualifies as a major criterion only if at least four major manifestations are present

==Clinical Features (major and minor criteria)==
**Skeletal (can develop in young children and progress during periods of rapid growth)
*Major criteria for diagnosis:
**Pectus carinatum (protruding sternum in convex shape)
**Pectus excavatum requiring surgery (congenital condition in which the sternum is abnormally depressed caused by overgrowth of ribs pushing the sternum in)
**Scoliosis (mild to severe and progressive may require bracing or surgery)
**Reduced extension at the elbows (&lt;170°)
**Pes planus (flatfoot)
**Protrusio acetabuli (pertaining to the hip bone socket where acetabulum abnormally deep and shows accelerated erosion)
**Reduced upper to lower segment ratio
**Wrist sign: thumb overlaps the distal phalanx of the fifth digit when grasping the contralateral wrist (due to bone overgrowth and joint laxity)
**Thumb sign: entire nail of the thumb projects beyond the ulnar border of the hand when the hand is clenched without assistance.
*Minor criteria:
**Pectus excavatum of moderate severity
**Joint hypermobility
**High arched palate with crowded teeth
**Specific facies: dolicocephaly, malar hypoplasia, retrognathia, down slanting palpebral fissures, deep set eyes, palate can be highly arched
**Dolichostenomelia (extremities are disproportionately long for the size of the trunk)
**Arachnodactyly (spider fingers long and thin)
*Major criteria:
**Ectopia lentis (displacement of the lens of the eye in 60% of affected and it is a hallmark feature)
*Minor critieria:
**Flat cornea
**Increased axial length of globe
**Hypoplastic iris or hypoplastic ciliary muscle
*Major Criteria:
**Dilitation of the ascending aorta w/ or w/o aortic regurgitation, involving the sinuses of Valsalva
**Dissection of the ascending aorta
*Minor criteria:
**Mitral valve prolapse w/ or w/o mitral valve regurgitation
**Dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, in the absence of valvular or peripheral pulmonic stenosis before the age of 40
**Calcification of the mital annulus before age 40
**Dilatation or dissection of the descending thoracis or abdominal aorta before age 50.
*Minor criteria:
**Spontaneous pneumothorax (air in the pleural cavity)
**Apical blebs
*Minor criteria:
**Striae atrophicae (stretch marks)
**Recurrent or incisional hernia
*Major criteria:
**Lumbosacral dural ectasia by CT or MRI

==Management/Treatment==
*Growth
**All individuals should be measured periodically
**Prepubertal girls can have height reduction by taking high-dose estrogen therapy combined with progesterone to prevent endometrial hyperplasia
*Development
**Physical therapy is of value in promoting motor skill development
**Psychosocial family counseling
*Musculoskeletal
**Delays in gross motor development caused by joint hypermobility can be ameliorated with PT and orthopedic braces (as needed)
**Treatment of scoliosis and kyphosis depending on the severity of the curvature
**Pectus excavatum or carinatum may need to be repaired to prevent cardiac or pulmonary compromise
*Cardiovascular
**Follow with a cardiologist
**Echocardiogram required at frequent intervals
**b-Adrenergic blaockade has been demonstrated to slow progression of the aortic root dilatation by decreasing the stress on the aortic wall and the tunica media.
**Graft replacement surgery if necessary
**Most adults with Marfan syndrome will eventually need replacement of the dilated aortic root (5% operative risk) and leaking aortic valve.
**If mitral valve prolapse is diagnosed, standard prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis is recommended for all dental procedures.
**Limit physical activities such as contact sports (football, basketball, hockey, volleyball, boxing, wrestling, etc.)
*Ophthalmologic:
**Myopia most common treated with corrective lenses
**Adequate optical correction must be prescribed and worn
**Assessments of refraction must be performed
**Amblyopia must be treated aggressively
**Lens removal for optical reasons is not recommended (the cataract of Marfan syndrome is a true indication for lens extraction)
**When ectopia lentis is progressive and leads to complications such as iritis, glaucoma etc. the lens may need to be removed.
**Because individuals are prone to retinal detachment, they should avoid contact sports
*Neurologic
**Orthostatic headache resulting from cerebrospinal fluid leakage is often transient. Treat with bed rest or corticosteroids
*Respiratory
**Spontaneous pneumothorax is treated by evacuation of the intrapleural air and restoration of the negative pleural pressure by insertion of a drainage test tube.

==Differential==
*Many of the skeletal features common in general population
*Other disorders caused by FBN1 mutations
**MASS phenotype - mitral valve prolapse, borderline and nonprogressive aortic enlargement, nonspecific skin and skeletal features
**Mitral valve prolapse syndrome - MVP with or without skeletal features
**Predominant aortic aneurysm with other subdiagnostic features of Marfan
**Predominant or isolated skeletal features of Marfan
**Dominant ectopia lentis - lens dislocation with skeletal features
**Familial ectopia lentis - associates eye and skeletal features (prolonged follow-up to differentiate it from Marfan)
**Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome - skeletal and heart findings with craniosynostosis and neurodevelopmental abnormalities (this is likely a genetically heterogeneous condition)
*Other connective tissue disorders share some overlap (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, fragile X, Stickler syndrome) Should be easily distinguished by other features though

      <comment>/* Down syndrome */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Maternal Serum Triple Screen'''

==Introduction==
*Acknowledge any prior contact
*Ask them what they know already about why they are here and what they hope to get out of the session
*Address any immediate concerns or indicate that they will be addressed later during the discussion
*Reassure them that this is not a diagnostic test so it can't tell us if there is a problem with the fetus or not. A triple screen is performed to pick out a smaller group of pregnancies that are at an increased risk for specific birth defects and to offer diagnostic testing.
*The majority of women with a positive screen will have babies without birth defects
*This does not mean the test was wrong because all it was supposed to do is pick out fetuses at higher risk and allow us to offer diagnostic testing.

==Obtain Medical and Family History==
*It is helpful for me to know some information about your medical history as well as your family history to determine if there are any health problems that may run in the family. (Make sure all the following information was correct on the test report before the visit or while taking the history because it can change the results drastically.)
*Gestational age - marker levels change throughout pregnancy and inaccurate dates are a common reason for a false positive
*Maternal weight - with increased blood volume, the markers will be diluted in the serum and lower their concentrations
*Maternal race - African American women typically have a 10-15% higher [AFP], but a lower incidence of NTD's
*Maternal age - the detection rate and false positive rate for Down syndrome will both be higher in women over age 35
*Diabetic status - Insulin-dependent diabetics have an increased risk of NTD's, but lower [AFP]
*number of fetuses - increases marker levels

==General Information about Triple Screen==
*A triple screen is a blood test that is routinely offered to women under age 35 where amniocentesis is not recommended.
*It is performed between 14-22 weeks gestation (It is most accurate when performed between 16-18 weeks)
*A negative or normal screening result does not ensure that a child will not have a birth defect
*As mentioned before, a positive result is not a diagnosis of an abnormality. It only indicates that a person has a high enough risk to warrant further testing.
*It is easy to get confused when discussing the triple screen because there is a lot of information so please interrupt me and ask questions as they come up or let me know if something is unclear

==What a Positive Test Means==
*A positive test can tell whether you are at an increased risk for any of 3 disorders, but it can't tell you whether or not the fetus is actually affected
**Open Neural Tube Defects
***Give spina bifida as an example (where the spinal cord didn't form properly and nervous tissue is exposed)
***Can cause motor impairments along with other health concerns
***Does not detect all types of NTDs
***If at high risk mention anencephaly so they can be prepared (where the brain is not formed properly and it is exposed) They may survive to term but die shortly after.
***Explain whether their test showed that they were at increased risk or reassure them that their risk is not increased above the general population risk
**Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 21
***Explain chromosomes
***When there is an extra chromosome it is called trisomy
***Extra genetic material can cause problems in growth and development
***There are a few relatively common trisomies, but the triple screen can detect only two of these
***Explain the features and prognosis of trisomy 18 and Down syndrome
***Explain whether or not their test showed they are at an increased risk for these

==How Does Screening Work==
*Products made by the fetus and placenta can be detected in the mother's blood during pregnancy.
*Levels of these products, referred to as markers, change throughout pregnancy
*Increased or decreased levels of these markers can be correlated to an increased risk of any of the three types of problems that were discussed previously.
*Triple screen measures three markers
**AFP (alpha-fetoprotein --made in the liver and GI tract of the fetus) It is excreted into fetal urine, thus amniotic fluid, then transferred across placenta into maternal blood it increases during 2nd trimester
**hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin - made by the placenta peaks at 10 weeks and falls from there) Pregnancy hormone tested for in pregnancy tests. Important marker for Down syndrome (increased)
**uE3 (unconjugated estriol) - made by the fetus, placenta, and mother it increases throughout pregnancy-- found in both pregnant and nonpregnant women, but at different levels)

==Risk Assessment==
*When the levels of the three markers are determined they are compared to the general population of pregnant women
*The computer takes all factors into account, such as age of the mother and gestational age, to calculate a number (MoM - multiple of the median) that allows us to readily see if the levels are higher or lower than expected
*A value that is 1 means that particular marker is present at expected levels
*However most women do not receive 1's for all three markers and a little variation is common
*It is not bad for the fetus to make different amounts of these proteins, but it is concerning if there are particular patterns to the levels of these three markers.
*A value of 2 indicates that the levels are twice the average expected amount
*A value of ½ indicates that the levels are half the average expected amount
*When risks are determined, all three numbers are looked at together to look for a pattern that may indicate an increased risk for the three specific abnormalities we mentioned already

|}


*screen positive tests for singletons of non-diabetic mothers

===ONTD===
*Only one marker is used to screen for ONTDs.
*Positive screen if MSAFP is greater than or equal to 2.5 MoM
*This indicates an unspecified increased risk of having a child with an ONTD
*(The population incidence is 1 or 2 per every 1000 fetuses)

===Trisomy 18===
*All three markers tend to be lower than expected, but uE3 is the most sensitive marker for trisomy 18.
*The computer program takes your age related risks of having a child with trisomy 18 and calculates a new risk based on all the information
*Your age related risk is _______________________
*Your calculated new risk is _____________________ which means that the chance your fetus does not have trisomy 18 is ____________
*The test is considered to be a positive screen if your new risk is greater than or equal to 1 in 100

===Down syndrome===
*Markers tend to show the pattern in the chart above, but the most important predictive marker is hCG and it tends to be present in higher levels when the fetus has Down syndrome (reason unknown)
*The computer program takes your age related risks of having a child with Down syndrome and calculates a new risk based on all the information
*Your age related risk is ______30_________________
*Your calculated new risk is _____________________ which means that the chance your fetus does not have Down syndrome is ____________
*The test is considered to be a positive screen if your new risk is greater than or equal to 1 in 270 (approximate risk in women age 35 of having a fetus with Down syndrome at time of amnio)

==Reasons for a Screen Positive Result==
*ONTD -- Other conditions can be associated with an elevated MSAFP

===ONTD===
*Normal variant
*Underestimated gestational age
*Multiple pregnancy
*Abdominal wall defect (gastroschisis or omphalocele)
*Feto-maternal bleeding
*Fetal demise
*Other birth defects
*Increased risk for 3rd trimester complications

===Trisomy 18===
*Trisomy 18
*Normal variant
*Inaccurate dating (uE3 levels most predictive)
*Another chromosome abnormality
*Fetal demise
*Steroid sulfatase deficiency (X-liked icthyosis) common reason if estriol is undetectable

===Down Syndrome===
*Down Syndrome
*Normal Variant
*Gestational age (if GA off by more than 10 days should recalculate)
*Multiple pregnancy
*Another chromosomal abnormality
*Triploidy
*Increased risk of third trimester complications (if hCG &gt; 2.5 she should be monitored more closely)

==Follow-Up Options==

===ONTDs===
*Offer ultrasound -
*confirm gestational age (MSAFP increases throughout this time in pregnancy and the g.a. may just be underestimated)
*rule out anencephaly, ONTD, fetal demise, multiple gestation
*If nothing is found on ultrasound and dates are correct
*2.0-2.9 MoM, g.a. &lt;18 wks repeat serum AFP
*&gt;3 MoM, or g.a. &gt; 18 wks offer amnio (measures AFP 90-96% accurate and can also measure Acetylcholinesterase level which detects 99% of ONTD) also detects chromosomal abnormalities
*If the cause of the elevation is still not identified and AFP was greater than 3.0 MoM, serial ultrasounds and antenatal testing should be considered (watch for pre-eclampsia)

===Trisomy 18===
*Offer ultrasound
*Confirm gestational age - off by &gt;10 days call and get a recalculation (uE3 most important increases with gestational age)
*Explain what they look for that might provide clues as to whether the fetus is affected (not diagnostic though so it cannot tell us for sure whether or not the fetus has trisomy 18)
*Offer amniocentesis
*diagnostic testing that will accurately determine if the fetus has trisomy 18 with greater than 99% accuracy
*risks of miscarriage 0.5 % above baseline
*also detects various other chromosomal abnormalities
*If hCG is &lt;2.5 MoM and cause is not identified, a third trimester ultrasound for growth should be considered and patient monitored for pre-eclampsia

===Down syndrome===
*Offer ultrasound
*Confirm gestational age
*if off by 10 days or more and drawn before 15 weeks than repeat at 15-18 wks
*if off by 10 days of more and drawn at or after 15 wks than recalculate the DS risk using corrected age
*Explain other things they will look for on the ultrasound that may be signs of Down syndrome
*Signs are found on ultrasound in about 2/3 of fetuses with Down syndrome
*Whether or not signs are found ultrasound cannot confirm for certain whether or not the fetus is affected.
*Offer amniocentesis (diagnostic testing that will tell us whether the fetus has Down syndrome with &gt;99% accuracy and also detects other chromosomal abnormalities
*If hCG is &lt;2.5 MoM and cause is not identified, a third trimester ultrasound for growth should be considered and patient monitored for pre-eclampsia

==Triple Screen Sensitivity==
*Focus on their results
*These statistics are for the population and don't really affect their results
*They may be confused about this though so address it if there are questions
*Detection rate
*Given the fetus is affected detection rate is the chance that it will be picked up and have a positive screen.
*NOT ALL AFFECTED FETUSES ARE PICKED UP ON TRIPLE SCREEN
*False positive
*Chance of having an unaffected fetus and obtaining a positive screen out of all unaffected pregnancies
*Since there are more unaffected pregnancies than affected pregnancies it may seem like there is a large absolute # of false positives
*If their fetus is unaffected it doesn't meant that the triple screen was wrong because all it is supposed to do is pick out women at increased risk for NTDs, Down syndrome, and trisomy 18.

===ONTDs===
*85% detection rate - means that out of 100 pregnancies where the fetus has an ONTD 85 of them are picked up by this screening (it does not pick up closed neural tube defects)
*80% of cases of open spina bifida
*90% of cases of anencephaly

===Trisomy 18===
*60-80% detection rate - means that out of 100 pregnancies where the fetus has trisomy 18, 60 or 80 of them will be picked up as a positive screen
*.5% false positive rate - means that out of 200 women who are not carrying a fetus with trisomy 18 1 of those 200 would receive a positive screen

===Down Syndrome===

====UNDER 35====
*60-65% detection rate - means that out of 100 pregnancies where the fetus has Down syndrome about 65 will be picked out by this screening
*5% false positive rate - means that out of 100 women that do not have a child with Down syndrome 5 of them will receive a positive screen

====OVER 35====
*85-90% detection rate
*25% false positive rate

==Review==
*Assess if there are any questions or if there is anything that she would like me to explain again
*Assess how she feels about further testing options
*Check for understanding by having her explain how she feels about her risk

(Triple Screen)

==Contracting==
*What do you know about why you have been referred for genetic counseling?
*What have you been told about the triple screen? What is your understanding of your test results?
*What questions or concerns would you like to address?

==Overview of maternal serum screening==
*Background
**Screening test
***Not a diagnostic test
***Used to identify women who are at increased risk for certain birth defects
****These women then offered diagnostic testing
****Negative or &quot;normal&quot; result does not mean that a child will not have a birth defect
****Positive result is not a diagnosis of an abnormality
***Can identify women at increased risk for Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18, or open neural tube defects
**Blood test
***Fetal and placental products can be detected in mother's blood serum during pregnancy
***Can be offered from 14-22 weeks but most accurate at 16-18 weeks
**Indirect measure of levels of three substances in mother's blood
***Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
****Produced by liver of fetus and excreted into amniotic fluid
****Passes into mother's bloodstream and concentration rises gradually throughout pregnancy
***Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
****Pregnancy hormone made by the placenta
****Level peaks at 10 weeks and declines throughout pregnancy
***Unconjugated estriol (uE3)
****Pregnancy hormone made by fetus and placenta
****Level increases throughout pregnancy
***Some laboratories also measure levels of inhibin-A
****Product of placenta
****Quadruple-marker screening may increase detection rate for Down Syndrome
**Risk assessment
***Markers are expressed as multiples of the median (MoM) in report
****MoM determined by examining results from a large number of women and establishing an &quot;average&quot;
****The median for all markers is 1.0 MoM
****An individual's values expressed as marker level in patient/median marker level
***Laboratory calculates a woman's risks based on levels of three substance plus other factors
****Multiple gestations would cause levels to be elevated
****Gestational age
*****Marker levels change throughout pregnancy
*****Inaccurate dates are common reason for false positive
*****Gestational age can be confirmed by ultrasound
****Maternal weight
*****Increased weight means increased blood volume
*****Markers will be diluted in serum and their concentration lower
****Maternal race
****Maternal age
*****Increased risk for having child with chromosomal abnormality as maternal age increases
*****Women over age 35 have higher detection rate and false positive rate
****Diabetic status
*****Insulin-dependant diabetics have increased risk for neural tube defects
*****Tend to have lower AFP levels, so use lower AFP cutoff
***Evaluation of screening performance
****Up to 100 of every 1,000 women who take test will have abnormal result
*****Only 3 of those 100 women will have a baby with a birth defect
*****Most abnormal test results indicate dates are wrong or another factor above has not been accurately accounted for
*****Abnormal result could also be normal variation
****Pattern of variation in levels may indicate that a woman is at increased risk for a particular birth defect
*Evaluation of abnormal results
**Elevated MSAFP
***Greater than 2.5 MoM
***Conditions possibly causing elevated MSAFP
****Normal variant
****Underestimation of gestational age
****Multiple pregnancies
****Open neural tube defects
****Abdominal wall defects
****Feto-maternal bleeding
****Fetal demise
****Finnish nephrosis
****Some other birth defects
***Increased risk for 3rd trimester complications
***Follow-up strategies:
****Repeat MSAFP
*****If patient's gestational age is within testable range
*****If only mild elevation (2.5-3.0 MoM)
****Confirm gestational age by ultrasound
****Offer ultrasound and amniocentesis
****Serial ultrasounds and antenatal testing
*****If AFP greater than 3.0 MoM
*****When cause of elevation is not identified
***Neural tube defects
****Includes spina bifida, anencephaly most commonly
****Also includes such conditions as encephalocele and hydrocephalus
****Neural tube is part of developing embryo that brain and spine develop from
*****Neural tube defects due to failure of this tube to close properly
*****About 2,500 babies born each year in US with neural tube defect
****Spina bifida
*****Backbone does not form properly
*****Often spinal cord is malformed and protrudes from back
*****Can cause leg paralysis and bladder and bowel problems
****Anencephaly
*****Upper end of neural tube fails to close
*****Brain and skull severely malformed
*****Babies usually don't survive
****Multifactorial inheritance
*****Both genetic and environmental factors interact to cause this condition
*****About 90-95% of babies with NTDs born into families with no prior history
**Screen positive for Down Syndrome
***Positive if calculated risk is greater than 1 in 270
***Occurs when AFP is decreased, hCG elevated, and uE3 decreased
***Conditions possibly associated with screen positive for Down Syndrome
****Normal variant
****Overestimation of gestational age
****Multiple pregnancies (uncommon)
****Down syndrome
****Another chromosome abnormality
****Triploidy
***Increased risk for 3rd trimester complications
***Follow-up recommendations
****Confirm gestational age with ultrasound
****Repeat test only if patient was at too early a gestational age for the screen to be performed
****Offer diagnostic ultrasound and amniocentesis
****Ultrasound for growth and monitoring for preeclampsia in 3rd trimester if hCG greater than 2.5 MoM for unknown reason
***Down Syndrome
****Explain chromosomes and nondisjunction
****Discuss age-related risk and adjusted risk for Down syndrome
****Clinical features and prognosis
*****Due to extra copy of chromosome 21
*****May cause characteristic facial features, mental retardation, heart defects, and other health problems
*****Cannot predict severity
**Screen positive for Trisomy 18
***When calculated risk is greater than 1 in 100
***Occurs when AFP, hCG, and uE3 are all decreased
***Conditions associated with positive screen
****Normal variant
****Gestational age inaccurate
****Trisomy 18
****Another chromosome abnormality
****Fetal demise
****Steroid sulfatase deficiency (X-linked ichthyosis)
***Follow-up recommendations
****Confirm gestational age by ultrasound
****Repeat only is gestational age at time of screen found to be too early
****Offer diagnostic ultrasound and amniocentesis
****Monitor for preeclampsia and offer ultrasound in 3rd trimester if hCG above 2.5 MoM and no cause identified
***Trisomy 18
****Explain chromosomes and nondisjunction
****Discuss age related and adjusted rates for trisomy 18
****Clinical features and prognosis
*****Caused by extra copy of chromosome 18
*****Causes severe mental retardation and health problems
*****Usually fatal within first year of life
*Capabilities and limitations of screening
**Benefits
***May provide reassurance that fetus does not appear to have certain birth defects
***Can help woman manage pregnancy better
****When problems detected, woman can prepare for delivery or treatment needed right after birth
****Prepare mentally, emotionally, and socially for birth of child with birth defect
***May help women over age 35 determine whether to have more invasive procedure
****Negative screen may actually lower risk for chromosome abnormality
****Women with negative screen may choose to avoid more risky procedure
***Monitoring of women with abnormal test result may prevent 3rd trimester complications
**Limitations
***Not diagnostic test
****False positive may produce unnecessary anxiety
****Negative test does not mean fetus does not have birth defect, only that not at increased risk for conditions mentioned
***May be no explanation for abnormal result
****Abnormal results may be associated with pregnancy problems like placental abruption, preterm labor, and low birth weight
****May cause maternal anxiety
***Can't identify all birth defects
****Down syndrome and Trisomy 18 are only chromosomal abnormalities that can be detected with this test
****Amniocentesis is only way to diagnose or rule out chromosome problems

==Other testing options==
*Ultrasound
**May be offered to confirm gestational age or identify multiple fetuses to help interpret triple screen results
**Can detect many major birth defects
**Can rule out 95% of NTDs if visualization is not limited
**Can't diagnose chromosomal abnormalities
*Amniocentesis
**Performed after 15 weeks
**Risks/Benefits
***99.7% accuracy for fetal chromosome analysis
***Detects 96% of open neural tube defects by testing AFAFP
***Cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation
***Risk of miscarriage due to procedure is 0.5%

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''McCune Albright Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*Establish rapport with small talk and introduce myself
*Briefly discuss the topics to be covered during the appointment
*Assess the concerns of the family and ask if they have any questions today

==Elicit Medical History - Clinical Progress Sheet==

==Elicit Family History Update==
*Any changes in family history?
*Any new births or plans for pregnancy?

==Definition==
*McCune Albright syndrome is a disorder characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia accompanied by café au lait spots and endocrine disorders esp. precocious puberty in girls. The patient is fracture prone, and deformity and shortening of the bones may develop.

==Genetic Etiology==
*Mode of inheritance:
**Thought to be sporadic although there have been a few familial occurrences.
**Believed to be a somatic mutation disorder
*Molecular Genetics:
**Identification of activating mutations in the GNAS1 gene
*G proteins are involved in signal transduction pathways that affect the production of cAMP
*An overactive cAMP pathway stimulates growth and function of the gonads, adrenal cortex, specific pituitary cells, osteoblasts, and melanocytes
**Mutations in the gene render it functionally constitutive.
**Proposal that this a disorder of mosacicism (nonmocaicism is thought to be a lethal condition)
*Chromosome location
**Chromosome 20

==Incidence==
*Described in 1936-1937 by McCune and Albright respectively- since then &gt;100 cases have been reported
*The frequency of diagnosis in females vs. males is 3:2

==Clinical Features==
*Endocrine Abnormalities:
**Precocious puberty occurs in over 50% of the female cases and has been reported for males as well
***Menstruation, breast development, and pubic hair growth can occur during the first months of life
***Usually caused by ovarian cysts that secrete estrogen into the blood stream
***Many women with MAS are fertile in adulthood
**Hyperthyroidism:
***50% of patients with MAS have thyroid gland abnormalities
***Enlargement=goiter
***Pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are low in these patients, while thyroid hormone levels may be normal or elevated
***Excessive secretion of growth hormone has been seen in a few patients
*Most develop course facies, enlarged hands/feet, and arthritis characteristic of acromegaly
*Associated with gigantism and gynecomastia
**Adrenal Enlargement:
***Rarely seen
***Excessive secretion of the adrenal hormone cortisol caused by the hyperfunction of the anterior pituitary
***Results in cushing syndrome
*Weight gain, obesity of the face and trunk, skin fragility and cessation of growth in children
*Treatment: removal of adrenal glands or use of drugs that block cortisol synthesis
*Bone Disease (polyostotic fibrous dysplasia):
**Abnormal fibrous tissue growth in many bones
**In affected areas, normal bone is replaced by irregular masses of fibroblast cells leads to deformity and/or thickening of the bones
***When this occurs in weight bearing bones such as the femur, limping, deformity, and fractures can result
***Many children have unequal arm/leg length even in the absence of fractures
**Regions of fibrous dysplasia are also common in the skull and jaw bones
***May result in facial asymmetry
**Severity of bone involvement varies
**Know known hormonal or medical treatment has been proven effective.
**Some surgical procedures such as grafting, pinning, and casting have been used to correct fracture and deformity (skull and jaw changes are often corrected surgically to improve appearance)
*Skin abnormalities:
**Flat areas of increased pigment may be found = café au lait spots
**These spots are usually present at birth, and they usually do not become more extensive
**The pattern of pigmentation is unique
***Starts or ends abruptly at the midline on the abdomen in front or at the spine in the back
***A few have spots confined to small areas such as the nape of the neck or crease of the buttocks

==Natural history==
*Pigmentation is usually evident in infancy
*Bone dysplasia may progress throughout childhood
*The sexual precocity is often unusual, with menstruation occurring before breast and pubic hair development.
*Precocious puberty may lead to short stature

==Testing==
*Currently, testing for a mutation in the GNAS1 gene is done for research purposes.
*It is not a routine test that can be ordered.

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Hemihypertrophy, a sporadic condition, has as its most significant feature- limb length asymmetry and sometimes, facial asymmetry. Between 5-8% of these children will develop an intra-abdominal tumor, either Wilms tumor of the kidney or hepatoblastoma.

==Psychosocial Assessment==
*How are things at home?
*Does mom work outside of the home?
*Financial concerns?
*How is the family adjusting?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase Deficiency'''

==Overview==
*Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) is an enzyme involved in mitochondrial fatty acid b-oxidation (FAO). Fatty acid oxidation provides energy for peripheral tissues when glycogen is depleted through hepatic ketogenesis. A defect in the MCAD enzyme causes accumulation of medium-chain fatty acids, metabolized to glycine- and carnitine-esters and dicarboxylic acids, and hypoketonia.

==Genetics==
*MCAD deficiency is caused by a mutation in the ACADM gene
*Chromosomal locus 1p31
*31 known disease causing mutations
*1 common mutation, K304E, accounts for 76% of alleles

==Incidence==
*Common in Caucasians, especially with Northern European ancestry
*Disease incidence 1:4,900 to 1:17,000
*Carrier frequency 1:40 to 1:100
*Less common among Hispanics
*Rare in African-American, and Native-American populations

==Diagnosis==
*Metabolic testing
*Symptomatic individuals should have plasma acylcarnitines, plasma fatty acids, urine organic acids, and urine acylclycines analyzed and interpreted.
*Enzymatic testing
*MCAD enzyme activity should be measured in fibroblasts or other tissues to confirm diagnosis
*Molecular testing
*Molecular genetic testing by mutation analysis (for K204E) or sequence analysis of the ACADM gene can confirm diagnosis
*Newborn screening
*MCAD is part of the newborn screening panel in 9 states (IA, ME, MA, NC, OH, SC, SD, WI, WY).
*Prenatal testing
*Enzymatic or molecular testing can be performed prenatally; however, there is limited benefit to prenatal vs. newborn testing.
*Carrier testing
*Only molecular testing can determine carrier status.

==Clinical Features==
*Typical presentation includes hypoketotic hypoglycemia, vomiting, lethargy,
seizures, and coma precipitated by prolonged fasting or common illness.
*Hepatomegaly and acute liver disease may also be present.
*Sudden, unexplained death may be first symptom (18%).

==Natural History==
*Typically normal at birth following uneventful pregnancy
*Most present with symptoms between 3 and 24 months in response to prolonged fasting or infection
*Initial presentation in adulthood also possible
*Affected individuals may lose developmental milestones or acquire aphasia or ADD as a result of acute metabolic event
*Individuals identified as newborns typically develop normally under treatment

==Inheritance==
*MCAD deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder.

==Testing==
*Enzymatic and Molecular testing can confirm diagnosis.
*Both mutation and sequence analysis are available on a clinical basis.

==Management &amp; Treatment==
*MCAD is a highly treatable condition- good prognosis when managed
*Avoidance of fasting is key-
*Infants should be fed frequently
*Toddlers should be given 2 g/kg uncooked cornstarch before bed
*Low-fat diet and carnitine supplementation may be beneficial

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Other disorders of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) gene family
*Other disorders of fatty acid b-oxidation

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Parental guilt over allowing too long of time between feedings which triggered onset of symptoms
*Parental guilt over passing gene to child
*When presenting symptom is sudden death, loss of seemingly healthy child can be devastating
*Parent or sibling may be identified as a homozygote during carrier testing
*Family planning- risk for future offspring/siblings of affected individual

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mosaic trisomy 21 - Transient Myeloproliferative Syndrome'''

==Introduction/Contracting==
*How has everything been going since your last visit in April?
*Do you have any concerns or questions at this time?
*We wanted to follow T in genetics because there is such a wide variability in characteristics, cognitive abilities and health concerns in children with mosaic trisomy 21 and we want to make certain that any special services or health care needs are being met.
*I am going to first ask questions about his medical and developmental hx. since his last visit in April.
*Dr. Doktour will want to take a look at him
*We can answer questions you might have and discuss what our impression is now at this time.

==Medical History==
*Any new medical problems?
*How is he eating? What does he eat? How much?
*Is he still being followed by oncology? What are their expectations for T?
*Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
*Medications
*Review systems briefly to check if any concerns with heart, hearing, eyes, bowel movements or stool, bladder problems, muscle or bone problems (broken bones, muscle weakness), seizures, breathing difficulties or snoring loudly at night, any birth marks or unusual skin findings, allergies.

==Developmental History==
*I noted that you feel his development is appropriate for his age.
*I just want to get documentation of when he achieved certain milestones
*Ask about milestones
*Ask what he is currently doing?
*Typical two-year old can
*Put on clothes, but not button
*Use spoon little spilling
*How does he pick up small objects can he use fingers in pincer grasp
*About how many words is he saying
*Is he combining words, how many?
*Following two step directions
*Does he have a tricycle? How does he do on that?
*Is he still receiving services through Baby Watch?

==Psychosocial Considerations and Counseling==
*Are you considering having more children?
*I know Counselor1 and Dr. Doktour have gone over this, but do you have any questions about recurrence risks or how mosaic trisomy 21 occurs.
*Acknowledge that it has been a lot to go through
*Childhood illness may increase parents worry and/or overprotective behavior concerning their child
*Assess how their support has been and whether they are getting all the help they need
*Assess whether they are worried about cancer recurrence risks

==Mosaic Trisomy 21==
*Occurs in 1-2% of liveborn infants with Down syndrome
*Wide variability in (characteristics) phenotype (ranging from completely normal to full DS phenotype)
*Intellectual develompent varies also (near normal to severe mental retardation)
*How affected an individual is depends on the tissues involved and the proportion of trisomic cells
*Children with DS have 10-20 fold increase in incidence of leukemia
*Most common is a transient leukemia known as transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD)
*7 of 8 families with mosaic trisomy 21 studied it appeared that nondisjunction occurred after fertilization then the cell line with extra copy developed and in 1 there was the presence of a third type of chromosome 21 suggesting it was trisomic embryo that lost one copy in one of cell lines subsequently

==TMD (Transient Myeloproliferative Disorder)==
*Clinically indistinguishable from congenital leukemia
*Unique due to spontaneous remission (no chemo)
*Complete clinical recovery in many cases
*often associated with trisomy 21 cell line, but not always associated with clinical signs of Down syndrome
*case report of newborn boy (Bhatt, ''et al.'', 1995)
*high white blood count, undifferentiated
*initially thought to be congenital leukemia a form that is usually fatal
*14 other cases with no phenotypic evidence of trisomy 21
*clinical course ranged from relatively benign to serious ending up in death
*all survivors showed complete resolution without chemo
*extent of mosaicism variable, but there was at least a decrease in percent of trisomy 21 cells and some had complete resolution
*some had constitutional presence of trisomy 21 (4/15) others only 10 had analysis of skin fibroblasts and they showed normal karyotype

==Recurrence Risks Mosaic Trisomy 21==
*Parents not likely to be at any higher risk than general population because nondisjunction probably occurred in the developing embryo and not the egg or sperm.
*Their risk may be as high as 1% based on empiric risks for parents with a child with full trisomy 21 (this includes risks for other chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomies 18 and 13 and Klinefelter)
*Uncertainty about whether there will be increased risks to the offspring of individuals with TMD. It is possible for them to have germ cell mosaicism for trisomy 21, which would increase risks for their offspring.

==Risks of Recurrence in Cancer==
*Although complete resolution of TMD occurs in most patients with DS, 25% end up developing AMKL within 3 years
*No patient with normal phenotype and trisomy 21 cell line has been described to develop AMKL
*Those with constitutional mosaicism speculated to be at higher risk than those without

==Resources==
*Bhatt, S. et al. Transient Leukemia With Trisomy 21: Description of a Case and review of the Literature. Amer. Journal of Med. Gen. 58:310-314 (1995).

==Contracting==
*Can you explain to me your main purpose in visiting genetics?
*What are your main concerns about the diagnosis?
*Outline session
*First I will update the medical and family history
*Doctor will then probably want to perform physical exam
*Then we will address any concerns or questions

==Medical history==
*Follow interim history form and focus on potential health problems/ symptoms described later in outline

==Update Pedigree==
*Any other brothers or sisters
*Full biological?
*Any other family members with:
*Genetic conditions
*Multiple miscarriages
*Birth defects
*Chronic illnesses
*MR learning difficulties
*Any chance that you and his father related by blood
*Country where relatives are from originally

==Overview==
*Group of inherited metabolic disorders
*Caused by a deficiency of the specific lysosomal enzymes needed to break down mucopolysaccharides
*Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules used to build connective tissues and organs in the body
*When mutations occur in the genes for the enzymes that break down mucopolysaccharides, excess amounts of them are stored in the body
*This causes progressive damage to organs and tissues
*Eight clinical types and numerous subtypes have been identified
*Although each type differs clinically, generally, people with mucopolysaccharidoses experience a period of normal development followed by a decline in physical and/or mental function
*Some of the excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted through the urine and diagnosis often can be made through clinical examination and urine tests

==Incidence==
*Estimated 1 in 25,000 births in U.S. have some form of MPS:

==Treatment==
*No simple cure for the mucopolysaccharidoses
*Treatment is symptomatic and supportive
*In several individuals, bone marrow transplants have been attempted with varying degrees of success
*Enzyme replacement trials (ERT) are under investigation for MPS I and MPS II
**Kakkis et al. (2001) treated 10 patients with MPS I (aged 5 to 22 years) with recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase at a dose of 125,000 U per kg of body weight given intravenously once weekly for 52 weeks.
**Hepatosplenomegaly decreased significantly in all patients, and the size of the liver was normal for body weight and age in 8 patients by 26 weeks.
**The rate of growth in height and weight increased by a mean of 85 and 131%, respectively, at 52 weeks in the 6 prepubertal patients.
**The mean maximum range of motion of shoulder flexion and elbow extension increased significantly.
**The number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea during sleep decreased by 61%.
**New York Heart Association functional class improved by 1 or 2 classes in all patients.
**Urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion decreased after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment; the mean reduction at 52 weeks was 63% of baseline values.
**Five patients had transient urticaria during infusions. Serum antibodies to alpha-L-iduronidase were detected in 4 patients

==ERT==
*treatment consists of a modified form of the alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme given intravenously
*takes approximately two hours for a person to receive the treatment, and the treatment is usually given every two weeks
*Enzyme replacement therapy can stop and often reverse the symptoms of the disorder
*Disadvantages of the enzyme replacement therapy are its high cost and the fact that it is a lifelong process
*Potential adverse reactions including &quot;allergic type reaction&quot;
*Initial evidence of potential treatment for Hurler syndrome (Keeling KM ''et al.'', 2001)
*Gentamicin-mediated suppression of Hurler syndrome stop mutations restored a low level of alpha-L-iduronidase activity and reduced lysosomal glycosaminoglycan accumulation
*results suggest that the suppression of premature stop mutations may provide an effective treatment for Hurler syndrome patients with premature stop mutations in the IDUA gene

==Types of MPS==
*MPS type I
**Hurler, Scheie, and Hurler/Sheie syndromes also known respectively as MPS-IH, MPS-IS, and MPS-IH/S
**Hurler syndrome takes its name from Gertrud Hurler, the doctor who described a boy and girl with the condition in 1919
**In 1962, Dr. Scheie, a consultant ophthalmologist, wrote about some of his patients who were more mildly affected
**Patients who seem not to fit clearly in either the severe or the mild end of the disorder are said to have *Hurler/Scheie syndrome
**All are caused by missing enzyme - alpha-L-iduronidase
**Alpha-L-iduronidase breaks down (mucopolysaccharides) heparan sulfate and dermatan
**Found at locus 4p16.3
**No reliable way of telling from biochemical tests how severe the disorder will be
**residual alpha-L-iduronidase activity in Hurler fibroblasts is heat-stable whereas that in Scheie fibroblasts is heat-labile
**Progression and severity of disease are highly variable within the spectrum of MPS)

==General symptoms==
*multiple organ and tissue involvement
*Joint stiffness
*Skeletal deformities
*Enlarged liver
*Obstructive airway disease; respiratory infection and cardiac complications are the most common direct causes of death
*Ophthalmologic manifestations and hearing disorders

==Three subgroups of MPSI according to severity==
*Sheie syndrome
*corneal opacities
*aortic valve disease
*normal stature
*mild or absent intellectual impairment
*nearly normal life span
*seldom recognized during infancy or early childhood
*No neurologic involvement
*Joint stiffness, carpet tunnel syndrome
*Mild hepatosplenomegaly
*Hurler/Sheie
**Onset of symptoms between 3 and 8 years of age
**death in 2nd or 3rd decade normal or near normal intelligence
**more severe physical symptoms than those with Scheie syndrome
**short stature
**dysostosis multiplex
**hepatosplenomegaly
**corneal clouding
**umbilical or inguinal hernia
**psychotic symptoms may appear later in life
*Hurler syndrome
**Most severe form
**Occurs in infancy
**Macrocephaly (*may appear early in infancy while complete clinical picture develops during second year of life)
**Respiratory infections*
**Limited hip abduction*
**Apnea or difficulty breathing
**Coarse (gargyloid) facies
**accelerated growth from infancy followed by progressive decline in the rate of development
**progressive physical disability
**progressive mental retardation
**dysostosis multiplex
**corneal clouding
**death usually before the age of 10 years usually result of pneumonia and heart failure

==Inheritance and risks==
*AR inheritance, panethnic
*Parents of affected child have ¼ chance of each pregnancy being affected
*Unaffected sibs of patient have 2/3 chance of being carrier
*Combined frequency: approximately 1 in 50,000
**Hurler: 1 in 100,000
**Hurler-Scheie: 1 in 115,000
**Scheie: 1 in 500,000

==Diagnosis==
*can be diagnosed with a blood looking at levels of alpha-L-iduronidase
*low level of this enzyme in a person's white blood cells is characteristic of the disease
*confirmed by this absence of alpha-L-iduronidase in the white blood cells, the excretion of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate in the urine, and by physical appearance
*Molecular (DNA) analysis can also be used to verify the diagnosis

==Genetic Testing==
*Prenatal diagnosis
*possible once a diagnosis has been made in the family and a genetic alteration identified (CVS and
*amount of alpha-L-iduronidase can be measured in the amniotic cells or chorionic villi Molecular (DNA) analysis can be used to verify the diagnosis prenatally, by looking for the same genetic alteration that is present in the family member
*Carrier testing
*Enzyme analysis using white blood cells is not effective or reliable in identifying carriers of these disorders
*However, a study in 2002 (Mandelli J ''et al.'') showed that leukocyte IDUA from MPS I heterozygotes differed from the normal enzyme in terms of optimum pH, Km, and Vmax of the reaction and thermostability at 50 degrees C. They claimed these parameters provide a simple and reliable tool for the detection of carriers for MPS I.
*molecular (DNA) analysis is used to identify carriers
*first test someone in the family who has already been diagnosed with the disorder, so that the laboratory can identify the genetic alteration present in that individual and look for that same alteration in at-risk family members

==MPS II (Hunter syndrome -differential diagnosis)==

==Overview==
*named after Charles Hunter, the professor of medicine in Manitoba, Canada, who first described two brothers with the disorder in 1917
*Hunter syndrome is less common than MPS I and has no corneal clouding and pursues a slower course than MPS I
*Some think there are two distinct types of the condition, the mild and the severe
*Others believe there is just one disorder with a wide range in the severity of the problems it causes

==Risks and inheritance==
*X-linked recessive
*Rarely girls have been diagnosed
*Mother of affected boy is carrier
*50% risk to future boys
*maternal aunts and sisters at risk of being carrier
*carrier testing available

==Description of symptoms==
*Severe form:
**Joint stiffness
**Mental deterioration
**Dwarfing
**Progressive deafness
**Death by age 15
*Mild form:
**Short stature
**Limitation of motion
**Enlarged forehead, tongue and lips
**Life span may be normal

==Other Differentials==
*MPS III,or Sanfilippo syndrome
**experience progressive dementia and mental deterioration in childhood
**Death usually occurs in the late teens
*MPS IV,or Morquio syndrome
**Symptoms usually appear in infancy and may include severe dwarfing and corneal clouding
**Intelligence is normal
**Cardiac or respiratory disease may cause death in the third or fourth decade of life
*MPS VI,or Maroteauz-Lamy syndrome
**resembles Hurler syndrome
**Onset is in infancy
**intelligence is normal
**Individuals may live into the second or third decade
*MPS VII, Sly disease
**experience corneal clouding, skeletal irregularities, and enlargement of the liver and spleen
**Intellectual impairments vary for this type of MPS

==Drug-induced lysosomal storage disease==
*example of phenocopy
*thought that drugs of widely differing pharmacologic activity can interact with polar lipids within the lysosomes to yield lipid-drug complexes resistant to enzymatic digestion

==Psychosocial considerations==
*Assess how this disease is viewed by patient and family members
*Probably difficult to watch progression of disease may feel helpless
*May seek out every possible therapy (including alternative med. tx)
*Difficulty accepting that life-span may be shortened
*May have been overprotected by parents
*May struggle with feelings of dependence on others
*Discuss support group

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Multiple Pregnancy Loss'''

==Introduction and contracting==
*Acknowledge prior phone contact
*Did you come up with any questions you would like us to discuss?
*What do you hope to get from the visit?
*What is your main concern?
*Explain that we will be taking a detailed pregnancy and family history to try to help us provide some answers concerning your pregnancy losses
*We will then have Dr. _________, one of our medical geneticists, come in and we will talk to you and try to answer your questions and explain what we know

==Medical History==
*Why were you referred to genetic counseling?
*Who referred you?
*Who is your current doctor?
*How many pregnancies have you had?
*Confirm when the losses were and what the suspected causes are
*What were you told you about the pregnancy losses?
*What types of testing have they done to try to find a reason for the miscarriages?
*Were you sick at all during the pregnancies?
*Did you drink, smoke or use drugs?
*Any medications during the pregnancies
*Did you take prenatal vitamins?
*Any concerns about anything you might have been exposed to during any of your pregnancies?
*Why do you believe you have had the miscarriages?
*Have you had problems with infertility?
*What type of infertility work up have you had?
*What is the next step in the process for you?

==Family History==
*Take a family history to see if there are any hereditary diseases that may run in your family that may or may not be related to your history of pregnancy losses
*Pedigree (ask specifically about)
*Miscarriages in other family members
*Infertility
*Mental retardation/learning difficulties
*Birth defects
*Chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease
*Consanguinity
*Country where your ancestors came from

==Psychosocial assessment==
*How are you handling the pregnancy losses?
*Have family members or friends been supportive?
*What do your plans for the future look like?
*Are you currently working outside the home?
*What is your occupation?
*Your husband's occupation?
*Do you have a religious preference?
*Are you in touch with a perinatal loss support group?
*Would you like to be in touch with a support group?
*Is your insurance covering the testing that has been performed?
*Are there any other concerns or questions?

==Trisomy 16==
*one of most common chromosomal abnormalities
*affected embryos or fetuses never survive past first trimester
*is the cause of may first trimester losses
*explain chromosomes
*explain nondisjunction
*reassure her that it is not do to anything she did or did not do
*once a woman has a child with an identified trisomy the risk of having another child with a trisomy is about 1% (is this what you would quote here) this is usually quoted for Down syndrome and trisomy 18 or 13 because they are viable??????

==AMA counseling==
*as women get older their risk of having a fetus or child with a trisomy increases gradually
*there is no magic age at which the risks become high, but at age 35 the risks of having a child with a chromosomal abnormality become high enough that it makes sense to offer diagnostic testing such as amnio (after 15 wks and CVS 10-12 wks)

==Early Pregnancy Loss==
*establishing pregnancy is more difficult than many people realize
*clinically recognized pregnancy loss occurs in ~15% of pregnancies
*40-60% of all conceptions may be lost, but most of these (3/4) are estimated to be lost before it is recognized clinically
*most miscarriages occur between 6-8 weeks and expulsion between 10-12 weeks
*after 3 consecutive clinical abortions the risk of aborting next pregnancy is 20-55%

==Causes of pregnancy losses==
(only chromosome abnormalities and uterine abnormalities are definitively implicated in pregnancy loss)
*chromosomal abnormalities (most common 70% of first trimester loss)
**balanced translocation carrier (2.7-4.8% of couples with recurrent losses)
**trisomies and other chromosomal anomalies
*Hormonal causes
**Inadequate luteal phase
**Deficient progesterone
*Endometrial factors (endometrial protein expression)
*Uterine abnormalities
**septate uterus
**bicornate uterus
**uterine myomas or fibroids
**DES exposure in utero
*Environmental exposures
**Alcohol (women who drink 2X's week had sig. higher SA than other women but drinkers also tend to smoke also - possible confounding?)
**tobacco ( if ½ pack a day or greater and appears to be dose dependent)
**heavy caffeine intake (moderate intake is not associated with SA)
**chemical solvent exposure in either sex may increase risk
*Immune Causes
**autoimmune problems -- estimated to be cause of multiple SA's in up to 30% of women (woman makes antibodies that will attack her own proteins and those that she has in common with the fetus)
***anticardiolipin antibodies -- type of a group of antiphospholipid antibodies that may be associated with miscarriage
***circulating antibodies to cardiolipin and/or inappropriate coagulation parameters, plus poor reproductive outcome, SLE, or spontaneous thrombosis (the antibodies can react with phospholipids that are required for coagulation)
***SLE - an autoimmune disease thought to be related to SA's (Antichromatin IgG is useful in diagnosing SLE antinuclear antibody testing can indicate many at risk for SLE or some other autoimmune diseases)
**alloimmune causes -- (response to tissues from another individual of the same species)
***theory that must recognize fetus as foreign by the HLA and produce blocking antibodies for pregnancy to progress
***only one of four studies found benefit to leukocyte immunization via paternal leukocyte transfusions
*Diabetes (controlled or unsuspected is not thought to cause SA)
*Infection
**chlamydia trachomatous causes acute and chronic infection of the endometrium which could interfere with implantation (more chlamydia antibodies in women with recurrent SA's but not all studies confirmed this)
**Mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum (controversy over importance in losses)
**CMV but suggests this is rare and causation not proven
**Herpes simplex virus (importance in SA's debated)
**HIV does not increase rates of loss in asymptomatic women
*Psychological factors-two studies showed significant reduction in SA among women who have 3 or more SA's when undergoing counseling once per week during pregnancy

==1. Be able to identify the following terms: ==
# '''Foredge:''' the fore edge of a book, that is, the edge opposite the spine.  
# '''Gutter:''' the inner margin of a pair of facing pages.  This would be the right margin of an even-numbered page (which is always found on the left side) and the left margin of an odd-numbered page (which is always found on the right).
# '''Endsheet:''' a piece of often decorative paper glued to the inside cover of a book.  Its purpose is to hide the raw edge of the cloth covering.
# '''Flysheet:''' the pages at the beginning and end of a book, not glued to the covers.
# '''Signature:''' a large sheet printed with several pages, intended to form four or more leaves in the finished book. The pages are arranged on the sheet so that all of the pages orient the same way and are in proper sequence after the sheet is folded.
# '''Mull:''' a coarse fabric used for lining the spine of a book.
# '''Backbone:''' the spine of a book.  This is the edge of a book that shows when a book is placed on a shelf.
# '''Head:''' the top margin of a page.
# '''Foot:''' the bottom margin of a page.
# '''Deckle edge:''' the uncut and slightly irregular edge of a piece of paper.  
# '''Guarding sheets:''' pieces of paper placed in a book in front of a plate (picture) to prevent ink from the picture from bleeding onto the facing page.
# '''Headbanding:''' a strip of material between a book's spine and the pages.  It usually protrudes slightly above the top edge of the spine.
# '''Casing-in:''' the process of attaching the bound pages of a book to the cover by gluing the endsheets to the inside covers.
# '''Buchram:''' the cloth used on the outside of a book cover.

==2. Describe the difference between the following binding methods: ==
# '''Perfect binding''' A paperback or soft cover book consists of a number of signatures or individual leaves between covers of much heavier paper, glued together at the spine with a strong flexible glue; this is sometimes called perfect binding. Mass market paperbacks and pulp paperbacks are small (16mo size), cheaply made and often fall apart after much handling or several years.
# '''Hard bound''' A hardbound or hard cover book has rigid covers and is stitched in the spine. Looking from the top of the spine, the book can be seen to consist of a number of signatures bound together. When the book is opened in the middle of a signature, the binding threads are visible. Modern hardcover books are typically of octavo size, though they are often smaller or larger.
# '''Single signature''' A single signature binding is one in which only one signature and the cover are sewn together at the spine.
# '''Spiral (metal and plastic)''' A spiral-bound book is made of individual sheets, each with a line of holes punched near the bound edge. A metal or plastic spiral wire is fed through the holes to hold the sheets together. Spiral binding allows a book to be disassembled and reassembled by hand without damage.
# '''Saddle stitch''' Stapling through the center fold, also called saddle-stitching, joins a set of nested folios into a single magazine issue.  Most American comic books fall into this category.

==3. Perform the following==
===a. Bind a single signature hand binding &quot;manuscript&quot;.===
A '''manuscript''' is an original copy of an author's work.  Manuscripts are often submitted in the form of typewritten (or computer printed) sheets of paper.  Sometimes the manuscripts are two-sided, and sometimes they are single-sided.

In order to bind a manuscript, it must be converted into a form suitable for folio binding - that is, the binder needs at least two leaves per sheet.  So instead of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets of paper, the binder needs 11&quot; x 17&quot; sheets.  This is accomplished by pasting the sheets together in what will form the ''gutter''.  Once the sheets are pasted together, they can be sewn though the overlapping section and bound normally.

In binding a 16-sheet single-sided manuscript, the right edge of sheet 1 is pasted to the left edge of sheet 16.  Similarly, sheets 2 and 15 are pasted together, 3 and 14, 4 and 13, etc.  An even sheet number is always pasted to an odd so that the middle sheet is not left standing alone.  If there are an odd number of sheets, the first sheet should be pasted to a blank sheet.

When a book is opened, the page on the left side always has an even page number, and the page on the right has an odd page number.  Care should be taken to observe this convention when pasting double-sided sheet together.  Again, for a 16-sheet, 32-page manuscript, page 1 should be laid on the table face down.  Page 32 should be laid face down to the right of it, and the bookbinder should then see pages 2 and 31.  These are then pasted together.

Once the paste has dried, each sheet is carefully folded along the center of the overlapping sections.  The manuscript will resist folding at this seam because the paper is double-thick there.  Nonetheless, this is where the fold should be made.  A bone folder makes this task easier.  The folded sheets are then nested together to form a ''signature'', and the signature is then ready to sew to a cover made of a single sheet of heavier paper.

===b. Bind a blank book using at least four signatures and a permanent cloth hard board binding, using a &quot;case&quot; method. ===
Follow the steps outlined and illustrated in requirement 7, using four signatures of blank pages.

===c. The proper way to &quot;break-in&quot; a new binding.===
A new book should be opened first a few pages from the front cover and the pages should be pressed down.  Then it should be opened near the back cover and again, the pages should be pressed down.  Finally, it should be opened in a few places near the center.  If it is opened near the center first, the book's spine may be broken, and if this happens, the book will always want to open to that page.

===d. Make a &quot;slip case&quot; for your blank book of at least four signatures.===
A slip case can be made from a piece of poster board.  The first step is to measure the book and then draw the layout on the poster board as shown in the illustration:

[[image:Slipcase.jpg|thumb|600px|left|Layout of Slipcase]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
You will want to make the slip case slightly larger than the book's dimensions so that it can be easily inserted and removed.  Once the layout has been drawn on the poster board, cut it as shown in the drawing.  Then carefully make creases where the dotted lines are drawn.  You may use a bone folder to help in doing this, or you may use a ruler.  The folds must be crisp and accurate.

The design shown here calls for an extra fold-in which makes the slipcase walls double thick.  Apply a thin coat of glue to the inside surface of the fold-in, then fold it on top of the slipcase wall.  You may wish to let the glue dry at this point.  

Next, apply a light coat of white glue to the back side of tab 1, and another thin layer of glue to the back side of tab 3.  Do the same for the bottom tabs.  Then assemble the slip case by gluing tab 3 to tab 1, and then gluing tabs 1 and 3 to tab 2.  Clamp the tabs with clothes pins while the glue drys.  Do not insert your book into the slip case until the glue is completely dry, or you may transfer glue to your book!

Once the glue dries, the slip case is finished.  You may decorate the slip case using decoupage (see the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Decoupage|decoupage chapter]] for instructions) if you like, or some other method as you see fit.

==4. Identify and describe the uses for the following binder's tools:==
# A '''Bone folder''' is a tool for folding and creasing paper.  They are traditionally made from the leg bone of a cow or deer, but synthetic bone folders are also available.  Bone folders resemble letter openers.
# '''Kick press:''' a foot operated device used for tightly holding and compressing objects upon which work is being performed.  Presses have many uses in bookbinding.  A text block (that is, the bound pages that have yet to be attached to a cover), is held in a press when the spine is glued up.  It is returned to the press when the cover is attached, and the spine is shaped.
# '''Folding needle:''' a steel needle with a wooden handle sometimes used for working in tight spaces on book covers, such as on decorative corners made of metal (miters).  It is sometimes also used for scoring.
# '''Awls''' are tools with a sharp point at the end of a long shaft mounted in a handle.  They are used for making holes in various materials such as leather (used for book covers) and multiple layers of paper (as in a signature).
# '''Sewing frame:''' a structure upon which books are held while they are being hand-sewn.
# '''Squared card:''' a sheet of heavy stock with two cut edges which together make a 90° angle.  These are used in the same way a carpenter's square is used, that is, in making right angles.
# '''Punch:''' a device for punching holes in material.  These are like sharp tubes driven into the material and removing a usually circular portion.  The waste material goes inside the tube and is sometimes ejected out the top when completely filled.

==5. Define the difference of paper weight in relationship to a ream of paper.==
In countries that use United States paper sizes, a less direct measure known as '''basis weight''' is used in addition to or instead of grammage. The basis weight of paper is the density of paper expressed in terms of the mass of a ream of given dimensions and a sheet count. In the US system, the weight is specified in avoirdupois pounds and the sheet count of a paper ream is usually 500 sheets.  However, the mass specified is not the mass of the ream that is sold to the customer.  Instead, it is the mass of the uncut &quot;basis ream&quot; in which the sheets have some larger size. Often, this is a size used during the manufacturing process before the paper was cut to the dimensions in which it is sold. So, to compute the mass per area, one must know

* the mass of the basis ream,
* the number of sheets in that ream, and
* the dimensions of an &quot;uncut&quot; sheet in that ream.

The standard dimensions and sheet count of a ream vary according to the type of paper.  These &quot;uncut&quot; basis sizes are not normally labeled on the product, are not formally standardized, and therefore have to be guessed or inferred somehow from trading practice.  Historically, this convention is the product of pragmatic considerations such as the size of a sheet mold.

By using the same basis sheet size for the same type of paper, consumers can easily compare papers of differing brands. 20 pound bond paper is always lighter and thinner than 32 pound bond, no matter what its cut size. And 20 pound bond ''letter size'' and 20 pound bond ''legal size'' papers are the same weight paper having different cut size.

However, a sheet of common copy paper that has a basis weight of 20 pounds does not have the same mass as the same size sheet of coarse paper (newsprint).  In the former case, the standard ream is 500 sheets of 17 by 22 inch paper, and in the latter, 500 sheets of 24 by 36 inch paper.  Here are some basic ream sizes for various types of paper.  Units are inches except where noted.

?--&gt;

Sheets 17 by 22 inches can be cut into four 8½ by 11 inch sheets, a standard for business stationery known conventionally as ''letter sized paper''. So, the 17 by 22 inch ream became commonly used.  The 25 by 38 inch book-paper ream developed because such a size can easily be cut into sixteen 6 by 9 inch book-sized sheets without significant waste.

Early newsprint presses printed sheets 2 by 3 feet in size, and so the ream dimensions for newsprint became 24 by 36 inches, with 500 sheets to a ream. Newsprint was made from ground wood pulp, and ground wood hanging paper (wallpaper) was made on newsprint machines. Newsprint was used as wrapping paper, and the first paper bags were made from newsprint.  The newsprint ream standard also became the standard for packaging papers, even though in packaging papers kraft pulp rather than ground wood was used for greater strength.

Paper weight is sometimes stated using the &quot;#&quot; symbol.  For example, &quot;20#&quot; means &quot;20 pounds per basis ream of 500 sheets&quot;. 

When the density of a ream of paper is given in pounds, it is often accompanied by its &quot;M weight&quot;.  The M weight is the weight (in pounds) of 1000 cut sheets.  Paper suppliers will often charge by M weight, since it is always consistent within a specific paper size, and because it allows a simple weight calculation for shipping charges.

For example, a 500-sheet ream of 20# copy paper may specify &quot;10 M&quot;.  Therefore, 1000 sheets (or two reams) will weigh 10 lb (≈4.54 kg).

==6. Describe the color and properties of three types of adhesives using in the binding process and where they are used:==
# '''Hot melt animal glue''' has a brown to amber color range.  It is made from animal hide or bones and is often sold as crystallized flakes.  These flakes must be dissolved in hot water before they can be used.  The mixture must be heated to about 140°F, and will cool quickly.  Once the glue is removed from the heat source, it will become unworkable in about one minute.  However, animal glue can be reheated even years after its initial application and it will return to a workable state.  Thus, a book bound with animal glue can be repaired or rebound years later, as is often done with antique books.  Animal glues are often used in gluing up a book's spine.
# '''Casing-in paste''' is also known as PVA, white glue (such as Elmers), or carpenters glue (which is yellow).  These glues have a much longer working time than animal glues, but they also have disadvantages as well.  If a surface needs to be reglued, PVA must be completely removed from the surface first, because this type of glue will not stick to itself.  This type of glue is used to bond a text block to its cover.
# '''Resin glues''' also range from dark brown to amber, and are more commonly known as epoxies.  Epoxy is a two-part glue consisting of a resin and a hardener.  When mixed together in the proper proportions, the two compounds react chemically to form an incredibly strong bond.  This bond is often stronger than the materials being glued, and thus the saying, &quot;an epoxy joint is forever.&quot;  Resin glues can be used to finish the grain side of leather or impregnated in buckram covering materials.

==7. Know and list the five principal stages of hand binding: ==
===Preparing the Signatures===
To begin, make up the signatures.  This is done by folding the pages into halves, quarters, eighths, or sixteenths.  Folding standard 8.5&quot;x11&quot; pages into quarters works well, as does folding 11&quot;x17&quot; into eighths.  

If making a non-blank book, you need to print the pages in a certain way so that they appear in the proper order and right-side up.  Folding a sheet of paper into quarters will produce eight pages.  Try this on a blank sheet of paper first, number the pages, unfold, and look at how the pages orient themselves on the unfolded paper.  When making a blank book, this step can obviously be skipped.  You can also use the pictures below as a guide.  Note that with the quarto folding scheme, some of the pages need to be printed upside-down.
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Zinemaking-folding-quarto.png‎|&lt;center&gt;Quarto (one sheet, 8 pages)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Zinemaking-folding-folio4.png‎|&lt;center&gt;Folio (four sheets, 16 pages)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Zinemaking-folding-folio1.png|&lt;center&gt;Folio (one sheet, four pages)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Once the folding is done, the bone folder or a knife can be used to cut the folds apart at the top, bottom, and outer edge of the pages.  Do not cut the fold along the spine!  The signatures are then ready to be sewn, and the sewing will bind them to a cloth ''tape''.  An even number of signatures will place the final stitch on the same end of the book as the initial stitch, and this will help when it comes to tying it off.

[[image:Bookbinding_fold_signatures.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Folding the Signatures]]
[[image:Bookbinding_cut_folds.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Cut the Folds]]

===Sewing up the Signatures===
====Prepare the ''Tapes''====
Make three to five cloth strips about a half inch wide.  The length of these cloth strips should be a bit less than twice the width of the pages.  The cloth itself should be a fine cotton or linen.  An old pillowcase has been suggested, but any thin cloth will work.  These strips of cloth are called ''tapes''.  Fewer tapes will make the sewing process go faster, but more tapes will yield a better book.

====Stitching====
Mark one of the outside signatures to indicate where the tapes will lie as shown in the photograph.


[[image:Bookbinding_mark_signatures.jpg|300px|thumb|Mark the Signatures]]

Note that the photographs show a very dark thread being used.  This was done to make the thread easier to see for the purpose of illustrating the techniques.  When binding ''your'' book, you will want to use white thread so that it ''won't'' be easy to see in the finished book.  
Begin stitching by passing the needle and thread through the fold from the outside to the inside.  It will be easier to make the hole from the inside of the fold with either an awl or the needle, but the thread should pass from the outside to the inside.  This stitch should be made near the edge of the page, but not ''too'' near the edge.  Leave a couple of inches of thread so you can tie it off when all the sewing is done.  Then pass the needle back through the fold so that it comes out on the other side of the cloth tape.  Do not run the thread through the tape.  Pass the thread over the tape and back into the fold again.  Repeat this process until all the tapes are sewn to the signature.  Then slip the next signature between the tape and the first signature.  Catch the previous stitch as shown in the photograph, and begin stitching the second signature.  

[[image:Bookbinding_initial_stitch.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Making pilot holes in the signature]]
[[image:Bookbinding_catch_stitch.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Catching the Previous Stitch]]

Use the same technique for it as for the first signature.  Stitch in the rest of the signatures, tighten the thread, and tie it off.

===Gluing up the Back===
Once the signatures have been sewn together, pull the tapes tight and apply a thin layer of glue to the spine.  You can use a small artist's paint brush for this.  Work the glue into the cracks between the signatures, but do not let it go too deep or the pages will stick together when you try to open the finished book.  The book is then placed in a press, but you can use a heavy weight, two wooden boards and a few C-clamps, or a shop vise to get the same effect.  

If you use weights to compress the signatures, be careful not to glue the weights to the book's pages.  The idea is to squeeze the pages together as tight as possible while the glue sets.  

If you use wooden boards and C-clamps, sandwich the pages between the two boards and clamp them together with the C-clamps.

If using a shop vise, be sure to pad the vise's jaws so you do not damage the pages.  The glue will strengthen the spine and adhere the threads to the pages.  

[[image:Bookbinding_glue_spine.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Glue-up the Spine]]
[[image:Bookbinding_press_text_block.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Pressing the Text Block]]

The finished product from this stage is called a ''text block''.

===Attaching the Boards===
====Make the Boards====
The &quot;boards&quot; are the book's covers.  Use either a very stiff non-corrugated cardboard or eighth-inch mason board (available at most lumber yards).  [http://guidemagazine.org Guide Magazine] is usually shipped with cardboard liners, so if your church subscribes to it, ask your Junior Sabbath School teacher to save them for you.  Cut the boards such that they are slightly larger (about an eighth inch) than the text block on three sides.  Make sure the boards are square.

Next, get some heavy cloth or heavy paper - whatever you want to use as the outside surface of the book cover.  The remainder of this discussion assumes a cloth cover.  Lay the boards on the cloth with a gap between them.  The width of this gap should be equal to the width of the text block's spine plus triple the thickness of the boards (three eighths of an inch).  Mark the cloth around the boards leaving about a one-inch border.  Cut the cloth, and then clip the corners to within a quarter inch of the corners of the boards:

[[image:Bookbinding_cover_layout.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Laying out the cover]]

Coat the outside surface of the boards with a ''thin'', even layer of glue, lay them on the cloth, and stretch the cloth smooth.  Be sure the gap between the boards is as wide as the text block's spine plus three times the thickness of the boards.  Glue a strip of cloth across the spine, bridging the two boards.  You may also glue a piece of card stock on top of this strip of cloth to further strengthen the spine.  If you do not have card stock, a manila folder or an index card can be pressed into service instead.  This strip of card stock should be as long as the text block's spine.  Be careful not to glue the cover to your worktable.  Ideally, you do not want any of the glue to penetrate the cloth cover, but just in case, you may wish to place a large piece of plastic beneath the cloth when doing this (use the lid from a large plastic storage tub, a plastic bag, or cellophane wrap).  Now place as much weight on the boards as you can muster and leave it there until the glue dries.

====Attach the Covers====
When the glue dries from the previous step, remove it from the press (or remove the weights from the cover) and apply another thin layer of glue to the inside of the book cover.  Then fold the top of the cloth cover over and glue it in place.  Do the same for the bottom, and then fold over the left and right sides.  

Get some wax paper or some plastic and insert two layers of it beneath the first page of the text block.  Apply a thin layer of glue around the edge of the paper using a small paint brush.  It's OK to brush the glue onto the wax paper.  Cover all four edges of the text block, and then add a little more glue to hold down the tapes.  Spread out some more wax paper and turn the text block over onto it.  Repeat the processes for the back of the book, adding glue to the edges of the page.  When you have coated the edges of the back page with glue, remove the layer of waxpaper that the glue was brushed onto, but leave the first layer of waxpaper in place.  This layer will prevent the glue from bonding to the next page and keep moisture out of the rest of the book.

Now carefully lift the text block and place it on the back cover.  Be sure to center it well.  If you misalign it, carefully lift it off and make another attempt.  Now fold the front cover closed onto the front page and make sure the text block is well centered.  Finally, place the book back in the press again (or under a heavy weight) and shape the spine as best you can.  Then let the glue dry.  Don't be impatient at this point.  If the book still smells like glue when you're ready to remove it, it is still too soon, and removing it will cause the pages to wrinkle and curl.

===Finishing===
The &quot;finishing&quot; step in bookbinding pertains to books with leather covers.  The first step in finishing a leather-bound book is to go over the covers with a polishing tool to smooth out any irregularities.  The book can then be placed in a finishing press with a set of embossing plates which will embed a pattern in the cover.  (Alternately, the cover can be tooled by hand in the same way that a leather worker decorates leather.)  When the book comes out of the finishing press, it may be gilded - that is, have a design tooled into it with gold leaf.  Finally, the leather may be varnished.

==Historical Notes==
The Bookbinding honor was introduced in 1935, and discontinued in 1951.  It was reintroduced as an ''Antique Honor'' in 1986.  It was revised and returned to the Vocational category in 2002.

*normal intellect
*possible missing, overlapping, or webbing of the toes, clubfeet, hip dislocation, or underdeveloped ribs may occur

==Incidence==
*very rare

==Etiology==
*Unknown - may represent new mutations of an autosomal dominant trait or variable expression
*Genetic testing is highly recommended

==Genetics==
*located on chromosome 9q32

==Prognosis==

==What are Neural Tube Defects?==
*NTDs are serious birth defects that involve incomplete development of the brain, spinal cord, and/or protective coverings for these organs
*The cause of NTDs is not completely understood, but involves both environmental and genetic factors (multifactorial inheritance)
*Sometimes NTDs can occur as part of a larger chromosomal or malformation syndrome (like Meckel syndrome where other malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, polydactyly, renal cystic disease and eye defects may be seen)
*There are three types of NTDs:
**Anencephaly
***Infants born with anencephaly have underdeveloped brains, incomplete skulls, and usually survive only a few hours after birth
**Encephalocele
***Infants have a hole in the skull through which brain tissue protrudes; most affected infants do not survive or are severely mentally retarded.
**Spina bifida
***This is the most common NTD affecting approximately 1/1000 newborns in the U.S.
***It results from the failure of the spine to close properly during the first month of pregnancy. The precise cause of this defect is not completely understood.
***There are three types of spina bifida. In order of increasing severity, they are:
****Spina bifida occulta
*****Includes individuals with a spinal defect associated with a pigmented or hairy patch of skin as well as individuals with absence of one or two vertebral arches.
*****The first group shows an increased incidence of NTDs in offspring and siblings, but the second group (which is about 5% of the population) shows no evidence of any increased risk.
*****This form of spina bifida usually has no symptoms.
****Meningocele
*****This is the rarest form of spina bifida in which a cyst or lump consisting of membranes surrounding the spinal cord pokes through the open part of the spine.
*****The cyst can be removed by surgery, allowing for normal development.
****Myelomenigocele
*****This is the most severe form of spina bifida where the protruding cyst contains membranes surrounding the spinal canal, nerve roots of the spinal cord, and often the spinal cord itself.
*****Or there may be no cyst, but a fully exposed section of the spinal cord and nerves.
*****Surgery to close the back is generally performed within 24 hours after birth to reduce the risk for infection and to preserve the existing function in the spinal cord.
*****Individuals with more severe spina bifida usually have paralysis and need surgeries and other extensive medical care.
*****The severity of the paralysis is determined by the spinal nerves that are involved. In general, the higher the cyst on the back, the more severe the paralysis.
*****Often, children need to use crutches, braces, or wheelchairs due to mobility deficits.
*****The condition can also cause bowel and bladder complications.
***Some children with spina bifida have learning problems. They may have difficulty paying attention, expressing or understanding language, organizing, and grasping reading and mathematical concepts.
***Hydrocephalus can accompany severe spina bifida
****This is an accumulation of fluid in the brain
****Is it controlled by a surgical procedure called &quot;shunting&quot; where the fluid that builds up in the brain is redirected into the abdominal cavity
***Children with spina bifida may be more prone to developing latex allergies
*Recent studies show that folic acid, a water-soluble B vitamin, is one factor that may reduce the risk of having a baby with a NTD.
**A vitamin with 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day is recommended for most women. This is the same as 0.4 milligrams (mg).
**If a woman is at an increased risk of having a baby with a NTD, it is recommended that she take a higher dose of folic acid. This should be 4000 mcg of folic acid for 1-3 months before becoming pregnant. This is the same as 4.0 mg.
**Taking folic acid will not guarantee a healthy baby.
*Birth defects such as NTDs can occur in any family.
*Be aware that the patient may feel guilty if she did not take folic acid before her pregnancy.

==Quote Risks==
*Spina bifida is usually an isolated birth defect.
**95% of babies with NTDs are born to parents with no family history of the disorder.
**The incidence of a NTD in the population is 1/200 - 1/1000 (This is 0.1% - 0.5%).
*When NTDs do appear to run in the family, it does not follow any particular pattern of inheritance.
*Women with certain chronic health problems like diabetes and seizure disorders (treated with certain anticonvulsant medications have an increased risk of having a baby with a NTD. This risk is approximately 1/100 (MOD)
*If one sibling is affected, the recurrence risk is approximately 2-5% based on the population incidence (Harper).
*State the risk in both ways (2% risk of abnormality = 98% chance of healthy baby)

==Discuss the Screening Options for NTDs==
*Maternal Serum Screening, level II ultrasound, &amp; amniocentesis are three testing options that may tell you if your baby is at an increased risk for a NTD.

==Maternal Serum Screening==
*What is it?
**A blood test that measures three different substances in the mother's blood
***Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
***Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
***Unconjugated estriol (uE3)
**It is routinely offered between 14 and 22 weeks of pregnancy
***Most accurate when done between 16-18 weeks
**It is NOT a diagnostic test; it is a screening test
**It is a way to identify pregnancies at increased risk of certain abnormalities
***It is NOT an absolute diagnosis of a problem
**Women who are shown to be at a higher risk are then offered diagnostic testing
***Level II Ultrasound
***Amniocentesis
*What can it tell me?
**Triple screen suggests an increased risk for certain abnormalities in the fetus such as ONTDs.
***It also can indicate if there's an increase risk for Down Syndrome or Trisomy 18
***We have no reasons to suspect these may be an issue in the pregnancy, but the test will provide this information.
*What can it NOT tell me?
**Triple screen cannot confirm that your baby has a NTD or other defect
**It also cannot predict an increased risk for all birth defects
***Other trisomies, mental retardation, cleft lip, etc. are not included in screen.
*What does the procedure involve?
**The screening test is done with a routine maternal blood draw.
*How do the markers work?
**Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP):
***This is the marker primarily used to detect ONTDs
***It is a protein made by the fetal liver
***AFP is excreted into the fetal urine and amniotic fluid from where it is transferred across the placenta into the maternal blood.
***It is not known what AFP does
***It is present in higher concentrations when there is an ONTD because more AFP leads out into the amniotic fluid
***It is present in lower concentrations with Down syndrome for unknown reasons.
**Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG):
***This is the &quot;pregnancy hormone&quot; used in pregnancy tests
***Is it produced by the placenta
***The concentration is higher in Down syndrome for unknown reasons.
**Unconjugated estriol (uE3):
***UE3 is the most sensitive marker for Trisomy 18 (lower with Trisomy 18)
***It is a steroid produced by the fetus and placenta
***May be lower in Down syndrome for unknown reasons.
**MoM (Multiple of the Median):
***This is the ratio of the marker level in the client to the median marker level
***It allows us to compare your marker levels to the general population of pregnant women
***A computer program takes into account all of your specific circumstances and calculates your MoM
***1.0 MoM is the expected value
***If 2.0 MoM, then your concentrations are twice as high as expected
***No one has a perfect 1.0 MoM
*What does a &quot;Screen Positive&quot; test result mean?
**The test results are analyzed for patterns
**There are specific patterns of the three marker levels associated with an ONTD, Down Syndrome, or Trisomy 18
***ONTD = High AFP
***Down Syndrome = Low AFP, High hCG, Low uE3
***Trisomy 18 = Low AFP, Low hCG, Low uE3
**5-10% of women who undergo Triple Screen get abnormal results
**Only 3-5% of them will have an affected baby
**For ONTDs:
***Only the AFP marker is used
***If the concentration is &gt;2.5 MoM, the result is screen positive for ONTD
***The incidence of ONTD is 1-2 in 1000 fetuses
**For Down syndrome:
***If the risk figure is over 1 in 270, the result is screen positive for DS
***HCG is the most sensitive marker for DS
***The incidence of DS is 1 in 660 newborns
**For Trisomy 18:
***If the risk figure is over 1 in 100, the result is screen positive for TRI 18
***UE3 is the most sensitive marker for Trisomy 18
***The incidence of Trisomy 18 is 3 in 1,000 newborns
*Why might I have a &quot;Screen Positive&quot; result?
**The fetus has either an ONTD, DS, or Trisomy 18
**The fetus has a different chromosome abnormality or birth defect
**The variation in the level of the marker or markers is normal
**The gestational age is incorrect
***Underestimated in ONTDs (She is farther than she thought)
***Overestimated in DS (She is not as far along as she thought)
**There are multiple pregnancies (affects NTDs and DS results)
**Fetal demise (for NTD and Tri 18)
**Other causes of (+) for NTD:
***Abdominal wall defect
***Feto-maternal bleeding
***Finnish nephrosis (kidney disease)
**Other causes of (+) for Trisomy 18:
***X-linked icthyosis (scale-like skin due to steroid sulfatase deficiency)
*What does a &quot;Screen Negative&quot; test result mean?
**The pregnancy does not appear to be at an increased risk for ONTD, DS, or TRI 18
**This does NOT guarantee that the child will not have a birth defect
*How Accurate is this test?
**The detection rate is a measure of how sensitive the test is
***This is the chance of getting a screen (+) when the fetus is actually affected
***There is a 60% overall detection rate
***This means that 60 out of 100 affected pregnancies will be found by this test
**The false (+) rate is the chance of getting a (+) when the pregnancy is unaffected
***There is a 5% overall false (+) rate
***5 out of 100 unaffected pregnancies will screen (+)
***Of 100 women with normal babies, 5 will screen (+)
**More specifically:
***For ONTD:
****Detection rate is 85%
****False (+) rate is 1-3%
***For DS:
****Detection rate is 60-65%
****False (+) rate is 5%
****Higher detection rate and false (+) rate for women over age 35
***For Trisomy 18:
****Detection rate is 60-80%
****False (+) rate is ~0.5%
*How do I follow up on a &quot;Screen Positive&quot; result?
**For NTD:
***Confirm gestational age with ultrasound
***Offer genetic counseling, ultrasound, and amniocentesis (to measure AFP)
***If AFP is &lt;3.0 MoM and client is &lt;22 weeks, may repeat triple screen
***If AFP is &gt;3.0 MoM or client is &gt;22 weeks, offer level II ultrasound and/or amniocentesis
**For Down Syndrome or Trisomy 18:
***Confirm gestational age with ultrasound
***Offer genetic counseling, ultrasound, and amniocentesis
***DO NOT repeat screen unless initial screen was done before 14 weeks
**Unexplained screen (+) results may be associated with an increased risk for 3rd trimester complications
***These pregnancies should be monitored more closely

==Level II Ultrasound==
*At 18-20 weeks, a high resolution, targeted ultrasound examination can be done to carefully and specifically examine the baby's spine.
*This is noninvasive and may provide reassurance but cannot be used as a diagnostic tool.
**If no evidence of a NTD is seen, it cannot be guaranteed that the baby does not have a NTD.

==Amniocentesis==
*If the triple screen results indicate an increased risk for a NTD, one may choose to have an amniocentesis, which is a more invasive, but more diagnostic test.
*What is it?
**Procedure used to obtain a small sample of fluid from the fluid-filled sac that surrounds the fetus
**Performed at 15 weeks gestation or later
***15-18 weeks is optimal because it leaves the patient with options
***22 weeks is probably the latest it can be done leaving the option of elective abortion
**Amniotic fluid contains the fetus's urine as well as other cells from the skin, throat, and digestive tract
**Fluid is studied in the lab for abnormalities
*What can it tell me?
**Amnio can detect certain abnormalities in the fetus.
***Chromosome abnormalities
***NTDs (Spina Bifida)
**It can determine the sex of the baby.
*What can it NOT tell me?
**Amnio cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation.
***For example, congenital heart defects, cleft lip &amp; palate cannot be seen.
***Also the severity of the defect cannot be known from amnio.
*Exactly what does the procedure involve?
**Show figure of amniocentesis.
**You will lie down on your back with hands behind your head.
**Your abdomen will be cleaned with alcohol or iodine.
**A local anesthetic may be applied to your stomach.
**Ultrasound will be used to locate the position of the baby and the placenta and to find a safe spot for the needle.
**A long, thin needle will be inserted through the skin, into the uterus.
**The first few cc's of fluid will be discarded because they probably contain contamination from your cells.
**Then a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons) of fluid is removed and the needle is withdrawn.
**The procedure itself usually takes ~5 minutes.
**The baby will quickly replace the fluid that is removed.
**The baby's heartbeat will be monitored by ultrasound.
**Fluid will be sent to the lab and results are available in 1-2 weeks.
**There is a small possibility of lab error or lack of cell growth
***In this case, the procedure would have to be done again.
*What will it feel like?
**If an anesthetic is used, you may not feel the needle enter the skin, but you will still feel it enter the uterus.
**This is described as a sharp pain, like a menstrual cramp that usually lasts a few seconds.
**You may also feel some cramping after the procedure.
**You should avoid strenuous activity for 24 hours after the procedure.
**Call your doctor immediately if you experience abdominal pain or cramps, vaginal bleeding, leakage of clear fluid from the vagina, fever, or anything else unusual.
***Approximately 2% of women experience light bleeding or spotting.
*What are the risks?
**The risk of miscarriage is between 1/400 and 1/200.
**This means that the added risk for pregnancy loss attributable to the procedure is 0.5% or less.
**There is a risk of uterine infection but this is less than 1 in 1,000
**There is a remote chance that birth defects can be caused by the amnio (0.1%).
**There are special considerations for mothers who are Rh negative. They need to take RhoGam after the amnio procedure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Neurofibromatosis - Type 1'''

==Contracting/Introduction==
*What is your understanding about why you were referred to genetics?
*What are your main concerns or questions?
*Outline session
**I will first ask you some questions about your family history and _____'s medical history
**Then Dr. _____ will examine ______
**We will discuss what we know at that point about whether or not a diagnosis can be made and we will answer any questions you might have.

==Elicit Family History==
*Family history can be helpful in determining if there is something in the family that might be inherited
*Some of the things I'm looking for in your family history include:
**Birth defects
**History of pregnancy losses
**learning difficulties or MR
**chronic health problems
**unusual skin findings or birth marks
**hearing loss
**underarm freckling
**scoliosis
**seizures
**vision loss
**anyone who died at a young age or unexpectedly
**Anything else that you think might be running in your family

==Incidence of NF1==
*NF1 is estimated to affect 1/3,500 people in the population
*Affects both sexes and all racial and ethnic groups equally

==Clinical Features==
*Clinical features are extremely variable both between and within families
*Not all of the features are present in individuals with NF1
*Skin:
**Café-au-lait spots in ~94% of patients
**Axillary or inguinal freckling- common after 3 years of age
**Xanthogranulomas (2-5%)
**Hemangiomas (5-10%)
*Eye:
**Optic glioma (often present at birth; occurs in 10-15% of patients)
**Lisch nodules- pigmented iris hamartomas (100% after the age of 20)
*Tumors
**Neurofibromas- benign tumors arising from nerve cells that can occur anywhere in the body and are often associated with the skin.
**Plexiform neurofibromas- tumors along nerve bundle tracts, can be large and usually appear at birth or early in childhood (occur in ~25%)
**Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors arise in ~2-4% of individuals
**Pheocromocytoma, rhabdomyoma, neuroblastoma (rare)
**Myelogenous leukemia (rare)
*Neurological:
**Headaches occur in &gt;10% of patients
**Seizures and/or EEG abnormalities occur in ~20%
**Seizures 6-7%
**Hydrocephalus occurs in ~5% of individuals
**Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in ~5% of patients
**Precocious puberty (2-5%)
*Orthopedic:
**Scoliosis
**Hypoplastic bowing of lower legs, with pseudoarthrosis at birth
**Short stature
**Macrocephaly
*Cardiovascular:
**Hypertension (2-5%)
**Congenital heart defect (2%)
*Cognitive:
**Developmental delay
**Learning disabilities- hyperactivity and/or speech problems occur in 50%
**Mental retardation (8% of patients)
*Other-occasional:
**Syndactyly
**Glaucoma
**Ptosis
**Pruritis

==Diagnostic Criteria==
(clinical diagnosis based on a number of clinical findings)
*NF1 is present in an individual who has two or more of the following signs:
**Six or more café au lait macules &gt;5 mm in prepubertal individuals or &gt;15 mm after puberty
**Two or more neurofibromas of any type, or one+ plexiform neurofibromas
**Freckling in the axilla or inguinal regions
**A tumor of the optic pathway (optic glioma)
**Two or more Lisch nodules
**Long bone bowing (w/ or w/o pseudarthrosis)
**A first-degree relative with NF1 by the above criteria

==Natural History and Life Span: NF1==
*Although the medical literature and the internet tend to show the most severe cases, approximately 2/3 have only mild or moderate involvement throughout their lifespan
*Lifespan is dependent on severity and types of symptoms, but it has been shown in one study that the average life expectancy of patients with NF1 can be reduced by at least 15 years overall
*Decreased lifespan has been associated with the following features:
**Malignant peripheral sheath tumors
**Acute hydrocephalus
**Severe seizure
**Progressive spinal plexiform neurofibromas
*Frequency of more serious complications increases with age
*Various manifestations of NF1 have different characteristic times of appearance
*Since characteristic features often develop with age, if NF1 is suspected it is often necessary to continue to follow them for a while before the diagnosis can be ruled out completely
*Infancy:
**Café-au-lait spots
**Long bone bowing
**Developmental delay
**Optic glioma
**Plexiform neurofibroma
*Childhood:
**Neurofibromas
**Freckling patterns
**Learning disabilities
**Scoliosis
**Hypertension
*Adolescence:
**Worsening of existing condition
**Rarely malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors develop
*Adulthood:
**Increase in neurofibromas
**Hypertension
**If other symptoms have not developed, they may do so at this time
*Pregnancy:
**most pregnancies in women with NF1 are normal but serious complications can occur
**Many women with NF1 experience a rapid increase in the number and size of neurofibromas during pregnancy
**Hypertension may first become symptomatic or, if pre-existing, may become worse
**Large pelvic or genital neurofibromas can complicate delivery
**cesarean section appears to be necessary more often in pregnant women with NF1 than in other women.

==Counseling==
**NF1 gene located on long arm of chromosome 17q11.2
**NF1 gene is classified as a tumor suppressor gene, however the gene has other functions that are not as well defined
**In about 50% of individuals with NF 1 it was inherited from an affected parent and the other half are due to a new mutation not already present in the family
**If a person has this gene they will almost certainly show some signs or characteristics, but these may not be obvious and it is possible for a person to go undiagnosed (nearly 100% penetrant, but variable expressivity)
**The gene is very large which is consistent with the number of patients with NF1 that were due to a new mutation
**Gene encodes for a protein called neurofibromin (believed to act as tumor suppressor, but probably also has other functions)
*Autosomal Dominant inheritance
**Autosomal means it is on a chromosome other than sex chromosome
**Dominant means only one altered copy of this gene is necessary to develop symptoms and characteristics
*Risk assessment:
**For affected individuals 50% risk for each pregnancy to be affected, although clinical expression is variable
**For unaffected parents the recurrence risk is (&lt;1%) (germline mosaicism in one man reported)

==Provide patient literature==

==Testing==
*Families with two or more affected individuals can use linkage analysis to identify carriers of the disease causing NF1 gene
*Sporadic cases require direct mutational analysis of the gene, if presymptomatic testing is desired
*DNA testing by protein truncation is available but rarely used for diagnosis (reported to detect 70% of mutations, but not firmly established)
*Mutation may be missed due to large size of gene and many mutations possible
*FISH can be used to detect microdeletions of chromosome 17q11.2
*Individuals with large deletions tend to have mental retardation and an increased tumor burden (approximately 5% of individuals with NF1 have whole gene deletions)

==Prenatal testing==
*Possible if there is a known mutation or via linkage studies if enough affected family members
*It is not often used

==Genotype/phenotype correlation==
*Differences seen even in members of same family suggest some randomness to some of features.
*Two-hit hypothesis supports these findings
*However, there are some similarities of phenotype seen in

==Management and Treatment Options==
*Individuals should be placed on surveillance programs
**Annual physical examination by a physician who is familiar with NF1
**Annual ophthalmological examination in childhood, less frequent examination in adults
**Regular developmental assessment by screening questionnaire
**Regular blood pressure monitoring
**Other studies only as indicated on the basis of clinically apparent signs or symptoms (HOWEVER, some centers do MRI on newly diagnosed patients though)
*Treatment includes treating the symptoms as they occur
**Learning difficulties: appropriate school placement, IEP
**Dermal neurofibromas: surgically remove if they are symptomatic
**Early recognition of long bone bowing can be accompanied with braces (which may help prevent fractures)
**MRI's should be scheduled to screen for optic gliomas
**Ophthalmologic exam to look for Lisch nodules
**Bracing for scoliosis
**Meds for seizures and headaches

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Overlap primarily lies in cutaneous features, especially café-au-lait spots
*Neurofibromatosis 2 (bilateral acoustic neuromas, tumors of cranial nerves and spinal roots, skin manifestations less frequent than in NF1)
*Multiple café-au-lait spots (an autosomal dominant trait without other features of neurofibromatosis)
*LEOPARD syndrome (multiple lentigines, ocular hypertelorism, deafness, congenital heart disease)
*McCune-Albright syndrome (large café-au-lait spots with irregular margins, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia)
*Noonan syndrome (short stature, unusual facies, pulmonic stenosis)
**A Noonan syndrome phenotype occurs in about 12% of patients with NF1 and features may include ocular hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, low-set ears, webbed neck, and pulmonic stenosis
*Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (mucosal neuromas, conjunctival neuromas, pheochromocytoma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, marfanoid habitus)
*Multiple lipomatosis (multiple cutaneous lipomas)
*Bannayan-Ruvalcaba-Riley syndrome (multiple lipomas and hemangiomas, macrocephaly, spotted pigmentation of the glans penis).
*Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (multiple subcutaneous tumors, gingival fibromatosis)
*Congenital generalized fibromatosis (multiple tumors of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, skeletal muscle, bones, and viscera) Multiple intradermal nevi (multiple cutaneous tumors)
*Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (cutaneous hemangiomas, varicose veins, aterio-venous fistulas, and hemi-hypertrophy
*Proteus syndrome (regional overgrowth, hyperpigmentation, multiple lipomas)

*Chromosome location:
**The gene for NF1 is located at chromosome 17q11.2
**The gene is very large, which is consistent with the large mutation rate

**Axillary or inguinal freckling- common after 3 years of age
**Xanthogranulomas (2-5%)
*Eye:
**Optic glioma (often present at birth; occurs in 10-15% of patients)
**Lisch nodules- pigmented iris hamartomas (100% after the age of 20)
*Neurological:
**Neurofibromas- benign tumors arising from nerve cells that can occur anywhere in the body and are often associated with the skin.
**Plexiform neurofibromas- tumors along nerve bundle tracts, can be large and usually appear at birth or early in childhood (occur in ~25%)
**Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors arise in ~2-4% of individuals
**Headaches occur in &gt;10% of patients
**Seizures and/or EEG abnormalities occur in ~20%
**Hydrocephalus occurs in ~5% of individuals
**Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in ~5% of patients
**Precocious puberty (2-5%)
*Orthopedic:
**Scoliosis
**Hypoplastic bowing of lower legs, with pseudoarthrosis at birth
**Short stature
**Macrocephaly
*Cognitive:
**Developmental delay
**Learning disabilities- hyperactivity and/or speech problems occur in 50%
**Mental retardation (8% of patients)
*Other-occasional:
**Syndactyly
**Glaucoma
**Ptosis
**Pruritis

==Risk of Occurrence/Recurrence==
*The risk for an affected individual to have a child with NF1 is 50%
*The risk for each additional pregnancy is also 50%

==Natural History and Life Span==
*Infancy:
**Café-au-lait spots
**Long bone bowing
**Developmental delay
**Optic glioma
**Plexiform neurofibroma
*Childhood:
**Neurofibromas
**Freckling patterns
**Learning disabilities
**Scoliosis
**Hypertension
*Adolescence:
**Worsening of existing condition
**Rarely malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors develop
*Adulthood:
**Increase in neurofibromas
**Hypertension
**If other symptoms have not developed, they may do so at this time
*Decreased lifespan has been associated with the following features:
**Malignant peripheral sheath tumors
**Acute hydrocephalus
**Severe seizure
**Progressive spinal plexiform neurofibromas

==Testing==
*Families with two or more affected individuals can use linkage analysis to identify carriers of the abnormal gene NF1
*Sporadic cases require direct mutational analysis of the gene, if presymptomatic testing is desired
*FISH can be used to detect microdeletions of chromosome 17q11.2
*Individuals with large deletions tend to have mental retardation and an increased tumor burden (approximately 5% of individuals with NF1 have whole gene deletions)

==Management and Treatment Options==
*Individuals should be placed on surveillance programs
*Treatment includes treating the symptoms as they occur
**Learning difficulties: appropriate school placement, IEP
**Dermal neurofibromas: surgically remove if they are symptomatic
**Early recognition of long bone bowing can be accompanied with braces (which may help prevent fractures)
**MRI's should be scheduled to screen for optic gliomas
**Ophthalmologic exam to look for Lisch nodules
**Bracing for scoliosis
**Meds for seizures and headaches

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Overlap primarily lies in cutaneous features, especially café-au-lait spots
**Consider: Russell-Silver, Bloom, Noonan, and Watson syndromes.
*For neurofibromas, consider:
**Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Carney syndrome, Proteus syndrome etc.

==Additional Psychosocial Issues==
*Risk for increased emotional and social problems
*Self-esteem issues associated with cosmetic concerns
*Reproductive concerns
*For parents, guilt issues as well as blame issues

==Introduction==
*Acknowledge any prior phone contact
*Assess their knowledge and understanding about Niemann-Pick disease
*Assess their concerns and ask what they want to discuss today

==Intake==
*Elicit medical history
*Elicit family history
*Construct pedigree

==Natural History==

===What is Niemann-Pick disease?===
*A group of rare inherited disorders of fat metabolism (three main types with subdivisions)
*Type A (acute infantile form) and Type B (chronic, non-neurological form): caused by excessive amounts of a fatty substance (sphingomyelin) that accumulates in the brain, central nervous system, and several visceral organs (liver, spleen, lungs). This is due to a deficiency of the enzyme sphingomyelinase, which breaks down the fat from the cell membrane products created by the normal turnover of cell death.
*Type C (biochemical form): is a lipid storage disorder that results in the accumulation of excessive amounts of cholesterol within the cells of the liver, spleen, and brain. This is due to the cell's inability to transport the cholesterol properly during esterification reactions. It causes progressive deterioration of the nervous system.

===What are the symptoms?===
*Type A: this is the most common form of the disease (80%). Most of the infants appear normal at birth, and then develop symptoms by 6-12 months. There is a gradual decline of motor and intellectual function resulting in a degenerative muscle weakness and floppiness. The severity of the symptoms increases rapidly and life-threatening complications may occur early in childhood. The fat accumulation is so severe that it may represent 2-5% of the body weight.
*the fat accumulation in various parts of the body occurs in the developing fetus
*hepatosplenomegaly
*lymphadenopathy
*abnormalities of the nervous system (profound MR)
*poor feeding
*edema and distention - abdominal swelling
*vomiting and diarrhea
*failure to thrive
*pyrexia - fever
*macula - bright red spots in the eyes (50%)
*jaundice
*Type B: begins in infancy or early childhood. These symptoms progress more slowly and there is minimal nervous system *involvement
*hepatosplenomegaly
*bright red spots in the eyes
*increased susceptibility to lung infections
*slow growth rate
*Type C: the disease may strike anytime from early infancy to adulthood, but usually affects school-age children
*fetal ascites or neonatal liver disease
*jaundice at birth
*infantile hypotonia
*developmental delay
*hepatosplenomegaly
*vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (VSGP) - difficulty with upward or downward eye movements
*ataxia - unsteady gait, clumsiness, difficulty walking
*dystonia - difficulty in the posturing of limbs
*dysarthria - slurred, irregular speech {these two eventually become disabling,
*dysphagia - difficulty swallowing making oral feeding impossible}
*dementia - learning disorders and progressive intellectual decline
*cataplexy - sudden loss of muscle tone, causing abrupt falls
*seizures and tremors accompanying movement

===What is the prognosis?===
*Type A: death usually occurs by 4 years of age
*Type B: the earliest diagnosed patients are now middle-aged without neurological impairment
*Type C: death usually occurs in the late 2nd or 3rd decade (aspiration pneumonia is often the cause)

==Genetic Etiology==

===Mode of Inheritance===
*autosomal recessive
*both parents carriers: ¼ affected, 2/4 carriers, ¼ unaffected
*males and females affected in equal numbers
*this means that no family history of the disease is the norm

===Chromosome location===
*Type A and Type B: SMPD1 (ASM) gene on locus 11p15.1-15.4
*Type C: NPC1 gene is on locus 18q11-q12
*NPC2 gene is on locus 14q24.333

===Molecular genetics===
*Type A: in non-Jewish populations, many different mutations have been detected in Jewish populations, 1/3 of the people have a R496L point mutation
*Type B: in non-Jewish populations, many different mutations have been detected in Jewish populations, a 3 base pair deletion &amp;#916;R608 is either homozygous or heterozygous with R496L
*it's not possible to predict the severity by enzyme testing
*Type C: 95% of patients have mutations in the NPC1 gene (clinical tests available)
*5% of patients have mutations in the NPC2 gene (research basis only)
*the exact gene defect is not known, as mutation scanning has identified most patients as compound heterozygotes with mutations unique to their family (over 100 mutations so far)
*the individuals with Nova Scotia ancestry (Type D) almost uniformly have a G992W mutation on NPC1

===Expression===
*The phenotype (age of onset and severity of symptoms) usually runs true in families
*Type C: &quot;classic&quot; patients have zero or very low esterification levels with a positive staining pattern, while &quot;variant&quot; patients (about 15%) have intermediate levels of cholesterol esterification and a less distinctive staining pattern

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*Type A: identified in people of all races
*higher incidence in: Ashkenazi Jew ancestry (between 1:20,000 and 1:30,000)
*carrier frequency: 1:90 to 1:100
*Type C: rare, with 300 reported cases in the United States and 1 in a million worldwide
*affects all populations with a prevalence 1:150,000 (est. in western Europe)
*no accurate info. on true incidence or carrier frequency
*higher incidence in: French Canadians in Nova Scotia (Type D)
*Hispanic ancestry in NM and CO (Rio Grande River)
*Bedouin group in Israel {Founder Effect}

==Testing==

===Diagnostic===
*Type A and Type B: blood testing - enzyme assay confirms a deficiency of the enzyme sphingomyelinase in the leukocytes (and a biopsy of the bone marrow will show abnormal foam cells)
*Type C: biochemical test - skin biopsy taken and the fibroblasts are tested for their ability to handle cholesterol (esterification studies to test impaired cell transport and filipin fluorescent staining studies to test cell storage)
biochemical testing is used to diagnose; molecular genetic testing is primarily used to confirm diagnosis in &quot;variant&quot; patients
*{Note: The diagnosis of often delayed because many clinicians do not realize that the absence of organomegaly doesn't rule out storage diseases and because &quot;routine&quot; tests for metabolic disease, such as urine screens and lysosomal enzyme panels, are normal in NPC.}

===Carrier===
*Type A: partial deficiency in sphingomyelinase activity in cultured fibroblasts indicates the heterozygote state
*Type C: carrier detection is not yet reliable using standard biochemical tests molecular analysis of the NPC1 gene may be used if proband mutations have been identified

===Prenatal===
*Type A and Type B: available by amnio or CVS to measure the enzyme activity
*Type C: prenatal diagnosis available through amniocentesis or CVS for pregnancies at 25% risk
*biochemical testing is the proband has a &quot;classical&quot; biochemical phenotype, but not if the proband has a &quot;variant&quot; *biochemical phenotype
*molecular genetic testing if the proband as identified mutations in the NPC1 gene

===Laboratories===
*Type A: Genzyme Genetics: http://www.genzymegenetics.com/Our-Services/Reproductive-Testing/niemann-pick-disease-type-a-testing.aspx
*Carrier testing for Ashkenazi Jewish individuals
*Prenatal diagnosis for carrier couples with identified mutations
*Genzyme's Niemann-Pick disease type A mutation analysis tests for 3 mutations for a 95% carrier detection rate in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
*Specimen Requirements:
**1. Blood: ACD-A (yellow-top) or EDTA (lavender-top) tube. Adult: 10 ml whole blood; 30 ml whole blood if ordering multiple tests. Turnaround Time: 10-14 days.
**2. Mouthwash: Please Note: Patient should not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum for at least one hour prior to collection. (See specimen kit for detailed instructions). Mouthwash samples can be sent when ordering up to two tests. When ordering more than two tests, blood samples are required. 10 ml of Scope® mouthwash that has been swished vigorously for at least 1 minute. Collect in orange-top 50 ml polypropylene tube. Turnaround Time: 10-14 days.
**3. Prenatal: Please Note: Call a laboratory genetic coordinator prior to obtaining any prenatal specimens. Prenatal testing is recommended only for carrier couples with identified mutations. In some circumstances, specimens from other family members may be required. All prenatal specimens (including cord blood) must be accompanied by a maternal blood or mouthwash specimen for analysis of possible maternal cell contamination. Discard first 2 ml; then 10 ml amniotic fluid in 15 ml orange-top polypropylene tube, 10-15 mg chorionic villi in laboratory-provided screw-top tubes with sterile transport medium or one T-25 flask of confluent fetal cells. Additional specimen must be obtained for back-up culture at one of our cytogenetics laboratories or another facility. If additional testing is desired, more amniotic fluid is needed. For example, chromosome analysis requires an additional 15-25 ml ('''see Cytogenetics – Amniotic Fluid Chromosome Analysis test page''': http://www.genzymegenetics.com/Our-Services/Reproductive-Testing/amniotic-fluid-testing.aspx) and AFAFP requires an additional 2 ml ('''see Amniotic Fluid Alpha-Fetoprotein - AFAFP test page''': http://www.genzymegenetics.com/Our-Services/Reproductive-Testing/afafp-test.aspx). Turnaround Time: 10-14 days (when cell culture required, add ~2 weeks).

(Type A)

==Background==
*Niemann-Pick disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a lysosomal storage disorder. A deficiency in acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity results in the accumulation of sphingomyelin.

==Genetics==
*Caused by mutation in ASM gene
*Chromosomal location 11p15.1-p15.4
*18 causal mutations mapped
*3 mutations account for 92% of Ashkenazi Jewish (R496L, L302P, and fsP330)

*Within Ashkenazi Jewish population:
*Incidence: 1 in 40,000
*Carrier frequency: 1 in 90

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical-

==Introduction and contracting==
*What is your primary concern
*Do you have any questions for us today
*What are your expectations for your visit today

==Outline the session==
*We will be taking medical history information
*Dr. ___ will come in to perform a physical examination
*We will be discussing if we think there is a diagnosis that can be made at this time
*If a diagnosis is made we will explain the inheritance and information we know about the cause

==Medical history==
(follow form)

==Overview of Noonan Syndrome==
*Common autosomal dominant, single gene
*Mistakenly called male Turner syndrome due to similar characteristics
*Occurs in both males and females equally

==Characteristics of Noonan Syndrome==
*Short stature
*Congenital heart defects
*Broad or webbed neck
*Unusual chest shape (low set nipples, superior pectus carinatum, inferior pectus excavatum)
*Developmental delay
*Cryptorchidism
*Characteristic physical appearance changes over time

==Features irrespective of age==
*Low set posteriorly rotated ears with thick helix (90%)
*Vivid blue or blue-green eyes (lighter than expected for background)
*thickened or ptotic eyelids
*hypertelorism

==Neonate and Infancy==
(age features are most striking)
*tall forehead
*hypertelorism with downslant palpebral fissures (95%)
*prominent eyes
*Nose has depressed root, wide base, bulbous tip
*Deeply grooved philtrum
*High wide peaks to vermillion border of upper lip
*Excess nuchal skin and low posterior hairline

==Children==
*Facial appearance lacks expression (resembles individual with myopathy)

==Adolescence==
*Facial shape inverted triangle, wide forehead tapered chin
*Pinched nasal root and thin bridge
*Neck lengthens accentuates skin webbing or trapezius muscle
*Eyes less prominent
*Curly or wooly hair in older child

==Adult==
*Nasolabial folds prominent
*Skin appears transparent and wrinkled
**Genetics of Noonan syndrome
***missense mutations in gene PTPN11 at 12q24.1 identified in 50% of patients
***gene identified in 2001 (normal gene encodes protein-tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 seems to be essential in several intracellular signal transduction pathways controlling diverse developmental processes
***absence of this mutation in some families suggests heterogeneity
***AD single gene
***50% chance to pass on if affected
***if parents not affected chance is low &lt;1% (gene clinics)
***direct transmission reported 30-75% of time rest are de novo
***predominantly mothers not fathers transmit gene (3:1 ratio) (likely due to cryptorchidism and reduced fertility in males)

==Prevalence==
*1/1000-1/2,500

==Diagnostic testing==
*Testing for PTPN11 mutations available on research basis
*Diagnosis based on clinical findings though
*High-resolution ultrasound only prenatal test available

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Turner syndrome in females should be ruled out through karyotype
*Trisomy 8p, trisomy 22 mosaicism, sex chromosome rearrangement, in utero exposure to alcohol or primidone
*Williams, Aarskog, Baraitser-Winter, Costello syndromes share some features
*Multiple lentigines/LEOPARD syndrome can also have pulmonary valve dysplasia, cardiomyopathy, short stature, hypertelorism, pectus deformity, hearing loss, developmental delay
*Watson syndrome shares pulmonary valve stenosis, short stature, mild intellectual handicap, café-au-lait patches
*Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome lot of overlap and debate about whether same condition, but MR more severe, skin findings hyperkeratosis, ichthyosis, absent eyebrows, sparse hair, gastrointestinal problems more severe, eyes rarely characteristically light blue/ blue-green

==Cause of characteristics==
*Hypothesized to be consequences of lymphatic obstruction

==Growth and feeding==
*B.W. usually normal
*15% have poor suck, 38% poor suck and vomiting, 24% require tube feeding 2 weeks or more
*length at birth normal usually then follows 3% ile
*final height lower end of normal in adults
*some endocrinologists choose to treat with growth hormone even if deficiency not seen

==Development and behavior==
*Delayed milestones
*Mean age sitting 10 mth, walking 21 mth, two-word sentence 31 mth
*10-15 % require special ed
*IQ usually within normal range, but mild MR seen in 1/3
*Verbal lower than nonverbal performance
*Usually good peer, social interactions and self-esteem, but one study suggests that less socially competent and more behavior problems than sibs (not clinically significant)

==Ears and hearing==
*May cause delayed speech
*Reported in &gt;1/3 usually secondary to ottitis media
*Sensorineural loss in 3%

==Cardiovascular==
*Potential bias in frequency due to requirement for diagnosis by many (50-80%)
*Stenotic or dysplastic pulmonary valve most common (20-50%)
*7% of all children with pulmonary stenosis have Noonan
*hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (20-30%) found at birth, infancy or childhood
*ASD (10-20%)

*Other problems common

==Blood/ liver spleen==
*1/3 have coagulation problems
*2/3 give history of abnormal bleeding or mild-severe bruising
*hepatosplenomegaly occurs reason unknown(clinically evident 25% ultrasound 51%)
*should avoid aspirin

==various lymphatic abnormalities described==

==Genitourinary==
*Renal abnormalities (generally mild 11%)
*Cryptorchidism in 60-80% of males may cause deficient spermatogenesis
*Fertility is rule in females

==Skin==
*Follicular keratosis
*Scalp hair curly, thick and wooly, or sparse with easy breakage
*Café-au-lait spots and lentigines more frequent than general population

==Management if suspected==

(a.k.a. Goldenhar Syndrome, Oculoauriculovertebral Dysplasia, OAV Syndrome, Facio-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum, First &amp; Second Branchial Arch Syndrome)

==Overview==
*a condition that affects the growth of the face
*predominantly unilateral and involves the ear, mouth, and mandible (jaw)
*about 15% have bilateral involvement though
*extremely variable with many transitional forms affecting different systems
*term Goldenhar syndrome used when the spine and the eye (epibulbar dermoids which are benign tumors located just inside the opening of the eye or the eyeballs and can cause vision problems) are involved

==Etiology==
*unknown etiology, but is usually sporadic
*However, a few cases have had a positive family history suggesting autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or multifactorial inheritance
*thought to be caused by abnormal changes in blood vessels and the disruption of the blood supply during embryonic development (early vascular disruption) at about 30-45 days of gestation
*results in the destruction of differentiating tissue in the first and second branchial arches, from which certain ligaments and bones of the face, parts of the skull, and the middle ear develop
*amount of damage depends on timing of vascular disruption and degree of tissue destruction
*No DNA abnormality has been identified
*However, it has also been noted that certain teratogens (Thalidomide, Primidone, and Accutane) have produced birth defect patterns that are similar to the HFM spectrum.
*rate of Goldenhar Syndrome found in the children of Gulf War veterans was 4 X's as high as in general population (ABDC collected data) 15 cases when 4 were expected (http://www.widesmiles.org/syndrom/hmsgold/gulfwar.html)

==Recurrance Risks==
(Unless autosomal dominant pattern found which can be in Goldenhar)
*chances of having another child with Hemifacial Microsomia or Goldenhar are less than 1%
*affected person has an approximately 3% chance of passing it on to their children

==Incidence==
*The frequency of occurrence is estimated to be 1 in 3000 to 1 in 5000, and there is a slight male predominance (3:2).

==Clinical Features==
*Key features:
**Facial - asymmetry (90%). . .right side predominance (62%)
**hypoplasia of malar, maxillary, and/or mandibular region
**macrostomia (lateral cleft-like extension of the corner of the mouth)
**hypoplasia of the facial musculature
**frontal bossing
**Ear - microtia (malformation of the external ear from complete aplasia to a crumpled, distorted
**pinna which is displaced anteriorly and inferiorly) (65%)
**accessory preauricular tags and/or pits
**middle ear anomaly with variable deafness
**Eye - palpebral fissure is somewhat lowered on the affected side
**Oral - diminished to absent parotid secretion
**anomalies in function or structure of the tongue
**malfunction of the soft palate
*Associated findings: 
**prenatal growth deficiency, feeding difficulties
**Vertebral - hemivertebrae or hypoplasia of vertebrae, usually cervical (40-60%)
**Eye - epibulbar dermoid and/or lipodermoid
**strabismus
**unilateral coloboma of the superior lid
**microphthalmia
**Oral - cleft lip, cleft palate (7%)
**Cardiac - various forms of heart disease (45-55%)
**ventricular septal defect
**patent ductus arteriosus
**tetralogy of Fallot
**coarctation of the descending aorta
**Lung - pulmonary agenesis or hypoplasia of the lung
**Renal - ectopic and/or fused kidneys
**renal agenesis
**double ureter
**Nervous - mental retardation (10%)
**occipital encephalocele
**hydrocephalus
**agensis of corpus callosum

==Natural History==
*Hemifacial Microsomia is congenital and most of the physical characteristics are apparent at birth.
*However, the facial asymmetry may not become apparent until the child grows (usually by four years of age).

==Potential Medical Concerns==
*lack of the development of the upper and lower jaws can cause breathing problems as well as a dental malocclusion which will need to be addressed surgically and orthodontically

==Testing==
*Diagnosis is clinical due to lack of understanding exact cause and probably usually more due to environmental factors
*Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound may be possible if there is severe hypoplasia of the mandible or severe abnormality of the ear

==Development and Learning==
*Most of these patients have normal intelligence

==Management==
*Deafness should be tested for at an early age, and speech therapy is often necessary
*Help may be required for feeding problems and encouraging weight gain in early infancy
*Any congenital heart defects may require surgery
*Plastic surgery may be used to reconstruct the ear, and bone distraction techniques are available to artificially lengthen the jaw bone to improve growth on the face.
*Children may also need ongoing orthodontic treatment.

==Differential Diagnoses==
*Treacher-Collins Syndrome-AD inheritance characterized by facial cleft, hypoplasia of the cheeks and mandible bilaterally, colobomas (or congenital scar) of the eyelids, downward-sloping palpebral fissures, poorly developed supraorbital rims and cheek, receding chin, malformation of the ear
*CHARGE Association
*VACTERL Association
*Townes-Brocks Syndrome
*Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) Syndrome
*Chromosomal disorders (including Trisomy 9 Mosaicism, Trisomy 18, Ring 21 Chromosome, and Trisomy 22)
*Teratogen exposure

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Assess development.
*Feeding problems?
*Are they seeking a diagnosis?
*Why would a diagnosis be helpful to them?
*How do other people react is there any teasing by others?
*How do they feel about the public's response to the facial abnormalities?
*Would they like to talk with other families going through the same thing?
*How can we be helpful to them?

(a.k.a. Goldenhar Syndrome, Oculoauriculovertebral Dysplasia, OAV Syndrome, Facio-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum, First &amp; Second Branchial Arch Syndrome)

==Introduction==
*Hemifacial Microsomia is a condition that affects the growth of the face. It is predominantly unilateral and involves the ear, mouth, and mandible. This disorder is extremely variable with many transitional forms affecting different systems (for example, Goldenhar Syndrome is used when there is ocular and vertebral involvement), which suggests that this disorder is a range along a continuous spectrum.

==Genetic Etiology==
*HFM has an unknown etiology, but is usually sporadic. However, a few cases have had a positive family history suggesting autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or multifactorial. The estimated recurrence in first-degree relatives is about 2%, but the minor features of the disorder may be more commonly noted in relatives. The chances of having another child with Hemifacial Microsomia are less than 1%. An affected person has an approximately 3% chance of passing it on to their children.
*HFM is thought to be caused by abnormal changes in blood vessels and the disruption of the blood supply during embryonic development (early vascular disruption) at about 30-45 days of gestation. This results in the destruction of differentiating tissue in the first and second branchial arches, from which certain ligaments and bones of the face, parts of the skull, and the middle ear develop.
*No DNA abnormality has been identified. However, it has also been noted that certain teratogens (Thalidomide, Primidone, and Accutane) have produced birth defect patterns that are similar to the HFM spectrum. Also, a research study is being done to determine if there is a higher rate of Goldenhar Syndrome found in the children of Gulf War veterans.

==Incidence==
*The frequency of occurrence is estimated to be 1 in 3000 to 1 in 5000, and there is a slight male predominance (3:2).

==Clinical Features==
*Key features:
**Facial - asymmetry (90%). . .right side predominance (62%)
**hypoplasia of malar, maxillary, and/or mandibular region
**macrostomia (lateral cleft-like extension of the corner of the mouth)
**hypoplasia of the facial musculature
**frontal bossing
**Ear - microtia (malformation of the external ear from complete aplasia to a crumpled, distorted
**pinna which is displaces anteriorly and inferiorly) (65%)
**accessory preauricular tags and/or pits
**middle ear anomaly with variable deafness
**Eye - palpebral fissure is somewhat lowered on the affected side
**Oral - diminished to absent parotid secretion
**anomalies in function or structure of the tongue

==Natural History==
*Hemifacial Microsomia is congenital and most of the physical characteristics are apparent at birth. However, the facial asymmetry may not become apparent until the child grows (usually by four years of age).

==Testing==
*Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound may be possible if there is severe hypoplasia of the mandible or severe abnormality of the auricle.

==Management==
*Most of these patients have normal intelligence. Deafness should be tested for at an early age, and speech therapy is often necessary. Help may be required for feeding problems and encouraging weight gain in early infancy. Any congenital heart defects may require surgery. Plastic surgery may be used to reconstruct the ear, and bone distraction techniques are available to artificially lengthen the jaw bone to improve growth on the face.

(Opitz Oculo-Geito-Laryngeal Syndrome, Hypertelorism-Hypospadias Syndrome, Opitz-Frias Syndrome)

==Contracting==
*Acknowledge prior phone contact
*What have you been told about why your were referred to genetics?
*What questions or concerns would you like us to address today?
*Set agenda for session

==Genetic Etiology==
*Genetic heterogeneity
**X-linked loci mapping to Xp22.3 and possibly Xq22
***Only males affected
***Sons of affected males can't be affected, daughters must be carriers
***Women have 50% chance for each pregnancy to inherit the mutation
***Sons of carrier women have 25% chance of being affected
**Autosomal dominant inheritance at 22q11.2
*Molecular genetics
**Xp22.3 form is caused by mutation in MID1 gene
***Gene product is midin
***Midin is associated with microtubules throughout cell cycle
**Xq22 form is caused by mutation in MID2 gene (recently identified)
***Gene structure and protein product almost identical to MID1
***Expressed in heart, but MID1 is not
***Unsure of clinical implications at this point
**Gene on chromosome 22 has not been determined yet
*Spontaneous mutations are rare
*Almost 100% penetrance

==Natural History==
**Great variation in range of severity
***Males tend to be more severely affected than females
***Women usually only mildly affected
**Rarely symptoms are sever enough to cause death in infancy
**Usually normal growth and normal life span

==Testing==
**Usually clinical diagnosis is most reliable
**Research testing for genes on X chromosome and chromosome 22
***Mutations have been identified in some families with X-linked Opitz
***If mutation is identified, other at risk relatives can be tested
***Dr. Maximilian Muenke lab offers blood test for changes in MID1
****Have found changes in 10 of 40 families studied
****Working to find gene on Xq22
**Prenatal diagnosis can be offered once change in MID1 identified
***Polyhydramnios may be sign of affected fetus
***Some features may be observed on level II ultrasound after 22 weeks

==Surveillance, management, and treatment options==

My name is Johnathan J. Stegeman/MidiMacMan, and I am a composer, webmaster, photographer, graphic artist, and freelance writer from Denver, Colorado.

I am have been playing the piano since age five, and while I have had no classical or &quot;formal&quot; piano training, my self taught technique has been shaped mostly by ear, and my love for improvisational styles mixed in with fundamental theories about chord structures and harmonies.

I have faced great criticism for my approach to piano playing, and for particularly for the music I compose. Perhaps it is just rubbish, and will one day make a mockery out of my name-my Mother's name as I had no father growing up, and have grown up with the German half of my heritage knowning little of my my other roots, Mexican-or I may just be onto something that is ahead of the time. The later scenario at least maintains hope, and without that little bit of reassurance, I could not hardly keep writing music. Without writing music, I wouldn't feel but maybe a fraction of the person I am.

For you see music is my greatest passion, and therefore greatest source of sorrow, despair and frusration at times. It has occured to me that my songs may be loved by even just a few other souls, after I have passed through this human existence.......sadly this happens to many more artists that you may have ever imagined.

However, they never give up their motivation, as if forced by a etheral force to continue their artistic expression. Almost a curse it can feel at times, but I don't think that any artist, wether successfful, or not, would trade in this unseen force for anything in the world. I know for example: I would not trade my sense of hearing in for my sense of sight. But what a foolish bargain most people would agree............I cannot help the fact that my music is so much of me.

Only in the last two years, and after great rejection by the music world, despite rigorous study through high school, and three years of study at the University of Colorado at Denver, have Itaken up other artistic expressions. Web Design, Graphic Design, Freelance writing, and even advertising and product development are skills that I had no real training with, even through college. These skills have been fashioned through my own quest for knowledge, and are quite immature in development stages. Yet I am proud of where I have come, especially for the skills I have learned on my own.

What it has taught me, is that the world is anyones oyster........and you can harvest whatever riches you may admire...........with work and with the simplest desire.

Thanks for noticing perhaps something in my work. It all adds up to make all my effort have some final worth.

Sincerely,
Johnathan J. Stegeman
MidiMacMan.
January, 2006.
Age 26.

Always Yours, 
Johnathan J. Stegeman-MidiMacMan

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome - Type 1'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*What is your understanding about why Dr. wanted to follow up with ____in our genetics clinic?
*What do you already know about OFD syndrome?
*Do you have any questions you would like us to address today?
*What is your main concern?
*Outline the visit
*I have a little family history info from when Dr. visited ____ in the hospital, but I will take a more detailed family history.
*I will also obtain a little more information about _______'s medical history
*Dr. will come in to examine _____ and he will probably want to take a look at some of the features that you (her mother) share with ________.
*We will then discuss the diagnosis of OFD1 including the inheritance, and issues regarding the medical management.

==Diagnosis==
*The diagnosis of OFD1 is established by clinical findings
*Established at birth in some infants due to combination of oral, facial, and digital anomalies
*In others it is suspected only after polycystic kidney disease is identified (usually in later childhood or adulthood)
*In some it is only suggested after a woman has an affected child.

==Characteristic Features==

===Oral===
*tongue is lobed (bifid or trifid)
*tongue nodules (usually hamartomas or lipomas) occur in at least a third of those with OFD1
*ankyloglossia is common (partial or complete fusion of the tongue to the bottom of the mouth) attributable to a short lingual frenulum
*Cleft hard or soft palate, submucous cleft palate, or highly arched palate occur in over half of patients
*Trifurcation of the soft palate has been reported
*Alveolar clefts and accessory gingival frenulae are common (these fibrous bands are hyperplastic frenulae extending from the buccal mucous membrane to the alveolar ridge, resulting in notching of the alveolar ridges)
*Dental abnormalities include missing teeth (most common), extra teeth, enamel dysplasia, and malocclusion

===Facial===
*Ocular hypertelorism or telecanthus occurs in at least 33%
*Hypoplasia of the alae nasi, median cleft lip or pseudocleft upper lip, and micrognathia are common (exact frequencies unknown )

===Digital===
*brachydactyly (short digits), syndactyly (fused digits) of varying degrees, and clinodactyly (inward curvature) of the fifth finger are all common
*other fingers, particularly the third (i.e., middle finger) may show variable radial or ulnar deviation
*duplicated hallux (great toe) occurs in less than half of patients and is usually unilateral
*preaxial or postaxial polydactyly of the hands (1-2% of patients)
*Radiographs of the hands often demonstrate fine reticular radiolucencies, described as irregular mineralization of the bone, with or without spicule formation of the phalanges

===Brain===
*Structural brain abnormalities occur in 10-15% (may be an underestimate)
*most common include
**intracerebral cysts
**agenesis of the corpus callosum
**cerebellar agenesis with or without Dandy-Walker malformation
*Other reported anomalies have each been described in a few patients
**type 2 porencephaly (schizencephalic porencephaly)
**pachygyria (abnormally large convolutions of cerebral cortex) and heterotopias (displacement of gray matter typically into the white matter)
**hydrocephalus
**cerebral or cerebellar atrophy

===Kidney===
*polycystic kidney disease (unknown frequency) fewer than 50%
*age of onset most often adulthood (but have been described in children)

===Intellect===
*As many as half of the individuals with OFD1 have some degree of mental retardation, which is usually mild
*Depends in part on brain abnormalities, but not always consistent
*Severe mental retardation in the absence of brain malformations appears to be rare

===Other===
*Rare manifestations include choanal atresia, tibial pseudarthrosis, and berry aneurysms
*Hair is often described as dry, coarse, and brittle
*Alopecia (absence of hair), usually partial, is an occasional finding
*Milia, small keratinizing cysts, occur in at least 10% (but likely more) occur most often on the scalp, ear pinnae, face, and dorsa of the hands
*milia are usually present in infancy and then resolve, but can then leave pitting scars

==Incidence==
*Estimates range from 1/50,000 to 1/250,000

==Inheritance==
*OFD1 is inherted in an X-linked dominant manner
*Almost all affected individuals are female
*reports of males with OFD1
**some males are described as malformed fetuses born to women with OFD1
**in most cases the diagnosis is uncertain because the mother is unaffected
*Approximately 75% of cases are sporadic (should examine mother and take family history to determine this)

==Caveats of inheritance==
*One family with a peculiar inheritance pattern has been described. In this pedigree, a woman with OFDI had four unaffected sons, three of whom then had daughters all affected with OFDI
*Often, mildly affected female relatives are diagnosed only after the identification of a severely affected individual

==Recurrance risks==
*If there is no family history of OFD1, the risk that an unaffected mother of an affected female will have another female with OFD1 is less than 1% due to the possibility of
**1) a new mutation in a second child
**2) germline mosaicism in a parent (more likely than new mutation)
***Germline mosaicism is when a person unaffected by OFD1 has multiple copies of the OFD1 mutation in their gametes
***Theoretically, germline mosaicism can occur in either parent of a female with OFD1
*At conception, the risk to the offspring of females with OFD1 of inheriting the mutant OFD1 is 50% (most male conceptuses with the mutant OFD1 allele miscarry)
*At delivery the expected sex ratio of offspring is: 33% unaffected females; 33% affected females; 33% unaffected males


Recurrance is a misspelling. This should instead be 'Recurrence'

==Genetic Testing==
*OFD1 is the only gene currently known to be associated with oral-facial-digital syndrome type I
*chromosomal locus Xp22.3-p22.2
*Molecular genetic testing of the OFD1 gene is available on a research basis only
*Tested in a limited number of patients
*A variety of mutations have been identified, the majority result in premature protein truncation
*Detection rate unknown

==Molecular genetics==
*Normal allelic variants:
**OFD1 has 23 exons
**OFD1 is on the portion of the X chromosome that escapes inactivation
**OFD1 was expressed in all adult tissues that were examined. However, during early development, expression is exclusively in the genital ridges, soon followed by expression in craniofacial structures and nervous system
**Homologous genes include Cyorf1 (Y chromosomes) and C5orf1 (chromosome 5)
*Pathologic allelic variants:
**Exonic and intronic mutations have both been described
**Mutations in exons include single base pair changes, frameshifts, and deletions
**These changes have occurred to date in exons 3, 11, 13, and 16 only
**Abnormal splicing has also been reported in introns 4 and 5

==Normal gene product==
**The protein OFD1 occurs in two forms, Cxorf5-1 and Cxorf5-2, which are differentiated by the use of an alternative splice site
**Cxorf5-1 is a 1011 amino acid protein, whereas Cxorf5-2 is a 367 amino acid protein
**The two proteins share the first 351 amino acids; Cxorf5-2 then has a C-terminal region of 16 amino acids
**The function of the protein is unknown, but thought to be related to a protein-protein interaction mechanism during development

==Abnormal gene product==
*Most of the mutations lead to the premature truncation of the protein and are therefore thought to result in a loss of function
*Since this gene is on the portion of the X chromosome that escapes inactivation, the truncated protein may interact with the wildtype product to produce a dominant-negative effect
*No genotype-phenotype correlation exists to date.

==Prenatal testing==
*Prenatal testing using molecular genetic techniques is not clinically available
*Prenatal ultrasound examination may detect structural brain malformations and duplicated hallux

==Differential diagnosis==
(includes the other oral-facial-digital syndromes and disorders including cystic renal disease)
*OFD II (Mohr syndrome)
**Autosomal recessive
**primarily distinguished by polydactyly (bilateral postaxial polydactyly of hands, bilateral polysyndactly of feet)
**other manifestations include broad (sometimes bifid) nasal tip
**midline partial cleft of lip
**these individuals do not have milia or polycystic kidney disease
*OFD III (Sugarman syndrome)
**Autosomal recessive
**characterized by see-saw winking and polydactyly only postaxial
**myoclonic jerks (also occur)
**bulbous nose (may also occur)
**apparently low set ears (also occur)
*OFD IV (Buru-Baraister syndrome)
**Autosomal recessive
**tibial involvement (short tibia) and pre and or postaxial polydactyly (primary manifestations)
**Other findings include pectus excavatum and short stature
*OFD V (Thurston syndrome)
**Autosomal recessive
**includes polydactyly and median cleft lip only
**Only one affected individual has had hyperplastic frenula
*OFD VI (Varadi-Papp syndrome)
**distinguished by polydactyly (particularly central) and cerebellar malformations
**Renal agenesis and dysplasia have been described
*OFD VII (Whelan syndrome)
**includes unilateral cleft lip and hydronephrosis
**only been described in one mother-daughter pair
**congenital hydronephrosis, coarse hair, facial asymmetry, facial weakness, preauricular tags
**Inheritance either autosomal or X-linked dominant
**may be allelic to OFD1 if X-linked dominant
*OFD VIII
**apparently inherited as an X-linked recessive trait
**combination of polydactyly, tibial and radial defects, and epiglottal abnormalities
**pre and postaxial polydactyly of hans and bilateral duplication of halluces, short stature, bypoplasia of the epiglottis, absent/abnormal central incisors, broad/bifid nasal tip
**may be allelic to OFD1
*OFD IX
**includes retinal abnormalities and nonmedian cleft lip
**reported in three males
*Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
**In ADPKD cysts develop from tubules, whereas in OFD1 cysts develop from both tubules and glomeruli
**however, imaging studies cannot always distinguish the renal cystic disease of OFD1 from that of ADPKD and other cystic renal disorders
**cysts are said to be smaller and more uniform in size in OFD1 than in ADPKD, and the kidneys are not as enlarged or deformed in OFD1
**hepatic cysts and berry aneurysms have been observed in OFD1
**Other distinguishing features are mode of inheritance and the lack of oral, facial, digital, or brain abnormalities in ADPKD
*Meckel-Gruber syndrome
**autosomal recessive condition characterized by the combination of encephalocele, polydactyly, and polycystic kidney disease
**Other common findings include microphthalmia (small eyes) or anophthalmia (no eyes), cleft lip/palate, hepatic fibrosis and cysts, and congenital cardiac defects

==Health concerns and management==
*Treatment for OFD1 is supportive
*Removal of accessory teeth; orthodontia for malocculsion; and cosmetic or reconstructive surgery for clefts of the lip and/or palate, tongue nodules, accessory frenula, and syndactyly
*Hearing loss from recurrent otitis media, usually associated with cleft palate, has been reported
*End stage renal disease (ESRD) has been reported in affected girls and women ranging in age from 11 years to age 70 years
*Management of renal disease may require hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and renal transplantation.
*Recently it has been emphasized that the risk for significant renal disease may be greater than previously reported
*Liver and pancreatic cysts may be observed
*Laboratory investigations such as creatinine levels and blood pressure determination to monitor renal function should be done
*if appropriate, imaging studies of the kidneys, liver, and pancreas should be performed

==Patient Resources==
(I found no patient literature that I felt was good or appropriate)
*http://www.netnet.net/mums/ -- Website where parents are matched up according to the condition that their child has. There are currently at least 4 people registered with OFD syndrome type I and 15 just listed under OFD syndrome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Module size ==

I must suggest a change in the plan for the list of instructions.  Having a whole module for each one does not seem appropriate to me.  I like the content so far, and there is some more detail and an example or two that could be added.  But even with that, a lot of them would consist only of two or three paragraphs - - a little small for a module.

Having a module for the CTL instructions and having the link to IF be [[TI-Basic:Instructions:CTL#If]] makes more sense (especially for those that are really small like Stop.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Description==
Cannabis is a leafy plant which grows wild in many of the tropic and temperate areas of the world. It is cultivated both indoors and out for the production of its flowering tops. The most commonly used form of cannabis are the leaves and flowering tops (buds) which may be either smoked or eaten; It also comes in a more concentrated resinous form called hashish, and as a sticky black liquid called hash oil. There are three distinct genera of cannabis: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis. Most recreationally used cannabis is the result of interbreeding between these three types. The term 'hemp' is generally used to describe low-thc varieties of cannabis which are grown for industrial uses.

==Health and safety==
===Effects on the Brain===
Scientists have learned a great deal about how THC acts in the brain to produce its many effects. When someone smokes marijuana, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to the brain and other organs throughout the body.

THC acts upon specific sites in the brain, called cannabinoid receptors, kicking off a series of cellular reactions that ultimately lead to the “high” that users experience when they smoke marijuana. Some brain areas have many cannabinoid receptors; others have few or none. The highest density of cannabinoid receptors are found in parts of the brain that influence pleasure, memory, thoughts, concentration, sensory and time perception, and coordinated movement.&lt;ref&gt;Herkenham M, Lynn A, Little MD, et al. Cannabinoid receptor localization in the brain. Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 87(5):1932–1936, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not surprisingly, marijuana intoxication can cause distorted perceptions, impaired coordination, difficulty in thinking and problem solving, and problems with learning and memory. Research has shown that marijuana’s adverse impact on learning and memory can last for days or weeks after the acute effects of the drug wear off.&lt;ref&gt;Pope HG, Gruber AJ, Hudson JI, Huestis MA, Yurgelun-Todd D. Neuropsychological performance in long-term cannabis users. Arch Gen Psychiatry 58(10):909–915, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, someone who smokes marijuana every day may be functioning at a suboptimal intellectual level all of the time.

Research on the long-term effects of marijuana abuse indicates some changes in the brain similar to those seen after long-term abuse of other major drugs. For example, cannabinoid withdrawal in chronically exposed animals leads to an increase in the activation of the stress-response system&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez de Fonseca F, Carrera MRA, Navarro M, Koob GF, Weiss F. Activation of corticotropin-releasing factor in the limbic system during cannabinoid withdrawal. Science 276(5321):2050–2054, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and changes in the activity of nerve cells containing dopamine.&lt;ref&gt;Diana M, Melis M, Muntoni AL, Gessa GL. Mesolimbic dopaminergic decline after cannabinoid withdrawal. Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 95(17):10269–10273, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Dopamine neurons are involved in the regulation of motivation and reward, and are directly or indirectly affected by all drugs of abuse.

===Effects on the Lungs===
Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50–70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;&lt;ref&gt;Tashkin DP. Smoked marijuana as a cause of lung injury. Monaldi Arch Chest Dis 63(2):92–100, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.&lt;ref&gt;Hashibe M, Morgenstern H, Cui Y, et al. Marijuana use and the risk of lung and upper aerodigestive tract cancers: Results of a population-based case-control study. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 15(10):1829–1834, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.

Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.&lt;ref&gt; Polen MR, Sidney S, Tekawa IS, Sadler M, Friedman GD. Health care use by frequent marijuana smokers who do not smoke tobacco. West J Med 158(6):596–601, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses. 

===Effects on the Heart===
Marijuana increases heart rate by 20–100 percent shortly after smoking; this effect can last up to 3 hours. In one study, it was estimated that marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug.&lt;ref&gt;Mittleman MA, Lewis RA, Maclure M, Sherwood JB, Muller JE. Triggering myocardial infarction by marijuana. Circulation 103(23):2805–2809, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to the increased heart rate as well as effects of marijuana on heart rhythms, causing palpitations and arrhythmias. This risk may be greater in aging populations or those with cardiac vulnerabilities.

===Effects on Mental Health===
A number of studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and schizophrenia. Some of these studies have shown age at first use to be a factor, where early use is a marker of vulnerability to later problems. However, at this time, it is not clear whether marijuana use causes mental problems, exacerbates them, or is used in attempt to self-medicate symptoms already in existence. Chronic marijuana use, especially in a very young person, may also be a marker of risk for mental illnesses, including addiction, stemming from genetic or environmental vulnerabilities, such as early exposure to stress or violence. At the present time, the strongest evidence links marijuana use and schizophrenia and/or related disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Moore TH, Zammit S, Lingford-Hughes A, et al. Cannabis use and risk of psychotic or affective mental health outcomes: A systematic review. Lancet 370 (9584):319–328, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt; High doses of marijuana can produce an acute psychotic reaction; in addition, use of the drug may trigger the onset or relapse of schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals.

===Other Effects===
Other effects include dry mouth (&quot;pasties&quot; or &quot;cotton mouth&quot;), increased appetite (&quot;munchies&quot;), and &quot;red-eye&quot;.
The first is a common effect from smoking anything. THC activates parts of the brain (Cannabinoid receptors) which are linked to appetite. (It is believed that cannabinoid receptors are activated after birth to make an infant hungry until they can learn the daily routine of eating). THC also causes dilation of blood vessels which can lead to the &quot;red-eye&quot;. THC can also lower intra-ocular (eye) pressure making it useful as a treatment for [[glaucoma]].

Cannabis has an anti-nauseante property. However, like most antiemetics, this effect is seemingly reversed with higher doses.

==Addictive Potential==
Long-term marijuana abuse can lead to addiction; that is, compulsive drug seeking and abuse despite its known harmful effects upon social functioning in the context of family, school, work, and recreational activities. Long-term marijuana abusers trying to quit report irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite, anxiety, and drug craving, all of which make it difficult to quit. These withdrawal symptoms begin within about 1 day following abstinence, peak at 2–3 days, and subside within 1 or 2 weeks following drug cessation.&lt;ref&gt;Budney AJ, Vandrey RG, Hughes JR, Thostenson JD, Bursac Z. Comparison of cannabis and tobacco withdrawal: Severity and contribution to relapse. J Subst Abuse Treat, e-publication ahead of print, March 12, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and Appeal==
Cannabis is one of the most commonly abused drugs. Effects include relaxation, fatigue, increased emotional reaction (e.g., laughter), and muscle relaxation.{{fact}}

The effects typically subside between 1 and 4 hours after smoking, depending on the users body build.{{fact}}

===Effects on Daily Life===
Research clearly demonstrates that marijuana has the potential to cause problems in daily life or make a person’s existing problems worse. In one study, heavy marijuana abusers reported that the drug impaired several important measures of life achievement including physical and mental health, cognitive abilities, social life, and career status.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber AJ, Pope HG, Hudson JI, Yurgelun-Todd D. Attributes of long-term heavy cannabis users: A case control study. Psychological Med 33(8):1415–1422, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies associate workers’ marijuana smoking with increased absences, tardiness, accidents, workers’ compensation claims, and job turnover.

==Non-Recreational Usage==
Hemp can be used to make paper, textiles (clothing, furniture upholstery, sails, etc.), fuel, and food. It can be grown rather easily and harvested several times annually.{{fact}}

      <comment>moved [[Recreational Drug Use/LD50]] to [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/LD50]]: Restoring previous book title.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''LD/50''' of any substance is the amount - typically given in a milligrams of the substance per kilogram of the users weight (mg/Kg) - needed to cause death to 50% of users.

This of course is never tested on humans. Instead a drug is administered intravenously to rats.

The number is not very reliable for two major reasons:
First of all, there is quite a difference between humans and rats. Humans have a completely different metabolism compared to our furry friends. This can either mean it takes more or less of a substance to reach LD/50, depending on the drug.

Secondly, many drugs are ingested orally. When something is absorbed by the GI track, it makes a pass through the liver. The liver breaks down a certain amount of the substance, usually into inactive chemicals (Although sometimes the liver breaks down an inactive chemical into an active one, such as with [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Codeine|Codeine]].

Wherever possible, this book includes the known human overdose threshold (Which is often a good deal below the LD/50), and/or a safe dosage range to stay clear of any dangers.

{{recipe}}  |  [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Cuisine of Poland]]

'''Pierogi''' are Polish dumplings that are typically filled with potatoes, cheese, meat, sauerkraut and mushrooms or wild fruits (strawberries, blueberries, etc.).

== Ingredients ==
*  1 tbs. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
*  ½ cup cold water
*  1-2 eggs large  [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] 
*  3½ cups  [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]], plus extra for rolling dough
*  ~1 cups water
*  1½ tbs. unsalted  [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 recipe [[Cookbook:Pierogie Filling:Saurkraut Filling|sauerkraut filling]] or [[Cookbook:Pierogie Filling:Cheese Filling|cheese filling]].

== Procedure ==
=== Dough ===
# Place flour in a large bowl.
# In a measuring cup, combine the salt, eggs, and the ½ cup cold water, and beat well with a fork.  Add those ingredients to flour and mix with your hands until blended.  Slowly mix in the remaining water (you do not have to add the entire cup, just keep adding until the dough feels wet).  Add the butter and knead until there are no lumps and it feels very smooth. This should take 15 minutes.  
# Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour, but for best results let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours.

=== Assembly ===

# Divide the dough into thirds and roll out each on a lightly floured surface until the dough is approximately ⅛ inch thick.
# With a cup or glass, cut as many circles as possible out of the dough, but do not lift them off the work surface.
# Remove the excess dough from the work surface, and roll the circles until they become completely flattened.  This might require the additional sprinkling of flour on the dough.
# Carefully lift each circle of dough from the table (a spatula helps) and put between 1 tsp. and 1 tbs. of filling in its center.  The amount would vary depending on the size of the glass that was used to cut the dough.  For each circle, fold dough over to form a half-moon shape, and pinch edges closed, making sure there are no air pockets.
# Repeat for the remaining dough. 

=== Boiling ===
# Place no more than ⅓ of the pierogi at a time in boiling salted water for 5-10 minutes.  
# Drain in colander and lightly rinse with cold water-- this will prevent them from sticking together. 
# Serve immediately or fry in butter.  

== Notes ==
{{Wikipedia|Pierogi}}
* These will freeze well for up to 6 weeks. Prior to boiling them, place each pieróg on a sheet of parchment paper or a floured sheet of wax paper, being careful not to have them touching. Stack sheets on top of each other and place in an airtight freezer bag.
* A standard recipe for mashed potatoes can also be used as filling.

{{recipe}}  |  [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Poland]]

== Ingredients ==
* 8 oz. farmer's cheese (a soft, NOT a hard cheese) (if unsalted add 1 tsp. salt)
* 4 oz. [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]
* 2 tbs. flour

== Procedure ==
Mash together all of the ingredients until well mixed.

== Notes ==

Farmer's cheese is similar to a dry-curd [[Cookbook:Cottage Cheese|cottage cheese]] and is unavailable outside predominately Eastern European and Jewish areas. Dry-curd cottage cheese is a sub-par substitution, and must be drained of all excess liquid if it is to be used.

{{recipe}}  |  [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Poland]]

== Ingredients ==
Filling:
* 1 large can (~28 oz.) sauerkraut
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1 stick butter  
* Salt and pepper
Dough:
* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 1 egg (optional)
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* water

== Procedure ==

#Place sauerkraut and liquid in a pot filled with just enough water to cover the sauerkraut. When it begins to boil, remove from stove and place in a collander then drain and rinse well with cold water to prevent further cooking. With your hands, squeeze as much liquid from the kraut as you can to prevent the pierogies from being too soggy. Place the sauerkraut on a large cutting board and chop fine with a large flat-bladed knife.
#Fry the onion until it is translucent and then add the drained sauerkraut. Salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer for 15 minutes and let it cool before using.  For best results, refrigerate a few hours before filling in Pierogies.
#For the dough, sift and measure flour with salt into a large bowl. Slightly beat egg with fork and add egg to flour, then add enough water to make a pastry dough soft enough to roll out with a rolling pin but not too dry that it spits and cracks. Roll out dough on a floured bread board until about the thickness of a cracker. Use a large rimmed glass or a big biscuit cutter to cut rounds approximately 3&quot;-4&quot; in diameter. Fill each round with a generous spoonful of kraut mixture and fold dough in half. Pinch and seal the edge of the dough with fingers then gently fold and pinch edge to make a ruffled edge with about 1/4&quot; folds. Drop each pierogie dumpling into a large pot of boiling salt water and boil until they float to the top. Remove each carefully with a slotted spoon. Fry the pierogie in a skillet with melted butter until golden brown. #Serve warm or cold.

== Notes ==

The boiling step may be omitted if you like really strong sauerkraut.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Authentication keys can improve efficiency, if done properly.  As a bonus advantage, the passphrase and private key never leave the client.  They are generally recommended for outward facing systems so password authentication can be turned off.  

==Verify a Host Key by Fingerprint==

The first time connecting to a remote host, the key itself should be verified.  Usually this is done by comparing the fingerprint or the ASCII art visual host key, metadata about the key, rather than trying to compare the whole key itself.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -l fred server.example.org
The authenticity of host 'server.example.org (192.0.32.10)' can't be established. 
RSA key fingerprint is 4a:11:ef:d3:f2:48:f8:ea:1a:a2:0d:17:57:ea:a6:16. 
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Downloading keys===

Usually a host’s key is displayed the first time the SSH client tries to connect.  The remote host’s public RSA or DSA keys can also be fetched on demand using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keyscan(1)]:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa host.example.org
# host.example.org SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.3
host.example.org ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAsA3bhtFFgzB9sdcjS0gcPRILUYGlDciXDzBb3PVp2rAYW1yW4AwsWLBYXW7d38dj+Q4rdGdzwpdsu0cAuFA9UD+9o1ajxAa8hAQsjOU+1l/hEJDQelYEeW905CZF7xl4sbcapyKN5y1bXZtdz84E2v8LAruNzCUULt564NUeGSQQRNiHfNta6VXrMAU4fYGMiHynbxTjOmpZV/GiSwcyZqCQqCmTMq2nn0/32QgpfmTkNgAHYk0jh/YNtXmRsGnbEvqdZAwog+NQsQriye0d2MMlgpuevpYKgL1IAhXMeb+Xx2HcUXjuKINwYAwfqOBQZBWMyMw5TAV1tFktsJBY4w==
&lt;/pre&gt;
Once the key is acquired, its fingerprint can be shown using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keygen(1)].  This is a two step process, the key is read to a file and then the file analyzed to get a fingerprint.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa host.example.org &gt; key
$ ssh-keygen -lf key
2048 37:af:05:99:e7:fb:86:6c:98:ee:14:a6:30:06:bc:f0 192.168.12.1 (RSA)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that output from [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keyscan(1)] is sent to '''stderr''' instead of '''stdout'''.  Note that the pipe below works on some systems and not others.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa host.example.org 2&gt;&amp;1 | ssh-keygen -lf -
2048 37:af:05:99:e7:fb:86:6c:98:ee:14:a6:30:06:bc:f0 192.168.12.1 (RSA)
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to find all hosts from a file which have new or different keys from those in '''known_hosts''', if the host names are in clear text and not stored as hashes.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa -f ssh_hosts | \
  sort -u - ~/.ssh/known_hosts | \
  diff ~/.ssh/known_hosts -
&lt;/pre&gt;

===ASCII Art Visual Host Key===

An ASCII art representation of the key can be supplied along with the fingerprint: 
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -lvf key 
2048 37:af:05:99:e7:fb:86:6c:98:ee:14:a6:30:06:bc:f0 www.example.net (RSA)

|  .o.* ..        | 
|  .*=.+o         | 
|  ..==+.         | 
+-----------------+ 
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Key-based authentication==

OpenSSH can use public key cryptography for authentication.  In public key cryptography, encryption and decryption are asymmetric.  The keys are used in pairs, a public key to encrypt and a hidden key to decrypt.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen ssh-keygen(1)] can make RSA, DSA, or ECDSA keys for authenticating.  DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits in size.  RSA keys are allowed to vary from 768 bits on up.  ECDSA can be one of 256, 384 or 521 bits.  Shorter keys are faster, but less secure.  Longer keys are much slower to work with but provide better protection.  

The key files can be named anything, so it is possible to have many keys each for different services or tasks.  The comment field at the end of the public key can be useful in helping to keep the keys sorted, if you have many of them or use them infrequently.  

With key-based authentication, a copy of the public key is stored on the server and the private key is kept on the client.  When the client first contacts the server, the server responds by using the client's public key to encrypt a random number and return that encrypted random number as a challenge to the client.  The client uses the matching private key to decrypt the challenge and extract the random number.  The client then makes an MD5 hash of the session ID and the random number from the challenge and returns that hash to the server.  The server then makes its own hash of the session ID and the random number and compares that to the hash returned by the client.  If there is a match, the login is allowed.  If there is not a match, then the next public key on the server is tried until either a match is found or all the keys have been tried. &lt;ref name=&quot;How Key Challenges Work&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/ssh-agent-forwarding.html#chal | title=An Illustrated Guide to SSH Agent Forwarding | author=Steve Friedl | date=2006-02-22 | accessdate=2013-04-27 | publisher=Unixwiz.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If an agent is used on the client side to manage authentication, the process is similar.  It only differs in that [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] passes the challenge off to the agent which then calculates the response and passes it back to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] which then passes the agent's response back to the server.  

===Basics of Public Key Authentication===

For public key authentication, a key pair is needed.  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen ssh-keygen(1)] is used to make the key pair.  From that pair the public key must be properly stored on the remote host and the private key stored safely on the client.  The public key is added to the designated '''authorized_keys''' file for the remote user account.  Once the keys have been prepared they can be used again and again without needing to do anything else.  

Preparation of the keys:
0) If either the '''authorized_keys''' file or '''.ssh''' directory do not exist on either the client machine or the remote machine, create them and set the permissions correctly:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ mkdir ~/.ssh/
$ touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ chmod 0700 ~/.ssh/
$ chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;

1) Create a key pair.  The example here creates a 4096-bit RSA key pair in the directory '''~/.ssh'''.  As a result, the public key will be seen named ''mykey_rsa.pub'' and and the private key will be called ''mykey_rsa''.  Be sure to enter a sound passphrase.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/mykey_rsa
&lt;/pre&gt;

2) Transfer both the public and private keys to the client machine, if not already there from the step above.  It is usually best to store both the public and private keys in the directory '''~/.ssh/''' together.  

3) Transfer only the public key to remote machine.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scp ~/.ssh/mykey_rsa fred@remotehost.example.org:.
&lt;/pre&gt;

4) Log in to the remote machine and add the new public key to the '''authorized_keys''' file, whether in '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''', the default, or somewhere else as designated by the server's configuration.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat mykey_rsa &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ nano -w ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;

Any editor that does not wrap long lines can be used.  In the example above, [http://linux.die.net/man/1/nano nano(1)] is started with the '''-w''' option to prevent wrapping of long lines.  The same can also be accomplished permanently by editing [http://linux.die.net/man/5/nanorc nanorc(5)]   However it is done, the key must be in the file whole and unbroken, on a single  line. 

Usage of the keys: 
Authenticate to the remote machine from the client using the private key.  The option ''-i'' tells [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] which private key to try.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey_rsa -l fred remotehost.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

A common error, if a key doesn't work, is that the file permissions are wrong.  The authorized key file must not be group writable.  
&lt;pre&gt;
$ chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= ~/.ssh
$ chmod u=rw,g=,o=  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another mistake that can happen is if the key is broken by line breaks or has other white space in the middle.  That can be fixed by joining up the lines and removing the spaces or by recopying the key more carefully.  

====Associating Keys Permanently with a Server====

The '''host''' directive in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config ssh_config(5)] can apply specific settings to a target host.  That includes using specific keys with certain hosts.  So by changing '''~/.ssh/config''' it is possible to assign keys to be tried automatically whenever making a connection to that host.  Here, all that's needed is to type ''ssh web1'' to connect with the key for that server.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Host web1
	Hostname 198.51.100.32
	IdentitiesOnly=yes
	IdentityFile=/home/fred/.ssh/web_key_rsa
&lt;/pre&gt;

Below  '''~/.ssh/config''' uses different keys for ''server'' versus ''server.example.org'',  regardless whether they resolve to the same machine.   This is possible because the host name argument given to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh ssh(1)] is not converted to a canonicalized host name before matching.

&lt;pre&gt;
Host server
	IdentityFile /home/fred/.ssh/key_a_rsa

Host server.example.org
	IdentityFile /home/fred/.ssh/key_b_rsa  
&lt;/pre&gt;

The parser is first-match, so the shorter name is tried first.  Of course less ambiguous shortcuts can also be made.  

====Encrypted Home Directories====

With encrypted home directories, the keys must be stored in an unencrypted directory and  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] configured appropriately to find the keys in that special location.  Sometimes it is also necessary to add a script or call a program from '''/etc/ssh/sshrc''' to decrypt the directory after authentication.

One symptom of having an encrypted home directory is that key-based authentication only works when you are already logged into the same account, but fails when trying to make the first connection and log in for the first time.

Here is one method for solving the access problem.  Each user is given a subdirectory under '''/etc/ssh/keys/''' which they can then use for storing their '''authorized_keys''' file.  This is set in the server's configuration file '''/etc/ssh/sshd_config'''

&lt;pre&gt;
AuthorizedKeysFile      /etc/ssh/keys/%u/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;

Multiple key file locations can be specified if they are separated by whitespace.  The user needs read access to the directory and keys, but write access is not needed.  That opens up more possibilities as to how the keys can be managed.

====Passwordless login====

One way of allowing passwordless logins is to follow the steps above, but do not enter a passphrase.  Note that this is very risky, so the key files should be very well protected and kept track of.  That includes that they only be used as single-purpose keys as described below.  Timely key rotation becomes especially important.  In general, it is not a good idea to make a key without a passphrase.  A better solution is to work with an authentication agent in conjunction with a single-purpose key.

====Requiring Both Keys and a Password====

While users should have strong passphrases for their keys, there is no way to enforce or verify that.  Indeed, the passphrase for any given key never leaves the client machine so it is nothing that the server can have any influence over.  Starting with OpenSSH 6.2, it is possible for the server to require multiple authentication methods for login using the '''AuthenticationMethods''' directive.   

&lt;pre&gt;
AuthenticationMethods publickey,password
&lt;/pre&gt;

This example requires that users first authenticate using a key and only queries for a password if that succeeds.  It is not possible to get to the system password prompt without first authenticating with a valid key.  Changing the order of the arguments changes the order of the authentication methods.  

'''AuthenticationMethods''' can also be set under a '''Match''' directive to apply only to certain groups or situations.

===Key-based authentication using an Agent===

The authentication agent, [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-agent ssh-agent(1)], should be started at the beginning of the session and used to launch the login session or X-session so that the environment variables are passed to each subsequent shell pointing to the agent process and its unix-domain socket.  Many distros do this automatically upon login or startup.  Starting the agent sets a pair of environment variables:

* SSH_AGENT_PID : the process id of the agent
* SSH_AUTH_SOCK : the filename and full path to the unix-domain socket

The various SSH and SFTP clients find these variables automatically and use them to contact the agent if they are set and if one or more keys are loaded.   If the shell or desktop session  was launched using [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-agent ssh-agent(1)], then these variables are already set and available.  If not, then it is necessary to set them manually inside each shell or for each application in order to use the agent.  

Once the agent is available, a private key only needs to be loaded once and then can be used many times.   Private keys are loaded into the agent with [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-add ssh-add(1)].

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-add /home/fred/.ssh/mykey_rsa
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to list the identities currently in the agent.  The option ''-l'' will list all the fingerprints of the identities in the agent.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-add -l
2048 09:58:23:08:03:65:e0:2b:03:54:31:89:7b:ee:05:28 /home/fred/.ssh/some_key_rsa (RSA)
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is also possible to remove individual identities from the agent using ''-d'' which will remove them one at a time by name, but only if the name is given.  Without the name of a private key, it will fail silently.  Using ''-D'' will remove all of them at once without needing to specify any by name.  

====Agent forwarding====

In agent forwarding, intermediate machines forward challenges and responses back and forth between the client and the final destination.  This eliminates the need for passwords or keys on any of these intermediate machines.  In other words, an advantage of agent forwarding is that the private key itself is not needed on any remote machine, thus hindering unwanted access to it. &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenSSH key management, Part 3&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc3/ | title=Common threads: OpenSSH key management, Part 3 | author=Daniel Robbins | publisher=IBM | date=2002-02-01 | accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another advantage is that the actual agent to which the user has authenticated does not go anywhere and is thus less susceptible to analysis.  

The default configuration files for the server enable authentication agent forwarding, so to use it, nothing needs to be done there.  On the client side it is disabled by default and so it must be enabled explicitly.  Put the following line in  [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config ssh_config(5)] to enable agent forwarding for a particular server:

&lt;pre&gt;
Host gateway.example.org
	ForwardAgent yes
&lt;/pre&gt;

One risk with agents is that they can be re-used to tailgate in if the permissions allow it.  Keys cannot be copied this way, but authentication is possible when there are incorrect permissions.  Note that disabling agent forwarding does not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always install their own forwarders.

==Single-purpose keys==

Tailored single-purpose keys can eliminate use of remote root logins for administrative activities.  A  finely tailored sudoers is needed along with a user account.  When done right, it gives just enough access to get the job done, following the security principle of Least Privilege.  Single-purpose keys are accompanied by use of either the '''ForceCommand''' directive in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)] or the '''Command=''' directive inside the '''authorized_keys''' file.  Further, neither the '''authorized_keys''' file nor the home directory should be writable.  
'''ssh -v''' can show exactly what is being passed to the server so that sudoers can be set up correctly when setting up encrypted remote backups using '''rsync''', '''tar''', '''mysqldump''', etc.  For example, here is what '''ssh -v''' show from one particular usage of '''rsync''':
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rsync --server -vlHogDtprz --delete --delete-after \
	--ignore-errors . /org/backup
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Key-based authentication, with limitations on activity===
The '''authorized_keys''' file can force a particular program to run whenever the key is used.  This is useful for automating various tasks.  The following launches firefox automatically and exits the connection when it is finished.

&lt;pre&gt;
command=&quot;/usr/bin/firefox&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...OFy5Lwc8Lo+Jk=
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following further restricts the connection to coming from a single domain.

&lt;pre&gt;
command=&quot;/usr/bin/firefox&quot;,from=&quot;*.example.net&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3...FLoJk=
&lt;/pre&gt;

The manual page [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd(8)] has the full list of options for the '''authorized_keys''' file.

The following key will only echo some text and then exit, unless used non-interactively with the -N option.  No matter what the user tries, it will echo the text.  The -N option will disable running the remote program, allowing the connection to stay open. 

&lt;pre&gt;
command=&quot;/bin/echo do-not-send-commands&quot; ssh-rsa AAAAB3...99ptc=
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is very useful for keys that are only used for tunnels.

===Read-only access to keys===

In some cases it is necessary to prevent the users from changing their own authentication keys.  This can be done by putting the key file in an external directory where the user has read-only access to the key file and no write permissions to either the file or the directory.  The '''AuthorizedKeysFile''' directive sets where '''sshd(8)''' looks for the keys and can point to the secured location for the keys instead of the default location.

The default location for keys on most systems is usually '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys'''.  A good alternate location could be to create the directory '''/etc/ssh/authorized_keys''' and store the selected users' key files there.  The change can be made to apply to only a group of users by putting it under a '''Match''' directive.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Match Group sftpusers
	AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/%u
&lt;/pre&gt;

This works even within a chrooted environment.  

&lt;pre&gt;
Match Group sftpusers
	ChrootDirectory /home
	ForceCommand internal-sftp -d %u
	AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/%u
&lt;/pre&gt;

Of course it could be set to affect all users by putting the directive in the main part of the server configuration file.

==Mark public keys as revoked==

Keys that have been revoked can be stored in '''/etc/ssh/revoked_keys''', a file specified in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)]  using the directive '''RevokedKeys''', so that [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd sshd(8)] will prevent attempts to log in with them.  No warning or error on the client side will be given if a revoked key is tried.  Authentication will simply progress to the next key or method.

The revoked keys file should contain a list of public keys, one per line, that have been revoked and can no longer be used to connect to the server.  The key cannot contain any extras, such as [[OpenSSH/Client_Configuration_Files#Available_key_login_options | login options]] or it will be ignored. If one of the revoked keys is tried during a login attempt, the server will simply ignore it and move on to the next authentication method.  An entry will be made in the logs of the attempt, including the key's fingerprint.  See the section on [[OpenSSH/Logging | logging]] for a little more on that.  

&lt;pre&gt;
RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;

The '''RevokedKeys''' configuration directive is not set in [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html sshd_config(5)] by default.  It must be set explicitly if it is to be used.  

===Key Revocation Lists===

A compact, binary form of representing revoked keys and certificates is available as a Key Revocation List (KRL).  KRLs are generated with [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen ssh-keygen(1)] and can be created fresh or an existing one updated.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -kf  /etc/ssh/revoked_keys -z 1 ~/.ssh/old_key_rsa.pub
$ ssh-keygen -ukf /etc/ssh/revoked_keys -z 2 ~/.ssh/old_key_dsa.pub
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is possible to test if a specific key or certificate is in the revocation list.  

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -Qf  /etc/ssh/revoked_keys ~/.ssh/old_key_rsa.pub
&lt;/pre&gt;

Only public keys and certificates will be loaded into the KRL.  Corrupt or broken keys will not be loaded and will produce an error message if tried.  Like with the regular '''RevokedKeys''' list, the public key destined for the KRL cannot contain any extras like login options or it will produce an error when an attempt is made to load it into the KRL or search the KRL for it.

==More on Verifying SSH Keys==

Reliable verification of a host key must be done when first connecting.  To know the key fingerprint in advance, it can be necessary to contact the system administrator who can provide it out of band.  Use '''ssh-keygen''' on the local console to be absolutely sure.  

Here the server's RSA key is read:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
xxxx x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub (RSA)
&lt;/pre&gt;

And here the corresponding DSA key is read.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
1024 x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub (DSA)
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is also possible to use [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keyscan&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh-keyscan(1)]  However, the fingerprint still needs to be verified out of band.  

===Warning: Remote Host Identification Has Changed!===

If the server's key does not match what has been recorded in either the system's or the local user's '''authorized_keys''' files, then the SSH client will issue a warning.  Two main reasons for the warning exist.  One is when the server's key has been changed, maybe the server was reinstalled without backing up the old keys.  Another situation is when the connection is made to the wrong machine, one such case would be the during an attempted man in the middle attack or when contacting a server that changes addresses because of dynamic address allocation.  

In cases where the key has changed there is only one thing to do: contact the system administrator and verify the key.  The system administrator may be you yourself in some cases.  If so, was OpenSSH-server recently reinstalled, or was the machine restored from an old backup?  The new key fingerprint can be sent out by some method where it is possible to verify the integrity and origin of the message, for example via PGP-signed e-mail.

Then go over to the client machine where you got the error and remove the old key from '''~/.ssh/known_hosts'''
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keygen -R host.example.org
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then try logging in, but enter the password if and '''only''' if the key fingerprint matches what you got on the server console.  If the key fingerprint matches, then go through with the login process and the key will be automatically added.  If the key finger print does not match, stop immediately and it would be a good idea to get on the phone (a real phone, no computer phones) to the remote machine's system administrator or the network administrator.

===Multiple keys for a host, multiple hosts for a key in known_hosts===
Using pattern matching in known_hosts, it is possible to assign multiple host names or ip addresses to the same key.  That goes for both those global keys in '''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts''' and those local user-specific key lists in '''~/.ssh/known_hosts'''.  They should provide you with an up-to-date set to add to your known hosts file. Otherwise, you must verify the keys by hand.  
&lt;pre&gt;
server1,server2,server3 ssh-rsa AAAAB097y0yiblo97gvl...jhvlhjgluibp7y807t08mmniKjug...==
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can use globbing to a limited extent in either '''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts''' or '''~/.ssh/known_hosts'''.
&lt;pre&gt;
172.19.40.* ssh-rsa AAAAB097y0yiblo97gvl...jhvlhjgluibp7y807t08mmniKjug...==
&lt;/pre&gt;
However, to get the effect you want, multiple keys for the same address, make multiple entries in either '''/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts''' or '''~/.ssh/known_hosts''', one for each key.
&lt;pre&gt;
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB097y0yiblo97gvljh...vlhjgluibp7y807t08mmniKjug...==
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB0liuouibl kuhlhlu...qerf1dcw16twc61c6cw1ryer4t...==
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB568ijh68uhg63wedx...aq14rdfcvbhu865rfgbvcfrt65...==
&lt;/pre&gt;
To get a pool of servers to share a pool of keys, each server-key combination must be added manually to the known_hosts file. 
&lt;pre&gt; 
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB097y0yiblo97gvljh...07t8mmniKjug...==
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB0liuouibl kuhlhlu...qerfw1ryer4t...==
server1 ssh-rsa AAAAB568ijh68uhg63wedx...aq14rvcfrt65...==

server2 ssh-rsa AAAAB097y0yiblo97gvljh...07t8mmniKjug...==
server2 ssh-rsa AAAAB0liuouibl kuhlhlu...qerfw1ryer4t...==
server2 ssh-rsa AAAAB568ijh68uhg63wedx...aq14rvcfrt65...==
&lt;/pre&gt;
I'm not quite sure how to get that to work with hashed host names. 

This will get the rsa key for ''server1'', put the rsa key in file (e.g. /tmp/z.key) and give a fingerprint for the key in that file:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa server1 
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa server1 &gt; /tmp/z.key 
$ ssh-keygen -l -f /tmp/z.key
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Another way of Dealing with Dynamic (roaming) IP Addresses===
It is possible to manually point to the right key using '''HostKeyAlias''' either as part of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html ssh_config(5)]  or as a runtime parameter.  Here the key for machine Foobar is used to connect to host 192.168.11.15

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh -o CheckIP=no -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
      -o HostKeyAlias=foobar   192.168.11.15
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is useful when DHCP is not configured to try to keep the same addresses for the same machines over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cryptography is a Greek word which means &quot;Secret Writing&quot;''

'''Important Uses of Cryptography'''
 1. Protect confidentiality of message (Achieved with Encryption Algorithms)
 2. Provide identity for authentication (Achieved with Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms, digital signature algorithms)
 3. Verify information to check message integrity (Achieved with hash functions)

To Validate information cryptographic function are used.

Cryptographic functions are called as '''hash functions'''

'''e.g. of Hash Functions'''
 1. MD5 (Message Digest 5)
 2. SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)

'''Types of Cryptography'''
 1. Secret key cryptography (Both parties know the same secreat key. Uses '''symmetric encryption''')
 2. Public key cryptography (Both parties have 2 different keys,'''Public key for encryption''' and '''Private key for decryption'''. 
    In Reversible public key algorithms, Data encrypted with private key can be decrypted with public key.Uses '''asymmetric encryption''')

Encryption algorithms are called '''Ciphers'''
Information in encrypted form is called '''Ciphertext'''

'''2 Types of Ciphers'''
 1. Stream Ciphers (Process data byte at a time)
 2. Block Ciphers (Process data in blocks 8 bytes at a time. Pad packets smaller than block)

'''e.g. of Symmetric Encryption Algorithms'''

 1. DES (Data Encryption Standard - Block)
 2. 3DES (Triple strength Data Encryption Standard - Block)
 3. RC2 (Rivest Cipher 2 - Block)
 4. RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4 - Stream)

'''e.g. of Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms'''

 1. RSA - Rivest Shamir Adleman
 2. DSA - Digital Signature Algorithm - Can only be used for digital signatures.

===''substr function''===
Uses
 1. get subset of string
 2. Replace subset of string with new string.

Syntax
 $value = substr($string, $offset, $count);
 $value = substr($string, $offset);

 substr($string, $offset, $count) = $newstring;
 substr($string, $offset, $count, $newstring);  # same as previous
 substr($string, $offset)         = $newtail;

E.g.

 $string = 'abcd1234';
 $subs = substr($string,4);
 print $subs;
 
 Output: 1234

 $string = 'abcd1234';
 substr($string,0,4)=&quot;pqrs&quot;;
 print $string;

 Output: pqrs1234

 # substitute &quot;at&quot; for &quot;is&quot;, restricted to first five characters
 substr($string, 0, 5) =~ s/is/at/g;

===''unpack'' function===

For positioning, use lowercase &quot;x&quot; with a count to skip forward some number of bytes, an uppercase &quot;X&quot; with a count to skip backward some number of bytes, and an &quot;@&quot; to skip to an absolute byte offset within the record.

 # extract column with unpack
 $a = &quot;To be or not to be&quot;;
 $b = unpack(&quot;x6 A6&quot;, $a);  # skip 6, grab 6
 print $b;
 or not


 ($b, $c) = unpack(&quot;x6 A2 X5 A2&quot;, $a); # forward 6, grab 2; backward 5, grab 2

'''RTOG 84-05 ([[Radiation Oncology/Liver|LIVER]])'''  
*''Title:'' Phase I/II Dose-Escalating Trial of Accelerated Fractionation in the Palliative Irradiation of Hepatic Metastases from Primary Cancer of the GI Tract 
*''Objective:'' 
**I. Assess the feasibility and efficacy of a twice-daily schedule of radiation treatments in the palliation of patients with liver metastases from cancer of the stomach, pancreas, gallbladder, biliary tree, colon, or rectum.
**II. Determine whether greater doses of hepatic irradiation in a selected population of prognostically favorable patients can result in a decreasing frequency of progressive liver metastases as a direct cause of death.
**III. Help define the tolerance of the liver to fractionated irradiation delivered in dose fractions that may ultimately be clinically useful in the elective or adjuvant irradiation of the liver in high-risk patients with primary cancers draining via the portal circulation.
*''[http://www.cancer.gov/search/ViewClinicalTrials.aspx?cdrid=72100&amp;version=HealthProfessional&amp;protocolsearchid=1985862 Protocol]:'' Whole liver dose escalation 27 Gy -&gt; 36 Gy given in 1.5 Gy/fx BID
*''Eligibility:'' Measurable hepatic metastases (as documented by CT scan) from histologically verified primary cancers arising in the stomach, pancreas, gallbladder, biliary tree, colon, or rectum.  All cell types are permissible except leukemia, plasmacytoma, and lymphoma. 
*''Enrolled:'' 173 patients
*''Conclusion:''
**PMID 8365932 -- ''Accelerated hyperfractionated hepatic irradiation in the management of patients with liver metastases: results of the RTOG dose escalating protocol.'' (Russel AH, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Sep 1;27(1):117-23.) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The study design could not credibly establish a safe dose for hepatic irradiation, however, it did succeed in determining that 33 Gy in fractions of 1.5 Gy is unsafe, carrying a substantial risk of delayed radiation injury. The absence of apparent late liver injury at the 27 Gy and 30 Gy dose levels suggests that a prior clinical trial of adjuvant hepatic irradiation in patients with resected colon cancer may have employed an insufficient radiation dose (21 Gy) to fully test the question.&quot;

*''Title:'' Phase I/II evaluation of I-131 Antiferritin after RT/CT induction
*''Objective:''
**I. Provide the necessary data to determine the maximum safe dose of adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil that can be combined with I-131 antiferritin IgG (given 30 mCi on day 0 and 20 mCi on day 5).

== Who is This Book For? ==

This is designed for a first course in Circuit Analysis which is usually accompanied by a set of labs. It is assumed that students are in a Differential Equations class at the same time. Phasors are used to avoid the Laplace transform of driving functions while maintaining a complex impedance transform of the physical circuit that is identical in both. 1st and 2nd order differential equations can be solved using phasors and calculus if the driving functions are sinusoidal. The 
sinusoidal is then replaced by the more simple step function and then the convolution integral is used to find an analytical solution to any driving function. This leaves time for a more intuitive understanding of poles, zeros, transfer functions, and Bode plot interpretation.

For those that have already had differential equations, the Laplace transform equivalent will be presented as an alternative while focusing on phasors and calculus. 

This book will expect the reader to have a firm understanding of Calculus specifically, and will not stop to explain the fundamental topics in Calculus. 

For information on Calculus, see the wikibook: [[Calculus]].

== What Will This Book Cover? ==

This book will cover linear circuits, and linear circuit elements. The goal is to emphasize Kirchhoff and symbolic algebra systems such as matLab mupad or mathematica at the expense of node, mesh, Norton, etc. A phasor/calculus based approach starts at the very beginning and ends with the convolution integral to handle all the various types of forcing functions. 

The result is a linear analysis experience that is general in nature but skips Laplace and Fourier transforms.

Krichhoff's laws receive normal focus, but the other circuit analysis/simplification techniques receive less than a normal attention.

The class ends with application of these concepts in Power Analysis, Filters, Control systems. 

The goal is set the ground work for a transition to the digital version of these concepts from a firm basis in the physical world. The next course would be one focused on modeling linear systems and analyzing them digitally in preparation for a digital signal ([[:w:Digital_signal_processing|DSP]]) processing course.

== Where to Go From Here ==

*For a technician version of this course which focuses on the real rather than the idea, expertise rather than theory, on algebra rather than calculus, see the '''[[Electronics]]''' wikibook 
*Take '''[[Ordinary_Differential_Equations]]''' now that you have a practical reason to. The math class should ideally feel like an &quot;art&quot; class and be enjoyable.
*To begin a course of study in Computer Engineering, see the '''[[Digital Circuits]]''' wikibook.
*For a traditional &quot;next&quot; course see the '''[[Signals and Systems]]''' wikibook. There should be an overlap with this one.
*The intended next course would have a name such as '''[http://www.ece.umd.edu/~adrian/enee222/textbook/enee241text0708.pdf A New Sequence in Signals and Linear Systems]''' or '''[http://www.amazon.com/Signals-Systems-using-MATLAB-Chaparro/dp/0123747163 Elements of Discrete Signal Analysis]'''.</text>

Well this is good new and can be a good way to make this book neutral. I just want to caution against turning this into an anti-drug book, since that is not any more neutral than a pro-drug book. A thought I had on how we might maintain a neutral point of view is by importing and adopting some work that already has been done on Wikipedia for use in this book. Most of [[w:Recreational drug use]] could probably be adopted for use in the Introduction chapter for example. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:36, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

:I disagree about the usefulness of [[w:Recreational drug use]], the material at the wikipedia is not very good and in many places is tagged as such.  I will try a bit harder to be neutral in my own writing and I have been careful to try to only bring in factual information that is properly sited from the websites controlled by NIDA. There will undoubtedly be some clean up necessary in the end to make sure we maintain NPOV. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 23:00, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

==Oy! What happend!==
Can we discuss renaming the entire book, I have been actively editing this and it is a bit annoying to work hard for an hour on a page click save and find a message saying the page has been deleted. For reasons I don't have time just at the moment to explain I would perfer to keep it under the previous title. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:06, 8 July 2010 (UTC)
:I like the current title as I forsee this book as potential reference during &quot;NIDA National Drug Facts Week - Shatter the Myths&quot; for which the mantra of fact vs fiction fits in quite well. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 23:02, 8 July 2010 (UTC)
:: My reasoning/thought is that the book should attempt to honor/stick with the original aim/scope of the book, which is about recreational drug use. However the book's title suggests a scope that is broader than the reality.
:: I think in the context of recreational drug use a NPOV can include the benefits from the perspective of those that use the drugs, and the dangers from a medical perspective. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:20, 9 July 2010 (UTC)
::: It is my intention rewrite the book in part to take care of the POV problems that we collectively recommended for clean up in multiple RfD's but were never implemented by anyone.  Unfortunately after I returned last evening I discovered my laptop was not plugged in and I could no longer copy and paste work elsewhere.  Which is a bit disappointing. If you plan any major restructuring of the book, particularly one that involves moving many pages, could please leave a note here to give me a heads up it would be appreciated. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:22, 9 July 2010 (UTC)
:::: Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be specific suggestions of what clean up needed to be done. I think you are already aware of the name I think this book should have so I doubt I need to mention that. Other than the name the only other structural changes I had in mind right now was to include a full table of contents, add navigational aids, and try to get this book to have an actual order for pages to be read. I had in mind to import and use work from Wikipedia to fill in a lot of missing details, not necessarily keeping everything from the Wikipedia pages, but the import would be done to preserve history and provide proper acknowledgments. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:47, 9 July 2010 (UTC)

'''What are Labels?'''

Labels are a feature found exclusively in Gmail. It's more or less the same as the Folder feature found in other web mails like Yahoo! Mail &amp; Hotmail, but definitely simpler &amp; quicker to use.

It is a simple way to set up links to find your emails quickly, and this system is used in conjunction with their Archiving system. 

[[Image:Gmail-Labels.png|thumb|left|150px|frame| Gmail Labels]]

'''How do I setup a label?'''

To set up a label, check the box next to the mail you want to label. Then go to the drop-down menu and click &quot;Add New Label&quot;. Type the label name into the pop-up. Now you will see a green box on your lower  left listing all the labels you have made. Click on it to find all emails with a given label.

'''Operator'''

You can use the operator '''label:''' in your filters or searchings.

For example, ''label:saved shows'' the email that you marked with a tag called ''saved''.

Please also note that this is not Wikipedia and the links you added to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s page are incorrect. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

okay, sure thing. But for a first attempt, i think it was very good, personally [[User:Jammi568|Jammi568]] 09:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:For a first effort, yes... but it will need to be expanded now to include all the details that are important; for instance, the fact that Harry's blood was used in Voldemort's revival was somehow interesting to Dumbledore later, and the author has suggested that we should be curious about that. The amount of interest caused by that one choice certainly makes it critical that we include that in the synopsis, and perhaps go into it in greater depth both in the analysis (where we would mention that Voldemort says that it will grant him immunity against the protection from his mother's sacrifice) and in the greater picture (where we mention Dumbledore's interest in chapter 36, and speculate on the effect it will have in Deathly Hallows).

== x86 Architecture ==
The x86 architecture has 8 General-Purpose Registers (GPR), 6 Segment Registers, 1 Flags Register and an Instruction Pointer.
{{Wikipedia|Processor register}}
=== General-Purpose Registers (GPR) ===  
The 8 GPRs are:
# Accumulator register (AX). Used in arithmetic operations.
# Base register (BX). Used as a pointer to data (located in segment register DS, when in segmented mode).
# Counter register (CX). Used in shift/rotate instructions and loops.
# Data register (DX). Used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations.
# Stack Pointer register (SP). Pointer to the top of the stack.
# Stack Base Pointer register (BP). Used to point to the base of the stack.
# Source Index register (SI). Used as a pointer to a source in stream operations.
# Destination Index register (DI). Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operations.

The order in which they are listed here is for a reason: it is the same order that is used in a push-to-stack operation, which will be covered later.

All registers can be accessed in 16-bit and 32-bit modes. In 16-bit mode, the register is identified by its two-letter abbreviation from the list above. In 32-bit mode, this two-letter abbreviation is prefixed with an 'E' (''extended''). For example, 'EAX' is the accumulator register as a 32-bit value.

Similarly, in the 64-bit version, the 'E' is replaced with an 'R', so the 64-bit version of 'EAX' is called 'RAX'.

It is also possible to address the first four registers (AX, CX, DX and BX) in their size of 16-bit as two 8-bit halves. The least significant byte (LSB), or low half, is identified by replacing the 'X' with an 'L'. The most significant byte (MSB), or high half, uses an 'H' instead. For example, CL is the LSB of the counter register, whereas CH is its MSB.

In total, this gives us five ways to access the accumulator, counter, data and base registers: 64-bit, 32-bit, 16-bit, 8-bit LSB, and 8-bit MSB. The other four are accessed in only two ways: 32-bit and 16-bit. The following table summarises this:

=== Segment Registers ===

The 6 Segment Registers are:

* Stack Segment (SS). Pointer to the stack.
* Code Segment (CS). Pointer to the code.
* Data Segment (DS). Pointer to the data.
* Extra Segment (ES). Pointer to extra data ('E' stands for 'Extra').
* F Segment (FS). Pointer to more extra data ('F' comes after 'E').
* G Segment (GS). Pointer to still more extra data ('G' comes after 'F').

Most applications on most modern operating systems (like FreeBSD, Linux or Microsoft Windows) use a memory model that points nearly all segment registers to the same place (and uses paging instead), effectively disabling their use. Typically the use of FS or GS is an exception to this rule, instead being used to point at thread-specific data.

=== EFLAGS Register ===

The EFLAGS is a 32-bit register used as a collection of bits representing Boolean values to store the results of operations and the state of the processor.

The names of these bits are:
{|  width=100% style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; 
| 31 || 30 || 29 || 28 || 27 || 26 || 25 || 24 || 23 || 22 || 21 || 20 || 19 || 18 || 17 || 16
|-  style=&quot;background-color: blue; color: white;&quot;
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || ID || VIP || VIF || AC || VM || RF
|- 
!  colspan=16 height=5 | 
|- 
!  colspan=16 style=&quot;background-color: black;&quot; | 
|- 
| 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 9 || 8 || 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1 || 0
|-  style=&quot;background-color: #777777; color: white;&quot;
| 0 || NT
!  colspan=2 | IOPL
| OF || DF || IF || TF || SF || ZF || 0 || AF || 0 || PF || 1 || CF
|} 

The bits named 0 and 1 are reserved bits and shouldn't be modified.

{|  
!  style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; colspan=2 | The different use of these flags are:
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 0. || CF : Carry Flag. Set if the last arithmetic operation carried (addition) or borrowed (subtraction) a bit beyond the size of the register.  This is then checked when the operation is followed with an add-with-carry or subtract-with-borrow to deal with values too large for just one register to contain.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 2. || PF : Parity Flag. Set if the number of set bits in the least significant byte is a multiple of 2.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 4. || AF : Adjust Flag. Carry of Binary Code Decimal (BCD) numbers arithmetic operations.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 6. || ZF : Zero Flag. Set if the result of an operation is Zero (0).
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 7. || SF : Sign Flag. Set if the result of an operation is negative.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 8. || TF : Trap Flag. Set if step by step debugging.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 9. || IF : Interruption Flag. Set if interrupts are enabled.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 10. || DF : Direction Flag. Stream direction. If set, string operations will decrement their pointer rather than incrementing it, reading memory backwards.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 11. || OF : Overflow Flag. Set if signed arithmetic operations result in a value too large for the register to contain.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 12-13. || IOPL : I/O Privilege Level field (2 bits). I/O Privilege Level of the current process.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 14. || NT : Nested Task flag. Controls chaining of interrupts. Set if the current process is linked to the next process.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 16. || RF : Resume Flag. Response to debug exceptions.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 17. || VM : Virtual-8086 Mode. Set if in 8086 compatibility mode.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 18. || AC : Alignment Check. Set if alignment checking of memory references is done.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 19. || VIF : Virtual Interrupt Flag. Virtual image of IF.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 20. || VIP : Virtual Interrupt Pending flag. Set if an interrupt is pending.
|- 
|  style=&quot;text-align: right; vertical-align: top&quot; | 21. || ID : Identification Flag. Support for CPUID instruction if can be set.
|}

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The EIP register contains the address of the '''next''' instruction to be executed if no branching is done.

EIP can only be read through the stack after a &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; instruction.

=== Memory ===

The x86 architecture is [[Wikipedia:Little endian|little-endian]], meaning that multi-byte values are written least significant byte first. (This refers only to the ordering of the bytes, not to the bits.)

So the 32 bit value B3B2B1B0&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; on an x86 would be represented in memory as:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+'''Little endian representation'''
| &lt;code&gt;B0&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;B1&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;B2&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;B3&lt;/code&gt;
|} 

For example, the 32 bits double word 0x1BA583D4 (the '''0x''' denotes hexadecimal) would be written in memory as:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+'''Little endian example'''
| &lt;code&gt;D4&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;83&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;A5&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;1B&lt;/code&gt;
|}

This will be seen as &lt;code&gt;0xD4 0x83 0xA5 0x1B&lt;/code&gt; when doing a memory dump.

=== Two's Complement Representation ===

Two's complement is the standard way of representing negative integers in binary.  The sign is changed by inverting all of the bits and adding one.

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+'''Two's complement example'''
|-
|''Start'':
|&lt;code&gt;0001&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|''Invert'':
|&lt;code&gt;1110&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|''Add One'':
|&lt;code&gt;1111&lt;/code&gt;
|}

0001 represents decimal 1

1111 represents decimal -1

=== Addressing modes ===
The addressing mode indicates the manner in which the operand is presented.

;Register Addressing:(operand address R is in the address field)
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax, bx  ; moves contents of register bx into ax&lt;/source&gt;

;Immediate: (actual value is in the field)
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax, 1   ; moves value of 1 into register ax&lt;/source&gt;
or
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax, 010Ch ; moves value of 0x010C into register ax&lt;/source&gt;

;Direct memory addressing: (operand address is in the address field)
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
.data
my_var dw 0abcdh ; my_var = 0xabcd
.code
mov ax, my_var ; copy my_var content in ax (ax=0xabcd)
mov ax, [my_var] ; idem as above
&lt;/source&gt;

;Direct offset addressing: (uses arithmetics to modify address)
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
byte_tbl db 12,15,16,22,..... ; Table of bytes
mov al,[byte_tbl+2]
mov al,byte_tbl[2] ; same as the former
&lt;/source&gt;

;Register Indirect: (field points to a register that contains the operand address)
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax,[di]&lt;/source&gt;
:The registers used for indirect addressing are BX, BP, SI, DI 

;Base-index:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax,[bx + di]&lt;/source&gt;
:For example, if we are talking about an array, BX contains the address of the beginning of the array, and DI contains the index into the array.

;Base-index with displacement:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;mov ax,[bx + di + 10]&lt;/source&gt;

== Stack ==
The stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure; data is pushed onto it and popped off of it in the reverse order. 
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
 mov ax, 006Ah
 mov bx, F79Ah
 mov cx, 1124h
 push ax
&lt;/source&gt;  
You push the value in AX onto the top of the stack, which now holds the value $006A.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;push bx&lt;/source&gt;
You do the same thing to the value in BX; the stack now has $006A and $F79A.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;push cx&lt;/source&gt;
Now the stack has $006A, $F79A, and $1124.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;call do_stuff&lt;/source&gt;
Do some stuff. The function is not forced to save the registers it uses, hence us saving them.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;pop cx&lt;/source&gt;
Pop the last element pushed onto the stack into CX, $1124; the stack now has $006A and $F79A.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;pop bx&lt;/source&gt;
Pop the last element pushed onto the stack into BX, $F79A; the stack now has just $006A.
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;pop ax&lt;/source&gt;
Pop the last element pushed onto the stack into AX, $006A; the stack is empty.

The Stack is usually used to pass arguments to functions or procedures and also to keep track of control flow when the &lt;code&gt;call&lt;code&gt; instruction is used. The other common use of the Stack is temporarily saving registers.

== CPU Operation Modes ==
=== Real Mode ===
Real Mode is a holdover from the original Intel 8086. You generally won't need to know anything about it (unless you are programming for a DOS-based system or, more likely, writing a boot loader that is directly called by the BIOS).

The Intel 8086 accessed memory using 20-bit addresses. But, as the processor itself was 16-bit, Intel invented an addressing scheme that provided a way of mapping a 20-bit addressing space into 16-bit words. Today's x86 processors start in the so-called Real Mode, which is an operating mode that mimics the behavior of the 8086, with some very tiny differences, for backwards compatibility.

In Real Mode, a segment and an offset register are used together to yield a final memory address. The value in the segment register is multiplied by 16 (shifted 4 bits to the left) and the offset is added to the result. This provides a usable address space of 1 MB. However, a quirk in the addressing scheme allows access past the 1 MB limit if a segment address of 0xFFFF (the highest possible) is used; on the 8086 and 8088, all accesses to this area wrapped around to the low end of memory, but on the 80286 and later, up to 65520 bytes past the 1 MB mark can be addressed this way if the A20 address line is enabled. ''See: [[X86 Assembly/16 32 and 64 Bits#The_A20_Gate_Saga|The A20 Gate Saga]]''.

One benefit shared by Real Mode segmentation and by [[#Multi-Segmented Memory Model|Protected Mode Multi-Segment Memory Model]] is that all addresses must be given relative to another address (this is, the segment base address). A program can have its own address space and completely ignore the segment registers, and thus no pointers have to be relocated to run the program. Programs can perform ''near'' calls and jumps within the same segment, and data is always relative to segment base addresses (which in the Real Mode addressing scheme are computed from the values loaded in the Segment Registers).

This is what the DOS *.COM format does; the contents of the file are loaded into memory and blindly run. However, due to the fact that Real Mode segments are always 64&amp;nbsp;KB long, COM files could not be larger than that (in fact, they had to fit into 65280 bytes, since DOS used the first 256 of a segment for housekeeping data); for many years this wasn't a problem.

=== Protected Mode ===
==== Flat Memory Model ====
If programming in a modern operating system (such as Linux, Windows), you are basically programming in flat 32-bit mode. Any register can be used in addressing, and it is generally more efficient to use a full 32-bit register instead of a 16-bit register part. Additionally, segment registers are generally unused in flat mode, and it is generally a bad idea to touch them.

==== Multi-Segmented Memory Model ====

Using a 32-bit register to address memory the program can access (almost) all of the memory in a modern computer. For earlier processors (with only 16-bit registers) the segmented memory model was used. The 'CS', 'DS', and 'ES' registers are used to point to the different ''chunks'' of memory. For a small program (small model) the CS=DS=ES. For larger memory models, these 'segments' can point to different locations.

== General Information ==

Examples in this article are created using the AT&amp;T assembly syntax used in GNU AS. The main advantage of using this syntax is its compatibility with the GCC inline assembly syntax. However, this is not the only syntax that is used to represent x86 operations. For example, NASM uses a different syntax to represent assembly mnemonics, operands and addressing modes, as do some [[Wikipedia:High_Level_Assembler|High-Level Assembler]]s. The AT&amp;T syntax is the standard on Unix-like systems but some assemblers use the Intel syntax, or can, like GAS itself, accept both.

GAS instructions generally have the form &lt;u&gt;mnemonic&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;source&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;destination&lt;/u&gt;. For instance, the following '''mov''' instruction:

 movb $0x05, %al

will move the value 5 into the register al.

== Operation Suffixes ==
GAS assembly instructions are generally suffixed with the letters &quot;b&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;q&quot; or &quot;t&quot; to determine what size operand is being manipulated.

*b = byte (8 bit)
*s = short (16 bit integer) or single (32-bit floating point)
*w = word (16 bit)
*l = long (32 bit integer or 64-bit floating point)
*q = quad (64 bit)
*t = ten bytes (80-bit floating point)

If the suffix is not specified, and there are no memory operands for the instruction, GAS infers the operand size from the size of the destination register operand (the final operand).

== Prefixes ==

When referencing a register, the register needs to be prefixed with a &quot;%&quot;. 
Constant numbers need to be prefixed with a &quot;$&quot;.

== Address operand syntax ==

There are up to 4 parameters of an address operand that are presented in the syntax &lt;code&gt;displacement(base register, offset register, scalar multiplier)&lt;/code&gt;.  This is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;[base register + displacement + offset register * scalar multiplier]&lt;/code&gt; in Intel syntax.  Either or both of the numeric, and either of the register parameters may be omitted:
 movl    -4(%ebp, %edx, 4), %eax  # Full example: load *(ebp - 4 + (edx * 4)) into eax
 movl    -4(%ebp), %eax           # Typical example: load a stack variable into eax
 movl    (%ecx), %edx             # No offset: copy the target of a pointer into a register
 leal    8(,%eax,4), %eax         # Arithmetic: multiply eax by 4 and add 8

This section is written as a short introduction to GAS. GAS is part of the [http://www.gnu.org/ GNU Project], which gives it the following nice properties:

*It is available on many operating systems.
*It interfaces nicely with the other GNU programming tools, including the GNU C compiler (gcc) and GNU linker (ld).

If you are using a computer with the Linux operating system, chances are you already have GAS installed on your system.  If you are using a computer with the Windows operating system, you can install GAS and other useful programming utilities by installing [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin] or [http://www.mingw.org/ Mingw].  The remainder of this introduction assumes you have installed GAS and know how to open a command-line interface and edit files.

=== Generating assembly from C code ===

Since assembly language corresponds directly to the operations a CPU performs, a carefully written assembly routine may be able to run much faster than the same routine written in a higher-level language, such as C.  On the other hand, assembly routines typically take more effort to write than the equivalent routine in C.  Thus, a typical method for quickly writing a program that performs well is to first write the program in a high-level language (which is easier to write and debug), then rewrite selected routines in assembly language (which performs better).  A good first step to rewriting a C routine in assembly language is to use the C compiler to automatically generate the assembly language.  Not only does this give you an assembly file that compiles correctly, but it also ensures that the assembly routine does exactly what you intended it to.&lt;ref&gt;This assumes that the compiler has no bugs and, more importantly, ''that the code you wrote correctly implements your intent''. Note also that compilers can sometimes rearrange the sequence of low-level operations in order to optimize the code; this preserves the overall semantics of your code but means the assembly instruction flow may not match up exactly with your algorithm steps.&lt;/ref&gt;

We will now use the GNU C compiler to generate assembly code, for the purposes of examining the GAS assembly language syntax.

Here is the classic &quot;Hello, world&quot; program, written in C:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 int main(void) {
     printf(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);
     return 0;
 }

Save that in a file called &quot;hello.c&quot;, then type at the prompt:

 gcc -o hello_c.exe hello.c

This should compile the C file and create an executable file called &quot;hello_c.exe&quot;.  If you get an error, make sure that the contents of &quot;hello.c&quot; are correct.

Now you should be able to type at the prompt:

 ./hello_c.exe

and the program should print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console.

Now that we know that &quot;hello.c&quot; is typed in correctly and does what we want, let's generate the equivalent 32-bit x86 assembly language. Type the following at the prompt:

 gcc -S -m32 hello.c

This should create a file called &quot;hello.s&quot; (&quot;.s&quot; is the file extension that the GNU system gives to assembly files). On more recent 64-bit systems, the 32-bit source tree may not be included, which will cause a &quot;bits/predefs.h fatal error&quot;; you may replace the &quot;-m32&quot; gcc directive with an &quot;-m64&quot; directive to generate 64-bit assembly instead. To compile the assembly file into an executable, type:

 gcc -o hello_asm.exe -m32 hello.s

(Note that gcc calls the assembler (as) and the linker (ld) for us.)  Now, if you type the following at the prompt:

 ./hello_asm.exe

this program should also print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console.  Not surprisingly, it does the same thing as the compiled C file.

Let's take a look at what is inside &quot;hello.s&quot;:

         .file   &quot;hello.c&quot;
         .def    ___main;        .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
         .text
 LC0:
         .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\12\0&quot;
 .globl _main
         .def    _main;  .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
 _main:
         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $8, %esp
         andl    $-16, %esp
         movl    $0, %eax
         movl    %eax, -4(%ebp)
         movl    -4(%ebp), %eax
         call    __alloca
         call    ___main
         movl    $LC0, (%esp)
         call    _printf
         movl    $0, %eax
         leave
         ret
         .def    _printf;        .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef

The contents of &quot;hello.s&quot; may vary depending on the version of the GNU tools that are installed; this version was generated with Cygwin, using gcc version 3.3.1.

The lines beginning with periods, like &quot;.file&quot;, &quot;.def&quot;, or &quot;.ascii&quot; are assembler directives -- commands that tell the assembler how to assemble the file.  The lines beginning with some text followed by a colon, like &quot;_main:&quot;, are labels, or named locations in the code.  The other lines are assembly instructions.

The &quot;.file&quot; and &quot;.def&quot; directives are for debugging.  We can leave them out:

         .text
 LC0:
         .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\12\0&quot;
 .globl _main
 _main:
         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $8, %esp
         andl    $-16, %esp
         movl    $0, %eax
         movl    %eax, -4(%ebp)
         movl    -4(%ebp), %eax
         call    __alloca
         call    ___main
         movl    $LC0, (%esp)
         call    _printf
         movl    $0, %eax
         leave
         ret

=== &quot;hello.s&quot; line-by-line ===

         .text

This line declares the start of a section of code.  You can name sections using this directive, which gives you fine-grained control over where in the executable the resulting machine code goes, which is useful in some cases, like for programming embedded systems.  Using &quot;.text&quot; by itself tells the assembler that the following code goes in the default section, which is sufficient for most purposes.

 LC0:
         .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\12\0&quot;

This code declares a label, then places some raw ASCII text into the program, starting at the label's location.  The &quot;\12&quot; specifies a line-feed character, while the &quot;\0&quot; specifies a null character at the end of the string; C routines mark the end of strings with null characters, and since we are going to call a C string routine, we need this character here. (NOTE! String in C is an array of datatype Char (Char[]) and does not exist in any other form, but because one would understand strings as a single entity from the majority of programming languages, it is clearer to express it this way).

 .globl _main

This line tells the assembler that the label &quot;_main&quot; is a global label, which allows other parts of the program to see it.  In this case, the linker needs to be able to see the &quot;_main&quot; label, since the startup code with which the program is linked calls &quot;_main&quot; as a subroutine.

 _main:

This line declares the &quot;_main&quot; label, marking the place that is called from the startup code.

         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $8, %esp

These lines save the value of EBP on the stack, then move the value of ESP into EBP, then subtract 8 from ESP.  Note that pushl automatically decremented ESP by the appropriate length.  The &quot;l&quot; on the end of each opcode indicates that we want to use the version of the opcode that works with &quot;long&quot; (32-bit) operands; usually the assembler is able to work out the correct opcode version from the operands, but just to be safe, it's a good idea to include the &quot;l&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or other suffix.  The percent signs designate register names, and the dollar sign designates a literal value.  This sequence of instructions is typical at the start of a subroutine to save space on the stack for local variables; EBP is used as the base register to reference the local variables, and a value is subtracted from ESP to reserve space on the stack (since the Intel stack grows from higher memory locations to lower ones).  In this case, eight bytes have been reserved on the stack.  We shall see why this space is needed later.

         andl    $-16, %esp

This code &quot;and&quot;s ESP with 0xFFFFFFF0, aligning the stack with the next lowest 16-byte boundary.  An examination of Mingw's source code reveals that this may be for SIMD instructions appearing in the &quot;_main&quot; routine, which operate only on aligned addresses.  Since our routine doesn't contain SIMD instructions, this line is unnecessary.

         movl    $0, %eax
         movl    %eax, -4(%ebp)
         movl    -4(%ebp), %eax

This code moves zero into EAX, then moves EAX into the memory location EBP-4, which is in the temporary space we reserved on the stack at the beginning of the procedure.  Then it moves the memory location EBP-4 back into EAX; clearly, this is not optimized code.  Note that the parentheses indicate a memory location, while the number in front of the parentheses indicates an offset from that memory location.

         call    __alloca
         call    ___main

These functions are part of the C library setup.  Since we are calling functions in the C library, we probably need these.  The exact operations they perform vary depending on the platform and the version of the GNU tools that are installed.

         movl    $LC0, (%esp)
         call    _printf

This code (finally!) prints our message.  First, it moves the location of the ASCII string to the top of the stack.  It seems that the C compiler has optimized a sequence of &quot;popl %eax; pushl $LC0&quot; into a single move to the top of the stack.  Then, it calls the _printf subroutine in the C library to print the message to the console.

         movl    $0, %eax

This line stores zero, our return value, in EAX.  The C calling convention is to store return values in EAX when exiting a routine.

         leave

This line, typically found at the end of subroutines, frees the space saved on the stack by copying EBP into ESP, then popping the saved value of EBP back to EBP.

         ret

This line returns control to the calling procedure by popping the saved instruction pointer from the stack.

=== Communicating directly with the operating system ===

Note that we only have to call the C library setup routines if we need to call functions in the C library, like &quot;printf&quot;.  We could avoid calling these routines if we instead communicate directly with the operating system.  The disadvantage of communicating directly with the operating system is that we lose portability; our code will be locked to a specific operating system.  For instructional purposes, though, let's look at how one might do this under Windows.  Here is the C source code, compilable under Mingw or Cygwin:

 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
 
 int main(void) {
     LPSTR text = &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;
     DWORD charsWritten;
     HANDLE hStdout;
 
     hStdout = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
     WriteFile(hStdout, text, 14, &amp;charsWritten, NULL);
     return 0;
 }

Ideally, you'd want check the return codes of &quot;GetStdHandle&quot; and &quot;WriteFile&quot; to make sure they are working correctly, but this is sufficient for our purposes.  Here is what the generated assembly looks like:

         .file   &quot;hello2.c&quot;
         .def    ___main;        .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
         .text
 LC0:
         .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\12\0&quot;
 .globl _main
         .def    _main;  .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
 _main:
         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $4, %esp
         andl    $-16, %esp
         movl    $0, %eax
         movl    %eax, -16(%ebp)
         movl    -16(%ebp), %eax
         call    __alloca
         call    ___main
         movl    $LC0, -4(%ebp)
         movl    $-11, (%esp)
         call    _GetStdHandle@4
         subl    $4, %esp
         movl    %eax, -12(%ebp)
         movl    $0, 16(%esp)
         leal    -8(%ebp), %eax
         movl    %eax, 12(%esp)
         movl    $14, 8(%esp)
         movl    -4(%ebp), %eax
         movl    %eax, 4(%esp)
         movl    -12(%ebp), %eax
         movl    %eax, (%esp)
         call    _WriteFile@20
         subl    $20, %esp
         movl    $0, %eax
         leave
         ret

Even though we never use the C standard library, the generated code initializes it for us.  Also, there is a lot of unnecessary stack manipulation.  We can simplify:

         .text
 LC0:
         .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\12&quot;
 .globl _main
 _main:
         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $4, %esp
         pushl   $-11
         call    _GetStdHandle@4
         pushl   $0
         leal    -4(%ebp), %ebx
         pushl   %ebx
         pushl   $14
         pushl   $LC0
         pushl   %eax
         call    _WriteFile@20
         movl    $0, %eax
         leave
         ret
 
Analyzing line-by-line:

         pushl   %ebp
         movl    %esp, %ebp
         subl    $4, %esp

We save the old EBP and reserve four bytes on the stack, since the call to WriteFile needs somewhere to store the number of characters written, which is a 4-byte value.

         pushl   $-11
         call    _GetStdHandle@4

We push the constant value STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE (-11) to the stack and call GetStdHandle.  The returned handle value is in EAX.

         pushl   $0
         leal    -4(%ebp), %ebx
         pushl   %ebx
         pushl   $14
         pushl   $LC0
         pushl   %eax
         call    _WriteFile@20

We push the parameters to WriteFile and call it.  Note that the Windows calling convention is to push the parameters from right-to-left.  The load-effective-address (&quot;lea&quot;) instruction adds -4 to the value of EBP, giving the location we saved on the stack for the number of characters printed, which we store in EBX and then push onto the stack.  Also note that EAX still holds the return value from the GetStdHandle call, so we just push it directly.

         movl    $0, %eax
         leave

Here we set our program's return value and restore the values of EBP and ESP using the &quot;leave&quot; instruction.

=== Caveats ===

From [http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/i386_002dBugs.html#i386_002dBugs The GAS manual's AT&amp;T Syntax Bugs section]:

The UnixWare assembler, and probably other AT&amp;T derived ix86 Unix assemblers, generate floating point instructions with reversed source and destination registers in certain cases. Unfortunately, gcc and possibly many other programs use this reversed syntax, so we're stuck with it.

For example

         fsub %st,%st(3)

results in &lt;code&gt;%st(3)&lt;code&gt; being updated to &lt;code&gt;%st - %st(3)&lt;/code&gt; rather than the expected &lt;code&gt;%st(3) - %st&lt;/code&gt;. This happens with all the non-commutative arithmetic floating point operations with two register operands where the source register is &lt;code&gt;%st&lt;/code&gt; and the destination register is &lt;code&gt;%st(i)&lt;/code&gt;. 

Note that even objdump -d -M intel still uses reversed opcodes, so use a different disassembler to check this. See http://bugs.debian.org/372528 for more info.

=== Suffixes ===

Some instructions, especially when built for non-Windows platforms (i.e. Unix, Linux, etc.), require the use of suffixes to specify the size of the data which will be the subject of the operation.  Some possible suffixes are:
* b (byte) = 8 bits
* w (word) = 16 bits
* l (long) = 32 bits
* q (quad) = 64 bits

An example of the usage with the [[mov]] instruction on a 32-bit architecture, GAS syntax:
     movl $0x000F, %eax          # Store the value F into the eax register

While integers are sufficient for some applications, it is often necessary to use the floating point coprocessor to manipulate numbers with fractional parts.

== x87 Coprocessor ==

The original x86 family members had a separate math coprocessor that handled floating point arithmetic. The original coprocessor was the 8087, and all FPUs since have been dubbed &quot;x87&quot; chips. Later variants integrated the floating point unit (FPU) into the microprocessor itself. Having the capability to manage floating point numbers means a few things:
#The microprocessor must have space to store floating point numbers
#The microprocessor must have instructions to manipulate floating point numbers
The FPU, even when it is integrated into an x86 chip, is still called the &quot;x87&quot; section. For instance, literature on the subject will frequently call the FPU Register Stack the &quot;x87 Stack&quot;, and the FPU operations will frequently be called the &quot;x87 instruction set&quot;.

== FPU Register Stack ==

The FPU has 8 registers, st0 to st7, formed into a stack. Numbers are pushed onto the stack from memory, and are popped off the stack back to memory. FPU instructions generally will pop the first two items off the stack, act on them, and push the answer back on to the top of the stack.

Floating point numbers may generally be either 32 bits long (C &quot;float&quot; type), or 64 bits long (C &quot;double&quot; type). However, in order to reduce round-off errors, the FPU stack registers are all 80 bits wide.

Most [[X86 Assembly/High-Level_Languages#C_Calling_Conventions|calling conventions]] return floating point values in the st0 register.

== Examples ==
The following program (using [[X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax|NASM]] syntax) calculates the square root of 123.45.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global _start

section .data
    val: dq 123.45  ;declare quad word (double precision)

section .bss
    res: resq 1     ;reserve 1 quad word for result

section .text
    _start:

    fld qword [val] ;load value into st0
    fsqrt           ;compute square root of st0 and store in st0
    fst qword [res] ;store st0 in result

    ;end program
&lt;/source&gt;

Essentially, programs that use the FPU load values onto the stack with &lt;code&gt;FLD&lt;/code&gt; and its variants, perform operations on these values, then store them into memory with one of the forms of &lt;code&gt;FST&lt;/code&gt;. Because the x87 stack can only be accessed by FPU instructions ‒ you cannot write &lt;code&gt;mov eax, st0&lt;/code&gt; ‒ it is necessary to store values to memory if you want to print them, for example.

A more complex example that evaluates the [[Trigonometry/Law_of_Cosines|Law of Cosines]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
;; c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - cos(C)*2*a*b
;; C is stored in ang

global _start

section .data
    a: dq 4.56   ;length of side a
    b: dq 7.89   ;length of side b
    ang: dq 1.5  ;opposite angle to side c (around 85.94 degrees)

section .bss
    c: resq 1    ;the result ‒ length of side c

section .text
    _start:

    fld qword [a]   ;load a into st0
    fmul st0, st0   ;st0 = a * a = a^2

    fld qword [b]   ;load b into st1
    fmul st1, st1   ;st1 = b * b = b^2

    fadd st0, st1   ;st0 = a^2 + b^2

    fld qword [ang] ;load angle into st0
    fcos            ;st0 = cos(ang)

    fmul qword [a]  ;st0 = cos(ang) * a
    fmul qword [b]  ;st0 = cos(ang) * a * b
    fadd st0, st0   ;st0 = cos(ang) * a * b * 2

    fsubp st1, st0  ;st1 = st1 - st0 = (a^2 + b^2) - (2 * a * b * cos(ang))
                    ;and pop st0

    fsqrt           ;take square root of st0 = c

    fst qword [c]   ;store st0 in c ‒ and we're done!

    ;end program
&lt;/source&gt;

== Floating-Point Instruction Set ==

You may notice that some of the instructions below differ from another in name by just one letter: a '''P''' appended to the end. This suffix signifies that in addition to performing the normal operation, they also '''P'''op the x87 stack after execution is complete.

{{Wikipedia|MMX (instruction set)}}

MMX is a supplemental instruction set introduced by Intel in 1996. Most of the new instructions are &quot;single instruction, multiple data&quot; (SIMD), meaning that single instructions work with multiple pieces of data in parallel. 

MMX has a few problems, though: instructions run slightly slower than the regular arithmetic instructions, the FPU can't be used when the MMX registers are in use, and MMX registers use saturation arithmetic.

== Saturation Arithmetic ==
In an 8-bit grayscale picture, 255 is the value for pure white, and 0 is the value for pure black. In a regular register (AX, BX, CX ...) if we add one to white, we get black! This is because the regular registers &quot;roll-over&quot; to the next value. MMX registers get around this by a technique called &quot;Saturation Arithmetic&quot;. In saturation arithmetic, the value of the register never rolls over to 0 again. This means that in the MMX world, we have the following equations:

 255 + 100 = 255
 200 + 100 = 255
 0 - 100 = 0;
 99 - 100 = 0;

This may seem counter-intuitive at first to people who are used to their registers rolling over, but it makes sense in some situations: if we try to make white brighter, it shouldn't become black.

== Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) Instructions ==

The MMX registers are 64 bits wide, but can be broken down as follows:

 2 32 bit values
 4 16 bit values
 8 8 bit values

The MMX registers cannot easily be used for 64 bit arithmetic. Let's say that we have 4 bytes loaded in an MMX register: 10, 25, 128, 255. We have them arranged as such:

 MM0: | 10 | 25 | 128 | 255 |

And we do the following pseudo code operation:

 MM0 + 10

We would get the following result:

 MM0: | 10+10 | 25+10 | 128+10 | 255+10 | = | 20 | 35 | 138 | 255 |

Remember that our arithmetic &quot;saturates&quot; in the last box, so the value doesn't go over 255.

Using MMX, we are essentially performing 4 additions in the time it takes to perform 1 addition using the regular registers, using 4 times fewer instructions. 

== MMX Registers ==

There are 8 64-bit MMX registers. To avoid having to add new registers, they were made to overlap with the FPU stack register. This means that '''the MMX instructions and the FPU instructions cannot be used simultaneously'''. MMX registers are addressed directly, and do not need to be accessed by pushing and popping in the same way as the FPU registers. 

 MM7 MM6 MM5 MM4 MM3 MM2 MM1 MM0

These registers correspond to to same numbered FPU registers on the FPU stack.

Usually when you initiate an assembly block in your code that contains 
MMX instructions, the CPU automatically will disallow floating point 
instructions. To re-allow FPU operations you must end all MMX code with 
&lt;code&gt;emms&lt;/code&gt;. Here is an example of a C routine calling assembly language 
with MMX code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
//---------------------------------------------------
// A simple example using MMX to copy 8 bytes of data 
// From source s2 to destination s1
//---------------------------------------------------
void __fastcall CopyMemory8(char *s1, const char *s2)
{
    __asm
    {
        push edx	//save state
        mov ecx, s2	//load data pointers
        mov edx, s1
        movq mm0, [ecx] //move quad-word (64 bits) into mm0
        movq [edx], mm0 //store in s1
        pop edx		//restore edx
        emms		//re-allow floating point operations
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

NOTE: this example will probably only work with Borland C++ compatible compilers.

== MMX Instruction Set ==
Several suffixes are used to indicate what data size the instruction operates on:
*'''B'''yte (8 bits)
*'''W'''ord (16 bits)
*'''D'''ouble word (32 bits)
*'''Q'''uad word (64 bits)

The signedness of the operation is also signified by the suffix: '''US''' for unsigned and '''S''' for signed.

For example, PSUB''USB'' subtracts unsigned bytes, while PSUB''SD'' subtracts signed double words.

{{Wikipedia|Streaming SIMD Extensions}}

SSE stands for '''Streaming SIMD Extensions'''. It is essentially the floating-point equivalent of the MMX instructions. The SSE registers are 128 bits, and can be used to perform operations on a variety of data sizes and types. Unlike MMX, the SSE registers do not overlap with the floating point stack.

== Registers ==

SSE, introduced by Intel in 1999 with the Pentium III, creates eight new 128-bit registers:

 XMM0 XMM1 XMM2 XMM3 XMM4 XMM5 XMM6 XMM7

Originally, an SSE register could only be used as four 32-bit single precision floating point numbers (the equivalent of a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; in C). SSE2 expanded the capabilities of the XMM registers, so they can now be used as:

 2 64-bit floating points (double precision)
 2 64-bit integers
 
 4 32-bit floating points (single-precision)
 4 32-bit integers
 
 8 16-bit integers
 
 16 8-bit characters (bytes)

==Data movement examples==
The following program (using [[X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax|NASM]] syntax) performs data movements using SIMD instructions.

    addps xmm0, xmm1    ;add the 4 numbers in xmm1 (from v2) to the 4 numbers in xmm0 (from v1), store in xmm0. for the first float the result will be 5.5+1.1=6.6
    mulps xmm0, xmm1    ;multiply the four numbers in xmm1 (from v2, unchanged) with the results from the previous calculation (in xmm0), store in xmm0. for the first float the result will be 5.5*6.6=36.3
    subps xmm0, xmm1    ;subtract the four numbers in v2 (in xmm1, still unchanged) from result from previous calculation (in xmm1). for the first float, the result will be 36.3-5.5=30.8
    
    movups [v3], xmm0   ;store v1 in v3
    
    ;end program

===Debugger commands explained===
;break: In this case, sets a breakpoint at a given label
;stepi: Steps one instruction forward in the program
;p: short for '''p'''rint, prints a given register or variable. Registers are prefixed by $ in GDB.
;x: short for e'''x'''amine, examines a given memory address. The &quot;/4f&quot; means &quot;4 floats&quot; (floats in GDB are 32-bits). You can use c for chars, x for hexadecimal and any other number instead of 4 of course. The &quot;&amp;&quot; takes the address of v1, as in C.

==Shuffling example using &lt;tt&gt;shufps&lt;/tt&gt;==
{{x86-inst-3x|att={{{1|shufps}}}|intel={{{1|shufps}}}|src={{{2|arg1}}}|dest={{{3|arg2}}}|aux={{{4|IMM8}}}}}

&lt;code&gt;shufps&lt;/code&gt; can be used to shuffle packed single-precision floats. The instruction takes three parameters, &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; an xmm register, &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; an xmm or a 128-bit memory location and &lt;code&gt;IMM8&lt;/code&gt; an 8-bit immediate control byte. &lt;code&gt;shufps&lt;/code&gt; will take two elements each from &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, copying the elements to &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;. The lower two elements will come from &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and the higher two elements from &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;.

===IMM8 control byte description===

IMM8 control byte is split into four group of bit fields that control the output into &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; as follows:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[1:0]&lt;/code&gt; specifies which element of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; ends up in the least significant element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[1:0]
!Description
|-
| 00b || Copy to the least significant element 
|-
| 01b || Copy to the second element
|-
| 10b || Copy to the third element
|-
| 11b || Copy to the most significant element
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[3:2]&lt;/code&gt; specifies which element of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; ends up in the second element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

|-
| 11b || Copy to the most significant element
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[5:4]&lt;/code&gt; specifies which element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; ends up in the third element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[7:6]&lt;/code&gt; specifies which element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; ends up in the most significant element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

'''IMM8 Example'''

Consider the byte 0x1B:
&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Byte value&lt;td colspan=8 style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;0x1B&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Nibble value&lt;td colspan=4 style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;0x1&lt;td colspan=4 style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;0xB&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2-bit integer (decimal) value&lt;td colspan=2 style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;0&lt;td colspan=2 style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;1&lt;td colspan=2 style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;2&lt;td colspan=2 style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;3
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Bit value&lt;td&gt;0&lt;td&gt;0&lt;td&gt;0&lt;td&gt;1&lt;td&gt;1&lt;td&gt;0&lt;td&gt;1&lt;td&gt;1
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Bit number (0 being LSB)&lt;th&gt;7&lt;th&gt;6&lt;th&gt;5&lt;th&gt;4&lt;th&gt;3&lt;th&gt;2&lt;th&gt;1&lt;th&gt;0&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The 2-bit values shown above are used to determine which elements are copied to &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;. Bits 7-4 are &quot;indexes&quot; into &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, and bits 3-0 are &quot;indexes&quot; into the &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt;.
*Since bits 7-6 are 0, the least significant element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; is copied to the most significant elements of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, bits 127-96.
*Since bits 5-4 are 1, the second element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; is copied to third element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, bits 95-64.
*Since bits 3-2 are 2, the third element of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; is copied to the second element of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, bits 63-32.
*Since bits 0-1 are 3, the fourth element of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; is copied to the least significant elements of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;, bits (31-0).

Note that since the first and second arguments are equal in the following example, the mask 0x1B will effectively reverse the order of the floats in the XMM register, since the 2-bit integers are 0, 1, 2, 3. Had it been 3, 2, 1, 0 (0xE4) it would be a no-op. Had it been 0, 0, 0, 0 (0x00) it would be a broadcast of the least significant 32 bits.

==Text Processing Instructions==

SSE 4.2 adds four string text processing instructions &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRM&lt;/code&gt;. These instructions take three parameters, &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; an xmm register, &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; an xmm or a 128-bit memory location and &lt;code&gt;IMM8&lt;/code&gt; an 8-bit immediate control byte. These instructions will perform arithmetic comparison between the packed contents of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;IMM8&lt;/code&gt; specifies the format of the input/output as well as the operation of two intermediate stages of processing. The results of stage 1 and stage 2 of intermediate processing will be referred to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt; respectively. These instructions also provide additional information about the result through overload use of the arithmetic flags(&lt;code&gt;AF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ZF&lt;/code&gt;). 

The instructions proceed in multiple steps:
#&lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; are compared
#An aggregation operation is applied to the result of the comparison with the result flowing into &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;
#An optional negation is performed with the result flowing into &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;
#An output in the form of an index(in &lt;code&gt;ECX&lt;/code&gt;) or a mask(in &lt;code&gt;XMM0&lt;/code&gt;) is produced

===IMM8 control byte description===

IMM8 control byte is split into four group of bit fields that control the following settings:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[1:0]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the format of the 128-bit source data(&lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[1:0]
!Description
|-
| 00b || unsigned bytes(16 packed unsigned bytes)
|-
| 01b || unsigned words(8  packed unsigned words)
|-
| 10b || signed bytes(16 packed signed bytes)
|-
| 11b || signed words(8  packed signed words)
|}
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[3:2]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the aggregation operation whose result will be placed in intermediate result 1, which we will refer to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;. The size of &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt; will depend on the format of the source data, 16-bit for packed bytes and 8-bit for packed words:

!IMM8[3:2]
!Description
|-
| 00b ||  &lt;b&gt;Equal Any&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a character set, arg2 is the string to search in. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg2[i] is in the set represented by arg1:
               arg1    = &quot;aeiou&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;Example string 1&quot;
               IntRes1 =  1010001000010000
|-
| 01b ||&lt;b&gt;Ranges&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a set of character ranges i.e. &quot;09az&quot; means all characters from 0 to 9 and from a to z., arg2 is the string to search over. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg[i] is in any of the ranges represented by arg1:

               arg1    = &quot;09az&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;Testing 1 2 3, T&quot;
               IntRes1 =  0111111010101000
|-
| 10b || &lt;b&gt;Equal Each&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is string one and arg2 is string two. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if arg1[i] == arg2[i]:

               arg1    = &quot;The quick brown &quot;
               arg2    = &quot;The quack green &quot;
               IntRes1 =  1111110111010011
|-
| 11b || &lt;b&gt;Equal Ordered&lt;/b&gt;, arg1 is a substring string to search for, arg2 is the string to search within. IntRes1[i] is set to 1 if the substring arg1 can be found at position arg2[i]:

               arg1    = &quot;he&quot;
               arg2    = &quot;, he helped her &quot;
               IntRes1 =  0010010000001000
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[5:4]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the polarity or the processing of &lt;code&gt;IntRes1&lt;/code&gt;, into intermediate result 2, which will be referred to as &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[5:4]
!Description
|-
| 00b || &lt;b&gt;Positive Polarity&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1
|-
| 01b || &lt;b&gt;Negative Polarity&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = -1 XOR IntRes1
|-
| 10b || &lt;b&gt;Masked Positive&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1
|-
| 11b || &lt;b&gt;Masked Negative&lt;/b&gt; || IntRes2      = IntRes1 if reg/mem[i] is invalid else ~IntRes1 
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[6]&lt;/code&gt; specifies the output selection, or how &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt; will be processed into the output. For &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRI&lt;/code&gt;, the output is an index into the data currently referenced by &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[6]
!Description
|-
| 0b || &lt;b&gt;Least Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || ECX contains the least significant set bit in IntRes2
|-
| 1b || &lt;b&gt;Most Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || ECX contains the least significant set bit in IntRes2
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For &lt;code&gt;PCMPESTRM&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PCMPISTRM&lt;/code&gt;, the output is a mask reflecting all the set bits in &lt;code&gt;IntRes2&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!IMM8[6]
!Description
|-
| 0b || &lt;b&gt;Least Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || Bit Mask, the least significant bits of XMM0 contain the IntRes2 16(8) bit mask. XMM0 is zero extended to 128-bits.
|-
| 1b || &lt;b&gt;Most Significant Index&lt;/b&gt; || Byte/Word Mask, XMM0 contains IntRes2 expanded into byte/word mask
|}
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IMM8[7]&lt;/code&gt; should be set to zero since it has no designed meaning.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

==SSE Instruction Set==

There are literally hundreds of SSE instructions, some of which are capable of much more than simple SIMD arithmetic. For more in-depth references take a look at the [[X86 Assembly/Resources|resources]] chapter of this book.

You may notice that many floating point SSE instructions end with something like PS or SD. These suffixes differentiate between different versions of the operation. The first letter describes whether the instruction should be '''P'''acked or '''S'''calar. Packed operations are applied to every member of the register, while scalar operations are applied to only the first value. For example, in pseudo-code, a packed add would be executed as:
 v1[0] = v1[0] + v2[0]
 v1[1] = v1[1] + v2[1]
 v1[2] = v1[2] + v2[2]
 v1[3] = v1[3] + v2[3]
While a scalar add would only be:
 v1[0] = v1[0] + v2[0]
The second letter refers to the data size: either '''S'''ingle or '''D'''ouble. This simply tells the processor whether to use the register as four 32-bit floats or two 64-bit doubles, respectively.

      <comment>/* Compilers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly Page}}

Very few projects are written entirely in assembly. It's often used for accessing processor-specific features, optimizing critical sections of code, and very low-level work, but for many applications, it can be simpler and easier to implement the basic control flow and data manipulation routines in a higher level language, like C. For this reason, it is often necessary to interface between assembly language and other languages.

== Compilers ==
The first compilers were simply text translators that converted a high-level language into assembly language. The assembly language code was then fed into an assembler, to create the final machine code output. The GCC compiler still performs this sequence (code is compiled into assembly, and fed to the AS assembler). However, many modern compilers will skip the assembly language and create the machine code directly. 

Assembly language code has the benefit that it is in one-to-one correspondence with the underlying machine code. Each machine instruction is mapped directly to a single Assembly instruction. Because of this, even when a compiler directly creates the machine code, it is still possible to interface that code with an assembly language program. The important part is knowing exactly how the language implements its data structures, control structures, and functions. The method in which function calls are implemented by a high-level language compiler is called a '''calling convention'''.

The calling convention is a contract between the function and caller of the function and specifies several parameters:

# How the arguments are passed to the function, and in what order? Are they pushed onto the stack, or are they passed in via the registers?
# How are return values passed back to the caller? This is usually via registers or on the stack.
# What processor states are volatile (available for modification)? Volatile registers are available for modification by the function. The caller is responsible for saving the state of those registers if needed. '''Non-volatile''' registers are guaranteed to be preserved by the function. The called function is responsible for saving the state of those registers and restoring those registers on exit.
# The function '''prologue''' and '''epilogue''', which sets up the registers and stack for use within the function and then restores the stack and registers before exiting.

== C Calling Conventions == 
{{Wikipedia|x86 calling conventions}}

=== CDECL ===
For C compilers, the CDECL calling convention is the de facto standard. It varies by compiler but, the programmer can specify that a function be implemented using CDECL usually by pre-appending the function declaration with a keyword, for example '''__cdecl''' in Visual studio:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int __cdecl func()
&lt;/source&gt;

in gcc it would be '''__attribute__( (__cdecl__ ))''':

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int __attribute__((__cdecl__ )) func()
&lt;/source&gt;

CDECL calling convention specifies a number of different requirements:

#Function arguments are passed on the stack, in '''right-to-left''' order. 
#Function result is stored in EAX/AX/AL
#Floating point return values will be returned in ST0
#The function name is pre-appended with an underscore.
#The arguments are popped from the stack by the caller itself.
#8-bit and 16-bit integer arguments are promoted to 32-bit arguments.
#The volatile registers are: EAX, ECX, EDX, ST0 - ST7, ES and GS
#The non-volatile registers are: EBX, EBP, ESP, EDI, ESI, CS and DS
#The function will exit with a RET instruction.
#The function is supposed to return values types of class or structure via a reference in EAX/AX. The space is supposed to be allocated by the function, which unable to use the stack or heap is left with fixed address in static non-constant storage. This is inherently not thread safe. Many compilers will break the calling convention:
##GCC has the calling code allocate space and passes a pointer to this space via a hidden parameter on the stack. The called function writes the return value to this address.
##Visual C++ will:
###Pass POD return values 32 bits or smaller in the EAX register.
###Pass POD return values 33-64 bits in size via the EAX:EDX registers
###For non-POD return values or values larger than 64-bits, the calling code will allocate space and passes a pointer to this space via a hidden parameter on the stack. The called function writes the return value to this address.


CDECL functions are capable of accepting variable argument lists. Below is example using cdecl calling convention:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global main 

extern printf

section .data
	align 4
	a:	dd 1
	b:	dd 2
	c:	dd 3
	fmtStr:	db &quot;Result: %d&quot;, 0x0A, 0

section .bss
	align 4

section .text
				
;
; int func( int a, int b, int c )
; {
;	return a + b + c ;
; }
;
func:
	push	ebp		; Save ebp on the stack 
	mov	ebp, esp	; Replace ebp with esp since we will be using
				; ebp as the base ponter for the functions
				; stack.
				;
				; The arguments start at ebp+8 since calling the
				; the function places eip on the stack and the
				; function places ebp on the stack as part of
				; the preamble.
				;
	mov	eax, [ebp+8]	; mov a int eax
	mov	edx, [ebp+12]	; add b to eax
	lea	eax, [eax+edx]	; Using lea for arithmetic adding a + b into eax
	add	eax, [ebp+16]	; add c to eax
	pop	ebp		; restore ebp
	ret			; Returning, eax contains result

	;
	; Using main since we are using gcc to link
	;
	main:

	;
	; Set up for call to func(int a, int b, int c)
	;
	; Push variables in right to left order 
	;
	push	dword [c]
	push	dword [b]
	push	dword [a]
	call	func
	add	esp, 12		; Pop stack 3 times 4 bytes
	push	eax
	push	dword fmtStr
	call	printf
	add	esp, 8		; Pop stack 2 times 4 bytes

	;
	; Alternative to using push for function call setup, this is the method
	; used by gcc
	;
	sub	esp, 12		; Create space on stack for three 4 byte variables
	mov	ecx, [b]
	mov	eax, [a]
	mov	[esp+8], dword 4 
	mov	[esp+4], ecx
	mov	[esp],	 eax
	call	func
	;push	eax
	;push	dword fmtStr
	mov	[esp+4], eax
	lea	eax, [fmtStr]
	mov	[esp], eax 
	call	printf

				;
				; Call exit(3) syscall
				;	void exit(int status)
				;
	mov	ebx, 0		; Arg one: the status
	mov	eax, 1		; Syscall number:
	int 	0x80
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
nasm -felf32 -g cdecl.asm 
gcc -o cdecl cdecl.o
./cdecl
&lt;/source&gt;

=== STDCALL ===
STDCALL is the calling convention that is used when interfacing with the Win32 API on Microsoft Windows systems. STDCALL was created by Microsoft, and therefore isn't always supported by non-Microsoft compilers. It varies by compiler but, the programmer can specify that a function be implemented using STDCALL usually by pre-appending the function declaration with a keyword, for example '''__stdcall''' in Visual studio:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int __stdcall func()
&lt;/source&gt;

in gcc it would be '''__attribute__( (__stdcall__ ))''':

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int __attribute__((__stdcall__ )) func()
&lt;/source&gt;

STDCALL has the following requirements:

#Function arguments are passed on the stack in '''right-to-left''' order.
#Function result is stored in EAX/AX/AL
#Floating point return values will be returned in ST0
#64-bits integers and 32/16 bit pointers will be returned via the EAX:EDX registers.
#8-bit and 16-bit integer arguments are promoted to 32-bit arguments.
#Function name is prefixed with an underscore
#Function name is suffixed with an &quot;@&quot; sign, followed by the number of bytes of arguments being passed to it.
#The arguments are popped from the stack by the callee (the called function).
#The volatile registers are: EAX, ECX, EDX, and ST0 - ST7
#The non-volatile registers are: EBX, EBP, ESP, EDI, ESI, CS, DS, ES, FS and GS
#The function will exit with a RET n instruction, the called function will pop n additional bytes off the stack when it returns.
#POD return values 32 bits or smaller will be returned in the EAX register.
#POD return values 33-64 bits in size will be returned via the EAX:EDX registers.
#Non-POD return values or values larger than 64-bits, the calling code will allocate space and passes a pointer to this space via a hidden parameter on the stack. The called function writes the return value to this address.

STDCALL functions are not capable of accepting variable argument lists.

For example, the following function declaration in C:

 _stdcall void MyFunction(int, int, short);

would be accessed in assembly using the following function label:

 _MyFunction@12

Remember, on a 32 bit machine, passing a 16 bit argument on the stack (C &quot;short&quot;) takes up a full 32 bits of space.

=== FASTCALL ===
FASTCALL functions can frequently be specified with the '''__fastcall''' keyword in many compilers. FASTCALL functions pass the first two arguments to the function in registers, so that the time-consuming stack operations can be avoided. FASTCALL has the following requirements:

#The first 32-bit (or smaller) argument is passed in ECX/CX/CL (see [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6xa169sk.aspx])
#The second 32-bit (or smaller) argument is passed in EDX/DX/DL
#The remaining function arguments (if any) are passed on the stack in right-to-left order
#The function result is returned in EAX/AX/AL
#The function name is prefixed with an &quot;@&quot; symbol
#The function name is suffixed with an &quot;@&quot; symbol, followed by the size of passed arguments, in bytes.

== C++ Calling Conventions (THISCALL) ==
The C++ THISCALL calling convention is the standard calling convention for C++. In THISCALL, the function is called almost identically to the CDECL convention, but the '''this''' pointer (the pointer to the current class) must be passed.

The way that the '''this''' pointer is passed is compiler-dependent.  Microsoft Visual C++ passes it in ECX.  GCC passes it as if it were the first parameter of the function.  (i.e. between the return address and the first formal parameter.)

== Ada Calling Conventions ==

== Pascal Calling Conventions ==

The Pascal convention is essentially identical to cdecl, differing only in that:

# The parameters are pushed left to right (logical western-world reading order)
# The routine being called must clean the stack before returning

Additionally, each parameter on the 32-bit stack must use all four bytes of the DWORD, regardless of the actual size of the datum.

This is the main calling method used by Windows API routines, as it is slightly more efficient with regard to memory usage, stack access and calling speed.


Note: the Pascal convention is NOT the same as the Borland Pascal convention, which is a form of fastcall, using registers (eax, edx, ecx) to pass the first three parameters, and also known as Register Convention.

== Fortran Calling Conventions ==

== Inline Assembly ==

=== C/C++ ===

This Borland C++ example splits &lt;code&gt;byte_data&lt;/code&gt; into two bytes in &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt;, the first containing high 4 bits and low 4 bits in the second.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void ByteToHalfByte(BYTE *buf, int pos, BYTE byte_data)
{
    asm
    {
        mov al, byte_data
        mov ah, al
        shr al, 04h
        and ah, 0Fh
        mov ecx, buf
        mov edx, pos
        mov [ecx+edx], al
        mov [ecx+edx+1], ah
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly Page}}

This page will explain x86 Programming using MASM syntax, and will also discuss how to use the macro capabilities of MASM. Other assemblers, such as [[X86 Assembly/NASM Syntax|NASM]] and [[X86 Assembly/FASM Syntax|FASM]], use syntax different from MASM, similar only in that they all use Intel syntax.

== Instruction Order ==

MASM instructions typically have operands reversed from GAS instructions. for instance, instructions are typically written as '''Instruction Destination, Source'''. 

The '''mov''' instruction, written as follows:

 mov al, 05h

will move the value 5 into the al register.

== Instruction Suffixes ==

MASM does not use instruction suffixes to differentiate between sizes (byte, word, dword, etc).

== Macros ==

MASM is known as either the &quot;Macro Assembler&quot;, or the &quot;Microsoft Assembler&quot;, depending on who you talk to. But no matter where your answers are coming from, the fact is that MASM has a powerful macro engine, and a number of built-in macros available immediately. 

== MASM directives ==

MASM has a large number of directives that can control certain settings and behaviors. It has more of them compared to NASM or FASM, for example.</text>

== HLA Syntax ==

HLA accepts assembly written using a high-level format, and converts the code into another format (MASM or GAS, usually). 

In MASM, for instance, we could write the following code:

 mov EAX, 0x05

In HLA, this code would become:

 mov(0x05, EAX);

HLA uses the same order-of-operations as GAS syntax, but doesn't require any of the name decoration of GAS. Also, HLA uses the parenthesis notation to call an instruction. HLA terminates its lines with a semicolon, similar to C or Pascal.

== High-Level Constructs ==

Some people criticize HLA because it &quot;isn't low-level enough&quot;. This is false, because HLA can be as low-level as MASM or GAS, but it also offers the options to use some higher-level abstractions. For instance, HLA can use the following syntax to pass eax as an argument to the Function1 function:

 push(eax);
 call(Function1);

But HLA also allows the programmer to simplify the process, if they want:

 Function1(eax);

This is called the &quot;parenthesis notation&quot; for calling functions.

HLA also contains a number of different loops (do-while, for, until, etc..) and control structures (if-then-else, switch-case) that the programmer can use. However, these high-level constructs come with a caveat: Using them may be simple, but they translate into MASM code instructions. It is usually faster to implement the loops by hand.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Assembler}}
There are a number of different assemblers available for x86 architectures. This page will list some of them, and will discuss where to get the assemblers, what they are good for, and where they are used the most.

== [[X86_Assembly/GAS_Syntax|GNU Assembler (GAS)]] ==
{{Wikipedia|GNU Assembler}}
The GNU assembler is most common as the assembly back-end to the GCC compiler. One of the most compelling reasons to learn to program GAS (as it is frequently abbreviated) is to write inline assembly instructions (assembly code embedded in C source code) when compiled by the [[w:GNU_Compiler_Collection|gcc]] need to be in GAS syntax. GAS uses the AT&amp;T syntax for writing the assembly language, which some people claim is more complicated, but other people say it is more informative.

== [[X86_Assembly/MASM_Syntax|Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)]] ==
{{Wikipedia|Microsoft Macro Assembler}}
Microsoft's Macro Assembler, MASM, has been in constant production for many many years. Many people claim that MASM isn't being supported or improved anymore, but Microsoft denies this: MASM is maintained, but is currently in a bug-fixing mode. No new features are currently being added. However, Microsoft is shipping a 64-bit version of MASM with new 64-bit compiler suites. MASM is available from Microsoft as part of Visual C++,  as a download from MSDN, or as part of the Microsoft DDK. The latest available version of MASM is version 10.x.

MASM uses the Intel syntax for its instructions, which stands in stark contrast to the AT&amp;T syntax used by the GAS assembler. Most notably, MASM instructions take their operands in reverse order from GAS. This one fact is perhaps the biggest stumbling block for people trying to transition between the two assemblers.

MASM also has a very powerful macro engine, which many programmers use to implement a high-level feel in MASM programs.

== [[JWASM|JWASM]] ==
{{Wikipedia|JWASM}}

JWASM is a 16, 32 and 64-bit assembler for 80x86 platforms, based apon Open Watcom's WASM, and was created by Japheth.

While syntactically compatible with MASM, it is faster, and its sourcecode is freely available under the Sybase Open Watcom Public License, and thus it is free for both commerical and non-commercial use.
Furthermore, it supports ELF, and is thus the only cross-platform assembler supporting the popular MASM syntax. JWASM is actively being developed, and is generally regarded as the unofficial successor to MASM.

== [[X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax|Netwide Assembler (NASM)]] ==
{{Wikipedia|Netwide Assembler}}
The Netwide Assembler, NASM, was started as an open-source initiative to create a free, retargetable assembler for 80x86 platforms. When the NASM project was started, MASM was still being sold by microsoft (MASM is currently free), and GAS contained very little error checking capability. GAS was, after all, the backend to GCC, and GCC always feeds GAS syntax-correct code. For this reason, GAS didn't need to interface with the user much, and therefore writing code for GAS was very tough.

NASM uses a syntax which is &quot;similar to Intel's but less complex&quot;.

The NASM users manual is found at http://www.nasm.us/doc/ .

Features:
* Cross platform: Like Gas, this assembler runs on nearly every platform, supposedly even on PowerPC Macs (though the code generated will only run on an x86 platform)
* Open Source
* Macro language (code that writes code)

== [[X86_Assembly/FASM_Syntax|Flat Assembler (FASM)]] ==
{{Wikipedia|FASM}}
Although it was written in assembly, it runs on several operating systems, including DOS, DexOS, Linux, Windows, and BSD. Its syntax is similar to TASM's &quot;ideal mode&quot; and NASM's but the macros in this assembler are done differently.

Features:
* Written in itself; and therefore its source code is an example of how to write in this assembler
* Open source
* Clean NASM-like syntax
* Very very fast
* Has macro language (code that writes code)
* Built-in IDE for DOS and Windows
* Creates binary, MZ, PE, ELF, COFF - no linker needed

== YASM Assembler ==

{{Wikipedia|Yasm}}

YASM is a ground-up rewrite of NASM under the new BSD licence. YASM is designed to understand multiple syntaxes natively (NASM and GAS, currently). The primary focus of YASM is to produce &quot;libyasm&quot;, a reusable library that can work with code at a low level, and can be easily integrated into other software projects.

== HLA ==

{{Wikipedia|High Level Assembly}}

HLA is an assembler front-end created by Randall Hyde and first popularized in his book &quot;The Art of Assembly&quot;.

HLA accepts assembly written using a high-level format, and converts the code into another format (MASM or GAS, usually). Another assembler (MASM or GAS) will then assemble the instructions into machine code.

{{Wikipedia|x86}}
The term &quot;x86&quot; can refer both to an instruction set architecture and to microprocessors which implement it. The name x86 is derived from the fact that many of Intel's early processors had names ending in &quot;86&quot;.

The x86 instruction set architecture originated at Intel and has evolved over time by the addition of new instructions as well as the expansion to 64-bits. As of 2009, x86 primarily refers to [[w:IA-32|IA-32]] (Intel Architecture, 32-bit) and/or [[w:X86-64|x86-64]], the extension to 64-bit computing.

Versions of the x86 instruction set architecture have been implemented by Intel, AMD and several other vendors, with each vendor having its own family of x86 processors.

== Intel x86 Microprocessors ==
{{Wikipedia|List of Intel microprocessors}}
;8086/8087 (1978): The 8086 was the original x86 microprocessor, with the 8087 as its floating-point coprocessor. The 8086 was Intel's first 16-bit microprocessor. 
;8088 (1979): After the development of the 8086, Intel also created the lower-cost 8088. The 8088 was similar to the 8086, but with an 8-bit data bus instead of a 16-bit bus.
;80186/80187  (1982): The 186 was the second Intel chip in the family; the 80187 was its floating point coprocessor. Except for the addition of some new instructions, optimization of some old ones, and an increase in the clock speed, this processor was identical to the 8086.
;80286/80287 (1982): The 286 was the third model in the family; the 80287 was its floating point coprocessor. The 286 introduced the “Protected Mode” mode of operation, as opposed to the “Real Mode” that the earlier models used. All subsequent x86 chips can also be made to run in real mode or in protected mode.  
;80386 (1985): The 386 was the fourth model in the family. It was the first Intel microprocessor with a 32-bit word. The 386DX model was the original 386 chip, and the 386SX model was an economy model that used the same instruction set, but which only had a 16-bit bus. The 386EX model is still used today in [[Embedded Systems|embedded systems]].
;80486 (1989): The 486 was the fifth model in the family. It had an integrated floating point unit for the first time in x86 history.  Early model 80486 DX chips were found to have defective FPUs. They were physically modified to disconnect the FPU portion of the chip and sold as the 486SX (486-SX15, 486-SX20, and 486-SX25).  A 487 &quot;math coprocessor&quot; was available to 486SX users and was essentially a 486DX with a working FPU and an extra pin added.  The arrival of the 486DX-50 processor saw the widespread introduction of fanless heat-sinks being used to keep the processors from overheating.
;Pentium (1993): Intel called it the “Pentium” because they couldn't trademark the code number “80586”. The original Pentium was a faster chip than the 486 with a few other enhancements; later models also integrated the MMX instruction set.
;Pentium Pro (1995): The Pentium Pro was the sixth-generation architecture microprocessor, originally intended to replace the original Pentium in a full range of applications, but later reduced to a more narrow role as a server and high-end desktop chip.
;Pentium II (1997): The Pentium II was based on a modified version of the P6 core first used for the Pentium Pro, but with improved 16-bit performance and the addition of the MMX SIMD instruction set, which had already been introduced on the Pentium MMX.
;Pentium III (1999): Initial versions of the Pentium III were very similar to the earlier Pentium II, the most notable difference being the addition of SSE instructions.
;Pentium 4 (2000): The Pentium 4 had a new 7th generation &quot;NetBurst&quot; architecture.  It is currently the fastest x86 chip on the market with respect to clock speed, capable of up to 3.8&amp;nbsp;GHz. Pentium 4 chips also introduced the notions “Hyper-Threading”, and “Multi-Core” chips.
&lt;!-- ;Pentium M (2003): Due to the greater power consumption and heat emission of the 7th generation NetBurst architecture, it was unsuitable for mobiles.  The Pentium M was the solution for mobiles; it was created by taking the 6th generation Pentium III and adding some enhancements such as SSE2 instruction support. --&gt;;Core (2006): The architecture of the Core processors was actually an even more advanced version of the 6th generation architecture dating back to the 1995 Pentium Pro. The limitations of the NetBurst architecture, especially in mobile applications, were too great to justify creation of more NetBurst processors.  The Core processors were designed to operate more efficiently with a lower clock speed. All Core branded processors had two processing cores; the Core Solos had one core disabled, while the Core Duos used both processors.
;Core 2 (2006): An upgraded, 64-bit version of the Core architecture. All desktop versions are multi-core.
;i Series (2008): The successor to Core 2 processors featuring Hyper-Threading.
;Celeron (first model 1998): The Celeron chip is actually a large number of different chip designs, depending on price. Celeron chips are the economy line of chips, and are frequently cheaper than the Pentium chips—even if the Celeron model in question is based off a Pentium architecture.
;Xeon (first model 1998): The Xeon processors are modern Intel processors made for servers, which have a much larger cache (measured in megabytes in comparison to other chips' kilobyte-sized cache) than the Pentium microprocessors.

== AMD x86 Compatible Microprocessors ==
{{Wikipedia|List of AMD microprocessors}}
;Athlon : Athlon is the brand name applied to a series of different x86 processors designed and manufactured by AMD. The original Athlon, or Athlon Classic, was the first seventh-generation x86 processor and, in a first, retained the initial performance lead it had over Intel's competing processors for a significant period of time.
;Turion : Turion 64 is the brand name AMD applies to its 64-bit low-power (mobile) processors. Turion 64 processors (but not Turion 64 X2 processors) are compatible with AMD's Socket 754 and are equipped with 512 or 1024 KiB of L2 cache, a 64-bit single channel on-die memory controller, and an 800&amp;nbsp;MHz HyperTransport bus.
;Duron : The AMD Duron was an x86-compatible computer processor manufactured by AMD. It was released as a low-cost alternative to AMD's own Athlon processor and the Pentium III and Celeron processor lines from rival Intel.
;Sempron : Sempron is, as of 2006, AMD's entry-level desktop CPU, replacing the Duron processor and competing against Intel's Celeron D processor.
;Opteron : The AMD Opteron is the first eighth-generation x86 processor (K8 core), and the first of AMD's AMD64 (x86-64) processors. It is intended to compete in the server market, particularly in the same segment as the Intel Xeon processor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">added some stuff. Tried to not anthropomorphize the subject, and did not precisely succeed. Maybe I could try and make a simple visual chart showing co-evolution in hummingbirds and the flowers, with say three steps to show how the flowers evolved to be longer to better rub pollen on the bird, and the birds' beak evolved longer to better suck out more nectar- I could discuss how perhaps many different taxa of birds fed on the flower, but when the long flower became prevalent, only the birds that would evolve longer beaks to suck all of the nectar would still find it worth their while to go after those flowers.
I can see myself going a little lamarkian if I'm not careful. Or even if I am.
:I like the start. Develop it how you think best.  I will likely do some editing, and may even move it to a different part of the textbook (for example, Chapter 5) if it seems to require that.  But for now, keep going with your ideas - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 18:31, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

Some of the most important and most frequently used instructions are those that move data. Without them, there would be no way for registers or memory to even have anything in them to operate on.

= Data transfer instructions =

== Move ==

{{x86-inst-2|mov}}

Move

The &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; instruction copies the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand into the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand.

''' Operands '''

''src''
* Immediate
* Register
* Memory
''dest''
* Register
* Memory

''' Modified flags '''

* No FLAGS are modified by this instruction

''' Example '''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 .data
 
 value:
         .long   2
 
 .text
         .global _start
 
 _start:
         movl    $6, %eax
         # %eax is now 6
 
         movw    %ax, value
         # value is now 6
 
         movl    $0, %ebx
         # %ebx is now 0
 
         movb    %al, %bl
         # %ebx is now 6
 
         movl    value, %ebx
         # %ebx is now 6
 
         movl    $value, %esi
         # %esi is now the address of value
 
         xorl    %ebx, %ebx
         # %ebx is now 0
 
         movw    value(, %ebx, 1), %bx
         # %ebx is now 6
 
 # Linux sys_exit
         mov     $1, %eax
         xorl    %ebx, %ebx
         int     $0x80
&lt;/source&gt;

== Data swap ==

{{x86-inst-2|xchg}}

Exchange.

The &lt;code&gt;xchg&lt;/code&gt; instruction swaps the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand with the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand. It's like doing three move operations: from ''dest'' to a temporary (another register), then from ''src'' to ''dest'', then from the temporary to ''src'', except that no register needs to be reserved for temporary storage.

If one of the operands is a memory address, then the operation has an implicit &lt;code&gt;LOCK&lt;/code&gt; prefix, that is,  the exchange operation is atomic.  This can have a large performance penalty.

It's also worth noting that the common &lt;code&gt;NOP&lt;/code&gt; (no op) instruction, &lt;code&gt;0x90&lt;/code&gt;, is the opcode for &lt;code&gt;xchgl %eax, %eax&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Operands'''

''src''
* Register
* Memory
''dest''
* Register
* Memory

However, only one operand can be in memory: the other must be a register.

''' Modified flags '''

* No FLAGS are modified by this instruction

''' Example '''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 .data
 
 value:
        .long   2
 
 .text
        .global _start
 
 _start:
        movl    $54, %ebx
        xorl    %eax, %eax
 
        xchgl   value, %ebx
        # %ebx is now 2
        # value is now 54
 
        xchgw   %ax, value
        # Value is now 0
        # %eax is now 54
 
        xchgb   %al, %bl
        # %ebx is now 54
        # %eax is now 2
 
        xchgw   value(%eax), %ax
        # value is now 0x00020000 = 131072
        # %eax is now 0
 
 # Linux sys_exit 
        mov     $1, %eax
        xorl    %ebx, %ebx
        int     $0x80
&lt;/source&gt;

{{x86-inst-2-generic|cmpxchg}}

Compare and exchange.

The &lt;code&gt;cmpxchg&lt;/code&gt; instruction has two implicit operands &lt;code&gt;AL/AX/EAX&lt;/code&gt;(depending on the size of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;ZF&lt;/code&gt;(zero) flag. The instruction compares &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;AL/AX/EAX&lt;/code&gt; and if they are equal sets &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; and sets the zero flag otherwise it sets &lt;code&gt;AL/AX/EAX&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and clears the zero flag. Unlike &lt;code&gt;xchg&lt;/code&gt; there is not an implicit &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; prefix and if the instruction is required to be atomic then &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; must be prefixed.

''' Operands '''

''arg1''
* Register
* Memory
''arg2''
* Register

''' Modified flags '''

* The ZF flag is modified by this instruction

''' Example '''

The following example shows how to use the cmpxchg instruction to create a spin lock which will be used to protect the &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; variable. The last thread to grab the spin lock will get to set the final value of &lt;code&gt;result&lt;code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;

	;	zero flag	&lt;- 0
	;
	; If sLock is still zero then it will have the same value as eax and
	; sLock will be set to edx which is one and therefore we aquire the
	; lock. If the lock was acquire between the first test and the
	; cmpxchg then eax will not be zero and we will spin again.
	;
	lock	cmpxchg [sLock], edx
	test	eax, eax

	pop	ebp

	mov	eax, 1		; Syscall number:

&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ nasm -felf32 -g cmpxchgSpinLock.asm
$ gcc -o cmpxchgSpinLock cmpxchgSpinLock.o -lpthread
$ ./cmpxchgSpinLock
&lt;/source&gt;

== Move with zero extend ==

{{x86-inst-2x|att=movz|intel=movzx}}

Move zero extend

The &lt;code&gt;movz&lt;/code&gt; instruction copies the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand in the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand and pads the remaining bits not provided by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; with zeros (0).

This instruction is useful for copying a small, unsigned value to a bigger register.

 .text
        .global _start
 
 _start:
        movzbw  byteval, %ax
        # %eax is now 204
 
        movzwl  %ax, %ebx
        # %ebx is now 204
 
        movzbl  byteval, %esi
        # %esi is now 204
 
 # Linux sys_exit 
        mov     $1, %eax
        xorl    %ebx, %ebx
        int     $0x80

== Sign Extend ==

{{x86-inst-2x|att=movs|intel=movsx}}

Move sign extend.

The &lt;code&gt;movs&lt;/code&gt; instruction copies the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand in the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand and pads the remaining bits not provided by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; with the sign bit (the MSB) of &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;.

This instruction is useful for copying a signed small value to a bigger register.

        xorl    %ebx, %ebx
        int     $0x80

== Move String ==

{{x86-inst|movsb}}

Move byte

The &lt;code&gt;movsb&lt;/code&gt; instruction copies one byte from the memory location specified in &lt;code&gt;esi&lt;/code&gt; to the location specified in &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt;. If the direction flag is cleared, then &lt;code&gt;esi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt; are incremented after the operation. Otherwise, if the direction flag is set, then the pointers are decremented. In that case the copy would happen in the reverse direction, starting at the highest address and moving toward lower addresses until &lt;code&gt;ecx&lt;/code&gt; is zero.

''' Operands '''

None.

''' Modified flags '''

* No FLAGS are modified by this instruction

''' Example '''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
section .text
  ; copy mystr into mystr2
  mov esi, mystr    ; loads address of mystr into esi
  mov edi, mystr2   ; loads address of mystr2 into edi
  cld               ; clear direction flag (forward)
  mov ecx,6
  rep movsb         ; copy six times
 
section .bss
  mystr2: resb 6
 
section .data
  mystr db &quot;Hello&quot;, 0x0
&lt;/source&gt;


{{x86-inst|movsw}}

Move word

The &lt;code&gt;movsw&lt;/code&gt; instruction copies one word (two bytes) from the location specified in &lt;code&gt;esi&lt;/code&gt; to the location specified in &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt;. It basically does the same thing as &lt;code&gt;movsb&lt;/code&gt;, except with words instead of bytes.

''' Operands '''

None.

section .data
  mystr db &quot;AaBbCca&quot;, 0x0
&lt;/source&gt;

== Load Effective Address ==

{{x86-inst-2|lea}}

Load Effective Address

The &lt;code&gt;lea&lt;/code&gt; instruction calculates the address of the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand and loads it into the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand.

''' Operands '''

''src''
* Immediate
* Register
* Memory
''dest''
* Register

''' Modified flags '''

* No FLAGS are modified by this instruction

''' Note '''
Load Effective Address calculates its &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand in the same way as the &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; instruction does, but rather than loading the ''contents'' of that address into the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand, it loads the address itself.

&lt;code&gt;lea&lt;/code&gt; can be used not only for calculating addresses, but also general-purpose unsigned integer arithmetic (with the caveat and possible advantage that FLAGS are unmodified).  This can be quite powerful, since the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand can take up to 4 parameters: base register, index register, scalar multiplier and displacement, e.g. &lt;code&gt;[eax + edx*4 -4]&lt;/code&gt; (Intel syntax) or &lt;code&gt;-4(%eax, %edx, 4)&lt;/code&gt; (GAS syntax). The scalar multiplier is limited to constant values 1, 2, 4, or 8 for byte, word, double word or quad word offsets respectively. This by itself allows for multiplication of a general register by constant values 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9, as shown below (using [[X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax|NASM]] syntax):
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
lea ebx, [ebx*2]      ; Multiply ebx by 2
lea ebx, [ebx*8+ebx]  ; Multiply ebx by 9, which totals ebx*18
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Wikipedia|Control flow}}

Almost all programming languages have the ability to change the order in which statements are evaluated, and assembly is no exception. The instruction pointer (EIP) register contains the address of the next instruction to be executed. To change the flow of control, the programmer must be able to modify the value of EIP. This is where control flow functions come in. 

&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
mov eip, label   ; wrong
jmp label        ; right
&lt;/source&gt;


== Comparison Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-2|test|arg1|arg2}}

Performs a bit-wise logical AND on &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; the result of which we will refer to as &lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt; and sets the &lt;code&gt;ZF&lt;/code&gt;(zero), &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt;(sign) and &lt;code&gt;PF&lt;/code&gt;(parity) flags based on &lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt; is then discarded.


''' Operands '''

* &lt;code&gt;PF&lt;/code&gt; &lt;- BitWiseXorNor(&lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt;[Max-1:0])
* &lt;code&gt;CF&lt;/code&gt; &lt;- 0
* &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; &lt;- 0
* &lt;code&gt;AF&lt;/code&gt; is undefined

{{x86-inst-2|cmp|arg2|arg1}}

Performs a comparison operation between &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt;. The comparison is performed by a (signed) subtraction of &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt;, the results of which can be called &lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Temp&lt;/code&gt; is then discarded. If &lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; is an immediate value it will be sign extended to the length of &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;EFLAGS&lt;/code&gt; register is set in the same manner as a &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; instruction.

Note that the GAS/AT&amp;T syntax can be rather confusing, as for example &lt;code&gt;cmp $0, %rax&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;jl branch&lt;/code&gt; will branch if &lt;code&gt;%rax &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt; (and not the opposite as might be expected from the order of the operands).

== Jump Instructions ==
The jump instructions allow the programmer to (indirectly) set the value of the EIP register. The location passed as the argument is usually a label. The first instruction executed after the jump is the instruction immediately following the label. All of the jump instructions, with the exception of &lt;code&gt;jmp&lt;/code&gt;, are '''conditional jumps''', meaning that program flow is diverted only if a condition is true. These instructions are often used after a comparison instruction (see above), but since many other instructions set flags, this order is not required.

See [[X86_Assembly/X86_Architecture#EFLAGS_Register]] for more information about the flags and their meaning.

=== Unconditional Jumps ===

{{x86-inst-1|jmp|loc}}

Loads EIP with the specified address (i.e. the next instruction executed will be the one specified by jmp).

=== Jump on Equality ===

{{x86-inst-1|je|loc}}
''ZF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if operands of previous CMP instruction are equal. For example:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
mov $5, ecx
mov $5, edx
cmp ecx, edx
je equal
; if it did not jump to the label equal, then this means ecx and edx are not equal.
equal:
; if it jumped here, then this means ecx and edx are equal
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Jump on Inequality ===

{{x86-inst-1|jne|loc}}
''ZF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if operands of previous CMP instruction are not equal.

=== Jump if Greater ===

{{x86-inst-1|jg|loc}}
''ZF = 0 and SF = OF''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is greater than the second (performs signed comparison).

{{x86-inst-1|jge|loc}}
''SF = OF''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is greater than or equal to the second (performs signed comparison).

{{x86-inst-1|ja|loc}}
''CF = 0 and ZF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is greater than the second. &lt;code&gt;ja&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;jg&lt;/code&gt;, except that it performs an unsigned comparison.

{{x86-inst-1|jae|loc}}
''CF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is greater than or equal to the second. &lt;code&gt;jae&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;jge&lt;/code&gt;, except that it performs an unsigned comparison.

=== Jump if Less ===

{{x86-inst-1|jl|loc}}

The criteria required for a &lt;code&gt;JL&lt;/code&gt; is that &lt;code&gt;SF &lt;&gt; OF&lt;/code&gt;, loads EIP with the specified address, if the criteria is meet. So either &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; can be set but not both in order to satisfy this criteria. If we take the &lt;code&gt;SUB&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;which is basically what a &lt;code&gt;CMP&lt;/code&gt; does&lt;/i&gt;) instruction as an example, we have:

&lt;DL&gt;&lt;DD&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;arg1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;

With respect to &lt;code&gt;SUB&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CMP&lt;/code&gt; there are several cases that fulfill this criteria:

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2 &lt; arg1&lt;/code&gt; and the operation does not have overflow
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2 &lt; arg1&lt;/code&gt; and the operation has an overflow
&lt;/OL&gt;

In case 1) &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; will be set but not &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; and in case 2) &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; will be set but not &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; since the overflow will reset the most significant bit to zero and thus preventing &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; being set. The &lt;code&gt;SF &lt;&gt; OF&lt;/code&gt; criteria avoids the cases where:

&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2 &gt; arg1&lt;/code&gt; and the operation does not have overflow
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2 &gt; arg1&lt;/code&gt; and the operation has an overflow
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;arg2 == arg1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;

In case 1) neither &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; are set, in case 2) &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; will be set and &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; will be set since the overflow will reset the most significant bit to one and in case 3) neither &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; will be set.

'''Example'''
The example code below runs the five cases outlined above and prints out whether &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; are equal or not:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
;
; nasm -felf32 -g jlFlagsCheck.asm
; gcc -o jlFlagsCheck jlFlagsCheck.o
;
global main 

extern printf

section .data

	sfeqofStr: db 'SF == OF', 0xA, 0

section .bss

section .text
	main:

;
; Functions will follow the cdecl call convention
;

	;
	; arg2 &lt; arg1 and no overflow
	;
	mov	eax, 1
	cmp	eax, 2
	call	checkSFNEOF

	;
	; arg2 &lt; arg1 and overflow
	;
	mov	al, -2
	cmp	al, 127
	call	checkSFNEOF

	;
	; arg2 &gt; arg1 and no overflow
	;
	mov	eax, 2
	cmp	eax, 1 
	call	checkSFNEOF

	;
	; arg2 &gt; arg1 and overflow
	;
	mov	al, 127
	cmp	al, -1 
	call	checkSFNEOF

	;
	; arg2 == arg1
	;
	mov	eax, 2
	cmp	eax, 2 
	call	checkSFNEOF

	call	exit

;
; Check if SF &lt;&gt; OF, which means the condition for jump less would be meet. 
;
checkSFNEOF:
	push	ebp
	mov	ebp, esp

	jl	SFNEOF
	jmp	SFEQOF	

SFNEOF:
	push	dword sfneofStr 
	call	printf
	jmp	checkSFNEOFDone

SFEQOF:
	push	dword sfeqofStr 
	call	printf

checkSFNEOFDone:

	leave
	ret

exit:
				;
				; Call exit(3) syscall
				;	void exit(int status)
				;
	mov	ebx, 0		; Arg one: the status
	mov	eax, 1		; Syscall number:
	int 	0x80

&lt;/source&gt;

The expected output is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
SF &lt;&gt; OF
SF &lt;&gt; OF
SF == OF
SF == OF
SF == OF
&lt;/source&gt;



{{x86-inst-1|jle|loc}}

The criteria required for a &lt;code&gt;JLE&lt;/code&gt; is that &lt;code&gt;SF &lt;&gt; OF&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ZF == 1&lt;/code&gt;, loads EIP with the specified address if the criteria is meet. See the &lt;code&gt;JL&lt;/code&gt; section for a more detailed description of the criteria, the one point of departure would be that &lt;code&gt;arg2 == arg1&lt;/code&gt; fulfills the criteria for &lt;code&gt;JLE&lt;/code&gt; since &lt;code&gt;ZF == 1&lt;/code&gt;.


'''Example'''
The example code below runs the five cases outlined previously and prints out whether &lt;code&gt;SF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OF&lt;/code&gt; are equal or not and whether &lt;code&gt;ZF == 1&lt;/code&gt; or not:

;
checkJLECriteria:

	mov	ebp, esp

	jz	ZFOne
	jmp	ZFZero

ZFOne:
	push	dword eq
	jmp	SFOFCheck
	
ZFZero:
	push	dword ne

SFOFCheck:

	jl	SFNEOF
	jmp	SFEQOF	

SFNEOF:
	push	dword sfneofStr 
	call	printf
	jmp	checkJLECriteriaDone

SFEQOF:
	push	dword sfeqofStr 
	call	printf

checkJLECriteriaDone:

	leave
	ret

exit:
				;
				; Call exit(3) syscall
				;	void exit(int status)
				;
	mov	ebx, 0		; Arg one: the status
	mov	eax, 1		; Syscall number:

&lt;/source&gt;

The expected output is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
SF &lt;&gt; OF and ZF &lt;&gt; 1
SF &lt;&gt; OF and ZF &lt;&gt; 1
SF == OF and ZF == 1
SF == OF and ZF &lt;&gt; 1
SF == OF and ZF &lt;&gt; 1
&lt;/source&gt;


{{x86-inst-1|jb|loc}}
''CF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is less than the second. &lt;code&gt;jb&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;jl&lt;/code&gt;, except that it performs an unsigned comparison.

{{x86-inst-1|jbe|loc}}
''CF = 1 or ZF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if first operand of previous CMP instruction is less than or equal to the second. &lt;code&gt;jbe&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;jle&lt;/code&gt;, except that it performs an unsigned comparison.

=== Jump on Overflow ===

{{x86-inst-1|jo|loc}}
''OF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if the overflow bit is set on a previous arithmetic expression.

{{x86-inst-1|jno|loc}}
''OF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if the overflow bit is not set on a previous arithmetic expression.

=== Jump on Zero ===

{{x86-inst-1|jz|loc}}
''ZF = 1''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if the zero bit is set from a previous arithmetic expression. &lt;code&gt;jz&lt;/code&gt; is identical to &lt;code&gt;je&lt;/code&gt;.

{{x86-inst-1|jnz|loc}}
''ZF = 0''

Loads EIP with the specified address, if the zero bit is not set from a previous arithmetic expression. &lt;code&gt;jnz&lt;/code&gt; is identical to &lt;code&gt;jne&lt;/code&gt;.

== Function Calls ==
{{x86-inst-1|call|proc}}

Pushes the address of the next opcode onto the top of the stack, and jumps to the specified location. This is used mostly for subroutines.

{{x86-inst-1|ret|[val]}}

Loads the next value on the stack into EIP, and then pops the specified number of bytes off the stack. If ''val'' is not supplied, the instruction will not pop any values off the stack after returning.

== Loop Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-1|loop}}

The &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; instruction decrements ECX and jumps to the address specified by &lt;code&gt;arg&lt;/code&gt; unless decrementing ECX caused its value to become zero. For example:

&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
 mov ecx, 5
 start_loop:
 ; the code here would be executed 5 times
 loop start_loop
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; does not set any flags.

{{x86-inst-1|loopx}}

These loop instructions decrement ECX and jump to the address specified by &lt;code&gt;arg&lt;/code&gt; if their condition is satisfied (that is, a specific flag is set), unless decrementing ECX caused its value to become zero.

*&lt;code&gt;loope&lt;/code&gt;  loop if equal
*&lt;code&gt;loopne&lt;/code&gt; loop if not equal
*&lt;code&gt;loopnz&lt;/code&gt; loop if not zero
*&lt;code&gt;loopz&lt;/code&gt;  loop if zero

== Enter and Leave ==

{{x86-inst-1|enter}}

Creates a stack frame with the specified amount of space allocated on the stack.

{{x86-inst|leave}}

destroys the current stack frame, and restores the previous frame. Using Intel syntax this is equivalent to:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov ebp, esp
pop ebp
&lt;/source&gt;

This will set &lt;code&gt;EBP&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ESP&lt;/code&gt; to their respective value before the function prologue began therefore reversing any modification to the stack that took place during the prologue.

== Other Control Instructions ==

{{x86-inst|hlt}}

Halts the processor. Execution will be resumed after processing next hardware interrupt, unless IF is cleared.

{{x86-inst|nop}}

No operation. This instruction doesn't do anything, but wastes an instruction cycle in the processor. This instruction is often represented as an '''XCHG''' operation with the operands '''EAX''' and '''EAX'''.

{{x86-inst|lock}}

Asserts #LOCK prefix on next instruction.

{{x86-inst|wait}}

Waits for the FPU to finish its last calculation.</text>

== Arithmetic instructions ==

Arithmetic instructions take two operands: a destination and a source. The destination must be a register or a memory location. The source may be either a memory location, a register, or a constant value. Note that at least one of the two must be a register, because operations may not use a memory location as both a source and a destination.


{{x86-inst-2|add}}
This adds &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;. If you are using the NASM syntax, then the result is stored in the first argument, if you are using the GAS syntax, it is stored in the second argument. 


{{x86-inst-2|sub}}
Like ADD, only it subtracts source from destination instead. In C: &lt;tt&gt;dest -= src;&lt;/tt&gt;


{{x86-inst-1|mul}}
This multiplies &quot;arg&quot; by the value of corresponding byte-length in the AX register.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| operand size || 1 byte || 2 bytes || 4 bytes
|-
| other operand || AL || AX || EAX
|-
| higher part of result stored in: || AH || DX || EDX
|-
| lower part of result stored in: || AL || AX || EAX
|-
|}

In the second case, the target is not EAX for backward compatibility with code written for older processors.



{{x86-inst-1|imul}}
As MUL, only signed. The IMUL instruction has the same format as MUL, but also accepts two other formats like so:

{{x86-inst-2|imul}}
This multiplies &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;. If you are using the NASM syntax, then the result is stored in the first argument, if you are using the GAS syntax, it is stored in the second argument.
{{x86-inst-3|imul}}
This multiplies &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;aux&lt;/code&gt; and places it into &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;. If you are using the NASM syntax, then the result is stored in the first argument, if you are using the GAS syntax, it is stored in the third argument. 


{{x86-inst-1|div}}
This divides the value in the dividend register(s) by &quot;arg&quot;, see table below.


:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| divisor size || 1 byte || 2 bytes || 4 bytes
|-
| dividend || AX || DX:AX || EDX:EAX
|-
| remainder stored in: || AH || DX || EDX
|-
| quotient stored in: || AL || AX || EAX
|-
|}

The colon (&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;) means concatenation. With divisor size 4, this means that EDX are the bits 32-63 and EAX are bits 0-31 of the input number (with lower bit numbers being less significant, in this example).

As you typically have 32-bit input values for division, you often '''need to use [[w:X86_instruction_listings#Added_with_80386|CDQ]] to sign-extend EAX into EDX just before the division'''.

If quotient does not fit into quotient register, arithmetic overflow interrupt occurs.
All flags are in undefined state after the operation.


{{x86-inst-1|idiv}}
As DIV, only signed.


{{x86-inst-1|neg}}
Arithmetically negates the argument (i.e. two's complement negation).

== Carry Arithmetic Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-2|adc}}

Add with carry. Adds &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;carry flag&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;, storing result in &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;.  Usually follows a normal add instruction to deal with values twice as large as the size of the register. In the following example, ''source'' contains a 64-bit number which will be added to ''destination''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov eax, [source] ; read low 32 bits
mov edx, [source+4] ; read high 32 bits
add [destination], eax ; add low 32 bits
adc [destination+4], edx ; add high 32 bits, plus carry
&lt;/source&gt;


{{x86-inst-2|sbb}}
Subtract with borrow. Subtracts &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;carry flag&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;, storing result in &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;.  Usually follows a normal sub instruction to deal with values twice as large as the size of the register.


== Increment and Decrement ==

{{x86-inst-1|inc}}
Increments the register value in the argument by 1. Performs much faster than '''ADD arg, 1'''.


{{x86-inst-1|dec}}
Decrements the register value in the argument by 1. Performs much faster than '''SUB arg, 1'''.

== Pointer arithmetic ==
The &lt;code&gt;lea&lt;/code&gt; instruction can be used for arithmetic, especially on pointers.  See [[X86 Assembly/Data Transfer#Load Effective Address]].</text>

== Logical instructions ==
The instructions on this page deal with bit-wise logical instructions. For more information about bit-wise logic, see [[Digital Circuits/Logic Operations]].

{{x86-inst-2|and}}

Performs a bit-wise AND of the two operands, and stores the result in dest. For example:

 movl $0x1, %edx
 movl $0x0, %ecx
 andl %edx, %ecx
 ; here ecx would be 0 because 1 AND 0 = 0

{{x86-inst-2|or}}

Performs a bit-wise OR of the two operands, and stores the result in dest. For example:

 movl $0x1, %edx
 movl $0x0, %ecx
 orl  %edx, %ecx
 ; here ecx would be 1 because 1 OR 0 = 1

{{x86-inst-2|xor}}

Performs a bit-wise XOR of the two operands, and stores the result in dest. For example:

 movl $0x1, %edx
 movl $0x0, %ecx 
 xorl %edx, %ecx 
 ; here ecx would be 1 because 1 XOR 0 = 1

{{x86-inst-1|not}}

Performs a bit-wise inversion of arg. For example:

 movl $0x1, %edx
 notl %edx
 ; here edx would be 0xFFFFFFFE because a bitwise NOT 0x00000001 = 0xFFFFFFFE</text>

== Logical Shift Instructions ==

In a '''logical shift''' instruction (also referred to as '''unsigned shift'''), the bits that slide off the end disappear (except for the last, which goes into the carry flag), and the spaces are always filled with zeros. Logical shifts are best used with unsigned numbers.

{{x86-inst-2|shr}}

Logical shift &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the right by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits.

{{x86-inst-2|shl}}

Logical shift &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the left by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits.

Examples ([[X86 Assembly/GAS Syntax|GAS Syntax]]):

 movw   $ff00,%ax        # ax=1111.1111.0000.0000 (0xff00, unsigned 65280, signed -256) 
 shrw   $3,%ax           # ax=0001.1111.1110.0000 (0x1fe0, signed and unsigned 8160)
                         # (logical shifting unsigned numbers right by 3
                         #   is like integer division by 8)
 shlw   $1,%ax           # ax=0011.1111.1100.0000 (0x3fc0, signed and unsigned 16320) 
                         # (logical shifting unsigned numbers left by 1
                         #   is like multiplication by 2)

== Arithmetic Shift Instructions ==

In an '''arithmetic shift''' (also referred to as '''signed shift'''), like a logical shift, the bits that slide off the end disappear (except for the last, which goes into the carry flag). But in an arithmetic shift, the spaces are filled in such a way to preserve the sign of the number being slid. For this reason, arithmetic shifts are better suited for signed numbers in two's complement format.

{{x86-inst-2|sar}}

Arithmetic shift &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the right by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits. Spaces are filled with sign bit (to maintain sign of original value), which is the original highest bit.

{{x86-inst-2|sal}}

Arithmetic shift &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the left by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits. The bottom bits do not affect the sign, so the bottom bits are filled with zeros.  This instruction is synonymous with SHL.

Examples ([[X86 Assembly/GAS Syntax|GAS Syntax]]):

 movw   $ff00,%ax        # ax=1111.1111.0000.0000 (0xff00, unsigned 65280, signed -256)
 salw   $2,%ax           # ax=1111.1100.0000.0000 (0xfc00, unsigned 64512, signed -1024)
                         # (arithmetic shifting left by 2 is like multiplication by 4 for
                         #   negative numbers, but has an impact on positives with most
                         #   significant bit set (i.e. set bits shifted out))
 sarw   $5,%ax           # ax=1111.1111.1110.0000 (0xffe0, unsigned 65504, signed -32)
                         # (arithmetic shifting right by 5 is like integer division by 32
                         #   for negative numbers)

== Extended Shift Instructions ==

The names of the ''double precision'' shift operations are somewhat misleading, hence they are listed as ''extended'' shift instructions on this page.

They are available for use with 16- and 32-bit data entities (registers/memory locations). The &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand is always a register, the &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; operand can be a register or memory location, the &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; operand is an immediate byte value or the CL register. In 64-bit mode it is possible to address 64-bit data as well.

{{x86-inst-3|shld|src|dest|cnt}}

The operation performed by &lt;code&gt;shld&lt;/code&gt; is to shift the most significant &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; bits out of &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;, but instead of filling up the least significant bits with zeros, they are filled with the most significant &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; bits of &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;.

{{x86-inst-3|shrd|src|dest|cnt}}

Likewise, the &lt;code&gt;shrd&lt;/code&gt; operation shifts the least significant &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; bits out of dest, and fills up the most significant &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; bits with the least significant bits of the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand.

Intel's nomenclature is misleading, in that the shift does not operate on double the basic operand size (i.e. specifying 32-bit operands doesn't make it a 64-bit shift): the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; operand always remains unchanged.

Also, Intel's manual&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.intel.com/products/processor/manual/325383.pdf Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 2] ([[w:PDF|PDF]], 6.2 MB)&lt;/ref&gt; states that the results are undefined when &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; is greater than the operand size, but at least for 32- and 64-bit data sizes it has been observed that shift operations are performed by (&lt;code&gt;cnt [[w:Modulo_operator|mod]] n&lt;/code&gt;), with n being the data size.

Examples ([[X86 Assembly/GAS Syntax|GAS Syntax]]):

 xorw   %ax,%ax          # ax=0000.0000.0000.0000 (0x0000)
 notw   %ax              # ax=1111.1111.1111.1111 (0xffff)
 movw   $0x5500,%bx      # bx=0101.0101.0000.0000
 shrdw  $4,%ax,%bx       # bx=1111.0101.0101.0000 (0xf550), ax is still 0xffff
 shldw  $8,%bx,%ax       # ax=1111.1111.1111.0101 (0xfff5), bx is still 0xf550

== Rotate Instructions ==

In a rotate instruction, the bits that slide off the end of the register are fed back into the spaces. 

{{x86-inst-2|ror}}

Rotate &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the right by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits.

{{x86-inst-2|rol}}

Rotate &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the left by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits.

== Rotate With Carry Instructions ==

Like with shifts, the rotate can use the carry bit as the &quot;extra&quot; bit that it shifts through.

{{x86-inst-2|rcr}}

Rotate &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the right by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits with carry.

{{x86-inst-2|rcl}}

Rotate &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; to the left by &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; bits with carry.

== Number of arguments ==
Unless stated, these instructions can take either one or two arguments. If only one is supplied, it is assumed to be a register or memory location and the instruction is repeated once.
&lt;code&gt; shrl $1, %eax &lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt; shrl %eax&lt;/code&gt;  (GAS syntax).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly Page}}

== Stack Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-1|push}}
This instruction decrements the stack pointer and stores the data specified as the argument into the location pointed to by the stack pointer.
 
{{x86-inst-1|pop}}
This instruction loads the data stored in the location pointed to by the stack pointer into the argument specified and then increments the stack pointer. For example:

{|
|-
|
 mov eax, 5
 mov ebx, 6
|
|-
|
 push eax 
| The stack is now: [5]
|-
|
 push ebx 
| The stack is now: [6] [5]
|-
|
 pop eax 
|The topmost item (which is 6) is now stored in eax. The stack is now: [5]
|-
|
 pop ebx 
|ebx is now equal to 5. The stack is now empty.
|}

{{x86-inst|pushf}}
This instruction decrements the stack pointer and then loads the location pointed to by the stack pointer with the contents of the flag register.

{{x86-inst|popf}}
This instruction loads the flag register with the contents of the memory location pointed to by the stack pointer and then increments the contents of the stack pointer.

{{x86-inst|pusha}}
This instruction pushes all the general purpose registers onto the stack in the following order: EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI. The value of ESP pushed is the value before the instruction is executed. It is useful for saving state before an operation that could potential change these registers.

{{x86-inst|popa}}
This instruction pops all the general purpose registers off the stack in the reverse order of PUSHA. That is, EDI, ESI, EBP, ESP, EBX, EDX, ECX, EAX. Used to restore state after a call to PUSHA.

== Flags instructions ==

While the [[X86_Assembly/X86_Architecture#EFLAGS_Register|flags]] register is used to report on results of executed instructions (overflow, carry, etc.), it also contains flags that affect the operation of the processor. These flags are set and cleared with special instructions.

=== Interrupt Flag ===
The IF flag tells a processor if it should accept hardware interrupts. It should be kept set under normal execution. In fact, in protected mode, neither of these instructions can be executed by user-level programs.

{{x86-inst|sti}}

Sets the interrupt flag. If set, the processor can accept interrupts from peripheral hardware. 

{{x86-inst|cli}}

Clears the interrupt flag. Hardware interrupts cannot interrupt execution. Programs can still generate interrupts, called software interrupts, and change the flow of execution. Non-maskable interrupts (NMI) cannot be blocked using this instruction.

=== Direction Flag ===

The DF flag tells the processor which way to read data when using [[X86_Assembly/Data_Transfer#Move_String|string]] instructions. That is, whether to decrement or increment the &lt;code&gt;esi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt; registers after a &lt;code&gt;movs&lt;/code&gt; instruction.

{{x86-inst|std}}

Sets the direction flag. Registers will decrement, reading backwards.

{{x86-inst|cld}}

Clears the direction flag. Registers will increment, reading forwards.

=== Carry Flag ===

The CF flag is often modified after arithmetic instructions, but it can be set or cleared manually as well.

{{x86-inst|stc}}

Sets the carry flag.

{{x86-inst|clc}}

Clears the carry flag.

{{x86-inst|cmc}}

Complements (inverts) the carry flag.

=== Other ===
{{x86-inst|sahf}}

Stores the content of AH register into the lower byte of the flag register.

{{x86-inst|lahf}}

Loads the AH register with the contents of the lower byte of the flag register.

== I/O Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-2|in}}

The '''IN''' instruction almost always has the operands AX and DX (or EAX and EDX) associated with it. DX (src) frequently holds the port address to read, and AX (dest) receives the data from the port. In Protected Mode operating systems, the IN instruction is frequently locked, and normal users can't use it in their programs.

{{x86-inst-2|out}}

The '''OUT''' instruction is very similar to the IN instruction. OUT outputs data from a given register (src) to a given output port (dest). In protected mode, the OUT instruction is frequently locked so normal users can't use it.



== System Instructions ==

These instructions were added with the Pentium II.

{{x86-inst|sysenter}}

This instruction causes the processor to enter protected system mode (supervisor mode or &quot;kernel mode&quot;).

{{x86-inst|sysexit}}

This instruction causes the processor to leave protected system mode, and enter user mode.

== Misc Instructions ==

{{x86-inst|RDTSC}}

RDTSC was introduced in the Pentium processor, the instruction reads the number of clock cycles since reset and returns the value in EDX:EAX. This can be used as a way of obtaining a low overhead, high resolution CPU timing. Although with modern CPU microarchitecture(multi-core, hyperthreading)  and  multi-CPU machines you are not guaranteed synchronized cycle counters between cores and CPUs. Also the CPU frequency may be variable due to power saving or dynamic overclocking. So the instruction may be less reliable than when it was first introduced and should be used with care when being used for performance measurements.

It is possible to use just the lower 32-bits of the result but it should be noted that on a 600 MHz processor the register would overflow every 7.16 seconds:

:&lt;math&gt;	2^{32} cycles * (1 second / 600,000,000 cycles) = 7.16 seconds&lt;/math&gt;

While using the full 64-bts allows for 974.9 years between overflows:

:&lt;math&gt;	2^{64} cycles * ((1 second / 600,000,000 cycles) / ( 86400 seconds\ in\ a\ day\ *\ 365\ days\ in\ a\ year) ) = 974.9 years&lt;/math&gt;

The following program (using [[X86_Assembly/NASM_Syntax|NASM]] syntax) is an example of using RDTSC to measure the number of cycles a small block takes to execute:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global main 

extern printf

section .data
	align 4
	a:	dd 10.0
	b:	dd 5.0
	c:	dd 2.0
	fmtStr:	db &quot;edx:eax = %llu edx = %d eax = %d&quot;, 0x0A, 0

section .bss
	align 4
	cycleLow:	resd 1
	cycleHigh:	resd 1
	result:		resd 1

section .text
	main:			; Using main since we are using gcc to link

;
;	op	dst,  src
;
	xor	eax, eax
	cpuid
	rdtsc
	mov	[cycleLow], eax
	mov	[cycleHigh], edx 

				;
				; Do some work before measurements 
				;
	fld	dword [a]
	fld	dword [c]
	fmulp	st1
	fmulp	st1
	fld	dword [b]
	fld	dword [b]
	fmulp	st1
	faddp	st1
	fsqrt
	fstp	dword [result]
				;
				; Done work
				;

	cpuid
	rdtsc
				;
				; break points so we can examine the values
				; before we alter the data in edx:eax and
				; before we print out the results.
				;
break1:
	sub	eax, [cycleLow]
	sbb	edx, [cycleHigh]
break2:
	push	eax
	push	edx
	push 	edx
	push	eax
	push	dword fmtStr
	call	printf
	add	esp, 20		; Pop stack 5 times 4 bytes


				;
				; Call exit(3) syscall
				;	void exit(int status)
				;
	mov	ebx, 0		; Arg one: the status
	mov	eax, 1		; Syscall number:
	int 	0x80
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ nasm -felf -g rdtsc.asm -l rdtsc.lst
$ gcc -m32 -o rdtsc rdtsc.o
$ ./rdtsc
&lt;/source&gt;

==Introduction==
*[[Electronics|Electric circuits]] include [[../Resistors|resistors]], [[../Capacitors|capacitors]], [[Electronics/Inductors|'''inductors''']], etc. A piece of wire has a very small amount of [[Electronics/Inductance|inductance]], but usually we talk about inductors when we think about [[School Science/OHP coil|coils]], which are a lot of wire wound in near-circles around a [[Electronics/Inductor Construction|core]] which is some kind of magnetic material, such as iron. That core magnifies the inductance of the coil.
*While the wire has some resistance, the coil has not only that resistance, but also [[w:reactance (chemistry)|reactance]]. Reactance is proportional to frequency, and coils are used mainly in AC circuits for that reason. Usually the reactance(L) (in Ohms) is much higher than the resistance(R) of the inductor (also in Ohms), with the L/R ratio being important.

==[[Electronics/Magnetic Field|Saturation]]==
There is a limit to the strength of the magnetic field of an inductor, and therefore also a limit to the inductance of the inductor. '''Saturation''' is reached when a small increase in the electric current creating the magnetic field no longer causes an increase in the magnitude of the magnetic field. This is done intentionally in [[w:Saturable reactor|&quot;Saturable reactors&quot;]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)'''

==Contracting==
*What questions or concerns would you like us to address today?
*What has your experience been like with OI?
*Explanation of what will occur during the session
**Confirm family history
**We have some medical records, but will want to confirm some of his med history
**Dr. will come in to examine him
**And we will discuss what we think regarding whether we think he has OI and why we have come to the conclusions we have
**We will then answer any questions you might have

==Overview of OI==
*OI is a genetic disorder (autosomal dominant) characterized by bones that break easily (more commonly known as brittle bone disease)
*It is due to a lack of or poor quality of type 1 collagen (Collagen is the major protein of the body's connective tissue)
*Extreme variations in severity from one individual to another
*Four types of OI based on severity and characteristics

==Inheritance==
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
*Most cases of OI are caused by new mutation (especially type II)
**If spontaneous (parents unaffected) then empiric recurrence is 6-7% (Marini JC and Chernoff EJ)
**Empiric recurrence increases to 28% if more than one affected child has been born to unaffected parent
**Recurrence is caused by gonadal mosaicism (or even somatic mosaicism in a parent where parent is only mildly affected)
**18 cases of mosaicism in literature (12 paternal and 6 maternal)
**approximately 1/3 of these parents were mildly affected
**determining proportion of mutation in sperm can be most accurate way to obtain recurrence risk for mosaic fathers
*Affected individual has 50% chance of passing mutation on to each child

==Genetics==
*Caused by an alteration in COL1A1 gene on chromosome 7 or COL1A2 gene on chromosome 17
*Over 200 mutations recognized (most unique to an individual family)
Geneotype Phenotype correlation (Not well understood)
*Even in families there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity
*Unrelated individuals with identical mutations may have similar or distinct phenotype
*Individuals with near identical phenotypes often have different mutations
*Lethal and nonlethal mutations are both represented about equally on alpha1 and alpha2 chains
*Type I caused by inactivation of one copy of gene resulting in underproduction of collagen
*More severe forms of OI generally result from structural mutations in gene that cause collagen fibers to become unstable
*Type I collagen is a primary component of bone
*Fibroblasts of patients show decrease in secretion of type I collagen into matrix
*Since the proportions of the components are important for mineralization of bone lack of enough type I results in poor matrix deposition
*Tissue specific difference in metabolism of mutant type I collagen may explain why mostly bone is affected

==Incidence==
(Marini JC and Chernoff EJ)
*Between 1 in 20,000 and 1 in 30,000
*Incidence in US is 1 in 20,000 if all diagnosed within 1 year of birth included
*No preferential distribution by gender, race or ethnic group.
*Brittle bone disease is un-cureable for the time being.

==Clinical Features==
(Vary widely within types and between types)
(There are 4 types according to current classification, but an individual may not fit one category clearly)
*Type I
**Mildest type of OI
**Bones predisposed to fracture, especially before puberty (postnatal onset of fractures usually without bony deformity)
**Normal or near normal stature
**Loose joints (hyperextensible)
**Blue sclera
**Triangular face
**Spinal curvature
**Teeth possibly brittle (dentinogenesis imperfecta)
**Hearing loss in 20s or 30s
*Type II
**Most severe form
**Usually fetal demise or death in the perinatal period
**Numerous fractures and severe bone deformity
**Length and weight SGA
**Head large for body size
**Usually blue-gray sclera
**Markedly reduced ossification
**Underdeveloped lungs
*Type III (progressive deforming form)
**Bones fracture easily - fractures present at birth
**Bone deformity sometimes severe
**Short stature
**Blue sclera (thought to be due to differential scattering of light because of differences in the connective tissue) tends to whiten with age
**Loose joints and poor muscle development
**Barrel-shaped rib cage
**Triangular face
**Relative macrocephaly
**intellectually normal
**most are severely physically handicapped
**Spinal curvature
**Respiratory problems sometimes
**Teeth brittle possibly
**Hearing loss possible
*Type IV
**Between Type I and Type III in severity
**Bones fracture easily, most before puberty
**Mild to moderate bone deformity
**Moderate osteoporosis and modeling abnormalities of the long bones
**Shorter than average stature (moderately short)
**Normal sclera (but some cases reported of blue sclerae that seem to fit this type better than type I)
**Tendency toward spinal curvature
**Barrel-shaped rib cage
**Triangular face
**Brittle teeth possible
**Hearing loss possible

==Management==
*Hearing loss
*characteristic in type I OI and also occurs in types III and IV
*Combined sensorineural and conductive deficits
*Hearing aids help with conductive hearing loss more than sensorineural
*Referral to center with experience in OI when hearing aid no longer enough
*Surgical intervention with stapedectomy gives satisfactory long-term results in OI with severe loss (not routine) because won't relieve sensorinerual component
*Dental
*May need orthodontic work for maloculsion
*Other dental considerations for dentinogenesis imperfecta
*Cardiovascular
*Aortic root dilatation (12% of all affected individuals 28% in type III)
*No standard regimen for evaluation
*Aortic and mitral regurgitation occasionally noted
*Respiratory
*Pulmonary function evaluated by cardiology or pulmonology initially at young age (4-6 years) then reassessed every 2-3 if normal

==Natural History==
*Type II
**Frequently lethal at or shortly after birth due to respiratory problems
**Those that survive perinatal period generally die from pneumonia or respiratory insufficiency
**Some have lived for months or years, but bones are very porotic and no evidence of haversian canals or lamellar bone
*Type I
**rarely diagnosed at birth because it is mildest form
*Type III
**often causes fractures at birth, and fractures may occur in utero
**Compatible with long life, but many die in infancy of respiratory difficulties or in childhood of pneumonia
**Early intervention and rehab have improved prognosis

==Development and behavior==
*Minimal delay in fine motor development
*Significant delay in gross motor
*Intelligence and language unaffected

==Diagnosis/Testing==
*Can be diagnosed based on fractures, clinical features, and family history
*Collagen testing
**Study cells making type I collagen
**Biopsy 1/8 to 1/16 of an inch of skin
**Radiolabel and run on gel
**In people with OI, also bands that migrate more slowly - abnormal collagen molecules
**Does not identify 10-15% of individuals with mild OI
**May not be possible to distinguish between types of OI
**Usually used before molecular testing
*Molecular testing
**DNA sequencing
**Most families have unique mutation
**Does not identify mutation in about 5% of those with OI
*Prenatal diagnosis
**Ultrasound can often detect fractures, bowing, or other bone deformities in severe cases of OI (milder forms may be missed)
***Type II OI identifiable as early as 15 weeks gestation
***Type III OI not reliable until after 20 weeks (limb shortness may not be apparent until then)
***Findings on U/S may include
**CVS
***Cells analyzed for abnormal collagen
***DNA test for mutation if it has been identified in family
**Amniocentesis
***can identify genetic mutation (useful only if mutation has already been identified)

==Management and Treatment Options==
*Currently is no cure
*Management of fractures
**Usually treated with short-term immobilization in lightweight casts, splints, or braces to allow movement as soon as possible
*Physical therapy
**Should begin as soon as muscle weakness identified
**Goal is to give independence in life functions
**Swimming, water therapy, and walking safe exercises to maintain bone and muscle mass
*Rodding surgery
**Metal rods inserted in long bones to control fractures and improve deformities
**Two types of rods
***Nonexpandable versatile but must be replaced when child grows
***Expandable rods grow with child but only appropriate for longer bones
**Very thick
**Must be firmly anchored at both ends
**Spinal rodding for severe scoliosis
**If bones strong enough to support rods
*Bisphosphonate drugs
**Currently used to treat osteoporosis and bone complications in cancer
**Study at Montreal Shriners Hospital
**Administered pamindronate intravenously
**Treatment cycle is 4 hour infusion for 3 successive days
**Received cycle every 4 - 6 months
**Prevents breakdown of bones by osteoclasts
**Normally osteoblasts create new bone to replace older bone that is resorbed by osteoclasts
**In OI bone is resorbed by osteoclasts more quickly because it is imperfect and osteoblasts become less efficient (produce less bone) because collagen is abnormal
**Slowing down resorption of bone may strengthen skeleton
**Study included 30 children with severe OI
**Results showed increased bone density, reduction in bone pain, increased motility and decreased incidence of fractures
**Only side effect was mild fever in 87% of children on second day of first treatment - did not occur again
**Small study, no controls, and did not include patients with mild OI
*Growth hormone (still under investigation)
**Administration to those with type III and IV significantly increases linear growth rate in about half of individuals (type IV compose majority of responders)
**Individuals with type I also usually are responsive to GH.
**GH also increases muscle mass and strength.
**GH does not worsen skeletal deformities, but there is increase in blood levels of all components of bone turnover due to an increased rate of whole body remodeling associated with rapid bone gain

==Health tips for individuals with OI==
*Safe exercise
*Nutritious diet
*Calcium maintains bone density
*Vitamin C promotes healing
*Avoid smoking, excessive alcohol or caffeine, and steroid medications

==Precautions to take when caring for someone with OI==
*Never pull or push on limb or bend it in awkward position
*Don't lift baby under armpits or by ankles - put one hand under buttocks and other under shoulders and head
*Covered foam or a pillow may be used to transport baby but be sure to hold and touch babies
*Support infants in a variety of positions to develop muscles
*Use caution when performing medical procedures
*Minimize handling of limb when fracture suspected
*Respect opinions or instructions of family members

==Diagnosis known in mother so I didn't look into differentials==

==Psychosocial issues==
*Family attitudes depend on previous experience with OI
*LSurprise, shock, anger, guilt, depression, and mourning common in parents with new diagnosis
**Families with a previous child may have already developed coping strategies and acceptance
**May be overprotective and overindulgent with affected children
**Frustration with medical personnel who don't handle child carefully
**Anxiety, frustration if unexplained fractures and child abuse suspected
*Affected individuals
**Frustration with inaccessibility of school, work, social environments
**Concerns about physical appearance, sexual development, and peer acceptance
**Feelings of isolation, discrimination, frustration

==Facts for me==
*Approximately 19 collagen types
*Type I is most abundant and major constituent of most connective tissues, bone, tendon, skin, dentin, ligament, fascia, and many blood vessels
*Composed of 3 alpha chains to form triple helix

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

What is mentioned about countability seems a bit strange. Are you sure that practically all Polish words can be said in a plural form?  &quot;Pogoda&quot;, &quot;wiek&quot; (age), &quot;wiedza&quot;, &quot;owłosienie&quot;, &quot;karmel&quot; etc. &lt;BR&gt;
I'm afraid , the rule here is more or less like in English, namely : you never know whether you can say something in plural or not ;-) And the example with &quot;beers&quot; is ridiculous as , obviously, '''exactly the same refers to English uncountables''', of course one can say &quot;two beers&quot; in English. Two teas, three soaps or whatever if there exist implied counters. &lt;BR&gt;And similarly, many uncountable products can only be said in plural if you mean &quot;types of...&quot;, e.g. &quot;mąki&quot;, &quot;cukry&quot;, &quot;tłuszcze&quot;, etc. And again, same happens in English. So, generally, I think the paragraph on countability brings more unnecessary confusion rather than explanation



&quot;Wiedza&quot; doesn't have plural form,  &quot;pogoda&quot;, &quot;owłosienie&quot;, &quot;karmel&quot; have plural, &quot;wiek&quot; too, but plural form only meaning &quot;centuries&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;
You can say uncountable products in singular and plural form, so &quot;mąka&quot;-&quot;mąki&quot;, &quot;cukier&quot;-&quot;cukry&quot;(only in meaning &quot;carbohydrates&quot;!), &quot;tłuszcz&quot;-&quot;tłuszcze&quot;, &quot;woda&quot;-&quot;wody&quot;, &quot;ser&quot;-&quot;sery&quot;(I never have understood, why cheese is uncontable in English ;p I'm polish) are correct.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Osteosarcoma and Li-Fraumeni Syndrome'''

==Contracting==
*What concerns do you have for yourself or for your family?
*What questions do you have?
*Overview of agenda
**Elicit medical history
**Review family history
**Discuss genetics, testing, treatment and management

==Osteosarcoma Background==
*Most common type of bone cancer
**Arises in osteoid tissue in bones
**Most common in knees, upper legs, and upper arms
**Commonly affects people from ages 10-25
***Accounts for about 5% of childhood tumors
***50% form in bones around knee
***Only about 30% of patients with localized tumors survive free of relapse
*Symptoms of bone cancer
**Pain is most common symptom
**Other symptoms depend on location and size of tumor
***Tumors in or near joints may cause swelling or tenderness
***Can interfere with normal ability to move
**May weaken bones and make fractures more likely
**General symptoms include fatigue, fever, weight loss, and anemia
*Diagnosis
**Alkaline phosphatase assay
***Blood test to determine enzyme levels
***Large amounts of alkaline phosphatase found in blood when cells of bone tissue are active
****During childhood growth
****During mending of broken bone
****When tumor causes production of abnormal bone tissue
**X-rays show location, size, and shape of tumor
**Bone scan, CT, MRI, or angiogram may be recommended if X-ray suggests that a tumor is cancerous
**Biopsy needed to determine for sure if tumor is cancer
***Needle biopsy - make small hole in bone and remove tissue sample from tumor with needle-like instrument
***Incisional biopsy - cut into tumor and remove sample of tissue
**No staging system for osteosarcoma so use general terms
***Localized
***Metastatic - most often to lungs or other bones (20% of patients)
***Recurrence - most often in the lungs (5 year survival is 20-40% following surgery)
*Treatment
**Depends on type, size, location, and stage of cancer
**Surgery
***Amputation of limb necessary in some cases
***Pre or post-operative chemotherapy has improved success of limb-sparing surgery
***May remove only cancerous section of bone and replace it with prosthesis
**Chemotherapy and radiation may be used alone or together
***Tumors are generally resistant to radiation
***Degree of necrosis following chemotherapy predicts prognosis
**Various clinical trials for surgeries, radiation therapies, and chemotherapies
*Risk factors for bone cancers
**Radiation or chemotherapy treatment in children or young adults for other conditions
**Adults with Paget's disease are at increased risk for osteosarcoma
**Hereditary factors

==Li Fraumeni Syndrome Overview==
*Cancer predisposition syndrome
**Associated with soft-tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, leukemia, osteosarcoma, melanoma, and cancer of the colon, pancreas, adrenal cortex, and brain
**Increases risk for development of cancers
*Diagnosis is made clinically and genetic testing is available

==Genetic Etiology==
*Due to mutation in TP53 gene on 17p13 that codes for TP53 protein in more than 50% of cases
**Tumor suppressor gene nicknamed &quot;guardian of the genome&quot;
**Acts as checkpoint control following DNA damage by delaying cell cycle progression until damaged DNA is repaired or cell commits to apoptosis
***Activates downstream genes to repair DNA
***Signals molecule to confirm damage and proceed with apoptosis
**Arrests cell cycle by mediating RB pathway
*CHEK2 gene at 22q12.1 also associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
**Reported in only a few families thus far
**Putative tumor suppressor gene
***Lies in TP53 pathway
***One of checkpoint genes activated in response to DNA damage by phorsphorylating p53
**Not known if cancer risks are different than those due to TP53 mutations
**Mutations in this gene appear to be most common in osteosarcomas
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
**Offspring of affected individuals have 50% chance of inheriting mutation
**Most individuals diagnosed have an affected parent
**De novo mutation rate unknown
*Fewer than 400 families reported worldwide
*Association of malignancies with TP53 mutations
**Less than 1% of all breast cancers
**2-10% of childhood brain tumors
**50-100% of childhood adrenocortical carcinomas
**2-3% of osteosarcomas
**9% of rhabdomyosarcomas
**7-20% of multiple primaries occurring at young ages
*Penetrance
**May be as high as 90%
**About 25% of cancers occur before age 18
**About 50% of individuals have malignancy by age 40
**About 90% of individuals have malignancy by age 70
**Different studies give different numbers - may be genetic heterogeneity

==Clinical Features==
*Predisposes to a number of different types of tumors
**Osteosarcomas (23/151)
**Soft-tissue sarcomas (32/151)
**Pre-menopausal breast cancers (36/151)
**Brain tumors - neuroblastoma commonly (14/151)
**Adrenal cortical tumors (4/151)
**Leukemia - particularly acute leukemia (9/151)
*Also associated with excess rates of other cancers
**Melanoma
**Stomach cancer
**Colon cancer
**Pancreatic cancer
**Esophageal cancer
**Gonadal germ cell tumors diagnosed at young ages
**Wilm's tumor
*Adult women have higher cancer risk than men because of high frequency of breast cancer
*Also increases risk to develop multiple primary cancers
**Up to 50% may develop second cancer
**4% develop third cancer
**2% develop four cancers
**Survivors of childhood cancer have greatest risk to develop another primary
**Radiation exposure appears to increase risk of second cancer
*Genotype-phenotype correlation
**R337H mutations associate with development of childhood adrenocortical carcinoma as low penetrance allele
**13964gc mutation in intron 6 in series of patients with breast cancer as low penetrance allele

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical diagnostic criteria (LFS)
**Proband with sarcoma diagnosed under 45 years of age
**First-degree relative with any cancer under 45 years of age
**Third family member who is first- or second-degree relative with cancer under 45 or sarcoma at any age
*Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL)
**Share some, but not all features of LFS
**Birch's definition
***Proband with any childhood cancer or sarcoma, brain tumor, or adrenal cortical tumor diagnosed under 45 years of age
***First- or second-degree relative with a typical LFS cancer at any age
***Additional first- or second-degree relative with any cancer under the age of 60
**Eele's definition
***Two first- or second-degree relatives with LFS-related malignancies
***Can occur at any age
*Molecular genetic testing
**Identifies mutations in TP53 gene in about 70% of patients with LFS and 8-22% of families with LFL
**DNA sequencing
***Available clinically
***Identifies mutations in about 75% of families
***About 80% of identifiable mutations are in exons 5-8 so testing is often limited to only these exons
***Full gene sequencing and protein function for novel missense mutations generally only offered on research basis
**Chip-based DNA sequencing
***Available on research basis only
***Detects most of common single base pair mutations that have been identified
***Sensitivity of 90-98% depending on how much of coding region is sequenced
**Can test asymptomatic individuals once mutation is identified in the family
***Cannot predict age of onset, severity, type of cancer, or rate of preogression
***Lack of proven surveillance or prevention so not justified for management but may be useful for reproductive, financial, and career planning or peace of mind
***Testing has been confined to individuals 18 and older since no proven management options
**Prenatal testing is possible if mutation identified in family but requires careful genetic counseling
**Potential risks of testing
***May not be covered by insurance
***Possible problems with health, life, and disability insurance coverage
***Possible employment and educational discrimination
***Changes in social and family interaction
***Implications for other at-risk family members
***Limitations in management options
**Potential benefits of testing
***Explanation for frequent/rare occurrence of cancer in family

****Requires 6 cc of whole blood in yellow or lavender topped tube
****Full mutation analysis - $450, known mutation analysis $250
****Turn-around time is 4 weeks
***University of Pennsylvania
****Conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE)
****Shows differences in 2 alleles as small as single base substitution, insertion, deletion
****Sensitivity estimated to be greater than 95% in coding sequence
****Turn-around time is 4 weeks
***Fairview Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory
****Sequencing analysis
****Requires 15 ml blood in yellow topped tube
****Turn-around time is 4-8 weeks

==Management==
*No surveillance except breast cancer screening has been show to reduce morbidity and mortality
*At-risk individuals should pay attention to signs and symptoms
**Lingering aches and illnesses
**Headaches, bone pain, abdominal discomfort
*Surveillance for at-risk children
**Complete physical exam
**Urinalysis
**Complete blood count
**Abdominal ultrasound examination
**Additional organ-targeted surveillance based on family history

**Annual complete physical exam including skin, nervous system, rectum, and Pap smear for women
**Consider scans of head and abdomen annually
**Semi-annual clinical breast exam for women
**Annual mammograms, breast ultrasonography, or MRI
***Mammograms controversial because of increased sensitivity to radiation
***Should begin screening by age 25-30
**Additional organ-targeted surveillance based on family history

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome

**Due to mutations in RB1 gene at 13q14
**RB1 protein is negative regulator of cell growth
**Approximately 90% of retinoblastomas occur before age 3
**Increases risk to develop osteosarcoma 500-fold
*Rothmund-Thomson syndrome - Autosomal recessive
**Due to mutations in RECQL4 gene at 8q24.3 in some families
**Cancer risks increased but not quantified
**Clinical features include:
***Skin atrophy marbleized pigmentation

==Contracting==
*Before we get started, I want to give you a chance to ask any questions or express any concerns that you may have.
*What issues do you want to make sure we discuss? What do you want to gain from our session today?
*Our plan:
**talk about your medical history and diagnosis
**discuss your family history in a little more detail
**talk about the genetics of hereditary cancers
**we'll explain what we see and discuss your risks
**talk about genetic testing - what it tests, limitations
**discuss ways for you to stay healthy

==Medical History==
*Tell me how you got to this point. How was your ovarian cancer diagnosed?
*Fill out intake with details.
*Any other medical illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?

==Family History==
*Update pedigree with details. A pedigree is our &quot;physical exam&quot;. Gives us clues as to whether the cancer is hereditary. It's important to know who has AND who doesn't have cancer.
**Very specific questions about the cancer in different family members
**Age at diagnosis
**Current age &amp; screening practices
**Age at death &amp; specific cause of death
**Primary site of cancer (type, location, stage, laterality)
**Metastasis or any new primary cancers
**Methods of treatment/surgery
**Any types of precancerous lesions
**Ethnic background
**Environmental exposures
**Lifestyle issues (diet, exercise, stress)
**Screening habits of &quot;unaffected&quot; relatives
**Any other medical conditions that may be associated with cancer
**any family hx of early heart attacks, blindness, deafness, birth defects, or multiple miscarriages

==Cancer Epidemiology==
*Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells. All cancers are genetic, but not all are inherited. It is a multifactorial disorder, caused by both genetic and non-genetic factors.
*Cancer is a very common disease. 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will develop some form of cancer in their lifetimes. The most common cancer sites are lung, breast, prostate, and colon.
*In the U.S., 1 in 55 women will develop ovarian cancer (1.8% lifetime risk)
**5-10% of all ovarian cancer is hereditary (meaning that it runs in families)
**90% of this is caused by a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation
*In the U.S., 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetimes.
**Average age of developing cancer is 62 (2/3 of the women will be over 55)
**5-10% of all breast cancer is hereditary. Of this, 2/3 (66%) of it is due to a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation
**This gene is the link between breast and ovarian cancer.

==Red Flags==
*How do we know when a cancer is hereditary? We look for clues (red flags).
*What makes us suspicious:
**more than one generation affected
**multiple close relatives affected on the same side of the family
**early age of onset (before 50)
**bilateral cancer or more than one type of cancer in the same person
**rare or unusual cancers

==Genes and Chromosomes==
*Hereditary cancers are caused by a change in a specific gene that is passed on
through a family
**Genes are made of DNA. They have all the instructions for how our bodies grow and develop.
**When there is a change in a gene, it causes the cell to not work properly, so it can grow out of control and become cancerous.
*Genes are packaged on chromosomes. Chromosomes come in pairs, and we inherit one from mom and one from dad.
*This gene is autosomal dominant, so only need one copy of it to inherit a higher risk of cancer. There is a 50% chance of getting it from our parents. If we carry the gene, then we have a 50% chance of passing it on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pallister-Killian Syndrome'''

==Genetic Etiology==
*Tetrasomy 12p (mosaicism)

==Incidence and carrier frequency==
*Very rare disorder
*Affects males and females in equal numbers
*&gt;30 cases reported in the literature

==Risk to various family members==
*Sporadic inheritance, extremely rare
*No increased recurrence risk

==Clinical features==
*Typical findings:
*Hypotonia
*sparse scalp hair
*a high forehead with frontal bossing
*a coarse face
*an abnormally wide space between the eyes
*broad nasal bridge
*highly arched palate
*epicanthal folds
*large ears with lobes that are thick and protrude outward.
*Additional features many include:
*congenital heart defects
*diaphragmatic hernia
*hypopigmentation
*extra nipples
*seizures
*droopy upper eyelids
*strabismus
*contractures
*cognitive delays, speech delays
*mental retardation
*stenosis of the external auditory canal
*abnormal opening in the anus
*hypoplastic lung
*abnormalities of the genitourinary system
*skeletal malformations.

==Testing/Diagnosis==
*the chromosome abnormality in Pallister-Killian Mosaic Syndrome is limited to specific cell types
*mechanism and parental origin of the isochromosome 12p can usually not be determined
*diagnosis is usually made from a chromosome study of skin cells (fibroblasts)
*a blood chromosome study usually shows normal chromosomes
*peripheral blood lymphocytes are continually dividing
*they may lose the extra chromosome with their frequent divisions
*fibroblasts normally cycle less frequently, don't lose the extra chromosome
*Other reasons to test skin cells:
*During the 3rd week of fetal development gastrulation determines 3 germ layers
*Ectoderm: gives rise to the epidermis (skin) and central nervous system
*Endoderm: gives rise to the inner lining of the digestive tract and also the linings of tissues that sprout from the digestive tract, such as the respiratory system, liver, and pancreas
*Mesoderm: gives rise to tissues such as bones, muscle, blood, and connective tissue
*If a chromosome error arises after these tissues differentiate, there could be an error in the skin cells that is not present in other tissues that came from other germ layers

==Surveillance, management, and treatment options==
*There is no specific therapy for individuals with Pallister-Killian Syndrome
*Because of poor prognosis, generally only supportive care
*Affected children may benefit from early intervention programs and special education

==Differential diagnoses==
*Fryns syndrome

==Psychosocial issues==
*Grief over loss of &quot;normal baby&quot;
*Shock over unexpected problems
*Worry about prognosis
*Uncertainty about testing and procedures
*Financial considerations, what will treatment cost?
*Who is their support network?
*Effects on relationships (parent/child)
*Concern about telling other family members
*Future reproductive decisions
*Possible disruption of marital relationships or family dynamics

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pancreatic Cancer'''

==Pancreatic Cancer==
*Incidence is more than 29,000 new cases/year in US
**Fifth leading cause of cancer death
**4.1% five-year survival rate is lowest of all cancers
**About 9-10% of pancreatic cancer is familial
*Pancreas is a gland located in the abdomen between the stomach and the spine
**Responsible for producing insulin, glucagon, and other hormones
**Releases digestive juices through series of ducts leading to common bile duct
*Risk factors for pancreatic cancer
**Smoking - increases risk 2-3 times
**Age - most cancers diagnosed between 60 and 80 years
**Diabetes
**Chronic pancreatitis
***Long-term inflammation of the pancreas
***Especially inherited form of the condition
**Family history
***Risk increases by 4.7% if first degree relative has been diagnosed
***Increases by 7.3% if diagnosis was made before age 60
***Increases by 12.3% if multiple primary cancers in family
**Males and African-Americans may be at increased risk
**Diets high in fat may increase risk

==Diagnosis and Surveillance Options==
*Possible symptoms
**Pain in upper abdomen or upper back
**Yellowing of skin and eyes, dark urine due to jaundice
**Weakness
**Loss of appetite
**Nausea and vomiting
**Weight loss
*Physical exam
**Look for signs of jaundice or changes in area near pancreas
**Check for ascites (build-up of fluid in abdomen)
*Lab tests
**Blood, urine, and stool samples
**Check for bilirubin that may be high if tumor blocking common bile duct prevents its passage
*CT Scan
**Produces detailed picture of abdomen
**Can provide information about nature and location of tumors, resectability
*Ultrasonography
**Transabdominal ultrasound
**Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
***Pass thin, illuminated optic instrument down mouth into stomach
***Ultrasound device at tip of endoscope takes images of pancreas and surrounding areas
*Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
**Pass endoscope through mouth and stomach into first part of small intesting
**Inject dye through catheter into ducts
**Take X-rays to determine if ducts are narrowed or blocked by tumor
*Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (PTC)
**Dye injected through needle inserted through skin into liver
**Dye moves freely through bile ducts unless blocked
**X-rays can show if dye has moved through ducts
*Biopsy
**Fine-needle aspiration
**During EUS or ERCP
**Open abdomen during operation
*Laparoscopy
**Uses several small incisions and TV camera to visualize organs in abdomen
**Usually only used if CT scan shows evidence of metastases

==Treatment==
*Pancreatic cancer is currently difficult to treat so participation in clinical trials is often recommended
*Surgery
**May be used alone or in combination with radiation or chemotherapy
**Whipple procedure
***If tumor is in head of pancreas
***Remove head and part of small intestine, bile duct, and stomach
**Distal pancreatectomy
***Surgeon removes body and tail of pancreas
***May also remove the spleen
**Total pancreatectomy
***Remove entire pancreas
***Also remove part of small intestine and stomach, and all of common bile duct, gallbladder, spleen, and nearby lymph nodes
**Create bypass or insert stent if tumor is blocking common bile duct or duodenum
***Relives jaundice and pain resulting from blockage
***Done if cancer cannot be completely removed surgically
**Side effects of removal of all or part of pancreas
***Diet control and medication may help with food digestion
***Diarrhea, pain, cramping, and feelings of fullness are common
*Radiation therapy and chemotherapy often used to destroy cancer cells

==Genetic Conditions Associated with Pancreatic Cancer==
*Familial Atypical Multiple Mole Melanoma (FAMMM)
**Due to mutations in p16 tumor suppressor gene
**TP16 (CKDN2) located at 9p21
**Affected individuals develop multiple nevi, atypical nevi, melanomas, and pancreatic cancer
*Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome
**Due to mutations in LKB1 (STK11) gene at 19p13.3
**Causes multiple hamartomaous polyps of GI tract and pigmented macules on lips, buccal mucosa, and digits
**Increases risk to develop cancers
***In women: breast, pancreas, uterus, and ovary
***In men: colon, pancreas, lung, or testes
*Hereditary Breast-Ovarian Cancer Syndrome
**Due to mutations in BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene at 13q12
**Most common inherited predisposition to pancreatic cancer identified to date
**Mutations in BRCA2 have been identified in individuals with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer
**Estimated that carriers of 6174delT have 10-fold increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer
**Increases risk for breast, ovarian, prostate, and colon cancers also
*HNPCC
**Due to mutations in mismatch repair genes, including MSH2 and MLH1
**Microsatellite instability has been identified in ~4% of pancreatic cancers
**Should be considered in patients with family history of colon cancer
**Increases risk for colon/rectum, endometrium, ovarian, urinary tract, stomach, and small intestine also
*MEN1
**Due to mutations in menin tumor suppressor gene at 11q13
**Associated specifically with insulinomas (10%) or gastrinomas (40%)
**Can cause tumors on parathyroid and pituitary glands also
*Hereditary Pancreatitis
**Due to mutations in cationic trypsinogen gene on 7q35
**Block inactivation of trypsin, resulting in autodigestion of pancrease

[[Image:Neofelis nebulosa.jpg|thumb|A clouded leopard is at home in trees]]
'''Clouded leopards''' are not truly leopards at all but they spend a great deal of time in trees, just as the true leopards of Africa do.

==Where do clouded leopards live?==
[[Image:Clouded leopard prevalence.png|thumb|left|Areas where the clouded leopards live are colored green]]
Clouded leopards live throughout southern China, the eastern Himalayan Mountains, south-east Asia, and some parts of Indonesia. They prefer to live in tropical or subtropical forests, yet they can also be found living in mangrove swamps and grasslands.

The clouded leopard is a medium-sized wild cat found in the forests of Asia. Little is known about the wild behavior of clouded leopards due to their extremely secretive nature. Much of our understanding of this cat’s natural history and behavior is a result of observations of them in captivity.

==What do clouded leopards look like?==
[[File:Clouded leopard.jpg|thumb|A clouded leopard at the San Antonio zoo]]
At adult age a clouded leopard will range from somewhere between two and a half feet, nose to rump, to three and a half feet. The clouded leopard has short legs for its size.  It also has the longest canine teeth (2-inch fangs) for any similarly sized cat species that lives today.  Only the extinct sabretooth cats had longer canine teeth for their body size.

Clouded leopards are excellent climbers and their major prey animals live in trees. Short flexible legs, large paws, and keen claws combine to make them very sure-footed in this environment. The clouded leopard's tail can be as long as the rest of its body and helps to maintain the cat's balance while moving through the trees. Amazingly, these cats can hang upside-down under branches, and can even climb down tree trunks head-first. Other cats cannot do this because their claws are not shaped in the same way.

The beautiful pattern of the clouded leopard's fur is its most interesting feature.  The large square rosettes look like clouds to some people, and that is how they got the name &quot;clouded leopard.&quot;  Other people think the blotches look more like mint leaves, so they are also called &quot;mint leopards.&quot;

==What do clouded leopards eat, and how do they catch their prey?==

While not much is known about their behaviour in the wild, their prey is thought to be mostly mammals that live in trees, particularly monkeys, along with small mammals, deer, birds, porcupines, goats, wild boar, young buffalo, and domestic livestock.

==Fun facts==
See how much you know about the clouded leopard:
*They can climb down tree trunks head first.
*Like marbled cats and margays, they will sometimes hang head-down from branches using their hind legs.
*Young clouded leopards are born with  spots that become open squares as they grow older.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Partial Trisomy 11q (q14-q21)'''

==Introduction==
*Introduce myself and others
*Assess concerns and what they hope to gain from the session
*Discuss reason for follow-up
*Provide overview of session

==Interim medical/developmental history==

==Discussion of concerns/question==

==Discussion about follow-up plans==

==Elicit interim medical history==
*Any illnesses/hospitalizations/surgeries since last visit in September?
*Current medications
*Any recent medical tests or procedures (since September)?
*Immunizations up to date?
*Review of systems

==Elicit developmental history==

==Elicit interim family history==
*Any newborns in the family?
*Any new information about health problems in family members?
*Any significant changes in family members' health?

==Psychosocial update?==
*Any changes in work?
*Who takes care of during the day?
*Any plans for more children?
*How are finances after paying for ____'s medical needs? Any assistance used or needed?

==Genetic etiology==
*Partial trisomies are usually de novo
*Possible mechanisms for formation of a partial trisomy/duplucation:
*Unequal crossing over during homologous chromosome recombination in meisosis, chromosomes mispaired resulting in duplication in one set of homologous chromosomes and deletion in one set of homologous chromosomes
*Parental gonadal mosaicism-One of his parents could have duplication of this region in some germ cells (caused by same mechanism as above)
*Recurrence risk for parents to have another child with Patient's chromosome rearrangement is less than 0.5% (probably MUCH less, but in case of gonadal mosaicism, we should say this number)
*Risk for any chromosome abnormality in future pregnancy: 1/417 at age 29, 1/384 at age 30 (from Maternal-Fetal Medicine)
*Risk for Patient to have a child with the same chromosome abnormality is about 50%
*Homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis requires the chromosomes to contort in order to pair up properly-this can lead to problems during crossing over, where further chromosome abnormalities could occur, as well as formation of an extra abnormal chromosome
*Fertility may be a problem with Patient, as it commonly is in people with chromosome abnormalities (especially males) and so this may be something the parents or Patient will want to assess after puberty

==Molecular genetics==
*People with duplications in different regions of 11q have been identified in the literature, but none with the same region as Patient
*Even though some of these people's duplicated regions may overlap slightly with Patient's duplicated region, there are very different genes duplicated in those people, and so we would not expect Patient to have the same effects
*Some of the documented literature:
*Delobel B, Delannoy V, Pini G, Zapella M, Tardieu M, Vallee L, Croquette MF. Identification and molecular characterization of a small 11q23.3 de novo duplication in a patient with Rett syndrome manifestations. Am J Med Genet. 1998 Nov 16;80(3):273-80.

*Bader PI, Haney SM, Munsick RA, Schubert SR, Hodes ME. Brief clinical report: neural tube defects in dup(11q). Am J Med Genet. 1984 Sep;19(1):5-8.

==Testing options==
*Chromosome analysis can detect MOST duplications and other chromosome anomalies (FISH may be required if abnormal region on chromosome is small)

:This site is a resource for parents of children with rare chromosome abnormalities.
:It provides parents with contact information for people who know about specific
rare chromosome abnormalities. No one with Patient's specific duplication is
listed; however, there may still be good resources for information and support.

==Conclusion/future plans==
*How do you feel about Patient's health right now?
*What do you envision when you think about Patient's future?
*How do you feel about your risk for a child with a chromosome abnormality in future pregnancies?
*How do you feel about Patient's reproductive possibilities?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Percutaneous Umbilical Blood Sampling (PUBS)'''

==Introduction==
*Welcome and acknowledge prior phone contact
*Discuss the reason for referral
*Elicit prior knowledge about Rh isoimmunization
*Assess questions and concerns
*Discuss overview of the session and explain relevance of each portion
**Medical information and family history
**Rh factor and isoimmunization
**Treatment options for the fetus

==Medical History==

==Explain Genes and Chromosomes==
*Tell patient that we need to discuss genes and chromosomes so she can understand how we can tell that her baby is Rh negative
*Dominant vs. recessive alleles and autosomal dominant inheritance

==Rh Factor and Rh Isoimmunization==
*Rh refers to a protein that is sometimes present on the surface of red blood cells. If a person has this protein, they are Rh positive; if not, they are Rh negative
*A person with Rh negative blood can develop antibodies against Rh positive cells if they are exposed to Rh positive blood. This can happen during pregnancy with an Rh - mother and Rh + fetus.
*These antibodies attack the Rh + fetal cells
*A medication called RhoGAM can be given to an Rh - mother so that she will not produce antibodies against her Rh + fetus
*If the mother makes these antibodies, fetal blood cells will be destroyed and a serious condition called anemia can result. Another more life-threatening condition, immune hydrops fetalis, can also occur. This is the accumulation of water in the fetus, causing severe swelling. This can cause other organ systems in the baby to shut down or not develop correctly.
*Even though Rh is the most common blood protein to cause sensitization in mothers there are other blood proteins such as Kell that can cause isoimmunization.  
==Explain PUBS==
*Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling is a technique used to collect a sample of blood from a fetus through an umbilical vessel
**&quot;Percutaneous&quot; refers to going through skin without puncturing or opening it
*We can use this technique to do a blood transfusion directly into a fetus to treat anemia
**Because of Rh incompatibility, we can't give the blood to the mother-it must be given directly to the baby
*PUBS can be done starting at 16 weeks gestation until birth
*The umbilical vessels connect the baby to the placenta (show on visual aid)
*A doctor and an ultrasound technician will typically be in the room during the procedure. The mother may have someone come in with her if she chooses.
*Mother will lie on an exam table on her back with her hands folded behind her head.
*An ultrasound will be done first to determine the location of the fetus and the placenta
**This is a special type of ultrasound, known as Color Doppler imaging. It allows the best view of the umbilical cord because it uses different colors to measure blood flow in the baby and allows the cord to be seen very easily.
**The physician and ultrasound technician will look for the best place to access the umbilical artery-this is usually where the umbilical cord meets the placenta, since it is farthest from the baby. This is not always possible, so the physician will look for the best spot available. This may include a loop in the umbilical cord, the place where the umbilical cord enters the fetus, or the hepatic vein (inside the fetal body)
*The entire procedure is done under ultrasound guidance
*Once the insertion site has been determined, the mother's abdomen will be sterilized with betadeine
*She will then be injected with a topical anesthetic at the insertion site
*The physician will then insert a special needle into the mother's abdomen, through the uterus and into the umbilical vein
**The needle is a 20 or 22-gauge needle (about the size used for drawing blood) and has a stylet inside of it
**Even though a topical anesthetic has been given, the mother will still feel some cramping when the needle passes through the uterus. Most women say this is the most painful part and compare it to a strong menstrual cramp.
*Once the needle has been inserted, the stylet will be removed and a syringe will be attached to the needle
**The syringe will have a drug in it (heparin) to help with blood clots
*A blood sample will then be taken to see if the baby is anemic. If that test (hematocrit) shows anemia, the procedure will continue.
**Hematocrit allows us to determine whether or not fetal blood cells are being destroyed due to Rh incompatibility.
*The baby will be given a neuromuscular blocking agent. This is to keep the baby from moving during the procedure.
*The blood transfusion will then be given to the baby
*The needle will then be removed and the physician will use ultrasound to check for fetal well-being
*The entire procedure will take less than ten minutes
*This procedure can reverse potentially detrimental conditions in a fetus. The overall survival rate for babies who have had a blood transfusion in utero is 84.7%. For babies without hydrops, the survival rate is 91.1%.
*If necessary, the procedure will be repeated at 2-to-3-week intervals until 34-35 weeks of gestation.
Discharge Instructions
*If the mother is Rh negative, RhoGam needs to be administered within 72 hours.
*After the test, avoid any strenuous activity for 24 hours. This includes standing for long periods of time, lifting, and exercising. A woman may return to work if her job doesn't require physical activity.
*No sexual intercourse, douching, tub baths, or use of tampons for 72 hours.
*Some minor cramping after the procedure is normal. If the cramps become severe, call a doctor. Also, call a doctor if leakage of clear fluid (amniotic fluid) or blood from the vagina, fever, unusual fetal activity, or any other unusual feelings occur.
*A few days after the test, a mother should return for a follow-up ultrasound just to check on the baby. Also, serial ultrasounds are recommended to check for signs of hydrops.

==Risks==
*If the placenta is located closer to the abdominal wall than the fetus is, the needle will pass through the placenta. This can cause maternal-fetal blood mixing.
**RhoGAM will be given to the mother to prevent problems
*1-2% risk for pregnancy loss (this is above the 3-5% background risk)
*Infection (chorioamnionitis) is another risk. Less common risks include blood clots in the umbilical cord, excessive bleeding (mother or baby), decreased fetal heart rate, and placental abruption. The overall risk of any of these things happening is between 1-6.7%, depending on the experience of the physician.
*Loss rates are higher in fetuses who have genetic conditions, structural anomalies, or IUGR. Maternal complications are uncommon.

==Other Testing Options==
*Amniocentesis
**By using amnio, we can look at the amount of bilirubin in the amniotic fluid. This pigment is an indicator of hemolysis and can tell us if the baby is anemic. Also, we can measure the levels of DOD450 to tell if the fetus is anemic.
**This is accurate during the third trimester, but not accurate in the second trimester.
**This can diagnose anemia, but cannot treat it

==Discuss Patient's Feelings About the Procedure==
*Emphasize the fact that this is entirely her choice

==Provide Resources==

==Assess Understanding and Elicit Questions==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Phenylketonuria (PKU)'''

==Introduction/Contracting==
*What is your understanding about why you are here?
*When were you first told about the abnormal test?
*Do you have any specific questions or concerns?
*Outline the visit
**We will be taking a family history
**We will discuss the genetic basis of PKU
**The medical geneticist will obtain some medical history and discuss medical management
**The dietitian will also be visiting with you to discuss the specifics about diet

==Family history==
*Get basic 3 generation pedigree
*Ask about mental retardation, pregnancy losses, birth defects, learning difficulties, chronic health problems, children that died young, and PKU specifically
Basic Info to review with family
*PKU is one of the disorders that is part of the newborn screening for in every state using a heel prick to get a blood sample
*PKU can be successfully treated to prevent symptoms by maintaining a strict diet
*There can be serious effects if the diet is not maintained especially during childhood
*Mental retardation
*Microcephaly
*Delayed speech
*Seizures
*Eczema
*Behavioral abnormalities
*This is a diet that should be maintained throughout life.
*The goal is to maintain phe levels below 6 mg/dl during childhood(some metabolic geneticists prefer to keep them below 5 mg/dl)
*It is especially important that a woman with PKU maintain the diet before and during a pregnancy because high phe can harm the development of the baby.
*Phe is an essential amino acid and is one of the building blocks of protein
*When a baby has an excess amount of phe there are a couple of potential explanations as follows:
**Phenyalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency -- (most common cause, 98% of the time this is explanation)
*(show diagram) This liver enzyme usually converts phenylalanine to another amino acid tyrosine
*Sometimes the gene that tells the body how to make the PAH is changed and so it doesn't work as well or doesn't work at all
*When this happens the path can be blocked and some by products will build up and cause the effects that can be seen in patients that are not on a well controlled diet
**Inability to make or recycle a cofactor that is required to help PAH do its job.
*This is rare and is found in about 2% of those with high phe.
*HOWEVER it can't be ruled out completely until results of the test for this come back which will indicate if this is the explanation.
*Because this cofactor also helps out in other important reactions in our bodies this can often be more severe sometimes referred to as atypical PKU

==Details for Reference==
*tetrahydrobiopterine (BH4), the cofactor in the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylation reactions.
*Defects in BH4 synthesis result from guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase (GTPCH) deficiency or 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterine synthase (PTPS) deficiency.
*Impaired recycling of BH4 is caused by deficient dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) or deficient pterin-4a carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD).
*All of the HPAs caused by BH4 deficiency are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
*They account for approximately 2% of patients with HPA. BH4 is also involved in catecholamine and serotonin biosynthesis.
*The typical (severe) forms of GTPCH, PTPS, and DHPR deficiencies have the following variable, but common, symptoms:
**mental retardation
**Convulsions
**disturbance of tone and posture
**drowsiness
**irritability
**abnormal movements
**recurrent hyperthermia without infections
**hypersalivation
**swallowing difficulties
**Microcephaly is common in PTPS and DHPR deficiencies
*Plasma phenylalanine levels can vary
*Mild forms of BH4 deficiency have no clinical signs
*PCD deficiency, sometimes referred to as &quot;primapterinuria&quot; is associated with benign transient hyperphenylalaninemia.
*Treatment requires the normalization of blood phe concentration and restoration of the BH4-dependent hydroxylation of tyrosine and tryptophan by BH4 supplementation or by dietary modification, neurotransmitter precursor replacement therapy, and supplements of folic acid in DHPR deficiency

==Three category classification==
(when due to altered PAH) based on levels of phe when untreated
*Classic PKU
**due to a complete or near-complete deficiency of PAH activity
**plasma phe concentrations above 20 mg/dl in the untreated state
**must be treated by diet or brain damage will develop
*Non-PKU Hyperphenylalinemia (also referred to as benign hyperphenylalinemia)
**characterized by plasma phe concentrations consistently above normal when the patient is on a normal diet, but not high enough to cause impaired cognitive development
**does not need to be treated by diet
*Variant PKU (intermediate levels and requires some treatment)
**intermediate levels between PKU and benign hyperphenylalinemia
**many metabolic geneticists choose to treat these patients with a modified diet that may not be as restrictive as for those with classical PKU

==Inheritance==
(regardless of whether it is due to PAH gene or to a problem with the cofactor BH4, it is inherited in an AR fashion)
*Autosomal means that the gene for PAH is on a chromosome other than the sex chromosomes
*Recessive means that for a person to have clinical symptoms they must have inherited two copies of the altered gene one from each parent
*We assume that you and your partner (husband) are carriers and don't have symptoms because you each have one functional copy
*Two carriers have a one in four (or 25%) chance for each pregnancy that the baby will have PKU (draw out AR inheritance) and a 50 % chance of having a child that is a carrier just like the parents, a 25% chance of having a child with both functional copies

==Prevalence==
*one in 15,000 live births in Caucasian populations and in Utah (carrier frequency in this population is approximately one in sixty)
*Most literature still quotes one in 10,000 live births in Caucasian and East Asian pop. (one in 60 carrier rate)
*Highly variable among populations
:*Turks one in 2600
:*Irish one in 4500
:*Japanese population one in 143,000
:*Finn and Ashkenazi Jewish populations one in 200,000

==Psychosocial considerations==
*It can feel overwhelming to get a diagnosis and so much information
*Reassure that we don't expect them to remember everything and that is why we'll be sending out a letter that will explain much of what we discuss
*It is common for parents not to even know the test was done or what it means initially
*Concerns about their ability to carry out the diet restrictions
*Scared of the unknown
*Provide information about the PKU picnic and potential to meet other families and see how children with PKU who are on diet since birth don't look or act any different than other children
*Reassure them that it is possible to manage, but don't give the impression that it is super easy because it does take some special planning, time and effort
*Reassure that we all carry genes that don't function properly, but we don't always know what they are unless we happen to find a partner that has one of the same altered genes (estimates are 4-6)
*Explain that we are here to help them and they can call the dietician (Sharon) about diet questions or concerns and us about questions concerning the genetics of PKU
Molecular Genetic Testing
*used primarily for genetic counseling purposes to determine carrier status of at-risk relatives and for prenatal testing
*Over 380 different disease-causing mutations have been identified in the PAH gene
*Molecular diagnosis for these mutations is possible but is only available on a limited clinical basis in the US and Canada
*Mutations are identified and confirmed by DNA analysis using various methods
*When mutation analysis is not available or disease-causing mutations are not identified in a family, linkage analysis can be considered for couples who have a child affected with PAH deficiency
*No other phenotypes are known to be associated with mutations in the PAH gene

==Determination of carrier status==
*Molecular testing used to be offered only to at-risk family members with a positive history
*Now molecular testing can be offered to unrelated spouses and detects carriers with a rate of 98%
*Not recommended for population screening to detect carriers
*Three methods can be used
**analysis of the plasma phe concentration and phe/tyr ratio (this test must take into account circadian variation and variations in a woman's menstrual cycle; it is not accurate during pregnancy.) When these variations are taken into account there is a 0.01 probability or less of heterozygote misclassification
**DNA analysis if the disease-causing PAH mutation in the family is known
**Linkage analysis with markers in the PAH gene

==Prenatal Testing==
*Prenatal testing (once the genotype of the proband has been established) is possible for fetuses at 25% risk for PAH deficiency by amnio and CVS
*Has also been done with linkage studies

==Addenda==
THE REST OF THE OUTLINE IS ONLY IF QUESTIONS ARISE, but much of it will be talked about by other members of the team

==Symptoms/prognosis==
*Each person with PKU is affected differently and at varying levels of severity
*Appear to have some other factors that may modify the phenotype (modifier genes and definitely environment)
*Variations in severity correlate somewhat with the type of over 500 mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene located at chromosomal locus 12q22-q24
*If diet is adhered to intelligence is usually in normal range, but still tends to be slightly lower than expected based on sibling and parent IQ's, but it mostly tends to correlate with levels of phe that are maintained and age at which treatment begun
*Untreated patients often have:
**abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs)
**seizures
**neurologic disorders
**a musty odor
**varying degrees of mental retardation
*Other possible symptoms include:
**increased occurrences of eczema
**tremor in the hands and eyelids
**memory problems
**raised levels of anxiety and depression
**social disorders, i.e. agoraphobia
**decreased motor functions, i.e. hand-eye coordination
**on average, a loss of one IQ point per year off diet
*Behavior problems of untreated or late-treated patients with PKU include:
**Hyperactivity
**aggressiveness
**negative moods
**motor and attention disturbances
**self-inflicted injury

==Screening==
*carried out in every state in the US and in many other countries with a heel-prick blood test
*screening started in the mid-1960's however this could be earlier or later depending on which state and hospital
*Utah statewide screening for PKU began in 1965 and galactosemia screening was added in 1979
*PKU detected in virtually 100% of cases
*Used to be done with Guthrie test that detected the presence of high phe by whether or not bacteria that were auxotrophic for phe would grow
*Utah uses the Delphia method which is a fluormetric assay and is semi-quantitative
*Mass spectrometry is now being used by some states (better accuracy and less false positives then Guthrie test)
*In the US there are several hundred babies diagnosed and put on diet each year
*An initial positive test does not necessarily mean that the child will have PKU
*A false positive elevated phe concentration (hyperphenylalaninemia) may result from:
**a blood spot that is too thick (when using Guthrie test)
**a sample that is improperly prepared
**combinations of the following: liver immaturity, protein overload (in newborns who are fed cow's milk), and heterozygosity for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.
*A second screening will be performed if the first is failed
*If the second test is positive, than further quantitative testing will be performed to confirm the levels of phe
*After hyperphe has been established, further tests must be done to distinguish those infants with PAH deficiency from the ~2% of infants with hyperphenylalaninemia who have impaired tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis or recycling)
*After diagnosis, the infant is treated without delay

==Diet for PKU==
*Medical management is a low phe diet maintained throughout life
*Just the right amount of phe is required because some is necessary for the body to make proteins
*Adults with PKU who were not diagnosed at birth and have suffered irreversible brain damage can still benefit significantly from being placed on a phenylalanine-restricted diet (improved behavior noted)
*not a typical vegetarian or vegan diet
*protein replaced by low phe formula, usually taken in powdered form mixed with water
*excludes all meat, fish, poultry, dairy, eggs, legumes chickpeas), nuts and seeds
*diet includes starchy foods, fruits, vegetables, special low-protein products, and foods that contain no protein
*starchy foods in the PKU diet contribute enough phenylanine
*diet sweeteners such as Nutrasweet®, Sweetmate®, Canderal®, or aspartame® are made from phenylalanine and aspartic acid and should be avoided
*diet must be carefully monitored so that growth and nutritional status are unaffected and deficiency of phenylalanine or tyrosine is not created.
*must be adjusted for growth, illness, activity, etc.

==Treatment in infancy and childhood==
*A phe-restricted diet and a phe-free medical formula must be started as soon as possible after birth under the direction of a nutritionist
*Intake of tyrosine and total amino acids must be monitored
*Consumption of phe-free formula should be spread out evenly over the 24 hours of the day to minimize fluctuations in blood amino acid concentrations
*avoid long periods of low blood phe concentration, which is also harmful to brain development
*blood phe concentration should be monitored periodically to evaluate control
*Recommendations for monitoring may vary, but levels should be maintained below 6 mg/dl according to NIH consensus
*Levels are usually taken weekly or bi-weekly in infancy and less frequently as a child gets older

==Treatment in adolescence and adulthood==
*Recommendations for treatment of adolescents and adults vary
*In general, support for &quot;diet therapy for life&quot; is increasing
*Adults who have abandoned the phe-restricted diet tend to have a reduced attention span, slow information processing abilities, and slow motor reaction time
*They also develop changes in the frequency distribution of brain electrical activity, increased muscle tone and tremor, lowered bone mineral content and mental health disorders
*Controversy remains over the plasma phe concentration to be achieved for patients older than 12 years of age
*General consensus is that the closer the phe concentration is to the recommended normal value, the better is the individual's general state of well being

==Treatment for patients with levels below that of classical PKU==
*Patients with non-PKU HPA who have plasma phe concentrations consistently below (10mg/dl) have been shown to not be at higher risk of developing intellectual, neurological, and neuropsychological impairment than individuals without PAH deficiency
*Some specialists believe that dietary treatment is unnecessary for the individuals in this class
*However, others debate the advisability of non-treatment and will treat if level is above 5-6mg/dl

==Maternal PKU risks==
*fetus can be severely damaged in the womb before birth by the effects of the mother's high PHE levels
*Blood PHE levels of a pregnant woman transferred at a 1:3 ratio to fetus
*very possible to have normal, healthy children if the mother follows the low-phenylalanine diet strictly before conception and throughout the pregnancy
*women with PAH deficiency who are planning a pregnancy should start a phe-restricted diet prior to conception and should maintain plasma phe concentrations between 2 to 6mg/dl (ideally over several months) before attempting conception, but the exact preferred level depends on the clinic. (At the U of U Nichola prefers that they are kept between 2-4 mg/dl)
*after conception, they should be offered continuous nutritional guidance and weekly or bi-weekly measurement of plasma phe concentration because dietary phe and protein requirements change considerably during pregnancy
*the likelihood that the fetus will have congenital heart disease, intrauterine and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly, and mental retardation depends upon the severity of the maternal HPA and the effectiveness of her dietary restriction
*Potential consequences to the fetus if diet is not maintained
**mental retardation
*slowness in learning ability and growth
*affect on short term memory
*low birth size
*microcephaly
*congenital heart disease

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pituitary Tumor'''

==Introduction==
*Acknowledge prior contact and receipt of family history information
*Assess the most important concerns since there are so many issues at hand
*Discuss family plans (timing, size, etc.) and how those plans may be influenced by what is learned today

==Intake and Family History==
*Review family history information and personal health information already obtained
*Use pedigree to make the review easier
*Specifically ask about cancer in the family
*Ask about pituitary tumor
**When was it diagnosed? How? By whom?
**What symptoms was she having?
**Did she receive any treatment beside the drug mentioned?
**Was surgery or radiation therapy ever discussed?
**Has her physician discussed recurrence risks with her?

==What is the Pituitary Gland?==
*The pituitary gland is a small, bean-shaped gland located in the center of the brain just above the back of the nose
*The pituitary gland makes hormones that affect the growth and functions of other glands in the body; therefore it is sometimes called the &quot;master gland&quot;
*Some hormones produced by the pituitary include: Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, Growth Hormone, Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, Luteinizing and Follicle Stimulating Hormones, Vasopressin, and others
*When there is an abnormality of the pituitary gland, it often produces either too much or too little of one or a combination of hormones. This can result in a variety of hormonal problems that can affect the whole body.
*Enlargement of the gland can also cause visual disturbances and/or impairment

==Pituitary Tumors==
*Pituitary tumors or adenomas are almost always benign which means that they grow slowly and do not spread to other parts of the body
*Pituitary tumors are rare.
*Some may be &quot;silent&quot; lesions that are incidentally found at autopsy
*The manifestations of a pituitary tumor depend on the hormones secreted by the tumor and the pattern of growth
*Some hormonally active tumors are those that produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, or growth-hormone
*Hormonally-inactive adenomas are often larger and may exhibit invasive properties. Thus, the likelihood for blindness is greater in patients with this tumor type
*Pituitary tumors are seen in one of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. MEN type I is well recognized, dominantly inherited, and comprises tumors of the parathyroid, pancreas and pituitary. Eighty percent of patients have involvement of 2 or more glands, and pituitary tumors occur in 54% to 80% of patients with MEN I.
*MRI most readily determines the presence of a pituitary tumor, although it may also be established by CT (computer tomography) scan.
*Many patients experience visual loss. Headaches occur in about 20%.

==Treatment==
*Treatment depends upon the type of tumor and if it extends into the brain around the pituitary.
*Hormone-secreting tumors may be treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Drug therapy with bromocriptine has been used with success in patients with prolactin-secreting tumors.
*Lesions that extend beyond the confines of the pituitary often require radiation therapy and surgery

==Risk for==
*I could not find a population rate for pituitary tumors, only that they are &quot;very rare&quot;
*sister was probably treated with bromocriptine which was used in the past for lactation cessation and is currently used to treat prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors
*Her tumor was likely small at the start, and she has responded well to treatment thus far
*Even if sister has a recurrence of the tumor, it will not affect the risk that this couple would have a child with a pituitary tumor

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Polycystic Kidney Disease'''

==Introduction==
*Greet the family/parent
*What do you understand about why you are here in genetics today?
*What questions or concerns do you want to have addressed today?

==Elicit Medical History==
(interim history form)
*update medical history since last seen
*determine if there have been any problems since released from the hospital
*assess developmental history

==Update Family History==
*Update pedigree
*determine if there are any other family members with kidney problems, heart problems, liver problems or that died in early infancy

==What is Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)?==
*Two main types
**Autosomal Dominant PKD (adult PKD)
**Autosomal Recessive PKD (infantile PKD)

==ADPKD==
*Etiology and Natural History
**gene PKD1 mutated in about 85% of cases
**gene PKD2 mutated in about 15% of cases
symptoms usually develop beginning in early adulthood although can be found in the infant period or not begin until later in adulthood
**large amount of variability both within and between families
*Prevalence and Inheritance
**most common single gene disorder that is potentially lethal
**prevalence at birth: 1/400 - 1/1000
**10% of cases due to new mutation
**occurs in all races
**inherited in autosomal dominant fashion
***if one parent is affected there is a 50% chance of having an affected child
*Symptoms
**multiple bilateral renal cysts (100% of cases)
***leads to end stage renal insufficiency by 60 years old in 50% of cases
**cysts in other organs specifically the liver (20% by 3rd decade; 75% by 6th decade)
**intracranial aneurysms (10% of cases)
***more common in patients with family history of intracranial aneurysms (22%) than those without this history (6%)
**mitral valve prolapse and other heart defects
*Diagnosis
**patients with known 50% risk
***at least 2 cysts either unilateral or bilateral by 30years of age
***large kidneys without cysts in infants and children
**patients with no known risk
***bilateral renal enlargements and cysts
***in absence of indication for different renal cystic disease
***suggestive of ADPKD, but not definite diagnosis
**Differential from:
***ARPKD - unaffected parents
***Glomerulocystic kidney disease - minimal tubular involvement
*Molecular Testing
**Linkage analysis - need a large number of family members to establish which gene is responsible
**Prenatal Testing - only available after a mutation has been identified in an affected family member
*Management
**no treatment for disease itself
**treat symptoms to prevent premature death and alleviate pain

==ARPKD==
*Etiology and Natural History
**mutation in PKHD1 locus (6p21) present in all studied patients with ARPKD
**enlarged echogenic kidneys found in perinatal period
**large amount of variability both within and between families
**30% of patients with ARPKD die in neonatal period
*Prevalence and Inheritance
**prevalence: 1/20,000 - 1/40,000
**prevalence may be underestimated due to death in neonatal period
**carrier frequency: 1/70
**inherited in autosomal recessive fashion
***if both parents are carriers there is a 25% chance of having a child who is affected , 50% chance of having a child who is a carrier, and a 25% chance of having
*Symptoms
**enlarged, echogenic kidneys with poor differentiation (100% of cases)
***renal function impaired in 70-80% of cases
**hypertension
***usually occurs within first week of life
**Liver disease (45% of cases at presentation)
**pulmonary hypoplasia resulting from oligohydramnios
**other abnormalities: low set ears, micrognathia, flattended nose, growth deficiency
*Diagnosis
**enlarged echogenic kidneys with poor differentiation
**one or more of the following:
***absence of renal cysts in parents
***signs of hepatic fibrosis
***pathoanatomical proof of ARPKD in affected sibling
***parental consanguinity suggesting AR inheritance
**Differential from:
***ADPKD - more likely to have bilateral macrocysts
***Glomerulocystic kidney disease - minimal tubular involvement
*Molecular Testing
**Linkage analysis - based on accurate diagnosis of ARPKD in affected individual and accurate understanding of relationships in family
**Prenatal Testing - only available after a linkage has been identified in an affected family member
*Management
**no treatment for disease itself
**treat symptoms to prevent premature death and alleviate pain
***stabilize respiratory function
**feeding difficulty and growth failure in chidren

==Psychosocial Issues==
*uncertainty of diagnosis and prognosis may lead to anxiety
*possibity that parent could find out they have the diease (for ADPKD)
*guilt over passing trait to child
*Concern for risks to future pregnancies
*Are you interested in pursuing linkage analysis?
*How are you dealing with your son's health problems?
*Are you anxious about the possibility of upcoming surgeries?
*Reassure that this could not have been prevented

==Recommended Follow-up for PKD==
*renal ultrasounds to monitor cysts and function
*control of hypertension
*CT scan to detect aneurysm (ADPKD)
*monitor liver function

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Polydactyly and Syndactyly'''



==Medical and Family History==
*Medical history
**How/when did they diagnose the polydactyly/syndactyly?
**Is it bilateral?
**Has she had X-rays or other imaging? Is this scheduled?
**Pregnancy history - teratogen exposures, illness, womb anomalies
**Birth history - any complications?
**Hearing screen? Responses to sound?
*Family history
**Polydactyly/syndactyly? Other limb anomalies?
**Cleft lip or palate?
**Learning difficulties? Mental retardation?
**Heart defects? Kidney abnormalities?
**Skeletal abnormalities? Short stature? Other birth defects?

==Overview of Hand/Foot Abnormalities==
**Presence of more than normal number of fingers or toes
**Can vary from rudimentary finger or toe to fully developed extra digits
*Syndactyly
**Webbing or fusing of two or more fingers or toes
**Varies from incomplete webbing of skin of two digits to complete untion of digits or fusion of bones and nails
**Fusion can be connected by shared skin, bones, nerves, vessels, or nails
*Polysyndactyly is presence of extra digits that are fused
*Fetal development of digits
**Limbs arise from small limb buds
***Upper limb bud appears 26-27 days after fertilization, lower limb bud 28-30 days
***Consists of mesenchymal core covered by epithelial tissue
**Apical ectodermal ridge (AER) forms along anteroposterior surface
***Longitudinal growth of limb with pattern forming proximodistally and anteroposteriorly
***Homeobox genes and morphogen (possibly retinoic acid) provide information for cell growth and division
**Separation of digits occurs due to programmed cell death in interdigital zones
*Anything that disrupts patterning or programmed cell death can result in limb defect

==Syndactylies==
*Most are malformations except when associated with amniotic bands
*Can be classified based on anatomic criteria
**Syndactyly type I
***Cutaneous syndactyly of fingers 3 and 4 or toes 2 and 3
***Can be bilateral in hands (50%) and feet (66%)
***Syndactyly of toes is four times more common than fingers
***Can be inherited as autosomal dominant trait
***About twice as common in males than in females
**Syndactyly type II (synpolydactyly)
***Syndactyly of fingers 3 and 4 or toes 4 and 5 with partial or complete duplication of digit
***Can be variable, hand anomalies can be severe including clinodactyly
***Extra digit may have fused, forked, or broad metacarpals and metatarsals, complete or partial duplications or digit
***Incidence is uncertain, some autosomal dominant forms have been reported
**Syndactyly type III
***Variable cutaneous or osseous syndactyly of fingers 3 to 5
***Syndactyly might be complete or partial, nails may be fused
***Condition is rare
**Syndactyly type IV (Haas type polysyndactyly)
***Complete cutaneous syndactyly of fingers and/or thumbs with a degree of polydactyly on radiography and a hypoplastic or triphalangeal thumb
***Hands often resemble &quot;mitten&quot; deformity
***Rarely seen as isolated defect, very rare with few families reported
**Syndactyly type V
***Metacarpal and metatarsal fusion associated with variable degrees of syndactyly
***Usually involves digits 4 and 5 but can be variable
***Can be variable involvement within families
***Autosomal dominant and X-linked recessive families have been described
***Rare - only 10 families reported
**Complete syndactyly
***Includes digits 2-5 and may include thumb also
***Usually seen with Apert syndrome (craniosynostosis)
**Cenani-Lenz syndrome
***Syndactyly involving all elements of all digits, often with fusion of radius and ulna or tibia and fibula
***Hands and feet often appear as mass of digits
***Autosomal recessive inheritance
**Preaxial syndactyly
***Failure of separation of preaxial digits of hands and feet
***Postaxial digits are relatively normal
***Lack of separation of thumb from finger 2 in hands, similar in feet
***Only reported in one family
**Symbrachydactyly
***Shortening of phalanges and other elements of digits in association with cutaneous syndactyly
***Usually seen unilaterally, middle phalanges tend to be more severely affected
***Incidence estimated to be 1/32,000

==Polydactylies==
*Usually manifest as extra digits or incomplete digits resulting in broad or bifid digit
*Postaxial polydactyly (80% of cases)
**Extra digit on ulnar or fibular side of limb
**Type A postaxial polydactyly
***Digit usually consists of three phalanges and nail
***Extra digit is relatively well formed but some or all of elements may be reduced
**Type B postaxial polydactyly
***Extra digit is represented by small conical projection or tag containing distal phalanx and nail on fifth digit
***10 times more common in African-Americans than Caucasians
***Unilateral in 2/3 of cases, affects left side twice as commonly as right
***Autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance
*Preaxial polydactyly
**Preaxial polydactyly type I
***Complete or partial duplication of a normal biphalangeal thumb
***Varies from extra phalanx to complete hypoplastic thumb
***May cause broadening of distal phalanx to triphalangeal thumb
***More common in males, most often unilateral, usually not familial
***Part of many malformation syndromes
**Preaxial polydactyly type II (triphalangeal thumb)
***Opposable thumb with three phalanges
***Estimated incidence is 1/25,000
***Usually sporadic, associated with prenatal hydantoin and thalidomide exposure, can be autosomal dominant
**Preaxial polydactyly type III (polydactyly of an index finger)
***Duplication of the index finger with or without an additional biphalangeal or triphalangeal thumb
***Can be autosomal dominant or associated with genetic syndromes
**Preaxial polydactyly type IV (polysyndactyly)
***Duplication of preaxial digits associated with syndactyly of the extra rays
***May see broadening of thumbs or six or seven toes
***Autosomal dominant with complete penetrance
***Sporadic cases occur in 1/10,000 births
**Mirror hands and feet
***Polydactyly of hand or foot with appearance of mirror duplication around midline axis of arm or leg in absence of recognizable thumb or great toe
***Very rare with a few autosomal dominant cases but usually sporadic

==Treatment/Management Options==
*Diagnosed by external observation, X-ray, or ultrasound
*Polydactyly
**Can be corrected surgically to improve appearance and functioning
**Usually done at 1 year of age so skeletal development is complete and accurate anatomic assessment can be done
**May require reconstruction of any associated abnormalities in remaining digit
**Cast and soft dressing may be used until healed
*Syndactyly
**Treatment aimed at maintaining and improving function with cosmetic benefits
**Involves surgery and may require skin graft from groin area
**Surgery usually done after 1 year and may be delayed as late as 18-24 months

      <text xml:space="preserve">Body language is, more generally, not specific to [[Guide to Social Activity/Courtship|Courtship]]. Improvements needed to this module:
* '''Expanded scope''' - not only gender neutrality, but the meanings of body language outside the limited idea of courtship/dating.
* '''Verifiability''' - this module appears to contain some speculations, and it is necessary to have a way to check them. A good way to start establishing this would be to create links to Wikipedia articles.
--[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:54, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

The how-to in this module might to too passive. Sometimes it suggests to let the other person do something, when you could do it. For example, in the current version, instead of letting the other person observe your rapport, ''you'' could observe the rapport of the other person. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:02, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

==What is Prader-Willi Syndrome?==
*A complex, multi-system mental retardation disorder
*The first recognized microdeletion syndrome identified when high-resolution chromosome analysis was introduced
*Now known to be one of the most common microdeletion syndromes
*Also one of the most common recognized genetic forms of obesity
*Caused by several different genetic alterations of proximal chromosome 15q

==Etiology &amp; Incidence==
*History
**Prader-Willi syndrome was first described in 1956.
*The basis of Prader-Willi syndrome
**Caused by the lack of expression of normally active paternally inherited genes at chromosome 15q11-q13
**The maternally inherited genes are normally inactive due to genetic imprinting
***Imprinting is a phenomenon by which some genes are modified in different ways depending on the genederof the parent from whom they were inherited
**There are 3 ways in which P-W syndrome can be caused.
***Small deletion in the paternally contributed chromosome 15
****This is seen in 75% of patients
****Usually the deletion is 4-Mb or smaller
***Uniparental disomy 15 (UPD)
****Inheritance of 2 maternal chromomes 15 but no paternal chromosome 15
***Defect in the imprinting process
****Seen in approximately 1% of patients
****Very small deletion or other abnormality in the imprinting center
****All studied families in which there has been a recurrence of P-W have had an imprinting mutation.
**The actual genes whose deficiency that cause the phenotype have not yet been identified
**One-third of patients with P-W exhibit hypopigmentation due to deletion of a gene associated with tyrosinase-positive albinism
*Incidence
**1 in 10,000 - 15,000
**Occurs in both sexes and all races
**Diagnosis is often delayed or missed in many cases

==Clinical Features &amp; Natural History==
*Neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive
**Hypotonia is prenatal in onset and nearly uniformly present
**Causes decreased fetal movement, frequent abnormal fetal position, and difficulty at time of delivery
**State of hypoarousal are associated with poor suck and lack of awakening to feed
**Hypotonia gradually improves
**Motor milestones are delayed
***Average age of sitting is 12 months
***Average age of walking is 24 months
**It is recommended that all newborns with persistent hypotonia be tested for P-W
*Developmental delay and mild cognitive impairment
**Language development is delayed
***Speech is often poorly articulated, having a nasal and/or slurred character
**Most patients are mildly retarded
***Mean IQ 60s to low 70s
**Approximately 40% have borderline retardation or low normal intelligence
**20% have moderate retardation
*Characteristic facial appearance
**Narrow bifrontal diameter
**Almond-shaped palpebral fissures
**Narrow nasal bridge
**Downturned mouth with a thin upper lip
*Early-childhood-onset obesity
**Hyperphagia begins generally between ages 2 and 4 leading to significant obesity
**Hypothalamic abnormality results in lack of satiety
**There is a decreased caloric requirement likely related to hypotonia and decreased activity
**Food seeking behaior with hoarding or faraging for food and stealing food or money to buy food are common
**High threshold for vomiting may complicate binging on spoiled food
**The obesity is central in distribution, with relative sparing of the distal extremities
**Obesity is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in P-W syndrome
*Hypogonadism with genital hypoplasia
**Hypogonadism is prenatal in onset and persists throughout life
**Genital hypoplasia is evident at birth
**Pubertal development is abnormal
**In both males and females, sexual activity is uncommon and fertility is rare
*Mild short stature
**If not apparent in childhood, it is almost always present by the second half of the second decade
**Average height is 155cm for males and 148cm for females
**African-Americans tend to be taller
*Characteristic behavior profile
**Becomes evident in early childhood
**Tempor tantrums, stubbornness, controlling and manipulative behavior
**Obsessive-compulsive characteristics
**Difficulty with change in routing
**Lying, stealing, and aggressive behavior
**True psychosis is evident in young adulthood in approximately 5-10%
*Sleep disturbances
**Excessive daytime sleepiness and oxygen desaturation in REM sleep
**These are common even in the absence of obesity

==Inheritance==
*P-W is caused by a lack of expression of the paternally derived PWS/AS region of chromosome 15q11-q13 by one of several genetic mechanisms
*Deletion of PWS/AS region
**70% of patients have P-W syndrome by this genetic mechanism
**&lt;1% risk to siblings of an affected proband
**Most of these cases are de novo deletions
**A small number of cases are due to translocation with a concomitant deltion
**If a parent has a balanced chromosomal translocation the recurrence risk could be as high as 25%
*Uniparental disomy
**25% of patients have P-W syndrome by this genetic mechanism
**&lt;1% risk to siblings of an affected proband
*Imprinting defect
**&lt;5% of patients have P-W syndrome by this genetic mechanism
**The risk to siblings of an affected proband is up to 50%
**A healthy parent can carry this imprinting defect
**But recurrence risk may be lower because imprinting defects can be de novo mutations
*Balanced chromosome translocation within 15q11-q13 or abnormality
**&lt;1% of patients have P-W syndrome by this genetic mechanism
**All of these cases have been de novo
**Risk to siblings of an affected proband is &lt;1%
**If a familial case is detected, the theoretical risk of inheritance of the balanced translocation could be as high as 25%

==Diagnosis==
*Genetic testing
**Molecular Genetic Testing
***Testing for the parent-specific methylation imprint detects over 99% of cases and is highly specific
***Methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the diagnosis in all children
***The methylation abnormality can be determined by southern blot hybridization using a methylation-sensitive probe (SNRPN or PW71B) or with parent-specific PCR primers
***If the methylation pattern is characteristic of maternal inheritance only, then the diagnosis is confirmed
***DNA methylation testing detects all cases caused by deletions, UPD, and imprinting defects
***Once the diagnosis is established, further tests are done to classify the mutation
****Deletions can be detected using FISH analysis
****UPD can be detected with informative microsatellite markers
****An imprinting defect is presumed to be present in patients with an abnormality in the parent-specific methylation imprint without evidence of a deletion or UPD
**Cytogenetic Analysis
***1% of patients have a detected chromosomal rearrangement resulting in a deletion of bands 15q11-q13
***Deletion can be detected using high resolution chromosome studies at the 650 band level and FISH.
*Clinical diagnosis
**Consensus diagnostic criteria were developed in 1993
**Major Criteria
***Neonatal and infantile hypotonia with poor suck
***Feeding problems and/or FTT in infancy
***Onset of rapid weight gain between 1-6 years of age causing central obesity
***Hyperphagia
***Characteristic facial features
***Hypogonadism
****Genital hypoplasia
****Incomplete and delayed puberty
****Infertility
***Developmental delay or mild to moderate MR or multiple learning disabilities
**Minor Criteria
***Decreased fetal movement and infantile lethargy
***Typical behavior problems
***Sleep disturbance/sleep apnea
***Short stature for the family by 15 years of age
***Hypopigmentation
***Small hands and feed for height age
***Narrow hands with straight ulnar border
***Esotropia, myopia
***Thick, viscous saliva
***Speech articulation defects
***Skin picking
**Supportive Findings
***High pain threshold
***Decreased vomiting
***Scoliosis and/or kyphosis
***Early adrenarche
***Osteoporosis
***Unusual skill with jigsaw puzzles
***Normal neuromuscular studies such as muscle biopsy

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Hypotonia in infancy
**Neonatal sepsis
**CNS depression
**Congenital myotonic dystrophy
**Several myopathies and neuropathies
*Developmental delay/mental retardation, obesity, and hypogonadism
**Albright hereditary osteodystrophy
**Bardet-Biedl syndrome
**Cohen syndrome
**Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome
**Some patients with Fragile X syndrome
**Possible 6q or 1p deletions

==Management==
*Infancy
**Special feeding techniques, including special nipples or gavage feeding to assure adequate nutrition
**Physical therapy may improve muscle strength and encourage achievement of milestones
**Screening for strabismus should start in infancy
*Childhood
**Obesity
***Monitoring of weight and nutritional counseling are critical
***Low-calrie, well-balanced diet with regular exercise and close supervision to minimize food stealing should be instituted before the onset of excessive weight gain
***Energy requirement should rarely exceed 1000 to 1200 Kcal/day
**Learning disabilities should be evaluated, and educational planning instigated
**Speech therapy is often needed
**Growth hormone replacement
***Normalizes height and increases lean body mass
***Growth hormone evaluation is recommended if growth rate is reduced or height is less than the 3rd percentile
**Behavioral disturbances
***Often follow excessive weight gain
***Firm limit-setting should be instituted
***Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors have helped many patients with managing behavior
**Sex hormone replacement is controversial
***Produces adequate secondary sexual characteristis
***Testosterone replacement may play a role in male behavior problems
***Estrogen replacement may increase risk of stroke and osteoporosis in females
**Scoliosis screening should be routine
*Adulthood
**Obesity
***The major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults
***Can cause medical complications
****Cardiopulmonary compromise
****Type II diabetes mellitus
****Thrombophlebitis
****Chronic edema
***If obesity is avoided, longevity may be nearly normal
**Psychiatric and behavioral disturbances may require hospitalization and medication
***Psychosis
***Manic-depressive illness
***Obsessive-compulsive disorder
**Group homes specifically designated for patients with P-W have been successful

==Prenatal Testing==

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Uncertainty because symptoms and severity vary widely
**Uncertainly may make goal-setting and future planning problematic
*Feelings of isolation, loneliness, and despair.
*Frustration due to ignorance about the disease.
*Coping with chronic pain and fatigue
*Burden of dealing with a chronic, rare, progressive disease
*Body image and self-esteem issues due to spleen or liver enlargement or growth retardation
*Guilt about passing on the gene to one's children.
*Family dynamic changes
**Stress in the marriage
**Sibling relationships
**Family members may feel guilty or resentful
*Depression and frustration about the requirement for lifelong management.
*Shock, fear, and denial over the diagnosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spina Bifida'''

==Quote Risks==
*Spina bifida is usually an isolated birth defect.

==Level II Ultrasound==
*At 18-20 weeks, a high resolution, targeted ultrasound examination can be done to carefully and specifically examine the baby's spine.
*This is noninvasive and may provide reassurance but cannot be used as a diagnostic tool.
**If no evidence of a NTD is seen, it cannot be guaranteed that the baby does not have a NTD.

==Amniocentesis==
*If the triple screen results indicate an increased risk for a NTD, one may choose to have an amniocentesis, which is a more invasive, but more diagnostic test.
*What is it?
**Procedure used to obtain a small sample of fluid from the fluid-filled sac that surrounds the fetus
**Performed at 15 weeks gestation or later
***15-18 weeks is optimal because it leaves the patient with options
***22 weeks is probably the latest it can be done leaving the option of elective abortion
**Amniotic fluid contains the fetus's urine as well as other cells from the skin, throat, and digestive tract
**Fluid is studied in the lab for abnormalities
*What can it tell me?
**Amnio can detect certain abnormalities in the fetus.
***Chromosome abnormalities
***NTDs (Spina Bifida)
**It can determine the sex of the baby.
*What can it NOT tell me?
**Amnio cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation.
***For example, congenital heart defects, cleft lip &amp; palate cannot be seen.
***Also the severity of the defect cannot be known from amnio.
*Exactly what does the procedure involve?
**Show figure of amniocentesis.
**You will lie down on your back with hands behind your head.
**Your abdomen will be cleaned with alcohol or iodine.
**A local anesthetic may be applied to your stomach.
**Ultrasound will be used to locate the position of the baby and the placenta and to find a safe spot for the needle.
**A long, thin needle will be inserted through the skin, into the uterus.
**The first few cc's of fluid will be discarded because they probably contain contamination from your cells.
**Then a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons) of fluid is removed and the needle is withdrawn.
**The procedure itself usually takes ~5 minutes.
**The baby will quickly replace the fluid that is removed.
**The baby's heartbeat will be monitored by ultrasound.
**Fluid will be sent to the lab and results are available in 1-2 weeks.
**There is a small possibility of lab error or lack of cell growth
***In this case, the procedure would have to be done again.
*What will it feel like?
**If an anesthetic is used, you may not feel the needle enter the skin, but you will still feel it enter the uterus.
**This is described as a sharp pain, like a menstrual cramp that usually lasts a few seconds.
**You may also feel some cramping after the procedure.
**You should avoid strenuous activity for 24 hours after the procedure.
**Call your doctor immediately if you experience abdominal pain or cramps, vaginal bleeding, leakage of clear fluid from the vagina, fever, or anything else unusual.
***Approximately 2% of women experience light bleeding or spotting.
*What are the risks?
**The risk of miscarriage is between 1/400 and 1/200.
**This means that the added risk for pregnancy loss attributable to the procedure is 0.5% or less.
**There is a risk of uterine infection but this is less than 1 in 1,000
**There is a remote chance that birth defects can be caused by the amnio (0.1%).
**There are special considerations for mothers who are Rh negative. They need to take RhoGam after the amnio procedure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)'''

==Introduction==
*Discuss the reason for referral.
*Elicit prior knowledge about CVS.
*Elicit knowledge about AMA or other indications for session.
*Assess concerns and set goals for the session.
*Provide overview of topics for counseling session.

==Client &amp; Partner Information==
*Discuss why it's important to get pregnancy, personal, and family history.
*Go over pregnancy history:
**G?P?
**LMP? EDC?
**Infertility?
**Exposures?
**Medical complications?
**How has the pregnancy been going?
*Personal background:
**Occupation?
**Religion?
**Ethnicity?
**Chronic illness?
**Partner exposure?

==Elicit Family History==
*Construct pedigree:
**Abnormal # miscarriages, stillbirths, infant deaths?
**Previous children with chromosome abnormality, NTD, Down syndrome, birth defects, mental retardation?
**Consanguinity?
**Other concerns/risk factors?

==What is AMA?==
*Woman is age 35 &amp; above at expected date of delivery.
*As maternal age increases, risks of birth defects increase.
*Women do not make new eggs like males make sperm.
*They are born will all the eggs they will have in their life and these eggs mature with age.
*There are procedures that can be done to assess the risk, but there are also risks associated with the procedures.
*The age of 35 is the &quot;magic&quot; number because this is when the risk of the procedure is justified.
*The background risk for major birth defects for women of all ages is 3-5%.

==Explain Chromosome Abnormalities==
*Explain cells, chromosome, and DNA
*Show karyotypes
*Explain nondisjunction
*Show abnormal karyotypes (trisomy 13, 18, 21, sex chromosome anomalies)
*Give a general description of the clinical features and prognoses.
**Trisomy 18 &amp; 13 are most severe with most affected dying before the age of 1 year
**Trisomy 21 is more mild; characteristic physical features and mild to moderate MR
**Turner and Kleinfelter's syndromes are sex chromosome anomalies. Also usually mild.

==Quote Risks==
*Show charts to figure risk of chromosome abnormalities.
*Give age-specific risks:
**Age at CVS: ____________
**Down syndrome: 1 in _______ ( %)
**Any CA: 1 in ________ ( %)

==Discuss the option of CVS==
*What is it?
**CVS is short for chorionic villus sampling
**The chorionic villi are wisps of fetal tissue or finger-like projections that attach the pregnancy sac to the uterine wall
**CVS is the technique in which this sample of placental tissue is obtained
**The technique has been around for approximately 15 years although methods have changed over time
**It is unique because it is used to diagnose certain birth defects in the 1st trimester of pregnancy rather than later in the pregnancy like amniocentesis
***It is usually performed at 10-12 weeks gestation
*What can it tell me?
**CVS can detect certain abnormalities in the fetus
***General chromosome abnormalities
***Specific genetic disorders that have been previously identified
**It can determine the sex of the baby.
*What can it NOT tell me?
**CVS cannot detect neural tube defects such as spina bifida
***For this reason, it may be useful to measure the amount of AFP in the maternal serum at 15-18 weeks gestation
***Also, follow-up with US at 18-20 weeks is recommended
**It cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation
***For example, congenital heart defects, cleft lip &amp; palate cannot be seen.
***Also the severity of the defect cannot be known from CVS
*Exactly what does the procedure involve?
**Show figures of CVS
**Transcervical CVS:
***Done at 10-12 weeks gestation
***A speculum is inserted and the vagina and cervix are cleaned with betadeine
***Some physicians apply a tenaculum to the lip of the cervix which can be painful
***Using US to guide, a thin tube is guided into the placenta
***Gentle suction is applied to the tube to remove the villi
***This method is easiest to perform when the placenta is posterior and close to the cervix
***A larger sample is taken as compared to transvaginal CVS
***Discomfort is often minimal, perhaps similar to a pap smear
***Post-procedure bleeding occurs in up to 10% of patients
**Transabdominal CVS:
***Done at 10 weeks gestation or later
***The abdomen is cleansed with betadeine
***A local anesthetic injection may be given
***Using US to guide, a spinal needed is inserted through the abdomen into the uterine wall and into the placenta
***The needle is moved back and forth several times through the placenta
***Suction is used to remove the villi sample
***This method is easiest when the placenta is anterior or away from the cervix
***This method is better for women with a retroverted uterus
***A smaller sample (pieces of villi) is taken as compared to transcervical CVS
***The procedure is usually more uncomfortable than the transcervical method
***Bleeding after the procedure is rare
**CVS takes approximately 5-7 minutes (not including prep time)
**The baby's heartbeat is monitored by US
**The collected sample is examined under the microscope to confirm that fetal tissue and not maternal tissue was collected
**If maternal cells were collected, the CVS will be repeated
**The sample is sent to the lab
**Results are available in approximately 10 days
*What will it feel like?
**There may be some discomfort when the needle enters the skin and the uterus or when the catheter enters the cervix and placenta
**Some say that they feel pressure during the procedure
**You may experience a small amount of bleeding after CVS
*What are the risks?
**The background rate of pregnancy loss at 10-12 weeks is 2-3%
**CVS increases the risk of miscarriage by 1/100 (1%) in women with a normal uterus
***Reinforce that 99% of women will have a healthy baby
**CVS increases the risk of miscarriage by 5/100 (5%) in women with a retroverted uterus using transcervical CVS
**Some studies indicate an increased risk for limb defects when CVS is done before 10 weeks gestation
***When performed at 10-12 weeks, most recent studies do not report an increased risk because limbs have already formed at this point
***The risk is approximately 1/3000 (0.0003%)
**There are special considerations for mothers who are Rh negative. They need to take RhoGam after the CVS procedure
**There is a low risk of uterine infection
**Exercise or strenuous activity is to be avoided for 24 hours after the procedure
**Sexual intercourse, douching, tub baths, or tampon use are to be avoided for 72 hours after CVS procedure
**CVS is not recommended for women with the following:
***Cervical polyps, overly curved sampling pathway, active genital herpes (for trans-cer)
***Interceding bowel, placenta too far from abdomen surface (for trans-abd)
***Active vaginal bleeding or bleeding disorder
**You should notify your doctor if any of the following occur:
***Fever greater than 100.4 F
***Heavy bleeding or cramping
***Amniotic fluid leakage
*Why should I choose CVS?
**CVS can be done earlier than amniocentesis (10-12 weeks versus 15-18 weeks)
**It may reduce a couples emotional stress if at risk for abnormality
**The procedure allows for termination at an earlier age
***This is before the pregnancy is visible
***Also before fetal movement is felt
**Allows for treatment of fetus affected with 21-hydroxylase deficiency
*Why might I not want to choose CVS?
**There is a higher risk for pregnancy loss as compared to amniocentesis
***1% for CVS versus 0.5% for amnio
**CVS does not detect NTDs
**CVS is less commonly done as compared to amnio
**With CVS, there is a greater likelihood of needing further invasive testing due to:
***Laboratory failure
***Insufficient sample
***Maternal cell contamination
****Seen in approximately 1.9% of cases
***Mosaic or ambiguous results
****There are 2 or more cell types that are different genetically
****Seen in 1-2% of CVS cases

*Literature, contact info, etc.
*March of Dimes website

==Elicit final questions and concerns==

==Reporting of the Results==
*If they are having the procedure, discuss how they would like to receive the results
**Appointment, phone call, etc.
**Who will contact them?

==Elicit Interim Medical History==

==Definition==
*Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a disorder caused by the inheritance of a paternally derived deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15 and is characterized by abnormalities in physical and mental development.

==Historical significance==
*First recognized microdeletion syndrome identified with high-resolution chromosome analysis
*Most common recognized genetic form of obesity
*First recognized human genomic imprinting disorder
*First recognized disorder resulting from uniparental disomy

==Etiology==
*Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15 at q11-q13 (~75% of cases)
**Detectable by high-resolution chromosome analysis or FISH with specific probes
**Paternally derived chromosome has been deleted (maternal genes are inactive due to genomic imprinting)
*Maternal disomy- receiving 2 copies of the maternal 15th chromosome and no paternal copies of the 15th chromosome (~24% of cases)
*Clinical differences exist between deletion patients and those with maternal disomy. Maternal disomy patients are less likely to have typical facial characteristics, slightly higher IQs and milder behavior problems.*
*A defect in the imprinting process occurs due to problems associated with the imprinting center, such as a mutation or deletion resulting in the biparental inheritance and a maternal-only pattern (1% of cases)
*In all cases where there has been a recurrence of Prader-Willi syndrome, there has been an imprinting mutation.

==Molecular Genetics==
*The actual genes that cause the phenotypic changes have not been identified.
*Several imprinted and nonimprinted genes have been found to exist in the deletion region (called the PWS/AS critical region).
*A deletion in the nonimprinted P gene, which codes for tyrosinase-positive albinism, is associated with hypopigmentation seen in 33% of patients with PWS.
*The SNRPN is the best described gene likely to cause some of the PWS features
**This ribosome-associated protein functions by controlling gene splicing and may therefore be involved in the control of the synthesis of some proteins
**SNRPN is known to be imprinted in the brain
*SNURF is upstream of SNRPN is a putative imprinting control element for the critical region
*Very small deletions in this gene have been identified in a few cases
*Many other genes have been identified from the critical region, but the function of these genes has yet to be elucidated

==Associated Risks==
*Patients with PWS usually have an unremarkable family history
*PWS that is caused by a deletion has a recurrence risk of 1% or less.
*Uniparental disomy is caused by nondisjunction thus the recurrence risk is 1% or less
*When counseling patients with a detected imprinting mutation, a recurrence risk of up to 50% pertains because the mutation is likely dominant and occurred in the paternal grandmother's germ line.

==Incidence==
*Approximately 1: 10,000-15,000 live births
*Both sexes and all races are affected
*The majority of affected individuals are the only family member affected

==Diagnostic Criteria==
*These criteria were developed before the availability of diagnostic testing and are still valuable in suggesting diagnosis and the need for a diagnostic test.
*Major criteria (1 point each)
**Infantile central hypotonia
**Infantile feeding problems and failure to thrive
**Characteristic facial appearance
**Early-childhood-onset of obesity (2-3 years of age)
**Hypogonadism with genital hypoplasia
**Developmental delay and mild cognitive impairment
**Mild short stature
**Characteristic behavior disorder
*Minor Criteria (1/2 point each)
**Decreased movement and infantile lethargy
**Typical behavior problems
**Sleep apnea
**Short stature
**Hypopigmentation
**Small hands and feet for height and age
**Esotropia, myopia
**Thick, viscous saliva
**Speech articulation defects
**Skin picking
*Supportive criteria (no points)
**High pain threshold
**Decreased vomiting
**Temperature control problems
**Scoliosis
**Early adrenarche
**Osteoporosis
*In children under 3 with 5 points (at least 3 from major criteria) or those above 3 with 8 points (at least 4 from major criteria) a diagnosis should be suspected

==Clinical Features==
*Hypotonia
**Prenatal in onset and present in nearly 100% of cases
**Causes decreased fetal movement and abnormal fetal position
**The fetus is often breeched in position at the time of delivery, thus delivery is often via a caesarian section.
**The infant usually has a poor suck reflex and fails to awake to feed leading, in many cases, to failure to thrive
**Infantile lethargy and a weak cry are also associated with hypotonia
**Motor milestones are delayed and average age of sitting is ~12 months and walking at 24 months
**Hypotonia results in a decrease in lean body mass leading to a high ratio of fat to lean body mass in children.
**Hypotonia gradually improves, although the adult with PWS remains mildly hypotonic with decreased muscle tone and bulk
**All newborns with persistant hypotonia are suggested to have PWS testing.
*Developmental delay and intelligence
**Motor milestones are delayed in 90-100% of cases (see above)
**Language development is also delayed
***Verbal skills are a strength in most patients but..
***Speech is often poorly articulated, nasal and slurred.
**Cognitive abnormalities are present and most patients are mildly mentally retarded with an IQ of 60s-low 70s
**~40% have borderline MR or low normal intelligence
**~20% have moderate MR
**Academic performance is poor for cognitive ability
**Strengths are in reading, long-term memory, and visual-spatial skills
**Weaknesses are in math, sequential processing, and short-term memory
**Patients often have an unusual skill with jigsaw puzzles and word-find puzzles.
*Hypogonadism
**Prenatal in onset and persists throughout life
**At birth it is evident by genital hypoplasia
**Cryptorchidism is present in 90-100% of male patients
**Sexual activity is uncommon in both sexes and fertility is rare (one case reported)
*Early-childhood-onset of obesity
**Significant obesity is not found in young infants
**Onset is usually triggered by hyperphagia between 1-6 years of age, but can occur as early as 6 months
**Hyperphagia is due to a hypothalamic abnormality resulting from lack of satiety
**There is a decreased caloric requirement, related to hypotonia and associated decreased activity
**Food-seeking behavior with hoarding and foraging of food is often common in patients with PWS
**Patients often eat unappealing substances such as garbage, frozen food and pet food
**Patients have decreased vomiting activity
**The obesity is central in location
***Abdomen
***Buttocks
***Thighs
**Obesity is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in PWS and longevity can be nearly normal if obesity is avoided.
**Obesity results in complications such as:
***Cardiopulmonary compromise
***Diabetes mellitus type II
***Hypertension
***Chronic leg edema
***Sleep apnea
*Characteristic Facial Features that are present at birth or appear over time for MOST patients:
**Narrow bi-frontal diameter
**Almond-shaped palpebral fissures
**Narrow nasal bridge
**Down-turned mouth with a thin upper lip
*Other characteristic physical findings
**Small narrow hands with a straight ulnar border
**Short broad feet, present by age 10 *African Americans are less likely to have small hands and feet*
**Shoulders are usually sloping
**Hypopigmentation manifests as fairer skin, hair, and eye color and occurs in about 1/3 of patients
**Scoliosis and/or kyphosis are common (about 40-80% of cases)
**Short stature is almost always present by the 2nd half of the 2nd decade for 90-95% of patients due to lack of pubertal growth spurt
**Strabismus is found in 60-70% of cases
*Behavior profile is present in 70-90% of cases
**A characteristic profile becomes evident in early childhood, with temper tantrums, stubbornness, controlling and manipulating behavior, OCD, and difficulty with change in routine
**Lying, stealing, and aggressive behavior are also common.
**These behavioral problems interfere with the quality of life for adults
*Others:
**Thick viscous saliva
***Predispose to dental caries
***Can result in articulation problems
**High pain threshold
**Skin picking
**Sleep disturbances, especially daytime sleeping
**Osteoporosis, frequent but poorly studied

==Diagnostic Testing==
*Methylation analysis
**PCR test that can detect all three causes of PWS
**All three causes result in the genes for PWS being methylated
**Methylated DNA is cut differently by restriction enzymes than unmethylated DNA
**The differences in the sizes of DNA can be detected
**This test can be used for both prenatal and postnatal testing
*Chromosome analysis using the FISH probe for SNRPN
*High resolution chromosome analysis alone is insufficient due to false positives and false negatives
*Uniparental disomy can be identified using microsatellite repeat sequences from chromosome 15 in the patients and the parents; if none of the variants of these repeats that are present in the father are seen in the child, then all the genetic information from chromosome 15 has been maternally derived.
*The presence of a normal FISH test plus abnormal methylation analysis indicates a probable imprinting center error

==Management and Treatment Options==
Intervention and management of PWS can significantly impact the health, functional abilities, and life of patients.
*Infantile FTT-
**Special feeding techniques are required because breast feeding is usually inhibited by the hypotonia
*Short Stature-
**Growth hormone has been shown to increase height and muscle tone
**Good results have been shown for adolescents.
*Development and behavior-
**Closely monitor development and behavior in infancy and toddler-hood.
**Developmental assessments should be conducted on patients and they should have early intervention services as soon as possible.
**Educational intervention should occur throughout school years. Most children require special education classes, speech therapy, and physical/occupational therapies.
**It is important to apply specific and consistent limits at home and school. Most individuals require consistency in daily routines and should be prepared in advance for changes in routine or activities.
**Those with severe behavioral problems may respond to psychotherapy. Medication for treatment of psychiatric problems is often needed.
*Obesity-
**Avoidance of obesity is extremely important, yet very difficult to achieve.
**Close monitoring of weight percentiles and height to weight ratio is critical throughout life
**Those who are extremely obese should have an assessment of glycosylated hemoglobin levels
**Decrease caloric intake, to1000-1200 Kcal/day or less.
**Vitamins and calcium should be taken everyday (100% of daily recommended)
**Keeping food under lock and only keeping healthy low calorie food in the house is critical
**Involve teachers and employers of individuals with PWS in food monitoring
**Regular exercise is extremely important; a program should be initiated as early as possible.
*Hypotonia-
**Physical therapy is appropriate
**Evaluation of hypothyroidism if hypotonia is persistant
*Hypogonadism (endocrine)-
**Administration of hCG may stimulate testicular descent
**Administration of testosterone in males or estrogen in females to improve secondary sex characteristics
*Ophthalmologic-
**Exams to monitor strabismus, myopia and hyperopia
*Dental-
**Emphasis placed on good dental hygiene
**Products that increase saliva flow can be used as necessary
*Musculoskeletal-
**Scoliosis should be monitored and treated as in the general population
**Calcium and vitamin D levels should be assured
*Dermatologic-
**Examination of the skin should occur to monitor the presence of sores from skin picking
**Keep lesions moist and covered
**Behavior modification techniques may be necessary

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Parents often must monitor children with PWS 24 hours a day to control symptoms such as obesity; this is draining for the parents.
*Fathers often struggle with guilt, blaming themselves for the occurrence of the syndrome.
*Important for counselors to ask how the parents are coping and how they are handling the situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Protein S Deficiency'''

(pregnancy loss)

==Introduction and contracting==
*Introduction
*What is your understanding about why you were referred for genetic counseling?
*Do you have any questions or concerns you would like to discuss?
*Address immediate concerns
*Explain that we will be taking a detailed pregnancy and family history
*Then we will answer your questions and talk a little more about protein S deficiency including how it is inherited and how it may increase the risk for pregnancy loss as well as other causes of multiple pregnancy losses

==Medical History==
*Who was referring physician
*How many pregnancies have you had?
*Confirm when the losses were and use EMPATHY
*Why do you believe you had the miscarriages?
*Sometimes women who have miscarriages are concerned that it might be due to something they did or did not do during the pregnancy
*What were you told you about the pregnancy losses?
*What types of testing did they do to find a reason for the miscarriages?
*Were you sick at all during the pregnancies?
*Did you drink, smoke or use drugs?
*Any medications during the pregnancies
*Did you take prenatal vitamins?
*Any concerns about anything you might have been exposed to during any of your pregnancies?
*Have you had any other chronic health problems except those due to the protein S deficiency?
*Could you describe how you first found out you had protein S deficiency
*Have you had any complications related to the protein S deficiency?

==Family History==
*Take a family history to see if there are any hereditary diseases that may run in your family that may or may not be related to your history of pregnancy losses
*Miscarriages in other family members
*Infertility
*Mental retardation/learning difficulties
*Birth defects (heart defects, CL/CP, spina bifida)
*Chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease
*Anyone else with protein S deficiency
*Any other blood clotting problems in the family
*Sickle cell anemia
*Specifically ask about symptoms of blood clotting see below
*Consanguinity

==Psychosocial considerations and assessment==
*How are you handling the pregnancy losses?
*Have family members or friends been supportive?
*What do your plans for the future look like?
*Are you currently working outside the home?
*Are you in touch with a perinatal loss support group?
*Would you like to be in touch with a support group?
*Is your insurance covering the testing that has been performed?
*Are there any other concerns or questions?

==Protein S deficiency==

==What is protein S==
*A protein that is involved in stopping the blood clotting process
*(Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein)
*(Major function is as a cofactor to facilitate the action of activated protein C (APC) on its substrates, activated factor V (FVa), and activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) )
*(Normally forms a complx with protein C to inhibit coagulation)
*Not having enough protein S may lead to problems with blood clotting in the veins (venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism in the lungs, but does not appear to increase risk for arterial thrombosis)
*Also associated with increased risk for miscarriage (studies have focused mostly on miscarriages that occur in 2nd and 3rd trimesters)

==How does protein S deficiency occur (Inherited vs. Acquired)==
*Inherited risk factors
*Caused by mutation in one of the two copies of the genes that instruct the body on how to make protein S (located on chromosome 3 at locus 3p11.1-q11.2 near a protein S pseudogene)
*Discuss genes and AD inheritance
*Incomplete penetrance (some individuals with protein S deficiency remain completely healthy and assymptomatic and there are other risk factors that may also contribute to the blood clotting in some individuals)
*VTE develops in 60-80% of patients who are heterozygous for protein S deficiency. The remaining patients are asymptomatic, and some heterozygous individuals never develop VTE.
*Occasionally a person can inherit two mutated copies
*This results in purpura fulminans (characterized by small vessel thrombosis with cutaneous and subcutaneous necrosis, and it appears early in life, usually during the neonatal period or within the first year of life)
*Acquired risk factors for thrombophilia
*Age - 1 in 10,000 in young before age 40 and 1 in 1,000 in elderly
*Malignancy -Tumor cells increase coagulant activity and so do chemotherapy drugs
*Antiphospholipid antibodies - may be associated with lupus or other autoimmune disease and increases risk 9 fold
*Surgery or major trauma-without prophylactic treatment risk may be as high as 45-70% with total hip or knee replacement surgery and increased risk continues for several weeks
*Pregnancy -RR is 10 increases to 1 in 1,000 from 1 in 10,000
*HRT and oral contraceptives-- risk depends on estrogen content and type of progesterone some studies show 2-3 fold increase
*Acquired thrombophilia
*usually due to liver disease
*vitamin K
*systemic lupus erythematosus
*Protein S levels decrease in pregnancy and can fall into the abnormal-low laboratory range, but the low levels of protein S in pregnancy do not cause thrombosis by themselves

==Special Concerns During Pregnancy==
*Pregnancy can result in falsely low protein S assays, especially functional assays. In addition, pregnancy increases the risk of thrombosis in patients who are heterozygous for protein S deficiency
*A female patient who is on warfarin for prior thrombosis should not continue warfarin during pregnancy due to teratogenic effects
*Heparin should be started during pregnancy and for 4-6 weeks postpartum in patients with protein S deficiency
*One case control study suggested that fetuses with a prothrombotic risk factor may have an increased incidence of low birth weight, but only statistically significant when fetus carried multiple thrombotic risk factors or was homozygous for risk factors
*Women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction, were more likely to have protein S deficiency than controls, but too small to assess strength of association
*Feb 2002 article in Seminars in Perinatology stated that not all studies have found association between inherited thrombophilias and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is limited by lack of well designed studies and therefore no clear evidence to determine when to test, whom to test, and what to test for

==Protein S deficiency and risk of miscarriage==
*French case control study of 232 instances of women experiencing stillbirth (&gt; 22 weeks gestation) and 464 controls (cases were referred patients which may add bias because 84% had more than one stillbirth)
*Independently protein S deficiency and factor V Leiden were correlated with stillbirth
*MTHFR mutation frequency alone was no greater
*However, with homozygosity for the MTHFR mutation plus an additional thrombophilic risk factor, and in the absence of supplementation with folic acid, the risk for stillbirth was 100% (28/28)
*This study also confirmed that those with the assessed risk factors and stillbirth virtually always showed maternal vascular markers when the placenta was thoroughly evaluated
*Study in Israel (May 2002) demonstrated among 40 women with unexplained intrauterine fetal death at &gt;27 wks matched with 80 healthy women demonstrated significantly higher rate of protein S deficiency than controls (OR 3.2, 2.4-4.1 CI) biased sample may not be representative of women of other ethnicities
*Prospective study in US of 145 patients with idiopathic pregnancy loss and 145 matched controls
*1 or greater thrombophilic defect in 66% of study group and 28% of controls
*21% of women with loss had combined thrombophilic defects compared to 5.5% controls
*late pregnancy wastage more common in women with thrombophilia

==Prevention?==
*Individuals with homozygosity for the MTHFR mutation and any other predisposing factor (protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, the thrombophilic prothrombin mutation, factor V Leiden, or antiphospholipid antibodies), high dose folate supplementation beginning preconceptually may have a protective effect.
*Those who have had one or more stillbirths and are found to have a thrombophilic mutation (not including MTHFR homozygosity in isolation) heparin and low dose aspirin may be appropriate

==Testing for Protein S Deficiency==
*Absent /reduced protein S and normal total proteins in heterozygote
*Protein S antigen testing:
*Functional protein S:
*Assays for functional protein S are difficult to perform, indirect and are based on prolongation of blood clotting by the generation of APC and its function
*Several other factors can alter the interpretation of test results falsely low protein S functional assay value can be observed in patients with factor V Leiden genetic defect and some pregnant women

==Incidence of Protein S Deficiency==
*based on 9000 blood donors 1 in 700 had protein S deficiency
*unknown if deficiency varies by race, but thrombotic disease in general less frequent in Asians
*No clear difference in male to female ratio

==Associated symptoms==
*Symptoms related to protein S deficiency include those associated with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), thrombophlebitis, or pulmonary embolus.
*Venous thrombosis of the lower limbs: Lower limb swelling and discomfort are the usual symptoms. Occasionally, redness or discoloration also is present, with or without associated cellulitis.
*A family history of thrombosis is an important finding, which suggests inherited thrombophilia.
*Thrombosis at an early age (e.g., usually &lt;40 y) or recurrent thrombosis also is indicative of an inherited thrombophilic state (e.g., protein S deficiency).
*Deep vein thrombosis
*The most common manifestation is venous thrombosis of the lower extremities (accounts for approximately 90% of all events)
*Superficial veins that are thrombosed usually appear distended, firm, and noncompressible (cords), with or without associated redness or pain.
*Superficial thrombophlebitis can be observed in some cases, with or without DVT
*Classic presentation of DVT is a triad of calf pain, edema, and pain on dorsiflexion of the foot (less than a third of DVT cases exhibit these 3 findings)
*Physicians observe unilateral leg or calf swelling with mild or moderate pain more often, which suggests DVT
*Rarely, calf discomfort without swelling is the only sign of DVT
*The differential diagnosis of DVT includes muscle strains and tears, passive swelling of a paralyzed or immobilized limb, Baker cyst, cellulitis, knee trauma or derangement, lymphatic obstruction, and the postphlebitic syndrome
*Pulmonary embolism
*Some patients may have associated or isolated pulmonary embolism and may experience dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or cardiac palpitations
*Classic pleuritic chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis suggests an embolism with pleural involvement
*Acute right-sided heart failure occurs rarely and is associated with massive embolus
*Findings of right ventricular dysfunction include bulging neck veins, a left parasternal lift, and an accentuated pulmonic component of the second heart sound.
*These findings in the chest also are not specific for pulmonary embolism.

==Early Pregnancy Loss==
*establishing pregnancy is more difficult than many people realize
*clinically recognized pregnancy loss occurs in ~15% of pregnancies
*40-60% of all conceptions may be lost, but most of these (3/4) are estimated to be lost before it is recognized clinically
*most miscarriages occur between 6-8 weeks and expulsion between 10-12 weeks
*after 3 consecutive clinical abortions the empiric risk of aborting next pregnancy is 20-55%

==Late Pregnancy Loss==
*seem to be associated with thrombophilia

==Possible causes of pregnancy losses==
*chromosomal abnormalities (most common 70% of first trimester loss)
**balanced translocation carrier (2.7-4.8% of couples with recurrent losses)
**trisomies and other chromosomal anomalies
*Hormonal causes
**Inadequate luteal phase
**Deficient progesterone
*Endometrial factors (endometrial protein expression)
*Uterine abnormalities
**septate uterus
**bicornate uterus
**uterine myomas or fibroids
**DES exposure in utero
*Environmental exposures
**Alcohol (women who drink 2X's week had sig. higher SA than other women but drinkers also tend to smoke also - possible confounding?)
**tobacco ( if ½ pack a day or greater and appears to be dose dependent)
**very heavy caffeine intake (moderate intake is not associated with SA)
**chemical solvent exposure in either sex may increase risk
*Immune Causes
**autoimmune problems -- estimated to be cause of multiple SA's in up to 30% of women (woman makes antibodies that will attack her own proteins and those that she has in common with the fetus)
o anticardiolipin antibodies -- type of a group of antiphospholipid antibodies that may be associated with miscarriage
o circulating antibodies to cardiolipin and/or inappropriate coagulation parameters, plus poor reproductive outcome, SLE, or spontaneous thrombosis (the antibodies can react with phospholipids that are required for coagulation)
o SLE - an autoimmune disease thought to be related to SA's (Antichromatin IgG is useful in diagnosing SLE antinuclear antibody testing can indicate many at risk for SLE or some other autoimmune diseases)
**alloimmune causes -- (response to tissues from another individual of the same species)
*Diabetes (controlled or unsuspected is not thought to cause SA)
*Infection
**chlamydia trachomatous causes acute and chronic infection of the endometrium which could interfere with implantation (more chlamydia antibodies in women with recurrent SA's but not all studies confirmed this)
**Mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum (controversy over importance in losses)
**CMV but suggests this is rare and causation not proven
**Herpes simplex virus (importance in SA's debated)
**HIV does not increase rates of loss in asymptomatic women
*Psychological factors-two studies showed significant reduction in SA among women who have 3 or more SA's when undergoing counseling once per week during pregnancy

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Reciprocal Translocation'''

==Contracting==
*What were you told about why you were referred to Genetics?
*What did they tell you about the results of the chromosome studies?
*What are your main concerns? Do you have any questions?
*Overview of session

==Intake==
*Follow intake questions
**What doctors are they seeing?
**Has she had any surgeries, or is she scheduled for any?
**What have they been told about the Dandy-Walker malformation and hydrocephalus?
**What have they been told about her heart defect?
**Has anyone talked with them about what to expect in the future?
*Updates to family history?
**Ask again about mental retardation, learning problems, birth defects
**Ask again about miscarriages and stillbirths in family

==Genes and Chromosomes==
*Chromosomes are instruction books for bodies - genes located all along chromosomes
*One copy of each from mother, one from father

==Explanation of Chromosomes==
*Show her karyotype to parents and point out rearrangement
*This is what we call a reciprocal translocation
*Parts of two different chromosomes break off and redistributed to different chromosomes
*Her chromosomes look a little bit different than what we would expect
**This happens to about 1 in 500 people
**We don't know why this happens sometimes
**This is not something that we can change or fix
**Nothing that anyone did or didn't do caused this to happen - it is a random event

==What Does this Mean==
*We don't really know right now - but there are some ways that we can try to find out
*It looks like the translocation is balanced
**All of the genetic material is still there, it is just rearranged (show yellow and pink chromosomes)
**Most of the time, this does not cause a problem so it would not explain why was born with Dandy-Walker malformation and a heart problem
**Remember that there are genes along the length of the chromosomes?
***There are spaces between those genes
***If the chromosomes broke in those spaces, it should not have disrupted any genes and all of the body functions should still work
***We would expect a child with a balanced reciprocal translocation to be healthy
***This would mean that her health complications are caused by something other than the translocation
**BUT . . .
***If one or both of the chromosomes broke in the middle of a gene, or if a small piece of one of the chromosomes is missing, that could cause problems (5%)
***Unfortunately, we can't look any closer at her chromosomes right now, so we can't tell if this is the case
***If a gene is interrupted or a piece is missing, this COULD explain her problems
**To help us determine whether the translocation is balanced or not, we need to look at BOTH of her parents chromosomes

==Importance of Looking at Parent's Chromosomes==
*If you both have normal chromosomes:
**The balanced translocation is something new
**If might explain the Dandy-Walker malformation and heart defect
*If one of you has the same balanced translocation as_____
**We know that you both do NOT have Dandy-Walker malformation or a heart defect
**Because you both don't have any health complications, we know that all of the genetic information is there - nothing is missing or interrupted
**This means that her problems may have another cause

==What Does this Mean for her's Future?==
*At this point, it is hard to say
*Once we know more about parents chromosomes, we will have a better idea about what caused the Dandy-Walker malformation and heart defect
**If the translocation does appear to be the cause of the problems, we still may not be able to predict what will happen to her in the future
***As mentioned before, we can't always look close enough at the chromosomes to know exactly what genes might not be working right
***We can be sure that her gets the care that she needs, including tests to rule out any possible problems and physical, occupational, speech therapies if needed
**If the translocation is not the cause of the problems, we may be able to identify another cause
**Either way, the important thing is that her gets the medical care that she needs

==Reproductive Risks of a Balanced Reciprocal Translocation==
*As we have already talked about, a balanced reciprocal translocation usually does not cause any physical differences
*Does have impact on reproduction
*Four possible outcomes for any pregnancy:
**A child with normal chromosomes
***Would expect child to be healthy
***They cannot pass on the translocation to their children
**A child that is a balanced translocation carrier
***If the parents are healthy, we would expect the child to be too
***Child would have same four possible outcomes for a pregnancy as we are discussing now
**A child with an unbalanced translocation causing a physical or mental handicap
***Unbalanced translocation means that there is extra or missing chromosomal material
***Could lead to physical differences, medical problems like heart defects, etc.
**An unbalanced translocation that leads to miscarriage or stillbirth
***Usually if the piece that is extra or missing is large (contains a lot of chromosomal material)
***There are too many changes in genetic material to allow a conception to grow
*Some people with balanced translocations have problems with infertility

==Risk Assessment==
*The exact risk assessment depends on where the chromosome breaks
*Overall, there is 5-30% risk to have child born with physical or mental handicaps (general population is 3-5%)
*There is a 20-30% risk for miscarriage (general population 15%)

==Reproductive Options for Balanced Translocation Carrier==
*Just be aware of risks
*Prenatal testing - amniocentesis or CVS
*Adoption
*Sperm or egg donor
*PGD or IVF

==Psychosocial==
*How do you feel about what we talked about?
*Do you have any new concerns?
*Give patient literature about translocations
*Feelings of guilt or blame if either parent is translocation carrier
*Frustration over inability to offer an explanation right now
*Fear, worry, anxiety about the future

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Renal Cell Carcinoma'''

==Introduction==
*Renal (comprising most kidney) cancer is usually sporadic or randomly occurring
*Some individuals with renal cancer have a genetic predisposition to developing cancer and we call these hereditary cancers
*There are a couple of things that sometimes make us wonder if a cancer is due to an inherited genetic predisposition. One of these is early age of onset of cancer.
*______ was diagnosed at a young age (most individuals with renal carcinoma are diagnosed in their 40's-60's)
*Two most common types of renal carcinomas
*Most common is clear cell renal carcinomas (comprise 80% of sporadic cases and are the type seen in Von Hippel Lindau, which rules this genetic cancer syndrome out)
*Second most common is papillary renal cell carcinomas (PRCCs) I WON'T GO INTO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING DETAILS ONLY THOSE STARRED
**generally accepted that it has a better prognosis than other types of renal cancer
**appears to be sporadic in majority of cases
**accounts for about 5-10% of sporadic renal cell carcinoma and is seen in Hereditary Papillary Renal Carcinomas (HPRC)
**estimated that male to female ratio for PRCC is between 5:1 and 8:1 (however when 9 families were studied they found 28:12 (2.33:1 ratio)
**Sporadic PRCC are usually solitary tumors (but multiple papillary adenomas were described in surrounding renal parenchyma in some cases)
**In one study all 29 patients from the 6 families with HPRC studied had multiple bilateral tumors
**Suggestion to subdivide PRCC into type 1 and type 2 tumors
**Those with family history and those with met mutation share features of type 1, but not all individuals with tumors characteristic of type 1 had an identified met mutation
**Trisomy 7 characteristic of sporadic and hereditary papillary renal carcinomas (shown in 95% of PRCCs)
**Also characterized by trisomy or tetrasomy 17, and trisomy 16, 20, and 12 and loss of Y in males
**Suggested that those with tri or tetrasomy 7 and 17 correspond to papillary adenomas and more complex karyotypic changes are papillary carcinomas

==Review genes and chromosomes==
*In order to understand the difference between hereditary and sporadic cancer it can be helpful to review some genetic information because it is not something most people think about all the time.
*Some genes help control when cells divide and how fast they divide.
*Essentially there are genes that act like the breaks of a car and there are genes that function like the gas pedal to accelerate cell growth and division.
*If these genes are changed it can sometimes cause a cell to keep dividing and dividing and develop into cancer.

==HPRC==
*Recently described form of hereditary cancer
*Genetic predisposition to develop multiple tumors in both kidneys (bilateral, multifocal)
*Median age of onset is 45, but ranges from 18-79 with most between 35 and 55 years old
*Explain AD inheritance with reduced penetrance
*Associated with (germline) mutation of a gene present in all of the cells of affected family members
*gene is called MET and is found at 7q31
*the gene is involved with regulating cell division
*this gene is called a proto-oncogene which just means that when it has a change or a mutation in the gene, it can cause cell division to become accelerated (it is kind of like pressing down harder on the gas pedal and not releasing the it so the car can stop)
*met mutations have also been found in 13% of tumors of PRC patients without a family history but all but one had bilateral disease and may be ascertainment bias
*half had somatic mutation and half were shown to have germline mutation so rate of met mutation in true sporadic mutations may be 7% or even lower due to bias
*In those with germline mutation it is possible that these are de novo mutations or may be possible that family members are not picked up because in known families, tumors not always detected until intense radiologic screening is done
*Germline mutation screening for met does not appear to be clinically indicated in patients with PRCC without additional evidence for genetic predisposition, which includes positive family history, unusual age at onset, bilateral disease (Mary Liebert 2001 found in Genetic Testing)
*Tumors are predominantly PRCs in HPRC but also breast, pancreas, lung, skin and stomach have been described in some of these families

==Management in those with HPRC==
*Use of partial nephrectomy due to risk of tumor in other kidney
*Those at high risk might benefit from earlier and aggressive site-specific surveillance

==Differential Causes==
*1;X translocations
**may have prominent papillary architecture
**may seem to be widely metastatic and poor prognosis
**TFE3 gene identified at breakpoint
*Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC)
**Described in large Finnish family
**Along with PRCs, uterine leiomyomas, skin leiomyomas, breast cancers, and bladder cancers also found
**Mapped to 1q42-q44

==Facts about renal cell carcinoma==
*accounts for about 3% of adult malignancies and 90-95% of neoplasms in the kidney
*more common in individuals of Northern European descent but incidence increasing most rapidly in African Americans
*twice as common in men
*lack of early warning signs
*25-30% are asymptomatic

==Symptoms and presentation==
*hematuria (40%)
*flank pain (40%)
*palpable mass in the flank or abdomen (25%)
*weight loss (33%)
*fever (20%)
*hypertension (20%)
*hypercalcemia (5%)
*night sweats
*malaise
*variocele, usually left sided, due to obstruction of the testicular vein (2% of males)
*cytokine release by tumor frequently causes paraneoplastic conditions

==metastasis==
*lung 75%
*soft tissues 36%
*bone 20%
*liver 18%
*cutaneous sites 8%
*CNS 8%

==Risk factors==
*Smoking doubles risk and contributes to as many as 1/3 of cases
*Obesity also seems to increase risk especially in women
*Risk increased also with
**Abuse of phenacetin-containing analgesics
**Acquired cystic kidney disease
**Renal dialysis
**Renal transplantation

==MET function==
*proto-oncogene that encodes met receptor (receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor)
*triggers autophosphorylation of critical tyrosines in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of MET, activating a signal cascade

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Retinoblastoma'''

==What is Retinoblastoma?==
*a rare, malignant tumor of the retina (nerve-rich, light-sensitive layer that enables us to see) of one or both eyes that occurs in children, usually before 3 years of age

==Incidence==
*affects 1 in every 15,000 to 20,000 live births
*represents about 2% of all childhood malignancies
*approximately 350 new cases are diagnosed in the U.S. each year
*affects both sexes in all races

==Types of Retinoblastoma==
*Unilateral - when the tumors are present in one eye
**50-70% of cases
**mean age of diagnosis is 24 months
*Bilateral - when the tumors occur in both eyes
**30-50% of cases
**mean age of diagnosis is 15 months
*&quot;Trilateral&quot; - the occurrence of bilateral RB plus a pinealoma
*Unifocal - when a single RB tumor is present
*Multifocal - when more than one tumor is present in one eye

==Mode of Inheritance==
*90% of patients have no family history of retinoblastoma
*most cases arise spontaneously for no apparent reason (sporadic)
*20% of cases are transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait
*patients heterozygous for a cancer-predisposing mutation in one RB1 allele are said to have a germline mutation &amp; have a hereditary predisposition to RB
*a combo. of clinical presentation, family history, and mutation analysis is used to determine if a proband has a germline (heritable) mutation or 2 somatic mutations
*occurs in cells that have cancer-predisposing mutations in both copies of the gene
**&quot;Two hit model&quot; - if a child inherits a gene predisposing it to get Retinoblastoma, a second event must take place to change the other gene, causing Retinoblastoma to occur. The nature of the 2nd event is unknown, but research is trying to determine which factors can precipitate the onset of this disorder.

==Risks to family members==
*Parents of a proband -
**Cytogenetically detectable chromosome 13 deletion or rearrangement. Recommendation: Parental cytogenetic studies to determine if either parent carries a balanced chromosome translocation or rearrangement
**Positive family history (i.e., the parent had retinoblastoma or a close relative of one parent had retinoblastoma). Conclusion: The parent has an RB1 cancer-predisposing germline mutation
**Negative family history. Recommendation: Examination of apparently unaffected parents by an ophthalmologist knowledgeable about retinoblastoma, retinoma, and retinoblastoma-associated eye lesions. If such a lesion is detected, the parent has an RB1 cancer-predisposing germline mutation
**Presence of a germline RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation. Recommendation: Molecular genetic testing of a blood sample of both parents.
***If a germline mutation is identified in either parent, the parent is at risk of developing non-ocular second primary tumors and is at-risk to transmit the mutation to other offspring.
***If a germline RB1 mutation is not identified in either parent, two possibilities exist: 1) the index case has a de novo RB1 germline mutation (90-94% chance); or 2) one parent has mosaicism (which includes the germline) for the RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation (6-10% chance).
***Mosaicism for an RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation. Recommendation: Molecular genetic testing of the parents is not necessary.
*Sibs of a proband - The risk to sibs of an index case depends on the genetic status of the parents of the index case.
**If a parent is determined to have a germline RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation either by positive family history, by an eye examination that reveals a retinoblastoma-associated eye lesion, or by molecular genetic testing that reveals the presence of a cancer-predisposing RB1 mutation, the risk to each sib of the index case is 50% (or lower if the carrier parent is a mutational mosaic) of inheriting the cancer-predisposing RB1 mutation. Given the approximately 99% penetrance of most RB1 cancer-predisposing mutations, the actual risk for retinoblastoma in these individuals is about 50% (or lower if the carrier parent is a mutational mosaic). (Note: In rare families with &quot;familial-low penetrance retinoblastoma,&quot; the risk of tumor development is less than 40%)
**If neither parent has the cancer-predisposing RB1 mutation that was identified in the index case, germline mosaicism in one parent is possible and the risk to each sib of having retinoblastoma is 3-5%
**If the index case has mosaicism for an RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation, it is assumed that the mutation arose as a post-zygotic event and that neither parent has an RB1 germline mutation. The risk to the sibs is not increased.
**If molecular genetic testing is not available or is uninformative, empiric risks based on tumor presentation (i.e., unifocal or multifocal) and family history can be used. The low, but not negligible, risk to sibs of an index case with a negative family history presumably reflects the presence of either a germline RB1 mutation with reduced penetrance in one parent or somatic mosaicism (that includes the germline) for an RB1 mutation in one parent.
*Offspring of a proband -
**If the index case has sporadic bilateral RB, a germline RB1 cancer-predisposing mutation has to be assumed and the risk to each offspring is close to 50%.
**If the index case has had sporadic unilateral multifocal RB, recurrence risk for offspring is lower. (Note: In rare families with &quot;familial-low penetrance retinoblastoma,&quot; the risk of tumor development is less than 40%).
**The low (~1%), but not negligible, risk to the offspring of index cases with unifocal disease and a negative family history reflects the possibility of a germline RB1 mutation with low penetrance or mutational mosaicism.

==Chromosome location==
*chromosome 13q14
*cytogenetic analysis (600-650 bands for at least 30 metaphases) detects deletions or rearrangements in approx. 5% of patients with unilateral RB and 7.5% of patients with bilateral RB -may also result in DD and facial dysmorphism
*with a normal cytogenetic study? 10% of cases have a positive family history and unilateral or bilateral RB; 30% of cases have a negative family history and multifocal RB; 60% of cases have a negative family history and unifocal RB
*mosaic aberrations are present in about 1% of patients

==Molecular genetics==
*gene RB1
*Normal gene product: The RB1 gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that is involved in cell cycle regulation (G1 to S transition). The RB-protein is phosphorylated by members of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) system prior to the entry into S-phase. Upon phosphorylation, the binding activity of the pocket domain is lost, resulting in the release of cellular proteins
*80% of patients have a point mutation in the coding regions of RB1 gene; 15% have a partial deletion in the RB1 gene; 5% are unknown (mo mutation found)
*recessive oncogene - gene that appears to prevent retinoblastoma
*Two kinds of oncogenes - can cause cancer either by their presence or their absence. Both are mutants/incomplete versions of ordinary genes that normally regulate cell growth. One is dominant and causes out-of-control cell growth (cancer). The other kind is recessive and normally limits or stops the growth of cells. When they are lost, cells can proliferate wildly, causing cancer.

==Penetrance==
*incomplete (90%; including all bilateral cases and about 15% of unilateral cases)
**up to 10% of gene carriers will not develop the tumor but may pass on the gene

==Signs/Symptoms==
*leukocoria (white pupil reflex or &quot;cat's eye reflex&quot;) - distinctive white mass in the pupil area behind the lens
*strabismus
*eye may become red and painful
*unusual: glaucoma (increased pressure in the eyeball), orbital cellulites, uveitis, hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage
*some retinal tumors (retinocytoma, retinoma) may undergo spontaneous growth arrest, leading to retinal lesions and scars

==Testing:==
*Diagnostic -
**clinical ophthalmoscopic examination of the fundus of the eye with dilated pupils
tumors appear as gray-yellow elevations on the retina (&quot;tumor seeds&quot; - the beginnings of tumors may be visible in the vitreous body of the eye)
**imaging studies may be used to support the diagnosis and stage the tumor
****ultrasound, CAT scan, or MRI may detect calcifications in the tumors
**probes may be used to identify newborns with a genetic predisposition in order to diagnose earlier
*Molecular - used in patients with RB with normal cytogenetic studies for risk prediction in relatives
**mutation analysis of RB1 gene in white blood cell DNA and tumor cells
**40% of patients have an abnormal RB1 gene
**can detect a germline mutation in 80% of the patients with hereditary RB
**Testing available at several labs, including [http://www.retinoblastomasolutions.org/ Retinoblastoma Solutions], University of Pennsylvania, Vermont, etc.
**detection depends on whether the tumor is unifocal or multifocal, whether the family history is positive or negative, and the sensitivity of the methodology
**if a germline mutation is identified in the proband, RB1mutation analysis can be used to determine the status of at-risk siblings and offspring
**indirect testing using linkage analysis (microsatellite markers) can be used in some families
**Prenatal - RB1 mutations can be detected in utero through CVS or amnio if the RB1 mutation is known or if linkage was informative
*Screening - ASCO classifies RB as a Group 1 disorder (genetic testing is considered part of the standard management for at-risk family members). Therefore, asymptomatic at-risk children are tested for early identification to improve diagnostic certainty and also to reduce the need for costly screening procedures in those members who have not inherited the mutation.

==Treatment==
*9 of 10 children are treated successfully (goal is preservation of sight and life)
*enucleation - excision of the tumor and the eye, removal of some of the optic nerve
**bilateral? more involved eye is removed, other treated in another way
*photocoagulation
*cryotherapy
*radiation
*systemic chemotherapy
*follow-up ophthalmological exams every 3 months
*radiologic surveys for bony metastases
*studies of spinal fluid &amp; bone marrow for malignant cells

==Future prognosis==
*early diagnosis and treatment can reduce morbidity and increase longevity
*patients with hereditary RB are at an increased risk of developing other (non-ocular) tumors, including pinealomas in the brain which are usually fatal
*may be at risk of developing osteosarcoma (rare form of bone cancer) - same gene involved in both disorders, soft tissue sarcomas, or melanomas

==Differential diagnosis==
*sporadic congenital disorders such as persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous &amp; Coat's disease
*hereditary disorders such as tuberous sclerosis, Norrie disease, incontinentia pigmenti, and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy
*ocular infestation by Toxocara canis

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rett Syndrome'''

==Contracting==
*What were you told about why you were referred to genetics?
*What would you like to learn today?
*Do you have any questions that you would like us to be sure to address?

==Intake and Family History==
*Development during first 6-18 months (should be normal)?
*Recent development - will see rapid regression in language and motor skills?
*Loss of purposeful hand use? Repetitive hand movement?
*Screaming fits and inconsolable crying (18-24 months)?
*Autistic features?
*Apnea or hyperpnea?
*Tremors and acquired miccrocephaly?
*Seizures?

==Etiology==
*Progressive neurological disorder characterized by normal birth and apparently normal psychomotor development until 6-18 months when see rapid regression
**Affects girls
**Diagnosis based on clinical or molecular basis
*X-linked dominant inheritance
**About 99.5% of cases are sporadic
***Result from de novo mutation or from one parent who has somatic or germline mosaicism
***Mother may have favorable skewed X-inactivation that results in her being unaffected or only slightly affected
**Risks to siblings depends on status of parents
***When mother of affected has MECP2 mutation, risk to inherit mutation is 50%
***If mutation is not identified in parents, risk to low but germline mosaicism cannot be excluded
***Healthy sisters of girl with Rett syndrome could be carriers with no symptoms due to skewed X-inactivation
**Females who reproduce have 50% chance of passing on mutation
***Daughters who inherit mutation at high risk to develop classic Rett syndrome
***Skewed X inactivation in girls may result in milder phenotype
***Sons who inherit mutation may suffer severe neonatal encephalopathy or have severe mental retardation syndrome - usually result in miscarriage
*Due to mutations in MECP2 gene
**Located at Xq28
**Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)
***Expressed in all tissues
***Thought to be global transcriptional repressor, and mutation disrupts gene expression during development
***Most active in brain tissue
*Prevalence is estimated to be 1:10,000 to 1:15,000

==Clinical Features==
*Normal course of development but may have mild hypotonia
**Poor suck or weak cry
**Generally very placid
*Stage I (early onset)
**Generally begins between 6 and 18 months of age
***Symptoms are vague and often overlooked
***Lasts for a few months to a year
**Infants show less eye contact and less interested in toys
**Delays in gross motor skills such as crawling or sitting
**Handwringing and decreasing head growth are mild
*Stage II (rapid destructive stage)
**Begins between ages 1 and 4 years old
***Lasts for weeks or months
***May have rapid or gradual onset
**Purposeful hand skills and spoken language lost
***May being wringing, washing, clapping, tapping, or hand-to mouthing
***Hands sometimes clasped behind back or at sides with random touching, grasping, and releasing
***Movements persist while awake but disappear during sleep
***Often screaming fits and inconsolable crying
**May see breathing irregularities
***Apnea and hyperventilation
***Breathing normal during sleep
**Autistic-like behaviors
***Loss of social interaction and communication
***General irritability and sleep irregularities
**Gait patterns unsteady and difficult to initiate movements
**Slowing of head growth is noticeable
***Brain size may eventually be 30% smaller than normal
***May begin to notice change as early as 3 months
**Gastrointestinal findings
***About 85-90% of girls have general growth failure and wasting
***Oropharyngeal and gastroesophageal incoordination may result in poor food intake
***Bowel dysmotility, constipation, and functional megacolon common
***Fecal impaction, vovulus, and intussusception can occur
***May also involve gallstones
*Stage III (plateau or pseudostationary stage)
**Begins between ages 2 and 10
***Can last for years
***Many girls remain in this stage for most of their lives
**Apraxia, motor problems common during this stage
**Seizures occur in about 50% of girls
***Tonic-clonic and partial complex are most common
***Occur more frequently once disease stabilizes
**Improvement in behavior with less irritability, crying, and autistic-like features
**May show more interest in her surroundings
***Alertness and attention span may improve
***Communication skills may also improve
**Osteoporosis is problem, possibly due to poor bone formation - results in fractures
*Stage IV (late motor deterioration stage)
**Can last for years or decades
**Characterized by reduced mobility
***Muscle weakness, rigidity (stiffness), spasticity, dystonia (increased muscle tone with abnormal posturing of extremity or trunk), and scoliosis
***Girls may stop walking
***Generally no decline in cognition, communication, or hand skills
***Repetitive hand movements may decrease
***Eye gaze usually improves
*Girls typically survive into adulthood
**Incidence of sudden, unexplained death significantly higher
**May be due to reduced heart rate variability and neurological differences
*Atypical Rett syndrome
**Females have mild learning disability or a few women with no symptoms and skewed X-inactivation
**Mutations have been found in those previously diagnosed with autism, mild learning disability, and Angelman syndrome
*Males
**Males meeting clinical phenotype have been found with 47,XXY and mosaicism for MECP2 mutations
**Males with 46,XY can also (rarely) be affected

==Diagnosis/Testing Options==
*Clinical diagnosis
**Requires following:
***Apparently normal prenatal and perinatal period
***Normal head circumference at birth
***Apparently normal development through age six months
***Deceleration of head growth occurring anytime between ages three and 48 months
***Loss of acquired hand skills and purposeful hand use between ages five and 30 months, with subsequent development of stereotyped hand movements
***Severe impairment of expressive and receptive language together with severe psychomotor retardation
***Development of gait apraxia and truncal ataxia between ages 12 and 48 months
**Limitations
***May be considered tentative until patient is 2-5 years old
***Broad clinical variability
****Some girls do lose purposeful hand motion and have seizures but can walk and retain some speech
****Some girls severe with no period of normal development
****Some girls have less dramatic regression and milder mental retardation
*Biochemical laboratory studies not helpful
*Mutation analysis
**Used to confirm diagnosis in patients or family members of patients
**Bi-directional sequencing
***Detects mutations in about 80% of patients
***Can also do PCR based DHPLC or combination of both
**Must be sure mutation is disease-causing and not polymorphism (truncating or previously reported)
**Baylor College of Medicine
***MECP2 testing using PCR amplification of 3 exons
***14cc for adults or 6cc for child in purple top EDTA tube
***CPT codes 83891, 83898x5, 83904x5, 83912 for index case; 83891, 83898x1, 83904x1, and 83912 (for other family members)
*X-chromosome inactivation
**Useful in family with several children having various MECP2 mutation phenotypes but asymptomatic mother
**Mother may have mutation but XCI pattern causes her to have no clinical signs
**Not used for diagnosis in at-risk family members
*Prenatal testing
**Prenatal diagnosis offered to women with known MECP2 mutations
***Male fetus will at best survive with severe mental retardation
***Phenotype in female difficult to predict since depends on X-inactivation
**Also offered whether or not disease-causing mutation is identified in parent because of germline mosaicism

==Treatment/Management==
*No treatment known to improve neurologic outcome
**Several trials have had questionable efficacy and outcomes
**Tried naltrexone (oral opiate agonist) and L-carnitine
*Management is supportive and symptomatic therapy
**Low dose risperidone for agitation or other selective seratonin uptake inhibitors
**May also try chloral hydrate, hydroxyzine, or diphenhydramine with melatonin
**Carbidopa/levodopa for rigidity but benefit not proven
**Melatonin may help sleep disturbances
**Try controlling diet to help with constipation
***Ample fluid intake and high fiber diet can help prevent crisis
***May use stool softeners
**Anti-reflux agents, smaller and thickened feedings, and positioning can help with reflux
*Video/EEG studies can give definitive information about seizures and need for antiepileptic
*Occupational and physical therapy to maintain function and prevent scoliosis
*Music therapy may be beneficial to girls to improve receptive and expressive language
*Mental function is not impaired!

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
**Loss of motorskills and seizures, dementia, and spasticit
**Have retinal dystrophy with blindness not seen in Rett syndrome
**Relies on electron microscopic findings on tissue biopsy, analysis of PPT-1 enzyme, or mutation analysis of CLN1 gene
*Autism
**Common diagnosis of girls with Rett syndrome without microcephaly, seizures, kyphoscoliosis
**No clinical criteria can distinguish between them
*Angelman syndrome
**Mental deficiency, seizures, ataxia, hand stereotypes, and microcephaly
**Developmental regression should distinguish Rett syndrome
**Seizures more difficult to manage in Angelman Syndrome
**Molecular genetic testing identifies about 90% of Angelman mutations
*Older patients may have been diagnosed with cerebral palsy

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Lifelong care for a child who may never be able to take care of herself
*Feelings of guilt, anger, fear, sadness, sense of loss surrounding new diagnosis
*Concern about risk for future children
*Worry, frustration about what future holds since may not be able to predict
*One child that requires extra care and attention, detracting from other children or family relationships

      <comment>/* Methods */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''method''' in Ruby is a set of expressions that returns a value.  With methods, one can organize their code into subroutines that can be easily invoked from other areas of their program.  Other languages sometimes refer to this as a [[w:Subroutine|function]].  A method may be defined as a part of a [[Ruby Programming/Classes|class]] or separately.

==Method Calls==

Methods are called using the following syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
method_name(parameter1, parameter2,…)
&lt;/source&gt;

If the method has no parameters the parentheses can usually be omitted as in the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
method_name
&lt;/source&gt;

If you don't have code that needs to use method result immediately, Ruby allows to specify parameters omitting parentheses:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
results = method_name parameter1, parameter2           # calling method, not using parentheses

# You need to use parentheses if you want to work with the result immediately.
# e.g., if a method returns an array and we want to reverse element order:
results = method_name(parameter1, parameter2).reverse
&lt;/source&gt;

==Method Definitions==

Methods are defined using the keyword &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; followed by the ''method name''.  
Method [[w:en:parameter (computer science)|parameters]] are specified between parentheses following the method name.  The ''method body'' is enclosed by this definition on the top and the word &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; on the bottom. By convention method names that consist of multiple words have each word separated by an underscore. 

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
def output_something(value)
  puts value 
end
&lt;/source&gt;

===Return Values===

Methods return the value of the last statement executed.  The following code returns the value &lt;code&gt;x+y&lt;/code&gt;.  
  
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
def calculate_value(x,y)
  x + y
end
&lt;/source&gt;

An explicit return statement can also be used to return from function with a value, prior to the end of the function declaration. This is useful when you want to terminate a loop or return from a function as the result of a conditional expression.

Note, if you use &quot;return&quot; within a block, you actually will jump out from the function, probably not what you want. To terminate block, use '''break'''. You can pass a value to break which will be returned as the result of the block:
  
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
six = (1..10).each {|i| break i if i &gt; 5}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, six will have the value 6.

===Default Values===

A default parameter value can be specified during method definition to replace the value of a parameter if it is not passed into the method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
def some_method(value='default', arr=[])
  puts value
  puts arr.length
end

some_method('something')
&lt;/source&gt;

The method call above will output:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  something
  0
&lt;/source&gt;

The following is a syntax error in Ruby 1.8
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def foo( i = 7, j ) # Syntax error in Ruby 1.8.7 Unexpected ')', expecting '='
    return i + j
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code will work in 1.9.2 and will be logically equivalent to the snippet below
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def foo( j, i = 7)
    return i + j
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

===Variable Length Argument List, Asterisk Operator===

The last parameter of a method may be preceded by an asterisk(*), which is sometimes called the 'splat' operator.  This indicates that more parameters may be passed to the function. Those parameters are collected up and an [[Ruby Programming/Syntax/Literals#Arrays|array]] is created.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def calculate_value(x,y,*otherValues)
    puts otherValues
  end
  
  calculate_value(1,2,'a','b','c')
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above the output would be ['a', 'b', 'c'].

The asterisk operator may also precede an Array argument in a method call. In this case the Array will be expanded and the values passed in as if they were separated by commas.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  arr = ['a','b','c']
  calculate_value(*arr)
&lt;/source&gt;

has the same result as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  calculate_value('a','b','c')
&lt;/source&gt;

Another technique that Ruby allows is to give a [[Ruby Programming/Syntax/Literals#Hashes|Hash]] when invoking a function, and that gives you best of all worlds: named parameters, and variable argument length.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def accepts_hash( var )
    print &quot;got: &quot;, var.inspect # will print out what it received
  end
  
  accepts_hash :arg1 =&gt; 'giving arg1', :argN =&gt; 'giving argN'
  # =&gt; got: {:argN=&gt;&quot;giving argN&quot;, :arg1=&gt;&quot;giving arg1&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

You see, the arguments for accepts_hash got rolled up into one [[Ruby Programming/Syntax/Literals#Hashes|hash]] variable. This technique is heavily used in the Ruby On Rails API.

Also note the missing parenthesis around the arguments for the accepts_hash function call, and notice that there is no { } Hash declaration syntax around the :arg1 =&gt; '...' code, either. The above code is equivalent to the more verbose:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  accepts_hash( :arg1 =&gt; 'giving arg1', :argN =&gt; 'giving argN' )  # argument list enclosed in parens
  accepts_hash( { :arg1 =&gt; 'giving arg1', :argN =&gt; 'giving argN' } ) # hash is explicitly created
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, if you are going to pass a code block to function, you need parentheses.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  accepts_hash( :arg1 =&gt; 'giving arg1', :argN =&gt; 'giving argN' )  { |s| puts s }
  accepts_hash( { :arg1 =&gt; 'giving arg1', :argN =&gt; 'giving argN' } )  { |s| puts s } 
  # second line is more verbose, hash explicitly created, but essentially the same as above
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Ampersand Operator===

Much like the asterisk, the ampersand(&amp;) may precede the last parameter of a function declaration.  This indicates that the function expects a code block to be passed in.  A Proc object will be created and assigned to the parameter containing the block passed in.

Also similar to the ampersand operator, a Proc object preceded by an ampersand during a method call will be replaced by the block that it contains.  [[Ruby Programming/Method Calling#yield|&lt;code&gt;Yield&lt;/code&gt;]] may then be used.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def method_call
    yield
  end

  method_call(&amp;someBlock)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Understanding blocks, Procs and methods===
====Introduction====

Ruby provides the programmer with a set of very powerful features borrowed from the domain of functional programming, namely closures, higher-order functions, and first-class functions [1]. These features are implemented in Ruby by means of code blocks, Proc objects, and methods (that are also objects)—concepts that are closely related and yet differ in subtle ways. In fact, I found myself quite confused about this topic, having difficulty understanding the difference between blocks, procs, and methods as well as unsure about the best practices of using them. Additionally, having some background in Lisp and years of Perl experience, I was unsure of how the Ruby concepts map to similar idioms from other programming languages like Lisp’s functions and Perl’s subroutines. Sifting through hundreds of newsgroup posts, I saw that I am not the only one with this problem and, in fact, quite a lot of “Ruby Nubies” struggle with the same ideas.

In this article I lay out my understanding of this facet of Ruby, which comes as a result of extensive research of Ruby books, documentation, and comp.lang.ruby, in sincere hope that other people will find it useful as well.

====Procs====

Shamelessly ripping from the Ruby documentation, Procs are defined as follows: Proc objects are blocks of code that have been bound to a set of local variables. Once bound, the code may be called in different contexts and still access those variables.

A useful example is also provided:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def gen_times(factor)
      return Proc.new {|n| n*factor }
  end
  
  times3 = gen_times(3)      # 'factor' is replaced with 3
  times5 = gen_times(5)
  
  times3.call(12)               #=&gt; 36
  times5.call(5)                #=&gt; 25
  times3.call(times5.call(4))   #=&gt; 60
&lt;/source&gt;

Procs play the role of functions in Ruby. It is more accurate to call them function objects, since like everything in Ruby they are objects. Such objects have a name in the folklore - functors. A functor is defined as an object to be invoked or called as if it were an ordinary function, usually with the same syntax, which is exactly what a Proc is.

From the example and the definition above, it is obvious that Ruby Procs can also act as closures. On Wikipedia, a closure is defined as a function that refers to free variables in its lexical context. Note how closely it maps to the Ruby definition blocks of code that have been bound to a set of local variables.

====More on Procs====

Procs in Ruby are first-class objects, since they can be created during runtime, stored in data structures, passed as arguments to other functions and returned as the value of other functions. Actually, the gen_times example demonstrates all of these criteria, except for “passed as arguments to other functions”. This one can be presented as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def foo (a, b)
      a.call(b)
  end
  
  putser = Proc.new {|x| puts x}
  foo(putser, 34)
&lt;/source&gt;

There is also a shorthand notation for creating Procs - the Kernel method lambda [2] (we’ll come to methods shortly, but for now assume that a Kernel method is something akin to a global function, which can be called from anywhere in the code). Using lambda the Proc object creation from the previous example can be rewritten as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  putser = lambda {|x| puts x}
&lt;/source&gt;

Actually, there are two slight differences between lambda and Proc.new. First, argument checking. The Ruby documentation for lambda states: Equivalent to Proc.new, except the resulting Proc objects check the number of parameters passed when called. Here is an example to demonstrate this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  pnew = Proc.new {|x, y| puts x + y}
  lamb = lambda {|x, y| puts x + y}

  # works fine, printing 6
  pnew.call(2, 4, 11)
  
  # throws an ArgumentError
  lamb.call(2, 4, 11)
&lt;/source&gt;

Second, there is a difference in the way returns are handled from the Proc. A return from Proc.new returns from the enclosing method (acting just like a return from a block, more on this later):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def try_ret_procnew
      ret = Proc.new { return &quot;Baaam&quot; }
      ret.call
      &quot;This is not reached&quot;
  end
  
  # prints &quot;Baaam&quot;
  puts try_ret_procnew
&lt;/source&gt;

While return from lambda acts more conventionally, returning to its caller:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def try_ret_lambda
      ret = lambda { return &quot;Baaam&quot; }
      ret.call
      &quot;This is printed&quot;
  end
  
  # prints &quot;This is printed&quot;
  puts try_ret_lambda
&lt;/source&gt;

With this in light, I would recommend using lambda instead of Proc.new, unless the behavior of the latter is strictly required. In addition to being a whopping two characters shorter, its behavior is less surprising.

====Methods====

Simply put, a method is also a block of code. However, unlike Procs, methods are not bound to the local variables around them. Rather, they are bound to some object and have access to its instance variables [3]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Boogy
      def initialize
          @dix = 15
      end
  
      def arbo
          puts &quot;#{@dix} ha\n&quot;
      end
  end

  # initializes an instance of Boogy
  b = Boogy.new

  # prints &quot;15 ha&quot;
  b.arbo
&lt;/source&gt;

A useful idiom when thinking about methods is that you are sending messages to the object that the method is defined for. Given a ''receiver'' - an object that has some method defined - we send it a message, which contains the name of the method, and optionally provides the arguments that the method would receive. In the example above, calling the method arbo without any arguments, is akin to sending a message with just “arbo” as the argument. 

Ruby supports the message sending idiom more directly, by including the send method in class Object (which is the parent of all objects in Ruby). So the following three lines are equivalent to the arbo method call:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  # method is called on the object, with no arguments
  b.arbo

  # method/message name is given as a string
  b.send(&quot;arbo&quot;)
  
  # method/message name is given as a symbol
  b.send(:arbo)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that methods can also be defined in the so-called “top-level” scope, which is not inside any user-defined class. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def say (something)
      puts something
  end
  
  say &quot;Hello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

While it seems that the method '''say''' is “free-standing”, it is not - Ruby silently tucks it into the Object class, which represents the scope of your application:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def say (something)
      puts something
  end
  
  say &quot;Hello&quot;
  Object.send(:say, &quot;Hello&quot;) # this will be the same as the above line
&lt;/source&gt;

But this doesn’t really matter, and for all practical purposes '''say''' can be seen as an independent method. Which is, by the way, just what’s called a “function” in some languages (like C and Perl). The following Proc is, in many ways similar:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  say = lambda {|something| puts something}
  
  say.call(&quot;Hello&quot;)

  # same effect
  say[&quot;Hello&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

The [] construct is a synonym to call in the context of Proc [4]. Methods, however, are more versatile than procs and support a very important feature of Ruby, which I will present right after explaining what blocks are.

====Blocks====

Blocks are so powerfully related to Procs that it gives many newbies a headache trying to decipher how they actually differ. I will try to ease on comprehension with a (hopefully not too corny) metaphor. Blocks, as I see them, are unborn Procs. Blocks are the larval, Procs are the insects. A block does not live on its own - it prepares the code for when it will actually become alive, and only when it is bound and converted to a Proc, it starts living:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  # a naked block can't live in Ruby
  # this is a compilation error !
  {puts &quot;hello&quot;}
  
  # now it's alive, having been converted
  # to a Proc !
  pr = lambda {puts &quot;hello&quot;}

  pr.call
&lt;/source&gt;

Is that it, is that what all the fuss is about, then ? No, not at all. The designer of Ruby, Matz saw that while passing Procs to methods (and other Procs) is nice and allows high-level functions and all kinds of fancy functional stuff, there is one common case that stands high above all other cases - passing a single block of code to a method that makes something useful out of it, for example iteration. And as a very talented designer, Matz decided that it is worthwhile to emphasize this special case, and make it both simpler and more efficient.

====Passing a block to a method====

No doubt that any programmer who has spent at least a couple of hours with Ruby has been shown the following examples of Ruby glory (or something very similar):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  10.times do |i|
      print &quot;#{i} &quot;
  end
  
  numbers = [1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 21]
  
  numbers.each do |x|
      puts &quot;#{x} is &quot; + (x &gt;= 3 ? &quot;many&quot; : &quot;few&quot;)
  end
  
  squares = numbers.map {|x| x * x}
&lt;/source&gt;

(Note that &lt;code&gt;do |x| ... end&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;{ |x| ... }&lt;/code&gt;.)

Such code is, in my opinion, the part of what makes Ruby the clean, readable, and wonderful language it is. What happens here behind the scenes is quite simple, or at least may be depicted in a very simple way. Perhaps Ruby may not implement it exactly the way I am going to describe it, since there are optimization considerations surely playing their role, but it is definitely close enough to the truth to serve as a metaphor for understanding.

Whenever a block is appended to a method call, Ruby automatically converts it to a Proc object but one without an explicit name. The method, however, has a way to access this Proc, by means of the yield statement. See the following example for clarification:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def do_twice
      yield 
      yield
  end

  do_twice {puts &quot;Hola&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

The method do_twice is defined and called with an attached block. Although the method did not explicitly ask for the block in its arguments list, the yield can call the block. This can be implemented in a more explicit way using a Proc argument:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def do_twice(what)
      what.call
      what.call
  end

  do_twice lambda {puts &quot;Hola&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

This is equivalent to the previous example but using blocks with yield is cleaner and better optimized since only one block is passed to the method. Using the Proc approach, any amount of code blocks can be passed:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def do_twice(what1, what2, what3)
      2.times do
          what1.call
          what2.call
          what3.call
      end
  end

  do_twice(   lambda {print &quot;Hola, &quot;},
              lambda {print &quot;querido &quot;},
              lambda {print &quot;amigo\n&quot;})
&lt;/source&gt;

This is important to note that many people frown at passing blocks and prefer explicit Procs instead. Their rationale is that a block argument is implicit and one has to look through the whole code of the method to see if there are any calls to yield there, while a Proc is explicit and can be immediately spotted in the argument list. While this is simply a matter of taste, understanding both approaches is vital.

====The ampersand (&amp;)====

The ampersand operator can be used to explicitly convert between blocks and Procs in a couple of cases. It is worthy to understand how these work.

Remember how I said that although an attached block is converted to a Proc under the hood, it is not accessible as a Proc from inside the method ? Well, if an ampersand is prepended to the last argument in the argument list of a method, the block attached to this method is converted to a Proc object and gets assigned to that last argument:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def contrived(a, &amp;f)
      # the block can be accessed through f
      f.call(a)
      
      # but yield also works !
      yield(a)
  end
  
  # this works
  contrived(25) {|x| puts x}
  
  # this raises ArgumentError, because &amp;f 
  # isn't really an argument - it's only there 
  # to convert a block
  contrived(25, lambda {|x| puts x})
&lt;/source&gt;

Another (IMHO far more efficacious) use of the ampersand is the other-way conversion - converting a Proc into a block. This is very useful because many of Ruby’s great built-ins, and especially the iterators, expect to receive a block as an argument, and sometimes it’s much more convenient to pass them a Proc. The following example is taken right from the excellent “Programming Ruby” book by the pragmatic programmers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  print &quot;(t)imes or (p)lus: &quot;
  times = gets
  print &quot;number: &quot;
  number = Integer(gets)
  if times =~ /^t/
      calc = lambda {|n| n*number }
  else
      calc = lambda {|n| n+number }
  end
  puts((1..10).collect(&amp;calc).join(&quot;, &quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

The collect method expects a block, but in this case it is very convenient to provide it with a Proc, since the Proc is constructed using knowledge gained from the user. The ampersand preceding calc makes sure that the Proc object calc is turned into a code block and is passed to collect as an attached block.

The ampersand also allows the implementation of a very common idiom among Ruby programmers: passing method names into iterators. Assume that I want to convert all words in an Array to upper case. I could do it like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  words = %w(Jane, aara, multiko)
  upcase_words = words.map {|x| x.upcase}
  
  p upcase_words
&lt;/source&gt;

This is nice, and it works, but I feel it’s a little bit too verbose. The upcase method itself should be given to map, without the need for a separate block and the apparently superfluous x argument. Fortunately, as we saw before, Ruby supports the idiom of sending messages to objects, and methods can be referred to by their names, which are implemented as Ruby Symbols. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  p &quot;Erik&quot;.send(:upcase)
&lt;/source&gt;

This, quite literally, says send the message/method upcase to the object “Erik”. This feature can be utilized to implement the map {|x| x.upcase} in an elegant manner, and we’re going to use the ampersand for this ! As I said, when the ampersand is prepended to some Proc in a method call, it converts the Proc to a block. But what if we prepend it not to a Proc, but to another object ? Then, Ruby’s implicit type conversion rules kick in, and the to_proc method is called on the object to try and make a Proc out of it. We can use this to implement to_proc for Symbol and achieve what we want:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Symbol
      
      # A generalized conversion of a method name
      # to a proc that runs this method.
      #
      def to_proc
          lambda {|x, *args| x.send(self, *args)}
      end
      
  end
  
  # Voilà !
  words = %w(Jane, aara, multiko)
  upcase_words = words.map(&amp;:upcase)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Dynamic methods ==

You can define a method on &quot;just one object&quot; in Ruby.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  a = 'b'
  def a.some_method
    'within a singleton method just for a'
  end
  &gt;&gt; a.some_method
  =&gt; 'within a singleton method just for a'
&lt;/source&gt;

Or you can use define_(singleton_)method, which preserves the scope around the definition, as well.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  a = 'b'
  a.define_singleton_method(:some_method) {
    'within a block method'
  }
  a.some_method
&lt;/source&gt;

==Special methods==
Ruby has a number of special methods that are called by the interpreter. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Chameleon
    alias __inspect__ inspect
    def method_missing(method, *arg)
      if (method.to_s)[0..2] == &quot;to_&quot;
        @identity = __inspect__.sub(&quot;Chameleon&quot;, method.to_s.sub('to_','').capitalize)
        def inspect
          @identity
        end
        self
      else
        super #method_missing overrides the default Kernel.method_missing
              #pass on anything we weren't looking for so the Chameleon stays unnoticed and uneaten ;)
      end
    end
  end
  mrlizard = Chameleon.new
  mrlizard.to_rock
&lt;/source&gt;

This does something silly but &lt;code&gt;method_missing&lt;/code&gt; is an important part of meta-programming in Ruby. In Ruby on Rails it is used extensively to create methods dynamically.

Another special methods is &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; that ruby calls whenever a class instance is created, but that belongs in the next chapter: [[Ruby_Programming/Classes_and_objects | Classes]].

==Conclusion==

Ruby doesn’t really have functions. Rather, it has two slightly different concepts - methods and Procs (which are, as we have seen, simply what other languages call function objects, or functors). Both are blocks of code - methods are bound to Objects, and Procs are bound to the local variables in scope. Their uses are quite different.

Methods are the cornerstone of object-oriented programming, and since Ruby is a pure-OO language (everything is an object), methods are inherent to the nature of Ruby. Methods are the actions Ruby objects do - the messages they receive, if you prefer the message sending idiom.

Procs make powerful functional programming paradigms possible, turning code into a first-class object of Ruby allowing to implement high-order functions. They are very close kin to Lisp’s lambda forms (there’s little doubt about the origin of Ruby’s Proc constructor lambda)

The construct of a block may at first be confusing, but it turns out to be quite simple. A block is, as my metaphor goes, an unborn Proc - it is a Proc in an intermediate state, not bound to anything yet. I think that the simplest way to think about blocks in Ruby, without losing any comprehension, would be to think that blocks are really a form of Procs, and not a separate concept. The only time when we have to think of blocks as slightly different from Procs is the special case when they are passed as the last argument to a method which may then access them using yield.

That’s about it, I guess. I know for sure that the research I conducted for this article cleared many misunderstandings I had about the concepts presented here. I hope others will learn from it as well. If you see anything you don’t agree with - from glaring errors to small inaccuracies, feel free to amend the book.

====Notes====

[1] It seems that in the pure, theoretical interpretation what Ruby has isn’t first-class functions per se. However, as this article demonstrates, Ruby is perfectly capable of fulfilling most of the requirements for first-class functions, namely that functions can be created during the execution of a program, stored in data structures, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as the values of other functions.

[2] lambda has a synonym - proc, which is considered ‘mildly deprecated’ (mainly because proc and Proc.new are slightly different, which is confusing). In other words, just use lambda.

[3] These are ‘instance methods’. Ruby also supports ‘class methods’, and ‘class variables’, but that is not what this article is about.

[4] Or more accurately, call and [] both refer to the same method of class Proc. Yes, Proc objects themselves have methods !

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Tools You'll Need For Watchmaking==

===Essentials That You Can't Do Without===

;Screwdrivers : 0.5mm, 1mm and 1.5mm at least.  A full set (nine screwdrivers, from 0.6 to 3 mm) is much better. The USD 50 AF (which is a French-made one, but rebranded) is a sure bet. Bergeon makes a nice set, but a bit overpriced. Do not get the anti-magnetic ones, as these are way too soft.

;Tweezers : Quality makes a difference. I'd get one quality pair (Dumont is a very good brand), and a couple of less expensive ones to start. An anti-magnetic steel pair (size 1 or 2; whereas a fine size 5 is for hairspring work only), and any brass one, as brass is softer than steel, so it won't leave any mark on the steel, and brass is anti-magnetic (AM is always obviously written on these).

;Watch oil and oiler :  I like fountain oilers, because they save oil, especially if you don't do all that many watches at a time.  Dip oilers will work, but it is likely that your oil will be contaminated before you use much of it.  A reasonable substitute is an insulin syringe with a blunted tip. Depends on local rules; here I can get them without a prescription.

;Movement holder or movement rings : It's just barely possible to work without them, but only barely. The genuine Bergeon 4040 is a classic. Do not get the Chinese/Indian ones, their sides are not parallel.  


===Nearly Essential Tools===

;Digital camera : Unless your memory is a lot better than mine.  Take pictures of the movement.  If your camera won't take close-ups, you can probably hold a jeweler's loupe in front of the lens to get closer.  Generally best with the flash off. 

;Screwdriver sharpener : Possibly not right away if you get a very high quality screwdriver set, you'll need it if you get a $15 screwdriver set, and you'll need it eventually no matter what.  I'd rather have cheap screwdrivers and a sharpener than a good set without. You'll need a sharpening stone: buy a double-sided USA Norton &quot;India&quot; stone (orange/brown): one side is coarse, the other one is fine. Always put some PETROL on it BEFORE sharpening anything on it, or the stone will get clogged up with metal fragments. For a last fine sharpening job, you can use an Arkansas stone (they're gray or bluish/white colored). Always use oil with this stone.

;Loupes : If you're as nearsighted as I am, you can just barely manage without one, but they are too cheap to do without.  You'll want a x4 or so to get tools between the loupe and the watch, and a x12 or so to inspect extremely close.  Drill some holes in the body to reduce fogging. Good brands : Asco, Bergeon.  An Optivisor (headband mounted stereo magnafyer) is nice. The real ones have a prism that helps with close vision.   Cheaper ones just have the lens, you wind up having to go cross-eyed to see.  

;Case wrench : Jaxa-style is the best cheap version. If you go for the Asian copy of the Jaxa tool, remember you can still buy a good Bergeon set of replacement bits.

;Case knife : One of the easiest tools to substitute, but inexpensive. 

;Crystal press : For installing crystals and bezels, and for closing stubborn snap-on backs. 

;Crystal lift : For installing and removing plastic crystals, the only way to access some watches with one-piece cases

;Pin vise : For holding stems and similar.  

:Rubber dust blower : To remove dust, or to dry a part.

;A tool to remove the strap/bracelet from the watch : I like the cheap Bergeon 6767 (the one with fine tip).

;Parts trays : I use artist's watercolor trays from WalMart, less than $1.  

;Rodico cleaning putty : Putty-like thumbtack substitutes can work, but the real stuff isn't expensive.  The older Green one is okay, but the Premium gray leaves no residues at all.

;Watch tissue : Basically like wrapping tissue, but pre-cut in 3-4 inch squares.  

;Hand puller : Go for the black Bergeon one, expensive, but do not take a risk with those fragile hands !

;Small containers for movements : I like 2 oz condiment containers with lids from a restaurant supply store. 

;Watchmaker's bench : I started with a footstool on my desk to get close to the right level, built a custom bench later. Always clean it well before doing any watchmaking job, that's a priority.

===Advanced Tools===

;Cleaning machine : A mechanical watch cleaner (spins the parts around in jars of cleaner) does nearly as good a job as a good ultrasonic, a better job than a cheap ultrasonic, and is far easier.  

;Chemicals : L and R watch cleaning chemicals may cost more than a used mechanical machine, but make a huge difference.  Non-ammoniated will last longer for occasional use, the ammonia will evaporate.  If you can't afford both wash and rinse, get the wash and substitute Naptha (lighter fluid) or paint thinner for the rinse. 

;Staking set

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ring Chromosome 22'''

==Introduction and contracting==
*Could you explain to me in your own words why you were referred to genetics?
*What is your understanding of the chromosome results?
*What are your main questions or concerns?
*Outline session
**Explain chromosome results
**Take family history (ask standard questions i.e.) miscarriage, MR, learning disabilities, birth defects, etc.)
**Dr. will examine him and may ask more questions about his medical history
**We will discuss what we know and answer questions if we can

==Explain results==
*Briefly explain chromosomes and genes
*He has 46 chromosomes including an X and Y which indicates what we already knew that he is a boy
*He also has part of an extra chromosome that has formed a ring
*The ring contains part of chromosome 22 (show ideogram)
*a ring usually forms when the ends of a chromosome break off leaving &quot;sticky ends&quot; that then connect.
*We don't really know why rings form
*We also don't know where the extra piece of chromosome originally came from
*The presence of extra chromosomal material can change the way our bodies grow and develop
*There are no reports in the literature of individuals with an extra ring chromosome 22 that is exactly like the one found in _______.
*Therefore it makes it difficult to give you a clear idea of what to expect
*Especially since there are two things we are considering, the extra genetic material and the fact that it is present in a ring form
*However, we can tell you about what we do know from reports in the literature that are similar in some ways
*I'd like to address your main concerns the best I can so please jump in with questions

==Possibilities with ring chromosomes==
*Extra ring chromosomes have been passed on from parent to child (a case of grandfather, father and son all with extra ring 22 that is much small then _____'s ring)
*When the ring chromosome is copied before cells divide sometimes there is difficulty separating them and this can result in the ring being altered (new break points or duplication of some of the material)
*It is thought that if they can't separate the cell dies
*It tends to be more common to have ring chromosomes present in a certain percentage of a person's cells and not all of them
*When this is the case the cells with the extra ring are thought to die (evidence for this comes from the fact that sometimes when these individuals are retested there are no longer rings present or they are found in a smaller percentage of cells.)

==Discussion==
*It seems that _____ is doing better than nearly all of the individuals that have been reported to have a duplication of all or even part of chromosome 22 in the literature
*If individuals have an entire extra copy of chromosome 22 (that is not a ring) they generally die before birth or soon after. They also usually have a number of birth defects and characteristic physical features.
*Individuals with partial deletions have been reported with a number of physical characteristics and health concerns that ______ does not seem to have.

==Phenotype seen in other cases==
*Complete trisomy 22 syndrome, der(22) syndrome, and cat eye syndrome (CES) all have some overlapping characteristics (see charts from articles describing characteristics with complete and mosaic trisomy 22 and see chart listing features of CES)

==CES==
*Typically associated with supernumerary bisatellited marker chromosome (inv dup 22pter-22q11.2) resulting in 4 copies of that region
*Highly variable phenotype (same marker results in different phenotype in different generations)
*3 copies have been enough to result in CES phenotype (Reiss ''et al.'' 1985 and Knoll ''et al.'' 1994)
*Criteria for diagnosis of CES include;
**Ocular coloboma of the iris and or retina
**Anal atresia (with or without fistula)
**Preauricular skin tags and pits
**Heart defects (especially total anomalous pulmonary venous return
**Dysmorphic features (hypertelorism, down-slanting palpegral fissures, urogenital defects, mild to moderater MR

==Minute supernumerary ring chromosome 22 associated with CES==
*3 generations had the minute ring derived from 22q11.2
*ring present in 90% of blood cells over the three generations

==Mechanisms of ring formation==
*By two DNA breaks, one in each arm of the same chromosome, followed by fusion of the proximal broken ends. The causes of these DNA breaks are usually unknown and so is the mechanism behind ligation of the ends. It is possible that the non-homologous end-joining machinery plays a role in this process (Smith et al. 2001). A ring can also be formed by fusion at two breakpoints in the same chromosome arm. However, only few examples of such rings have been described. Most probably, this is because they are acentric and will lack attachment point for the cell division machinery. Unless there is a different anchorage sequence for the kinetochore complex they will be lost in subsequent mitoses. Such ÒneocentromereÓ sequences have, however, been described in rare cases of constitutional (Slater et al. 1999) and acquired (Gisselsson et al. 1999) ring chromosomes.
*By fusion of dysfunctional telomeres from the same chromosome. Several in vitro and animal models have shown that shortening of telomeric DNA repeats leads to the detachment of protective proteins from the chromosome ends (Counter et al. 1992). This renders the chromosome ends prone to recombination with DNA either from other chromosomes Ð leading to formation of a dicentric Ð or with the other arm of the same chromosome Ð leading to formation of a ring.
*Parents carrying acrocentric isochromosomes or homologous Robertsonian translocations have been known to have children with a ring chromosome apparently derived from the parental abnormality (Mears AJ cites de Almeida ''et al.'' 1983 and Neri et al. 1983)
*Extranumerary can form when a marker chromosome breaks and ends of the monocentric fragment fuse

==Constitutional ring chromosomes==
*1/50,000 human fetuses (Jacobs et al. 1975)
*In most instances, these rings are formed by breakpoints in both arms, followed by fusion of the proximal ends into a ring with loss of the distal material.
*Such rings may thus result in clinical features mimicking terminal deletion syndromes.
Supernumary ring chromosomes
*Alternatively, congenital ring chromosomes are supernumerary, i.e. they occur together with two normal homologues of the corresponding chromosome (Anderlid et al. 2001)
*rare due to:
*actually are rare in occurrence
*supernumerary ring chromosomes often gradually disappear in vivo and only cells with normal karyotype are eventually observed (Michalski K ''et al.'' 1993 cited Hoo ''et al.'' 1980)
*not very many reports makes it difficult to predict prognosis or provide empiric risk data
*supernumerary marker chromosomes are more common than supernumerary rings occurring in 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 500 for a (Michalski K ''et al.'' 1993 extrapolated this from multiple studies from 1984-1990)
*the consequences will be similar to partial trisomies or duplications
*Different characteristics depending on:
*which chromosome is involved
*the position of breakpoints within the chromosome.
*patients with extra rings do not only display diverse symptoms resulting from deletions or duplications
*In a meta-study including more than two-hundred patients with congenital ring chromosomes it has been demonstrated that the majority of children with rings show a failure to thrive beyond the extent expected from their chromosomal imbalances (Kosztolanyi 1987).
*suggested that this is due to the mitotic instability of rings, preventing somatic cells from proliferating normally.
*hypothesis is supported by the fact that growth failure is more common among patients with large ring chromosomes, than among those with small ones (Kosztolanyi 1987).
*This is in accordance with the BFB model of ring chromosome dynamics.
*Statistically, large rings will undergo more sister chromatid exchanges per cell cycle than small rings and would thus have a higher propensity for breaking at anaphase.
*In a normal cell, this provokes a physiological DNA damage response leading to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (Cohen-Jonathan et al. 1999).
*a cell population carrying a ring chromosome would proliferate slower than a population without rings; the population with rings would be less fit and be at a selective disadvantage.
*Interestingly, ring chromosome loss or size reduction is not uncommon in cases with congenital rings.
*In particular, cases with small rings often exhibit a subclone without the ring chromosome and these patients are thus ring/monosomy mosaics (Gisselsson et al. 1999).

==Ring chromosomes at cell division==
*In contrast to linear chromosomes, rings may undergo cell division in three different ways (McClintock 1938; Lejeune 1968). Which of these pathways a ring chromosome will follow depends on the number of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) that has occurred in the ring before cell division:
**No SCE or an even number of SCEs in the same direction will enable normal, symmetrical segregation of the chromatids.
**An even number of SCEs in different directions will lead to the formation of interlocked rings.
**An odd number of SCEs will lead to transformation from two parallel chromatids into one continuous ring, with the double size of the original rings (Fig. 2).

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;A Glossary of Terms Related to Invasive Species Ecology&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----

'''Alien species:'''  Less commonly used in scientific literature but often included in population publications, public information displays, and educational literature.  This term refers to species that spread beyond their native range, not necessarily harmful, or species introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread; similar terms include exotic species, foreign species, introduced species, non indigenous species, and non native species (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).

'''Aquatic nuisance species: ''' Less commonly used in most literature.  1. A nonindigenous species that threatens the diversity or abundance of native species or the ecological stability of infested waters, or commercial, agricultural, aquacultural or recreational activities dependent on such waters (EPA 1990).  2. Aquatic species that causes economic or environmental harm to humans (Heutte and Bella 2003).  3.  An aquatic species with adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. species that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. species that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  

'''Biological control or biocontrol:''' 1. In general, the control of the numbers of one organism as a result of natural predation by another or others.  Specifically, the human use of natural predators for the control of pests or weeds.  Also applied to the introduction of large numbers of sterilized males of the pest species, whose matings result in the laying of infertile eggs (Allaby, 1998).  2. The release of one species to control another (Carlton, 2001).  3.  The management of weeds using introduced herbivores (often insects) as biological control agents (Booth et al., 2003). 4. Control method involving a biological control agent that is a natural enemy of a target pest (Heutte and Bella, 2003).

'''Biological invasion or bioinvasion:''' A broad term that refers to both human-assisted introductions and natural range expansions (Carlton, 2001).

'''Biological diversity or biodiversity:''' Used to describe species richness, ecosystem complexity, and genetic variation (Allaby 1998). 

'''Bioregion:''' A biological subdivision of the earth’s surface delineated by the flora and fauna of the region (Allaby 1998).

'''Biota:'''  The plants and animals of a specific region or period, or the total aggregation of organisms in the biosphere (Allaby 1998).
 
'''Casual species:'''  This term is becoming less common in usage.  A non native species that does not form self-replacing populations (Booth et al. 2003).  Similar terms include introduced species, non indigenous species, and non native species.

'''Chemical control:''' Control method that employs herbicides to control exotic plants (Heutte and Bella 2003).  

'''Community:''' Any grouping of populations of different organisms that live together in a particular environment (Allaby 1998). 

'''Cryptogenic species:''' Species that are neither clearly native nor exotic (Cohen and Carlton 1988).

'''Cultivar:''' A variety of a plant produced and maintained by horticultural techniques and not normally found in wild populations (Allaby 1998). 

'''Disturbance:''' An event or change in the environment that alters the composition and successional status of a biological community and may deflect succession onto a new trajectory, such as a forest fire or hurricane, glaciation, agriculture, and urbanization (Art 1993). 

'''Ecosystem:'''  A discrete unit, or community of organisms and their physical environment (living and non-living parts), that interact to form a stable system (Allaby 1998). 

'''Endemic:''' A species or taxonomic group that is restricted to a particular geographic areas because of such factors as isolation or response to soil or climatic conditions; this species is said to be endemic to the place (Allaby 1998) and would be native. 

'''Exotic species:''' This term is commonly used in publications and literature, and is similar to the terms alien species, foreign species, introduced species, non indigenous species, and non native species (Heutte and Bella 2003).  Other definitions include: 1. An introduced, non native species, or a species that is the result of direct or indirect, deliberate or accidental introduction of the species by humans, and for which introduction permitted the species to cross a natural barrier to dispersal (Noss and Cooperrider 1994).  2.  In North America, often refers to those species not present in a bioregion before the entry of Europeans in the 16th century, or present in later parts of that region and later introduced to an ecosystem by human-mediated mechanisms (Cohen and Carlton 1988).  

'''Fauna:''' The animal life of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). 

'''Foreign species:''' A species introduced to a new area or country.  Similar terms include alien species, exotic species, introduced species, non indigenous species, and non native species. 

'''Flora:''' Plant or bacterial life forms of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). 

'''Habitat:''' The place, including physical and biotic conditions, where a plant or an animal usually occurs (Allaby 1998). 

'''Herbicide:'''  Pesticide that specifically targets vegetation (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Indigenous:''' A species that occurs naturally in an area; a synonym for native species (Allaby 1998), although see &quot;endemic&quot;.

'''Injurious species:''' An introduced species that causes economic or environmental harm to humans.  Similar terms include aquatic nuisance species, noxious weed, and invasive species (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Intentional introduction:''' A species that is brought to a new area, country, or bioregion for a specific purpose, such as for a garden or lawn; a crop species; a landscaping species; a species that provides food; a groundcover species; for soil stabilization or hydrological control; for aesthetics or familiarity of the species; or other purposeful reasons (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Introduced species:'''  This term, along with the terms introduced species and nonindigenous species, is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal species that is not originally from the area in which it occurs.  This terms means those species that have been transported by human activities, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a region in which they did not occur in historical time and are now reproducing in the wild (Carlton 2001).  Similar terms include alien species, exotic species, foreign species, non indigenous species, and non native species.

'''Invasibility:''' The ease with which a habitat is invaded (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Invasion:''' The expansion of a species into an area not previously occupied by it (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Invasive species: ''' This term is subject to the most confusion and debate within invasion biology terminology.  Generally, this term refers to a subset of plants or animals that are introduced to an area, survive, and reproduce, and causes harm economically or environmentally within the new area of introduction.  1. An alien species whose introduction does or whose introduction is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health (Executive Order 1999).  2. An adjective for native or nonindigenous species that have colonized natural areas; 3.  Discrimination of nonindigenous species established in cultivated habitats (as ‘noninvasive’) from those established in natural habitats; 4. Nonindigenous species that are widespread; or 5. Widespread nonindigenous species that have adverse effects on the invaded habitat (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Other definitions include the following: 5. Species that spread beyond their native range, not necessarily harmful, or species introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).  6. Species that displace native species and have the ability to dominate an ecosystem, or a species that enters an ecosystem beyond its natural range and causes economic or environmental harm (Heutte and Bella 2003).  

'''IPM:''' Integrated Pest Management.  IPM focuses on long-term prevention or suppression of pests.  The integrated approach to weed management incorporates the best suited cultural, biological and chemical controls that have minimum impact on the environment and on people (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Manual control:''' Removal that involves the use of tools such as shovels, axes, rakes, grubbing hoes, and hand clippers to expose, cut, and remove flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, and/or roots from target plants (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Mechanical control:''' Removal that involves the use of motorized equipment such as mowers, “weed-whackers”, and tractor-mounted plows, disks, and sweepers.  Burning is also categorized here (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Native range:''' The ecosystem that a species inhabits (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Native species:'''  1. A synonym for indigenous species 2. A species that occurs naturally in an area, and has not been introduced by humans either intentionally or unintentionally (Allaby 2005).  3.  In North America, a species established before the year 500 (Jeschke and Strayer 2005)

'''Native weed (invasive native):''' A species that is native to an area or bioregion that has increased in number dramatically.  In cases of disturbance or change to a landscape, a ruderal species can increase in cover and compete with other native plants, threatening^ members^ the diversity of a community.  In other cases, landscape level changes can cause the increase of the population of a species, such as white-tailed deer in the northeastern part of the United State, which are at the highest levels historically and cause damage to humans, crops, and structures, suffer high disease levels, and pose threats to humans through interactions on roads (Foster and Sandberg 2004).

'''Naturalized species:''' 1. A species that was originally introduced from a different country, a different bioregion, or a different geographical area, but now behaves like a native species in that it maintains itself without further human intervention and now grows and reproduces in native communities (Allaby 1998).  2. A non native species that forms self-sustaining populations but is not necessarily an invasive species (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Niche opportunity:''' Defines conditions that promote invasions in terms of resources, natural enemies, the physical environment, interactions between these factors, and the manner in which they vary in time and space (Shea and Chesson 2002).

'''Nonindigenous species:''' This is a common term used along with non native species and introduced species in current literature and publications; other similar terms include alien species, exotic species, and foreign species.  1. Any species or other viable biological material that enters an ecosystem beyond its historic range, including any such organism transferred from one country into another (EPA 1990).  2. A plant or animal that is not native to the area in which it occurs which was either intentionally or unintentionally introduced (Williams and Meffe 2005). 

'''Non native species: ''' This term, along with the terms introduced species and nonindigenous species, is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal species that is not originally from the area in which it occurs.  Similar terms also include alien species, exotic species, and foreign species.  This term has also been defined as: 1. A species whose presence is due to intentional or unintentional introduction as a result of human activity (Booth et al. 2003).  2. A species that has been introduced to an area or bioregion (Heutte and Bella 2003). 

'''Noxious weed:''' This term is frequently a legal term in state code, denoting a special status of the plant as, for example, prohibited or restricted.  1. Native or non-native plants, or plant products, that injure or cause damage to interests of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, natural resources, public health, or the environment (Heutte and Bella 2003).  2. Implies a species’ adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. species that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. species that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  3. Any species of plants, either annual, biennial, or perennial; reproduced by seed, root, underground stem, or bulblet; which when established is or may become destructive and difficult to control by ordinary means of cultivation or other farm practices (Heutte and Bella 2003).  

'''Pathway:''' 1. Used to mean vector, purpose (the reason why a species is moved), and route (the geographic corridor from one point to another) (Carlton 2001).  2. Mode by which a species establishes and continues to exist in a new environment (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Pest:''' 1. An animal that competes with humans by consuming or damaging food, fiber, or other materials intended for human consumption or use, such as an insect pest on a cropfield (Allaby 1998)  2. Synonymous to invasive species (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).

'''Pesticide:''' A chemical or biological agent intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate plant or animal life and any substance intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, including insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, herbicides, nematocides, and biocides (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Population:''' A group of potentially inter-breeding individuals of the same species found in the same place at the same time (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Prohibited weed:''' A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may not be brought into a state (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Restricted weed:''' A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may only be brought into a state in limited quantities (Heutte and Bella 2003).

'''Ruderal species:''' A plant associated with human dwellings, construction, or agriculture, that usually colonizes disturbed or waste ground.  Ruderals are often weeds which have high demands for nutrients and are intolerant of competition.  See also native weed or invasive native (Allaby 1998).  

'''Seed bank:''' Seeds that become incorporated into the soil (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Species: ''' A group of organisms formally recognized as distinct from other groups; the taxon rank in the hierarchy of biological classification below genus; the basic unit of biological classification, defined by the reproductive isolation of the group from all other groups of organisms (Allaby 1998). 

'''Status''' or '''distributional statrus:'''

'''Tens rule:''' 1. Describes how approximately ten percent of species pass through each transition from being imported to becoming casual to becoming established, and finally becoming a weed (Booth et al. 2003).  2. Ten percent of the introduced species establish themselves in the non native continent and ten percent of these, in turn, spread or are pests (Jeschke and Strayer 2005). {note that J&amp;S found exceptions to the 10's rule}.

'''Time lag:''' 1. Time between introduction, establishment, and spread (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).  2. The time between when a species is introduced and when its population growth explodes (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Unintentional introduction:''' An introduction of nonindigenous species that occurs as the result of activities other than the purposeful or intentional introduction of the species involved, such as the transport of nonindigenous species in ballast or in water used to transport fish, mollusks or crustaceans for aquaculture or other purposes (EPA 1990). 

'''Vector:''' The physical means or agent by which a species is transported, such as ballast water, ships’ hulls, boats, hiking boats, cars, vehicles, packing material, or soil in nursery stock (Carlton 2001).  See also Pathway.  

'''Weed:'''  1. A plant in the wrong place, being one that occurs opportunistically on land or in water that has been disturbed by human activities (see also ''ruderal species'' and ''native weed'' or ''invasive native''), or on cultivated land, where it competes for nutrients, water, sunlight, or other resources with cultivated plants such as food crops.  Under different circumstances the weed plant itself may be cultivated for beneficial purposes (Allaby, 1998).  2. A native or introduced species that has a perceived negative ecological or economic effect on agricultural or natural ecosystems (Booth et al., 2003).  3.  A plant growing in an area where it is not wanted (Royer and Dickinson, 1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Robin Sequence'''

==Introduction==
*Robin sequence was named after the French stomatologist Pierre Robin.
*It has typically been regarded as the association of micrognathia, wide, U-shaped cleft palate, and upper airway obstruction.
*Robin sequence is a heterogenous disorder that most often occurs as a sequence of other syndromes.

==Incidence==
*Incidence has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 2,000 live births.
*Some babies with Robin sequence die shortly after birth because of severe airway obstruction or a variety of underlying syndromes incompatible with life (such as trisomy 13).
*Therefore, population prevalence is slightly lower than birth incidence.

==Diagnostic Criteria==
*The large majority of cases of Robin sequence are associated with other multiple-anomaly syndromes.
**The majority of syndromes that result in Robin sequence are single-gene disorders, often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
**There are also several X-linked recessive disorders and recessive disorders.
**The most common teratogenic disorder is fetal alcohol syndrome, although phenytoin and retinoic acid have been implicated as well.
*In one study, only 17% of Robin sequence cases were isolated.
*Stickler syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome are the first and second most commonly associated diagnoses.
*An initial diagnosis of Robin sequence should be regarded as a starting point in the diagnostic search.
*Robin sequence may be associated with mandibular anomalies other than micrognathia, including retrognathia and mandibular asymmetry.
*It may also be caused by macroglossia and severe muscle weakness.
*Most clinicians cite micrognathia, U-shaped cleft palate, and upper airway obstruction as the criteria for Robin sequence, but some may use only two of the features.
*Many other anomalies may exist with this triad because Robin sequence is most often secondary to another syndrome.

==Diagnostic Testing==
*There is no specific testing for Robin sequence other than observation of clinical features
*Micrognathia and cleft palate can be detected with sonography in the fetus
*Because Stickler syndrome and VCF account for nearly half of all cases of Robin sequence, it is appropriate to screen all newborns with Robin sequence for these disorders.

==Etiology==
*Robin sequence is a sequence, not a syndrome:
**The term syndrome is used when multiple anomalies in a single individual are caused by a single etiology.
**The term sequence is used when an individual has multiple anomalies caused secondarily by a single known or presumed structural anomaly or error in morphogenesis; that is, it is a cascade of events.
*The primary anomaly in Robin sequence which interrupts the normal developmental process is micrognathia or occasionally retrognathia.
*This mandibular anomaly is present at the time that palate fusion is to begin. As a result, the tongue is not free to descend from between the vertical palatal shelves, preventing them from growing toward fusion.
*Although the tongue may eventually descend in the oral cavity, it may do so after lateral head growth is too great for the remaining palatal growth to overcome or the period of programmed growth may be over.
*After birth, micrognathia persists. With the mouth closed and a small or retruded mandible present, the tongue is retrodisplaced in the pharynx (glossoptosis_ which causes airway obstruction and failure to thrive.
*The most common occurrence of a short mandibular body is in positional mandibular deformation, and extrinsic mechanical force
**This may occur as a result of fetal crowding caused by the presence of multiple fetuses, abnormal fetal position, or uterine anomalies.
**Associated deformations may include clubfoot, crumpled ear, or limb contractures.
**One would not expect to find other anomalies that were not related to mechanical constriction.
*The most common cause of retrognathia is platybasia, which draws the glenoid fossa and the temporomandibular joint backward away from the maxilla.
*Platybasia has been observed in a number of craniofacial syndromes, most commonly is VCF.

==Management==
*Growth and Feeding:
**Babies may have marginal airways that permit sufficient respiration to sustain life, but there is difficulty maintaining the airway while feeding.
**Failure to thrive becomes evident in the neonatal period.
**Failure to thrive and long-term feeding problems occur in over 50% of babies with Robin sequence.
**Respiratory sounds should be assessed by stethoscope during feeding.
**In most cases, resolution of the airway problem results in resolution of the feeding problem.
*Respiratory:
**Robin sequence is typically evident at birth because of the potentially life-threatening effects of upper airway obstruction.
**Apneic events are typically silent because the neonatal lung capacity cannot create the high negative pressures that would prompt loud noises or snoring.
**Glossoptosis associated with micrognathia is typically suspected to be the cause of airway obstruction and apnea.
**Other types of upper airway obstruction are hypotonic pharynx, absence of adequate muscle tone, laryngeal anomalies, or tracheomalacia.
**Treatment depends upon the severity of the airway obstruction, which can be variable in Robin sequence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:en:class (object-oriented programming)|'''Classes''']] are the basic template from which [[w:en:Object (computer science)|object]] instances are created.  A class is made up of a collection of variables representing internal state and methods providing behaviours that operate on that state.  

==Class Definition==

Classes are defined in Ruby using the &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; keyword followed by a name.  The name must begin with a capital letter and by convention names that contain more than one word are run together with each word capitalized and no separating characters ([[w:en:CamelCase|CamelCase]]).  The class definition may contain method, class variable, and instance variable declarations as well as calls to methods that execute in the class context at read time, such as attr_accessor.  The class declaration is terminated by the &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; keyword.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    def some_method
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

===Instance Variables===
Instance variables are created for each class instance and are accessible only within that instance.  They are accessed using the @ operator. Outside of the class definition, the value of an instance variable can only be read or modified via that instance's public methods.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    @one = 1
    def do_something
      @one = 2
    end
    def output
      puts @one
    end
  end
  instance = MyClass.new
  instance.output
  instance.do_something
  instance.output
&lt;/source&gt;

Surprisingly, this outputs:

  nil
  2


This happens (nil in the first output line) because ''@one'' defined below ''class MyClass'' is an instance variable belonging to the class object (note this is not the same as a class variable and could not be referred to as ''@@one''), whereas ''@one'' defined inside the ''do_something'' method is an instance variable belonging to instances of ''MyClass''.  They are two distinct variables and the first is accessible only in a class method.

===Accessor Methods===

As noted in the previous section, an instance variable can only be directly accessed or modified within an instance method definition. If you want to provide access to it from outside, you need to define public accessor methods, for example

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    def initialize
      @foo = 28
    end

    def foo
      return @foo
    end

    def foo=(value)
      @foo = value
    end
  end

  instance = MyClass.new
  puts instance.foo
  instance.foo = 496
  puts instance.foo
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that ruby provides a bit of syntactic sugar to make it look like you are getting and setting a variable directly; under the hood

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  a = instance.foo
  instance.foo = b
&lt;/source&gt;

are calls to the foo and foo= methods

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  a = instance.foo()
  instance.foo=(b)
&lt;/source&gt;

Since this is such a common use case, there is also a convenience method to autogenerate these getters and setters:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    attr_accessor :foo

    def initialize
      @foo = 28
    end
  end

  instance = MyClass.new
  puts instance.foo
  instance.foo = 496
  puts instance.foo
&lt;/source&gt;

does the same thing as the above program. The attr_accessor method is run at read time, when ruby is constructing the class object, and it generates the foo and foo= methods.

However, there is no requirement for the accessor methods to simply transparently access the instance variable. For example, we could ensure that all values are rounded before being stored in foo:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    def initialize
      @foo = 28
    end

    def foo
      return @foo
    end

    def foo=(value)
      @foo = value.round
    end
  end

  instance = MyClass.new
  puts instance.foo
  instance.foo = 496.2
  puts instance.foo #=&gt; 496
&lt;/source&gt;

===Class Variables===
Class variables are accessed using the @@ operator.  These variables are associated with the class hierarchy rather than any object instance of the class and are the same across all object instances. (These are similar to class &quot;static&quot; variables in Java or C++).

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    @@value = 1
    def add_one
      @@value= @@value + 1
    end
    
    def value
      @@value
    end
  end
  instanceOne = MyClass.new
  instanceTwo = MyClass.new
  puts instanceOne.value
  instanceOne.add_one
  puts instanceOne.value
  puts instanceTwo.value
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:

  1
  2
  2

===Class Instance Variables===

Classes can have instance variables.  This gives each class a variable that is not shared by other classes in the inheritance chain.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Employee
    class &lt;&lt; self; attr_accessor :instances; end
    def store
      self.class.instances ||= []
      self.class.instances &lt;&lt; self
    end
    def initialize name
      @name = name
    end
  end
  class Overhead &lt; Employee; end
  class Programmer &lt; Employee; end
  Overhead.new('Martin').store
  Overhead.new('Roy').store
  Programmer.new('Erik').store
  puts Overhead.instances.size    # =&gt; 2
  puts Programmer.instances.size  # =&gt; 1
&lt;/source&gt;

For more details, see [http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html MF Bliki: ClassInstanceVariables]

===Class Methods===
Class methods are declared the same way as normal methods, except that they are prefixed by &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;, or the class name, followed by a period.  These methods are executed at the Class level and may be called without an object instance.  They cannot access instance variables but do have access to class variables.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    def self.some_method
      puts 'something'
    end
  end
  MyClass.some_method
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:

  something

===Instantiation===
An object instance is created from a class through the a process called ''instantiation''.  In Ruby this takes place through the Class method &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  anObject = MyClass.new(parameters)
&lt;/source&gt;

This function sets up the object in memory and then delegates control to the initialize function of the class if it is present.  Parameters passed to the new function are passed into the &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class MyClass
    def initialize(parameters)
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

==Declaring Visibility==

By default, all methods in Ruby classes are public - accessible by anyone. There are, nonetheless, only two exceptions for this rule: the global methods defined under the Object class, and the initialize method for any class. Both of them are implicitly private. 

If desired, the access for methods can be restricted by public, private, protected object methods.

It is interesting that these are not actually keywords, but actual methods that operate on the class,
dynamically altering the visibility of the methods, and as a result, these 'keywords' influence the visibility of all following declarations until a new visibility is set or the end of the declaration-body is reached.

===Private===

Simple example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Example
    def methodA
    end
    
    private # all methods that follow will be made private: not accessible for outside objects
    
    def methodP
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

If private is invoked without arguments, it sets access to private for all subsequent methods.
It can also be invoked with named arguments. 

Named private method example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class Example
    def methodA
    end
    
    def methodP
    end
    
    private :methodP
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Here private was invoked with an argument, altering the visibility of methodP to private.

Note for class methods (those that are declared using def ClassName.method_name), you need to use another function: private_class_method

Common usage of private_class_method is to make the &quot;new&quot; method (constructor) inaccessible, to force access to an object through some getter function. A typical Singleton implementation is an obvious example.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class SingletonLike
    private_class_method :new
    
    def SingletonLike.create(*args, &amp;block)
      @@inst = new(*args, &amp;block) unless @@inst
      return @@inst
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Note :
another popular way to code the same declaration
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class SingletonLike
    private_class_method :new
    
    def SingletonLike.create(*args, &amp;block)
      @@inst ||= new(*args, &amp;block)
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

More info about the difference between C++ and Ruby private/protected:
http://lylejohnson.name/blog/?p=5

One person summed up the distinctions by saying that in C++, “private” means “private to this class”, while in Ruby it means “private to this instance”. What this means, in C++ from code in class A, you can access any private method for any other object of type A. In Ruby, you can not: you can only access private methods for your instance of object, and not for any other object instance (of class A).

Ruby folks keep saying &quot;private means you cannot specify the receiver&quot;. What they are saying, if method is private, in your code you can say:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class AccessPrivate
    def a
    end
    private :a # a is private method
        
    def accessing_private
      a              # sure! 
      self.a         # nope! private methods cannot be called with an explicit receiver at all, even if that receiver is &quot;self&quot;
      other_object.a # nope, a is private, you can't get it (but if it was protected, you could!)
    end
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, &quot;other_object&quot; is the &quot;receiver&quot; that method &quot;a&quot; is invoked on. For private methods, it does not work. However, that is what &quot;protected&quot; visibility will allow.

===Public===

Public is default accessibility level for class methods. I am not sure why this is specified - maybe for completeness, maybe so that you could dynamically make some method private at some point, and later - public.

In Ruby, visibility is completely dynamic. You can change method visibility at runtime!

===Protected===

Now, “protected” deserves more discussion. Those of you coming from Java or C++ have learned that in those languages, if a method is “private”, its visibility is restricted to the declaring class, and if the method is “protected”, it will be accessible to children of the class (classes that inherit from parent) or other classes in that package.

In Ruby, “private” visibility is similar to what “protected” is in Java. Private methods in Ruby are accessible from children. You can’t have truly private methods in Ruby; you can’t completely hide a method.

The difference between protected and private is subtle. If a method is protected, it may be called by any instance of the defining class or its subclasses. If a method is private, it may be called only within the context of the calling object---it is never possible to access another object instance's private methods directly, even if the object is of the same class as the caller. For protected methods, they are accessible from objects of the same class (or children).

So, from within an object &quot;a1&quot; (an instance of Class A), you can call private methods only for instance of &quot;a1&quot; (self). And you can not call private methods of object &quot;a2&quot; (that also is of class A) - they are private to a2. But you can call protected methods of object &quot;a2&quot; since objects a1 and a2 are both of class A.

[http://www.rubycentral.com/faq/rubyfaq-7.html Ruby FAQ] gives following example - implementing an operator that compares one internal variable with a variable from the same class (for purposes of comparing the objects):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  def &lt;=&gt;(other)
    self.age &lt;=&gt; other.age
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

If age is private, this method will not work, because other.age is not accessible. If &quot;age&quot; is protected, this will work fine, because self and other are of same class, and can access each other's protected methods.

To think of this, protected actually reminds me of the &quot;internal&quot; accessibility modifier in C# or &quot;default&quot; accessibility in Java (when no accessibility keword is set on method or variable): method is accessible just as &quot;public&quot;, but only for classes inside the same package.

===Instance Variables===

Note that object instance variables are not really private, you just can't see them.
To access an instance variable, you need to create a getter and setter.

Like this (no, don't do this by hand! See below):
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class GotAccessor
    def initialize(size)
      @size = size
    end
    
    def size
      @size
    end
    def size=(val)
      @size = val
    end
  end
  
  # you could the access @size variable as
  # a = GotAccessor.new(5)
  # x = a.size 
  # a.size = y
&lt;/source&gt;

Luckily, we have special functions to do just that: attr_accessor, attr_reader, attr_writer.
attr_accessor will give you get/set functionality, reader will give only getter and writer will give only setter.

Now reduced to:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class GotAccessor
    def initialize(size)
      @size = size
    end
    
    attr_accessor :size
  end
  
  # attr_accessor generates variable @size accessor methods automatically:
  # a = GotAccessor.new(5)
  # x = a.size 
  # a.size = y
&lt;/source&gt;

==Inheritance==
[[File:calling_super_in_ruby.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The ''super'' keyword only accessing the direct parents method.  There is a workaround though.]]
A class can ''inherit'' functionality and variables from a ''superclass'', sometimes referred to as a ''parent class'' or ''base class''.  Ruby does not support ''multiple inheritance'' and so a class in Ruby can have only one superclass.  The syntax is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;  
  class ParentClass
    def a_method
      puts 'b'
    end
  end
  
  class SomeClass &lt; ParentClass  # &lt; means inherit (or &quot;extends&quot; if you are from Java background)
    def another_method
      puts 'a'
    end
  end
  
  instance = SomeClass.new
  instance.another_method
  instance.a_method
&lt;/source&gt;  
Outputs:

   a
   b

All non-private variables and functions are inherited by the child class from the superclass.

If your class overrides a method from parent class (superclass), you still can access the parent's method by using 'super' keyword.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class ParentClass
    def a_method
      puts 'b'
    end
  end
  
  class SomeClass &lt; ParentClass  
    def a_method
      super
      puts 'a'
    end
  end
  
  instance = SomeClass.new
  instance.a_method
&lt;/source&gt;
Outputs:
   b
   a

(because a_method also did invoke the method from parent class).

If you have a deep inheritance line, and still want to access some parent class (superclass) methods directly, you can't. ''super'' only gets you a direct parent's method. But there is a workaround! When inheriting from a class, you can alias parent class method to a different name. Then you can access methods by alias.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
  class X
    def foo
      &quot;hello&quot;
    end
  end
  
  class Y &lt; X
    alias xFoo foo
    def foo
      xFoo + &quot;y&quot;
    end
  end

  class Z &lt; Y
    def foo
      xFoo + &quot;z&quot;
    end
  end
  
  puts X.new.foo
  puts Y.new.foo
  puts Z.new.foo
&lt;/source&gt;
Outputs

  hello
  helloy
  helloz

==Mixing in Modules==

First, you need to read up on modules [http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_modules.html Ruby modules]. Modules are a way of grouping together some functions and variables and classes, somewhat like classes, but more like namespaces. So a module is not really a class. You can't instantiate a Module, and thus it does not have ''self''.

This trait, however, allows us to include the module into a class. Mix it in, so to speak. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
module A
  def a1
    puts 'a1 is called'
  end
end

module B
  def b1
    puts 'b1 is called'
  end
end

module C
  def c1
    puts 'c1 is called'
  end
end

class Test
  include A
  include B
  include C

  def display
    puts 'Modules are included'
  end
end

object=Test.new
object.display
object.a1
object.b1
object.c1
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Modules are included
a1 is called
b1 is called
c1 is called
&lt;/source&gt;

The code shows Multiple Inheritance using modules.

==Ruby Class Meta-Model==
In keeping with the Ruby principle that everything is an object, classes are themselves instances of the class Class.  They are stored in constants under the scope of the [[Module|module]] in which they are declared.  A call to a method on an object instance is delegated to a variable inside the object that contains a reference to the class of that object.  The method implementation exists on the Class instance object itself.  Class methods are implemented on meta-classes that are linked to the existing class instance objects in the same way that those classes instances are linked to them.  These meta-classes are hidden from most Ruby functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{General Mechanics}}

The fundamental idea of kinematics is the discussion of the movement of objects, without actually taking into account what caused the movement to occur. By using simple calculus, we can find all of the equations for kinematics. To simplify the learning process, we will only consider objects that move with constant acceleration. For the first few parts, we will also assume that there is no friction or air resistance acting on the objects.

=Straight Line Motion (SLM)=
The name of this section '''Straight Line Motion''' means that we begin learning about the subject of kinematics by observing motion in one dimension. This means that we will only take one axis of a 3D &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system into account. We will be using the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis as our axis of motion.

Throughout our discussion, we will look at the motion of a '''rigid body''', one that does not deform as it moves. We idealize the rigid body by assuming that it has no dimensions and is infinitely small. This way we can talk about the entire body instead of saying, &quot;The front of the body is at this point while the rear of the body is at some other point&quot;. Also, subscripts on the variables in our equations will indicate the initial value, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and the final value, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, of that variable.

== Displacement ==

To start off with we will define the term '''displacement'''. Displacement is basically the shortest route of getting from one place to another, basically it is a straight line from the starting point of motion to the ending point of motion. No matter how much movement takes place in between and what sort of things come inbetween, we only care about the first location and the second location. We will use the variable, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, to stand for the locations of the rigid body that we are discussing. It is a vector quantity i.e. it has both magnitude and direction, if we want to define displacement for some movement then it would be like - '50 km due North'. 

In order to define motion we first must be able to say how far an object has moved. This is done by subtracting the final value of the displacement by the initial value of the displacement. Or, in other words, we subtract the initial position of the object on our coordinate system from the final position of the object on our coordinate system. It is necessary to understand that the values which you receive for this variable can be either positive or negative depending on how the object is moving and where your coordinates start:

:&lt;math&gt;x=x_f-x_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Velocity ==

The term '''velocity''', &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, is often mistaken as being equivalent to the term '''speed'''. The basic difference between speed and velocity is that, velocity is a vector quantity, whereas speed is a scalar quantity. The term '''velocity''' refers to the displacement that an object traveled divided by the amount of time it took to move to its new coordinate. From the above discussion you can see that if the object moves backwards with respect to our coordinate system, then we will get a negative displacement. Since we cannot have a negative value for time, we will then get a negative value for velocity( Here the negative sign shows that the body has moved in the backward direction to the coordinates system adopted). The term '''speed''', on the other hand refers to the magnitude of the velocity, so that it can only be a positive value. We will not be considering speed in this discussion, only velocity. By using our definition of velocity and the definition of displacement from above, we can express velocity mathematically like this:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar v={(x_f-x_i) \over (t_f-t_i)}&lt;/math&gt;  

The line over the velocity means that you are finding the average velocity, not the velocity at a specific point. This equation can be rearranged in a variety of ways in order to solve problems in physics dealing with SLM. Also, by having acceleration as a constant value, we can find the average velocity of an object if we are given the initial and final values of an object's velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar v={(v_f+v_i) \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be combined with the other equations to give useful relationships in order to solve straight line motion problems. For example, to find the initial position of an object, if we are given its final position and the times that the object began moving and finished moving, we can rearrange the equation like this:

:&lt;math&gt;x_i=x_f-\bar v(t_f-t_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Acceleration ==

The term '''acceleration''' means the change in velocity of an object per unit time. It is a vector quantity. We use the variable, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, to stand for acceleration. Basically, the sign of acceleration tells us whether the velocity is increasing or decreasing, and its magnitude tells us how much the velocity is changing. In order for an object that is initially at rest to move, it needs to accelerate to a certain speed. During this acceleration, the object moves at a certain velocity at a specific time, and travels a certain distance within that time. Thus, we can describe acceleration mathematically like this:

:&lt;math&gt;a={(v_f-v_i) \over (t_f-t_i)}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, we can rearrange our formula, this time using our definition for displacement and velocity, to get a very useful relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;x_f=x_i+v_i(t_f-t_i)+{1 \over 2}a(t_f-t_i)^2&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly Page}}

== Relationship to Machine Code ==

X86 assembly instructions have a one-to-one relationship with the underlying machine instructions. This means that essentially we can convert assembly instructions into machine instructions with a look-up table. This page will talk about some of the conversions from assembly language to machine language.

== CISC and RISC ==

The x86 architecture is a '''complex instruction set computer''' (CISC) architecture. Amongst other things, this means that the instructions for the x86 architecture are of varying lengths. This can make the processes of assembly, disassembly and instruction decoding more complicated, because the instruction length needs to be calculated for each instruction.

x86 instructions can be anywhere between 1 and 15 bytes long. The length is defined separately for each instruction, depending on the available modes of operation of the instruction, the number of required operands and more.

== 8086 instruction format (16 bit) ==

This is the general instruction form for the 8086 sequentially in main memory:

{| border=1
|Prefixes (optional)
|}
{| border=1
|Opcode (first byte)
|D
|W
|
|}
{| border=1
|Opcode 2 (occasional second byte)
|
|}

{| border=1
|MOD
|Reg
|R/M
|}
{| border=1
|Displacement or data (occasional: 1, 2 or 4 bytes)
|}

;Prefixes: Optional prefixes which change the operation of the instruction
;D:   (1 bit) Direction. 1 = Register is Destination, 0 = Register is source.
;W:   (1 bit) Operation size. 1 = Word, 0 = byte.
;Opcode: the opcode is a 6 bit quantity that determines what instruction family the code is
;MOD (Mod): (2 bits) Register mode.
;Reg: (3 bits) Register. Each register has an identifier.
;R/M (r/m): (3 bits) Register/Memory operand

Not all instructions have W or D bits; in some cases, the width of the operation is either irrelevant or implicit, and for other operations the data direction is irrelevant.

Notice that Intel instruction format is little-endian, which means that the lowest-significance bytes are closest to absolute address 0. Thus, words are stored low-byte first; the value 1234H is stored in memory as 34H 12H. By convention, most-significant bits are always shown to the left within the byte, so 34H would be 00110100B.

After the initial 2 bytes, each instruction can have many additional addressing/immediate data bytes.

=== Mod / Reg / R/M tables ===

{| border=1
|-
|Mod || Displacement
|-
| 00 || If r/m is 110, Displacement (16 bits) is address; otherwise, no displacement
|-
| 01 || Eight-bit displacement, sign-extended to 16 bits
|-
| 10 || 16-bit displacement (example: MOV [BX + SI]+ displacement,al)
|-
| 11 || r/m is treated as a second &quot;reg&quot; field
|}

{| border=1
|-
|Reg || W = 0 || W = 1||double word||
|-
|000||AL||AX||EAX
|-
|001||CL||CX||ECX
|-
|010||DL||DX||EDX
|-
|011||BL||BX||EBX
|-
|100||AH||SP||ESP
|-
|101||CH||BP||EBP
|-
|110||DH||SI||ESI
|-
|111||BH||DI||EDI
|}

{| border=1
|-
| r/m || Operand address
|-
| 000 || (BX) + (SI) + displacement (0, 1 or 2 bytes long)
|-
| 001 || (BX) + (DI) + displacement (0, 1 or 2 bytes long)
|-
| 010 || (BP) + (SI) + displacement (0, 1 or 2 bytes long)
|-
| 011 || (BP) + (DI) + displacement (0, 1 or 2 bytes long)
|-
| 100 || (SI) + displacement (0, 1 or 2 bytes long)
|-
| 101 || (DI) + displacement (0, 1 or 2 bytes long)
|-
| 110 || (BP) + displacement unless mod = 00 (see mod table)
|-
| 111 || (BX) + displacement (0, 1 or 2 bytes long)
|}

Note the special meaning of MOD 00, r/m 110. Normally, this would be expected to be the operand [BP]. However, instead the 16-bit displacement is treated as the absolute address. To encode the value [BP], you would use mod = 01, r/m = 110, 8-bit displacement = 0.

=== Example: Absolute addressing ===

Let's translate the following instruction into bytecode:

 XOR CL, [12H]

Note that this is XORing CL with the contents of address 12H – the square brackets are a common indirection indicator. The opcode for XOR is &quot;001100dw&quot;. D is 1 because the CL register is the destination. W is 0 because we have a byte of data. Our first byte therefore is &quot;00110010&quot;.

Now, we know that the code for CL is 001. Reg thus has the value 001. The address is specified as a simple displacement, so the MOD value is 00 and the R/M is 110. Byte 2 is thus (00 001 110b).

Byte 3 and 4 contain the effective address, low-order byte first, 0012H as 12H 00H, or (00010010b) (00000000b)

All together,

 XOR CL, [12H] = 00110010 00001110 00010010 00000000 = 32H 0EH 12H 00H

=== Example: Immediate operand ===

Now, if we were to want to use an immediate operand, as follows:

 XOR CL, 12H

In this case, because there are no square brackets, 12H is immediate: it is the number we are going to XOR against. The opcode for an immediate XOR is 1000000w; in this case, we are using a byte, so w is 0. So our first byte is (10000000b).

The second byte, for an immediate operation, takes the form &quot;mod 110 r/m&quot;. Since the destination is a register, mod is 11, making the r/m field a register value. We already know that the register value for CL is 001, so our second byte is (11 110 001b).

The third byte (and fourth byte, if this were a word operation) are the immediate data. As it is a byte, there is only one byte of data, 12H = (00010010b).

All together, then:

 XOR CL, 12H = 10000000 11110001 00010010 = 80H F1H 12H

== x86-32 Instructions (32 bit) ==
The 32-bit instructions are encoded in a very similar way to the 16-bit instructions, except (by default) they act upon dword quantities rather than words. Also, they support a much more flexible memory addressing format, which is made possible by the addition of an SIB &quot;scale-index-base&quot; byte, which follows the ModR/M byte.

== x86-64 Instructions (64 bit) ==</text>

(Abrams RA, Cancer J Sci Am. 1998 May-Jun;4(3):178-84.) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Patients with unresectable alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatocellular carcinoma experienced improved survival and decreased toxicity when managed with post-induction cycles of intra-arterial cisplatin as compared with intravenous doxorubicin and 5-FU. Intravenous 131I-polyclonal antiferritin did not improve survival when added to either post-induction regimen but dramatically increased hematologic toxicities.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A. Setup NX Server on Fedora Core 3 machine ==
'''From a windows machine, use putty to login as root to Fedora Core 3 machine''' 

1. run command
 	
 rpm -q nc expect

If you get error like &quot;package expact is not installed&quot; or &quot;package nc is not 
installed&quot;,  from fedora core  cds, copy expect-5.42.1-1.i386.rpm and
nc-1.10- 22.i386.rpm  to /root directory  and run commands
    
 cd /root
 rpm -ivh expect-5.42.1-1.i386.rpm
 rpm -ivh nc-1.10-22.i386.rpm 

2. Then to download nx server, run command 

 wget http://fedoranews.org/contributors/rick_stout/freenx/nx-1.5.0-0.FC3.1.i386.rpm
 wget http://fedoranews.org/contributors/rick_stout/freenx/freenx-0.4.4-1.fdr.0.noarch.rpm

3. After download is finished, run command
  rpm -ivh nx-1.5.0-0.FC3.1.i386.rpm
  rpm -ivh  freenx-0.4.4-1.fdr.0.noarch.rpm   

4. create a user called testuser and set password for it with command

  useradd testuser
  password testuser

'''Now your NX Server is UP and running''' 


== B. Setup NX Client on Windows machine ==

1. Download nx client for windows from following link

http://64.34.161.181/download/1.5.0/client/nxclient-1.5.0-132.exe

2. Run '''nxclient-1.5.0-132.exe''' to install nx client

3. Click on  '''Start &gt; Programs &gt; NX Client for Windows &gt; NX Connection Wizard'''

In “Session” type '''Linux'''

In “Host”  type ip address of Fedora Core 3 Server

Click Next

4. Select &quot;Unix&quot;, “Gnome”. Make sure that &quot;Enable SSL encryption on all traffic&quot; is checked and click &quot;Next&quot;. 

5. Check &quot;Show the Advanced Configuration dialog&quot; box and click &quot;Finish&quot;.

6. Click on button &quot;Key...&quot;. It will open '''General – Key Management''' window. Press Alt + Tab to go to putty

On putty, run command '''vi /etc/nxserver/client.id_dsa.key''' and copy the key (To copy, just select the key text on screen. The selected text gets copied on windows clipbord).

Press Alt + Tab to go '''General – Key Management window''' and paste it here.

Click &quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Ok&quot;.

7. Now type your login name '''testuser''' that you created on Linux machine and '''your password''' and click on Login button

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly Page}}

This page is going to discuss the differences between real mode and protected mode operations in the x86 processors. It will also discuss how to enter protected mode, and how to exit protected mode. Modern Operating Systems (Windows, Unix, Linux, BSD, etc...) all operate in protected mode, so most assembly language programmers won't need this information. However, this information will be particularly useful to people who are trying to program kernels or [[X86_Assembly/Bootloaders|bootloaders]].

== Real Mode Operation ==
{{Wikipedia|Real mode}}
When an x86 processor is powered up or reset, it is in real mode. In real mode, the x86 processor essentially acts like a very fast 8086. Only the base instruction set of the processor can be used. Real mode memory address space is limited to 1MiB of addressable memory, and each memory segment is limited to 64KiB. Real Mode is provided essentially for backwards-compatibility with 8086 and 80186 programs.

== Protected Mode Operation ==
{{Wikipedia|Protected mode}}
In protected mode operation, the x86 can address 16 Mb or 4 GB of address space. This may map directly onto the physical RAM (in which case, if there is less than 4 GB of RAM, some address space is unused), or paging may be used to arbitrarily translate between virtual addresses and physical addresses.
In Protected mode, the segments in memory can be assigned protection, and attempts to violate this protection cause a &quot;General Protection&quot; exception.

Protected mode in the 386, amongst other things, is controlled by the '''Control Registers''', which are labelled CR0, CR2, CR3, and CR4.

Protected mode in the 286 is controlled by the '''Machine Status Word'''.

== Long Mode ==
{{Wikipedia|Long mode}}
Long mode was introduced by AMD with the advent of the Athlon64 processor. Long mode allows the microprocessor to access 64-bit memory space, and access 64-bit long registers. Many 16 and 32-bit instructions do not work (or work correctly) in Long Mode. x86-64 processors in Real mode act exactly the like 16 bit chips, and x86-64 chips in protected mode act exactly like 32-bit processors. To unlock the 64-bit capabilities of the chip, the chip must be switched into Long Mode.

== Entering Protected Mode ==

The lowest 5 bits of the control register CR0 contain 5 flags that determine how the system is going to function. This status register has 1 flag that we are particularly interested in: the &quot;Protected Mode Enable&quot; flag (PE). Here are the general steps to entering protected mode:

#Create a Valid GDT ([[X86_Assembly/Global_Descriptor_Table|Global Descriptor Table]])
#Create a 6 byte pseudo-descriptor to point to the GDT
# 
##If [[X86_Assembly/Protected_Mode#Paging | paging]] is going to be used, load CR3 with a valid page table, PDBR, or PML4.
##If PAE (Physical Address Extension) is going to be used, set CR4.PAE = 1.
##If switching to long mode, set IA32_EFER.LME = 1.
#Disable Interrupts (CLI).
#Load an IDT pseudo-descriptor that has a null limit (this prevents the real mode IDT from being used in protected mode)
#Set the PE bit (and the PG bit if paging is going to be enabled) of the MSW or CR0 register
#Execute a far jump (in case of switching to long mode, even if the destination code segment is a 64-bit code segment, the offset must not exceed 32-bit since the far jump instruction is executed in compatibility mode)
#Load data segment registers with valid selector(s) to prevent GP exceptions when interrupts happen
#Load SS:(E)SP with a valid stack
#Load an IDT pseudo-descriptor that points to the IDT
#Enable Interrupts.

Following sections will talk more about these steps.

== Entering Long Mode ==

To enter Long Mode on a 64-bit x86 processor (x86-64):

#If paging is enabled, disable paging.
#If CR4.PAE is not already set, set it.
#Set IA32_EFER.LME = 1.
#Load CR3 with a valid PML4 table.
#Enable paging.
#At this point you will be in compatibility mode. A far jump may be executed to switch to long mode. However, the offset must not exceed 32-bit.

== Using the CR Registers ==

Many bits of the CR registers only influence behavior in protected mode.

=== CR0 ===

The CR0 32-bit register has 6 bits that are of interest to us. The low 5 bits of the CR0 register, and the highest bit. Here is a representation of CR0:

 CR0: |PG|----RESERVED----|NE|ET|TS|EM|MP|PE|


;PE: Bit 0. The Protected Environment flag.  This flag puts the system into protected mode when set.
;MP: Bit 1. The Monitor Coprocessor flag. This flag controls the operation of the &quot;WAIT&quot; instruction.
;EM: Bit 2. The Emulate flag. When this flag is set, coprocessor instructions will generate an exception.
;TS: Bit 3. The Task Switched flag. This flag is set automatically when the processor switches to a new task.
;ET: Bit 4. The Extension Type flag. ET (also called &quot;R&quot;) tells us which type of coprocessor is installed. If ET = 0, an 80287 is installed. if ET = 1, an 80387 is installed.
;NE: Bit 5. New exceptions. If this flag is clear, FPU exceptions arrive as interrupts. If set, as exceptions. 
;PG: Bit 31. The Paging flag. When this flag is set, memory paging is enabled. We will talk more about that in a second.

=== CR2 ===

CR2 contains a value called the '''Page Fault Linear Address''' (PFLA). When a page fault occurs, the address that access was attempted on is stored in CR2.

=== CR3 === 

The upper 20 bits of CR3 are called the '''Page Directory Base Register''' (PDBR). The PDBR holds the physical address of the page directory.

=== CR4 ===

CR4 contains several flags controlling advanced features of the processor.

== Paging ==

Paging is a special job that microprocessors can perform to make the available amount of memory in a system appear larger and more dynamic than it actually is. In a paging system, a certain amount of space may be laid aside on the hard drive (or on any secondary storage) called the '''swap file''' or '''swap partition'''. The '''virtual memory''' of the system is everything a program can access like memory, and includes physical RAM and the swap space.

The total virtual memory is broken down into chunks or '''pages''' of memory, each usually being 4096 bytes (although this number can be different on different systems). These pages can then be moved around throughout the virtual memory, and all pointers inside those pages will be automatically directed to point to the new locations by referencing them to a global paging directory that the microprocessor maintains. The pointer to the current paging directory is stored in the CR3 register.

A '''page fault''' occurs when the system attempts to read from a page that is marked as &quot;not present&quot; in the paging directory/table, when the system attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of a currently available page, or when any number of other errors occur in the paging system. When a page fault occurs, the accessed memory address is stored in the CR2 register.

== Other Modes ==

In addition to real, protected, and long modes, there are other modes that x86 processors can enter, for different uses :

* Virtual 8086 Mode: This is a mode in which application software that was written to run in real mode is executed under the supervision of a protected-mode, multi-tasking OS.

* System Management Mode: This mode enables the processor to perform system tasks, like power management, without disrupting the operating system or other software.</text>

The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is a table in memory that defines the processor's memory segments. The GDT sets the behavior of the segment registers and helps to ensure that protected mode operates smoothly.

== GDTR ==
The GDT is pointed to by a special register in the x86 chip, the '''GDT Register''', or simply the GDTR. The GDTR is 48 bits long. The lower 16 bits tell the size of the GDT, and the upper 32 bits tell the location of the GDT in memory. Here is a layout of the GDTR:

 |LIMIT|----BASE----|

LIMIT is the size of the GDT, and BASE is the starting address. LIMIT is 1 less than the length of the table, so if LIMIT has the value 15, then the GDT is 16 bytes long.

To load the GDTR, the instruction '''LGDT''' is used:

 lgdt [gdtr]

Where &lt;code&gt;gdtr&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer to 6 bytes of memory containing the desired GDTR value. Note that to complete the process of loading a new GDT, the segment registers need to be reloaded. The '''CS''' register must be loaded using a far jump:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
flush_gdt:
    lgdt [gdtr]
    jmp 0x08:complete_flush
 
complete_flush:
    mov ax, 0x10
    mov ds, ax
    mov es, ax
    mov fs, ax
    mov gs, ax
    mov ss, ax
    ret
&lt;/source&gt;

== GDT ==
{{Wikipedia|Global Descriptor Table}}
The GDT table contains a number of entries called '''Segment Descriptors'''. Each is 8 bytes long and contains information on the starting point of the segment, the length of the segment, and the access rights of the segment.

The following NASM-syntax code represents a single GDT entry:

 struc gdt_entry_struct
 
 	limit_low:   resb 2
 	base_low:    resb 2
 	base_middle: resb 1
 	access:      resb 1
 	granularity: resb 1
 	base_high:   resb 1
 
 endstruc

== LDT ==
{{Wikipedia|Local Descriptor Table}}
Each separate program will receive, from the operating system, a number of different memory segments for use. The characteristics of each local memory segment are stored in a data structure called the '''Local Descriptor Table''' (LDT). The GDT contains pointers to each LDT.</text>

==Liver anatomy==
The liver is divided anatomically into the left and right lobes, but surgically is divided into the left and right liver which does not correlate with the anatomic lobes.  The left and right liver contain four segments each. 
*The left part of the liver contains segments I to IV: 
**caudate lobe (I)
**lateral segment (II and III)
**medial segment (IV).  Division between lateral and medial segment is a line between the gallbladder and IVC, which is the same as dividing at the falciform ligament.  
*The right part of the liver consists of segments V to VIII: 
**anterior segment (V and VIII) 
**posterior segment (VI and VII).  The division between the anterior and posterior segments is the right hepatic vein.  The divison between the anterior segment from the left part of the liver ist he middle hepatic vein.  


==Child-Pugh Scoring==
The score employs five clinical measures of liver disease. Each measure is scored 1-3, with 3 indicating most severe derangement.

==Liver RT Tolerance==
Whole liver radiation tolerance is ~30 Gy, which is not sufficient for &quot;cure&quot; but is sufficient for palliation of painful disease. Partial liver tolerance depends on the volume irradiated. Partial liver dose escalation to 70+ Gy has been reported, and there does appear to be some dose-response relationship. Similarly, efforts are underway to explore the role of stereotactic radiosurgery, with single doses as high as 26 Gy reported.

==EBRT Whole Liver==
Given the low whole-liver tolerance (~30 Gy), whole liver RT has been used historically (prior to development of conformal therapy) for palliation of painful primary and metastatic liver disease. Up to 90% of patients may report improvement in pain control. Overall survival is short (~6 months), and not improved with RT. Several RTOG attempts at improving whole-liver RT efficacy have not shown much benefit (hyperfractionation, misonidazole radiosensitization, radiolabelled antiferritin and CEA antibodies).


Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Liver/Treatment/Whole_Liver_RT|Whole Liver RT]] section for literature review.

**Retrospective. 128 patients with inoperable primary liver CA; mean GTV 459 cm3, mean dose 53.6 Gy at average 4.9 Gy/fx
**Response: 55%, median survival 20 months
**Toxicity: RILD 15%, GI 8/125 patients
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Hypofractionated 3DCRT is effective in carefully selected patients with PLC. Gastrointestinal complications and RILD were the most distinct complications.&quot;

*'''Changhua Taiwan 1999-03''' PMID 15466827 -- ''Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients who had failed with or were unsuited for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.'' ('''2004 Liu''' MT, Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2004 Sep;34(9):532-9.)
**Retrospective. 44 patients treated with 3D-CRT after failed/unsuitable for TACE
**Response: 61%, median survival 15.2 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Although we do not know whether there is a survival benefit through the use of this treatment, 3DCRT seems to be a practical method of salvage for this subset of patients.&quot;

*'''Yonsei Korea''' 
**'''1994-00''' PMID 12957204 -- ''Clinical results of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy combined with transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma in the cirrhotic patients.'' ('''2003 Seong''' J, Hepatol Res. 2003 Sep;27(1):30-35.

***Prospective, phase I. 43 patients with unresectable intrahepatic hepatobiliary cancer (27 patients) and colorectal liver mets (16 patients). Large tumors (10x10x8). Median dose 58.5 Gy (1.5 BID) with concurrent FUdR.
***Escalated RT dose associated with improved OS and PFS. 
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The excellent response rate, prolonged intrahepatic control, and improved survival in patients treated with RT doses of 70 Gy or more motivate continuation of dose-escalation studies for patients with intrahepatic malignancies.&quot;
**'''1995''' PMID 7751185 -- ''The treatment of colorectal liver metastases with conformal radiation therapy and regional chemotherapy.'' (Robertson JM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 May 15;32(2):445-50.)
***Phase I/II. 22 patients with CRC mets, RT dose escalation + IAH FdUrd. RT given as 1.5-1.65 Gy/fx BID split-course to 48-72.6 Gy, depending on liver volume treated
***Response: 50% CR/PR; median survival 20 months. PR - 2 in-field failures, SD/PD - 5 in-field failures
***Toxicity: no clinical RILS
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Combined conformal radiation therapy and IAH FdUrd can produce an objective response in 50% of patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. However, response was not durable, and hepatic progression was frequent. Improvements in hepatic tumor control for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer may require higher doses of conformal radiation and/or improved radiosensitization. In an effort to increase radiosensitization, we have recently initiated a clinical trial combining IAH bromode-oxyuridine, a thymidine analog radiosensitizer, with conformal high dose radiation therapy.&quot;
**'''1993''' PMID 8391066 -- ''Treatment of primary hepatobiliary cancers with conformal radiation therapy and regional chemotherapy.'' (Robertson JM, J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jul;11(7):1286-93.)
***26 patients with non-met primary HB cancer (6 diffuse HCC, 11 localized HCC, 9 CCA) treated with conformal RT (48-72.6 Gy @ 1.5/1.65 Gy/fx BID) + intraarterial FdUrd (see 1991 Lawrence below)
***Toxicity: 2 patient radiation hepatitis, 7 patients &gt;= Grade III toxicity (5/7 whole liver RT)
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These findings suggest that three-dimensional planned focal liver radiation and IAH FdUrd can produce a high, durable response rate and an encouraging median survival duration in patients with nondiffuse, unresectable primary hepatobiliary cancer.&quot;
**'''1991''' PMID 1847363 -- ''Treatment of cancers involving the liver and porta hepatis with external beam irradiation and intraarterial hepatic fluorodeoxyuridine.'' (Lawrence TS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1991 Mar;20(3):555-61.)
***Phase I/II trial of RT (30 Gy total liver @ 1.5 Gy/fx BID + 15/30 Gy boost depending on DVH) + intraarterial FdUrd as radiosensitizer; 33 patients reported
***20 patients whole liver only, 6 patients 15 Gy boost, 7 patients 30 Gy boost
***Toxicity: GI but &lt;=Grade 2, 2 radiation hepatitis
***Response: 48% (14/29) had objective CT-scan response
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These data suggest that the treatment of intrahepatic malignancies can be guided by the concept of DVH analysis of the normal liver to allow the safe administration of doses of radiation that are potentially tumoricidal and are well above those that would be predicted to be tolerable for the whole liver.&quot;

*'''Yonsei Korea 1993-97''' PMID 10889387 -- ''Local radiotherapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients who failed with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.'' ('''2000 Seong''' J, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Jul 15;47(5):1331-5.)
**Prospective. 27 patients with unresectable HCC who failed TACE; mean tumor 7.2 cm, treated with conformal RT mean 51.8 Gy in 1.8 Gy/fx
**Response: 67% PR/CR, median survival 14 months from RT
**Toxicity: acute LFTs, thrombocytopenia, gastroduodenal ulcer/duodenitis
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In unresectable HCC patients who failed with TACE, local RT induced a substantial tumor response of 66.7%, with a 3-year survival rate of 21.4% and a median survival time of 14 months. Toxicity was significant but manageable. Although we do not know if there is survival benefit through this treatment, local RT in these patients seems to be valuable as a salvage for TACE-failed HCC.&quot;

*'''Taiwan 1993-96''' PMID 10530500 -- ''A pilot study of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.'' ('''1999 Cheng''' SH, J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 1999 Oct;14(10):1025-33.)
**Prospective. 13 patients (9 3D-CRT alone, 4 3D-CRT + TACE)
**Tumor median 15 cm (6-25cm); dose 40-60 Gy; PR 58%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our experience indicates that HCC is more radiosensitive than it was traditionally expected. Three-dimensional reconstruction of tumour and surrounding organs helps to avoid excessive exposure of the liver and adjacent organs to RT and makes it a safer treatment modality for unresectable HCC.&quot;

**A-P variation: individual 2.1-8.3 mm, group 4.1 mm

**Retrospective. 18 patients with 27 tumors. Pre-op CT or MRI imaging compared to gross path
**Median radiographic size 2.9cm, median pathologic size 2.5cm. Radiographic size greater in 81% tumors
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our study shows that in most instances (81%), imaging by CT or MRI overestimates true gross pathologic size of HCC. Nineteen percent of tumors appeared smaller on preoperative imaging than on the final pathologic specimen. Radiation therapy utilizing a 0.5 or 1.0 cm margin around the radiographic tumor would have encompassed the gross pathologic tumor in 93% and 100% of cases, respectively.&quot;

**15 patients initially planned with 3D-CRT, replanned with IMRT to maximize generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) and NTCP
**IMRT significantly increased max gEUD by 11 Gy (high grade), 18 Gy (low grade), and 10 Gy (nonoverlap)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;We have successfully used mathematical/biologic models directly as cost functions within the optimizing process to produce IMRT plans that maximize the gEUD while maintaining compliance with a well-defined protocol for the treatment of intrahepatic cancer. For both PTV-organ-at-risk overlap and nonoverlap situations, IMRT has the capacity to improve the maximal dose achievable across the PTV, expressed in terms of the gEUD. The use of multiple noncoplanar beams appears to confer an advantage over fewer beams in cases with PTV-organ-at-risk overlap. When liver toxicity is the dose-limiting factor, high gEUD values are obtained most frequently when the field arrangement is chosen to provide the shortest possible transhepatic path length.&quot;

**Retrospective. 12/68 HCC patients developed RILD, and replanned with IMRT 5F step-shoot

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;IMRT is capable of preserving acceptable target coverage and improving or at least maintaining the nonhepatic organ sparing for patients with HCC and previously diagnosed RILD after 3D-CRT.

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Radiotherapy using ABC for patients with intrahepatic cancer is feasible, with good intrafraction reproducibility of liver position using ABC. However, the interfraction reproducibility of organ position with ABC suggests the need for daily on-line imaging and repositioning if treatment margins smaller than those required for free breathing are a goal.&quot;

Interrupts are special routines that are defined on a per-system basis. This means that the interrupts on one system might be different from the interrupts on another system. Therefore, it is usually a bad idea to rely heavily on interrupts when you are writing code that needs to be portable.

== What is an Interrupt? ==
{{Wikipedia|Interrupt}}

In modern operating systems, the programmer often doesn't need to use interrupts. In Windows, for example, the programmer conducts business with the Win32 API. However, these API calls interface with the kernel, and the kernel will often trigger interrupts to perform different tasks. In older operating systems (specifically DOS), the programmer didn't have an API to use, and so they had to do all their work through interrupts.

== Interrupt Instruction ==
{{x86-inst-1|int}}

This instruction issues the specified interrupt. For instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
int 0x0A
&lt;/source&gt;

Calls interrupt 10 (0x0A (hex) = 10 (decimal)).

== Types of Interrupts ==
There are 3 types of interrupts: Hardware Interrupts, Software Interrupts and Exceptions.

=== Hardware Interrupts ===
Hardware interrupts are triggered by hardware devices. For instance, when you type on your keyboard, the keyboard triggers a hardware interrupt. The processor stops what it is doing, and executes the code that handles keyboard input (typically reading the key you pressed into a buffer in memory). Hardware interrupts are typically asynchronous - their occurrence is unrelated to the instructions being executed at the time they are raised.

=== Software Interrupts ===
There are also a series of software interrupts that are usually used to transfer control to a function in the operating system kernel. Software interrupts are triggered by the instruction '''int'''. For example, the instruction &quot;int 14h&quot; triggers interrupt 0x14. The processor then stops the current program, and jumps to the code to handle interrupt 14. When interrupt handling is complete, the processor returns flow to the original program.

=== Exceptions ===
Exceptions are caused by exceptional conditions in the code which is executing, for example an attempt to divide by zero or access a protected memory area. The processor will detect this problem, and transfer control to a handler to service the exception. This handler may re-execute the offending code after changing some value (for example, the zero dividend), or if this cannot be done, the program causing the exception may be terminated.

==External Beam==
Given the low whole-liver tolerance (~30 Gy), whole liver RT has been used historically (prior to development of conformal therapy) for palliation of painful primary and metastatic liver disease. Up to 90% of patients may report improvement in pain control. Overall survival is short (~6 months), and not improved with RT. Several RTOG attempts at improving whole-liver RT efficacy have not shown much benefit (hyperfractionation, misonidazole radiosensitization, radiolabelled antiferritin antibody).


*'''Meta-RTOG''' PMID 9612600 -- ''Survival results among patients with alpha-fetoprotein-positive, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis of three sequential treatments of the RTOG and Johns Hopkins Oncology Center.'' ('''1998 Abrams''' RA, Cancer J Sci Am. 1998 May-Jun;4(3):178-84.)
**Meta-analysis of 1) RTOG 83-19, 2) Hopkins pilot study, 3) RTOG 88-23 during 1983-1991
**Induction (EBRT 21.0 Gy at 3.0 Gy/fx) + radiosensitizing chemo, followed by 1) doxorubicin + 5-FU +/- 131-I-antiferritin, 2) intrahepatic artery cisplatin, or 3) intrahepatic artery cisplatin +/- 131-I-antiferritin, respectively.
**131-I-antiferritin: no improvement on survival, dramatic increase in hematologic toxicity
**Intrahepatic artery cisplatin: significantly better than doxorubicin/5-FU
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Patients with unresectable alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatocellular carcinoma experienced improved survival and decreased toxicity when managed with post-induction cycles of intra-arterial cisplatin as compared with intravenous doxorubicin and 5-FU. Intravenous 131I-polyclonal antiferritin did not improve survival when added to either post-induction regimen but dramatically increased hematologic toxicities.&quot;

('''1993 Russell''' AH, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Sep 1;27(1):117-23.)
**Phase I/II. Dose escalation 27 -&gt; 33 Gy in 1.5 Gy BID
**No patients at 30 Gy showed RILD, 10% patients at 33 Gy showed RILD (study closed)
**No impact on OS
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The study design could not credibly establish a safe dose for hepatic irradiation, however, it did succeed in determining that 33 Gy in fractions of 1.5 Gy is unsafe, carrying a substantial risk of delayed radiation injury. The absence of apparent late liver injury at the 27 Gy and 30 Gy dose levels suggests that a prior clinical trial of adjuvant hepatic irradiation in patients with resected colon cancer may have employed an insufficient radiation dose (21 Gy) to fully test the question.&quot;

**Prospective. HCC. Arms were 1) 135 patients (70% mets/recurrent) EBRT 21.0 Gy (3.0 Gy/fx) + low dose Adriamycin vs. 2) 59 patients (80% mets/recurrent) hyperfractionated EBRT 24.0 Gy (1.2 Gy/fx BID) + low dose Adriamycin
**Response: single fraction 22% vs. BID fraction 18% (p=NS)
**Toxicity: Esophagitis and thrombocytopenia significantly higher in BID arm
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Hyperfractionated radiation did not demonstrate a significant benefit over standard daily radiation, but acute toxicity appeared to be higher.&quot;

**Phase III. EBRT (whole liver to 21 Gy in 3 Gy/fx) +/- misonidazole. 187 patients
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The addition of misonidazole did not significantly improve the therapeutic response to radiation therapy in any of the parameters studied.&quot;

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Hyperfractionated external radiotherapy with concomitant 5-FUdR hepatic artery of 5-FU i.v. infusion therapy for liver metastases was well-tolerated, and both subjective and objective response and quality of survival were noted.&quot;

**Prospective, non-randomized. 109 patients with liver mets.
**RT: Single met: 30.4/19 +/- 20 Gy boost or 30/15 +/- 20 Gy boost; Multiple mets: 30/15 or 25.6/16 or 20/10 or 21/7

**90% had significant palliation of symptoms
**Median survival 4.5 months; median survival 9 months of excellent responders (38%) comparable to arterial CT

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The impression is that radiation therapy is valuable for the treatment of symptomatic liver metastases in the young patient who does not have a terminal condition.&quot;

==Radiolabeled antibodies==

In the chapter on [[x86 Assembly/X86 Interrupts|Interrupts]], we mentioned the fact that there are such a thing as software interrupts, and they can be installed by the system. This page will go more in-depth about that process, and will talk about how ISRs are installed, how the system finds the ISR, and how the processor actually performs an interrupt.

{{Wikipedia|Interrupt}}

== Interrupt Service Routines ==

The actual code that is invoked when an interrupt occurs is called the '''Interrupt Service Routine''' (ISR). When an exception occurs, a program invokes an interrupt, or the hardware raises an interrupt, the processor uses one of several methods (to be discussed) to transfer control to the ISR, whilst allowing the ISR to safely return control to whatever it interrupted after execution is complete. At minimum, FLAGS and CS:IP are saved and the ISR's CS:IP loaded; however, some mechanisms cause a full task switch to occur before the ISR begins (and another task switch when it ends).

== The Interrupt Vector Table ==

In the original 8086 processor (and all x86 processors in Real Mode), the '''Interrupt Vector Table''' controlled the flow into an ISR. The IVT started at memory address 0x00, and could go as high as 0x3FF, for a maximum number of 256 ISRs (ranging from interrupt 0 to 255). Each entry in the IVT contained 2 words of data: A value for IP and a value for CS (in that order). For example, let's say that we have the following interrupt:

 int 14h

When we trigger the interrupt, the processor goes to the 20th location in the IVT (14h = 20). Since each table entry is 4 bytes (2 bytes IP, 2 bytes CS), the microprocessor goes to location [4*14H]=[50H]. At location 50H is the new IP value, and at location 52H is the new CS value. Hardware and software interrupts are all be stored in the IVT, so installing a new ISR is as easy as writing a function pointer into the IVT. In newer x86 models, the IVT was replaced with the Interrupt Descriptor Table.

When interrupts occur in real mode, the FLAGS register is pushed onto the stack, followed by CS, then IP. The '''iret''' instruction restores CS:IP and FLAGS, allowing the interrupted program to continue unaffected. For hardware interrupts, all other registers (including the general-purpose registers) ''must'' be explicitly preserved (e.g. if an interrupt routine makes use of AX, it should push AX when it begins and pop AX when it ends). It is good practice for software interrupts to preserve all registers except those containing return values. More importantly, any registers that ''are'' modified must be documented.

== The Interrupt Descriptor Table ==
{{Wikipedia|Interrupt Descriptor Table}}
Since the 286 (but extended on the 386), interrupts may be managed by a table in memory called the '''Interrupt Descriptor Table''' (IDT). The IDT only comes into play when the processor is in protected mode. Much like the IVT, the IDT contains a listing of pointers to the ISR routine;, however, there are now three ways to invoke ISRs:

* Task Gates: These cause a task switch, allowing the ISR to run in its own context (with its own LDT, etc.). Note that IRET may still be used to return from the ISR, since the processor sets a bit in the ISR's task segment that causes IRET to perform a task switch to return to the previous task.
* Interrupt Gates: These are similar to the original interrupt mechanism, placing EFLAGS, CS and EIP on the stack. The ISR may be located in a segment of equal or higher privilege to the currently executing segment, but not of lower privilege (higher privileges are ''numerically lower'', with level 0 being the highest privilege).
* Trap Gates: These are identical to interrupt gates, except they do not clear the interrupt flag.


The following NASM structure represents an IDT entry:

 struc idt_entry_struct
 
 	base_low:  resb 2
 	sel:       resb 2
 	always0:   resb 1
 	flags:     resb 1
 	base_high: resb 2
 
 endstruc

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Field
! Interrupt Gate
! Trap Gate
! Task Gate
|- 
! base_low
| colspan=2 | Low word of entry address of ISR
| Unused
|-
! sel
| colspan=2 | Segment selector of ISR
| TSS descriptor
|-
! always0
| colspan=2 | Bits 5, 6, and 7 should be 0. Bits 0-4 are unused and can be left as zero.
| Unused, can be left as zero.
|-
! flags
| Low 5 bits are (MSB first): 01110, bits 5 and 6 form the DPL, bit 7 is the Present bit.
| Low 5 bits are (MSB first): 01111, bits 5 and 6 form the DPL, bit 7 is the Present bit.
| Low 5 bits are (MSB first): 00101, bits 5 and 6 form the DPL, bit 7 is the Present bit.
|-
! base_high
| colspan=2 | High word of entry address of ISR
| Unused
|-
|}

where:
* DPL is the Descriptor Privilege Level (0 to 3, with 0 being highest privilege)
* The Present bit indicates whether the segment is present in RAM. If this bit is 0, a '''Segment Not Present''' fault (Exception 11) will ensue if the interrupt is triggered.

These ISRs are usually installed and managed by the operating system. Only tasks with sufficient privilege to modify the IDT's contents may directly install ISRs.

The ISR itself must be placed in appropriate segments (and, if using task gates, the appropriate TSS must be set up), particularly so that the privilege is never lower than that of executing code. ISRs for unpredictable interrupts (such as hardware interrupts) should be placed in privilege level 0 (which is the highest privilege), so that this rule is not violated while a privilege-0 task is running.

Note that ISRs, particularly hardware-triggered ones, should ''always'' be present in memory unless there is a good reason for them not to be. Most hardware interrupts need to be dealt with promptly, and swapping causes significant delay. Also, some hardware ISRs (such as the hard disk ISR) might be ''required'' during the swapping process. Since hardware-triggered ISRs interrupt processes at unpredictable times, device driver programmers are encouraged to keep ISRs very short. Often an ISR simply organises for a kernel task to do the necessary work; this kernel task will be run at the next suitable opportunity. As a result of this, hardware-triggered ISRs are generally very small and little is gained by swapping them to the disk.

However, it may be desirable to set the present bit to 0, even though the ISR actually is present in RAM. The OS can use the Segment Not Present handler for some other function, for instance to monitor interrupt calls.

== IDT Register ==

The x86 contains a register whose job is to keep track of the IDT. This register is called the '''IDT Register''', or simply &quot;IDTR&quot;. the IDT register is 48 bits long. The lower 16 bits are called the LIMIT section of the IDTR, and the upper 32 bits are called the BASE section of the IDTR:

 |LIMIT|----BASE----|

The BASE is the base address of the IDT in memory. The IDT can be located anywhere in memory, so the BASE needs to point to it. The LIMIT field contains the current length of the IDT.

To load the IDTR, the instruction '''LIDT''' is used:

 lidt [idtr]

== Interrupt Instructions ==

{{x86-inst-1|int}}

calls the specified interrupt

{{x86-inst|into 0x04}} 

calls interrupt 4 if the overflow flag is set

{{x86-inst|iret}}

returns from an interrupt service routine (ISR).

=== Default ISR ===
A good programming practice is to provide a default ISR that can be used as placeholder for unused interrupts. This is to prevent execution of random code if an unrecognized interrupt is raised. The default ISR can be as simple as a single '''iret''' instruction.

Note, however, that under DOS (which is in real mode), certain IVT entries contain pointers to important, but not necessarily executable, locations. For instance, entry 0x1D is a far pointer to a video initialisation parameter table for video controllers, entry 0x1F is a pointer to the graphical character bitmap table.

== Disabling Interrupts ==

Sometimes it is important that a routine is not interrupted unexpectedly. For this reason, the x86 allows hardware interrupts to be disabled if necessary. This means the processor will ignore any interrupt signal it receives from the interrupt controller. Usually the controller will simply keep waiting until the processor accepts the interrupt signal, so the interrupts are delayed rather than rejected.

The x86 has an ''interrupt flag'' (IF) in the FLAGS register. When this flag is set to 0, hardware interrupts are disabled, otherwise they are enabled. The command '''cli''' sets this flag to 0, and '''sti''' sets it to 1. Instructions that load values into the FLAGS register (such as '''popf''' and '''iret''') may also modify this flag.

Note that this flag does not affect the '''int''' instruction or processor exceptions; only hardware-generated interrupts. Also note that in protected mode, code running with less privilege than IOPL will generate an exception if it uses '''cli''' or '''sti'''. This means that the operating system can disallow &quot;user&quot; programs from disabling interrupts and thus gaining control of the system.

Interrupts are automatically disabled when an interrupt handler begins; this ensures the handler will not be interrupted (unless it issues '''sti'''). Software such as device drivers might require precise timing and for this reason should not be interrupted. This can also help avoid problems if the same interrupt occurs twice in a short space of time. Note that the '''iret''' instruction restores the state of FLAGS before the interrupt handler began, thus allowing further interrupts to occur after the interrupt handler is complete.

Interrupts should also be disabled when performing certain system tasks, such as when entering protected mode. This consists of performing several steps, and if the processor tried to invoke an interrupt handler before this process was complete, it would be in danger of causing an exception, executing invalid code, trashing memory, or causing some other problem.</text>

==What are Variables?==
TI-Basic is unusual among programming languages in that it does not support actual variables. Instead, all data are treated like files; there is no distinction between an ordinary number and an image, for example. TI refers to all files as &quot;variables;&quot; henceforth &quot;variable&quot; will refer to a file usable by a program.
&quot;Variables&quot; are the meat of any programming language - they are used to store and work with data. With variables, the outcomes of programs can differ depending on the user's input or the purpose of the program.  Variables in the TI calculators can store different types of data, whether it be numbers, lists of numbers, strings, mathematical functions, etc.  However, each data type has its own type of variable that it can be stored in and the rules must be followed fairly strictly.

==Storing and Recalling Variables==
Variables can be stored and recalled at the Homescreen (the startup screen), or within a program by simply using that variables name.  For example, to recall the variable X at the Homescreen, one would simply type X and hit enter (which would display 10 if X was ten):
{{bcode:FOutput|
X
              10
}}
or to recall Str1:
{{bcode:FOutput|
Str1
      HELLO WORLD
}}
The format to recall any variable is the same.

To store a value to a variable, you simply state the value you are trying to store, hit the store key (it looks like &quot;STO›&quot;), then the variable you are storing to, and then hit enter.  For example, making X equal to 52.5 would be as follows:

{{bcode:FOutput|
52.5→X
            52.5
}}

It should be noted that 52.5 was displayed after hitting enter on the homescreen.  This is because it also recalled the value of the variable after storing it.  In programming, the variable isn't actually recalled, but rather the variable in used in some sort of equation.  See the individual examples for more help.

==Types of Basic Variables==
There are many types of variables, but in this chapter, only the most common ones will be dealt with.  The [[Programming:TI-Basic:Advanced Variables|Advanced Variables]] section, will deal with the more complex variable types and uses.  The following sections will deal with:
*Real Numbers (i.e. 52.5)
*Lists (1,2,3,4,5)
*Strings (&quot;APPLES&quot;)

----
===Real Numbers===
For easability in this section/chapter, it should be noted that the variables 'A' through 'Z' and the variable theta are considered to be Real Number Variables.

Real number variables store both an integer and decimal part of a number.  Examples of real numbers are 0, 2.1, 5, 7.212 or 3.1415926.  Reals are accurate up to eight significant digits and can be in the range of -9e99 to 9e99 (that is 9*10^99).  If an attempt is tried to exceed this limit the calculator returns an error.
====Syntax====
To store a number to a Real Variable, the syntax is as follows:
{{bcode:Syntax|
''value''→''variable''
|
*Where ''value'' is a literal value, a variable, or an expression and
*Where ''variable'' is the variable to store ''value'' to
**Can be 'A' through 'Z' or theta.
***The variables are accessed by pressing the green ALPHA key, then finding the corresponding green character key on the keypad.
}}

====Ex: Literals====
{{bcode:Example|
5.32→X
}}
====Ex: Variable====
{{bcode:Example|
A→X
}}
====Ex: Equation====
{{bcode:Example|
10/2+36+89/A→X
}}&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Note:  In this example, if A was 89, X would be 42, not the actual equation.  Only the result of an equation is stored to X (the equation is 5+36+89/89 = 42, so X is 42)&lt;/small&gt;
----

===Lists===
For easability in this section/chapter, all lists will be considered as Real Number Lists.

Lists are basically what they sound like - lists of numbers.  They are considered by some to be the same as an array.  They store a series of numbers which are the same datatype (for this section we will assume that it is a Real Number List).  The individual numbers of a list are named elements.

====Syntax====
{{bcode:Syntax|
{''value1'',''value2'',...,''valueN''}→''listName''
|
*Where ''value1'',''value2'' through ''valueN' are real number elements
**The number of elements (values) in a list is only limited by the memory of the calculator
**The minimum number of elements a list can contain is 0.
*Where ''listName'' is the name of a list.  This can be one of two types:
**Calculator defined:  L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,L6
**User defined:  a calculator 'L' (found via the list menu) followed by characters denoting the name
*The amount of elements in a list may not exceed 999.
}}

====Ex: Literals====
{{bcode:Example|
{15,20,30}→L1
}}

====Ex: Custom Named list====
{{bcode:Example|
{1,2,3,4,5}→&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;MYLIST
}}

====Ex: List to List====
{{bcode:Example|
L1→L2
}}
====Ex: Equations====
{{bcode:Example|
{15,20,30}+5→L1
}}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*Note:&lt;/nowiki&gt;  In this example, L1 would consist of {20,25,35} because each element was increased by five then stored to L1&lt;/small&gt;

----

===Strings===

====Syntax====
{{bcode:Syntax|
''string''→''strN''
|
*Where ''string'' is the string literal, or some other form of string to store to ''strN'' and
*Where ''strN'' is one of the predefined strings for the calculator.  These are Str1, Str2, Str3, Str4, Str5, Str6, Str7, Str8, Str9 and Str0
}}

====Ex: Literals====
{{bcode:Example|
&quot;MY NAME IS BOB&quot;→Str1
}}
====Ex: Str to Str====
{{bcode:Example|
St1→Str2
}}
====Ex: Concatenation/Combination====
{{bcode:Example|
&quot;MY NAME IS &quot;+St1+&quot; AND YOU KNOW IT!&quot;→Str2
}}

The string variables can be accessed by pushing [VARS], selecting ''Strings'', then choosing the desired string variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to prepare Word files before import ==

In many cases it is advisable to prepare Word files, in order to avoid a number of well-known problems. The following is a little check-list that can be used as a guideline. 
(This list is based on material from one of the excellent courses run by Judy Ann Schoen [http://www.edv-und-seminare.de])

* Accept all changes and switch off track-changes mode. 
* Delete all comments. 
* Remove embedded graphics, logos, icons etc. from headers and footers. 
* Delete graphics and text fields that are located close to the document edge. 
* Remove inline graphics using the macro ImagesOutIn by Miri Ofek (available from the yahoogroups website of the dejavu-l list: [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dejavu-l/files/])
* Watch out for spaces with different formatting than the rest of the text. They can lead to excessive codes in the DV project. 
* Switch off the auto-recognition of the language. 
* In severe cases, where the Word document won't import or export or when there is an excessive number of codes, try to save as RTF or open and save using OpenOffice. 
* In hopeless cases, save the Word doc as plain text (*.txt) and apply the formatting manually (and cleanly) after translation. 
* Switch off the syllable division. 
* Remove nested groupings.

{{Wikipedia|Bootloader}}
When a computer is turned on, there is some beeping, and some flashing lights, and then a loading screen appears. And then magically, the operating system loads into memory. The question is then raised, how does the operating system load up? What gets the ball rolling? The answer is '''bootloaders'''.

== What is a Bootloader? ==

Bootloaders are small pieces of software that play a role in getting an operating system loaded and ready for execution when a computer is turned on. The way this happens varies between different computer designs (early computers required a person to manually set the computer up whenever it was turned on), and often there are several stages in the process of boot loading.

It's crucial to understand that the term &quot;bootloader&quot; is simply a classification of software (and sometimes a blurry one). To the processor, a bootloader is just another piece of code that it blindly executes. There are many different kinds of boot loaders. Some are small, others are large; some follow very simple rules while others show fancy screens and give the user a selection to choose from.

On IBM PC compatibles, the first program to load is the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). The BIOS performs many tests and initialisations, and if everything is OK, the BIOS's boot loader begins. Its purpose is to load another boot loader! It selects a disk (or some other storage media) from which it loads a secondary boot loader.

In some cases, ''this'' boot loader loads enough of an operating system to start running it. In other cases, it loads yet another boot loader from somewhere else. This often happens when multiple operating systems are installed on a single computer; each OS may have its own specific bootloader, with a &quot;central&quot; bootloader that loads one of the specific ones according to the user's selection.

Most bootloaders are written exclusively in assembly language (or even machine code), because they need to be compact, they don't have access to OS routines (such as memory allocation) that other languages might require, they need to follow some unusual requirements, and they make frequent use of low-level features. However some bootloaders, particularly those that have many features and allow user input, are quite heavyweight. These are often written in a combination of assembly and C. The [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/ GRand Unified Bootloader] (GRUB) is an example of such.

Some boot loaders are highly OS-specific, while others are less so - certainly the BIOS boot loader is not OS-specific. The MS-DOS boot loader (which was placed on ''all'' MS-DOS formatted floppy disks) simply checks if the files '''IO.SYS''' and '''MSDOS.SYS''' exist; if they are not present it displays the error &quot;Non-System disk or disk error&quot; otherwise it loads and begins execution of '''IO.SYS'''.

The final stage boot loader may be expected (by the OS) to prepare the computer in some way, for instance by placing the processor in protected mode and programming the interrupt controller. While it would be possible to do these things inside the OS's initialisation procedure, moving them into the bootloader can simplify the OS design. Some operating systems require their bootloader to set up a small, basic GDT ([[X86_Assembly/Global_Descriptor_Table|Global Descriptor Table]]) and enter protected mode, in order to remove the need for the OS to have any 16-bit code. However, the OS might replace this with its own sophisticated GDT soon after.

== The Bootsector ==

The first 512 bytes of a disk are known as the '''bootsector''' or '''Master Boot Record'''. The boot sector is an area of the disk reserved for booting purposes. If the bootsector of a disk contains a valid boot sector (the last word of the sector must contain the signature 0xAA55), then the disk is treated by the BIOS as bootable.

== The Boot Process ==

When switched on or reset, an x86 processor begins executing the instructions it finds at address FFFF:0000 (at this stage it is operating in '''Real Mode'''). In IBM PC compatible processors, this address is mapped to a ROM chip that contains the computer's Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) code. The BIOS is responsible for many tests and initialisations; for instance the BIOS may perform a memory test, initialise the interrupt controller and system timer, and test that these devices are working.

Eventually the actual boot loading begins. First the BIOS searches for and initialises available storage media (such as floppy drives, hard disks, CD drives), then it decides which of these it will attempt to boot from. It checks each device for availability (e.g. ensuring a floppy drive contains a disk), then the 0xAA55 signature, in some predefined order (often the order is configurable using the BIOS setup tool). It loads the first sector of the first bootable device it comes across into RAM, and initiates execution.

Ideally, this will be another boot loader, and it will continue the job, making a few preparations, then passing control to something else.

While BIOSes remain compatible with 20-year-old software, they have also become more sophisticated over time. Early BIOSes could not boot from CD drives, but now CD and even DVD booting are standard BIOS features. Booting from USB storage devices is also possible, and some systems can boot from over the network. To achieve such advanced functioning, BIOSes sometimes enter protected mode and the like, but then return to real mode in order to be compatible with legacy boot loaders. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: bootloaders are written to work with the ubiquitous BIOS, and BIOSes are written to support all those bootloaders, preventing much in the way of new boot loading features.

However, a new bootstrap technology, the [[w:Extensible_Firmware_Interface|EFI]], is beginning to gain momentum. It is much more sophisticated and will not be discussed in this article.

Note also that other computer systems - even some that use x86 processors - may boot in different ways. Indeed, some embedded systems whose software is compact enough to be stored on ROM chips may not need bootloaders at all.

== Technical Details ==

A bootloader runs under certain conditions that the programmer must appreciate in order to make a successful bootloader. The following pertains to bootloaders initiated by the PC BIOS:

#The first sector of a drive contains its boot loader.
#One sector is 512 bytes — the last two bytes of which ''must'' be 0xAA55 (i.e. 0x55 followed by 0xAA), or else the BIOS will treat the drive as unbootable.
#If everything is in order, said first sector will be placed at RAM address 0000:7C00, and the BIOS's role is over as it transfers control to 0000:7C00 (that is, it JMPs to that address).
#The DL register will contain the drive number that is being booted from, useful if you want to read more data from elsewhere on the drive.
#The BIOS leaves behind a lot of code, both to handle hardware interrupts (such as a keypress) and to provide services to the bootloader and OS (such as keyboard input, disk read, and writing to the screen). You must understand the purpose of the Interrupt Vector Table (IVT), and be careful not to interfere with the parts of the BIOS that you depend on. Most operating systems replace the BIOS code with their own code, but the boot loader can't use anything but its own code and what the BIOS provides. Useful BIOS serve include &lt;code&gt;int 10h&lt;/code&gt; (for displaying text/graphics), &lt;code&gt;int 13h&lt;/code&gt; (disk functions) and &lt;code&gt;int 16h&lt;/code&gt; (keyboard input).
#This means that any code or data that the boot loader needs must either be included in the first sector (be careful not to accidentally execute data) or manually loaded from another sector of the disk to somewhere in RAM. Because the OS is not running yet, most of the RAM will be unused. However, you must take care not to interfere with the RAM that is required by the BIOS interrupt handlers and services mentioned above.
#The OS code itself (or the next bootloader) will need to be loaded into RAM as well.
#The BIOS places the stack pointer 512 bytes beyond the end of the boot sector, meaning that the stack cannot exceed 512 bytes. It may be necessary to move the stack to a larger area.
#There are some conventions that need to be respected if the disk is to be readable under mainstream operating systems. For instance you may wish to include a [[w:BIOS Parameter Block|BIOS Parameter Block]] on a floppy disk to render the disk readable under most PC operating systems.

Most assemblers will have a command or directive similar to &lt;code&gt;ORG 7C00h&lt;/code&gt; that informs the assembler that the code will be loaded starting at offset 7C00h. The assembler will take this into account when calculating instruction and data addresses. If you leave this out, the assembler assumes the code is loaded at address 0 and this must be compensated for manually in the code.

Usually, the bootloader will load the kernel into memory, and then jump to the kernel. The kernel will then be able to reclaim the memory used by the bootloader (because it has already performed its job). However it is possible to include OS code within the boot sector and keep it resident after the OS begins.

Here is a simple bootloader demo designed for NASM:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
         org 7C00h
 
         jmp short Start ;Jump over the data (the 'short' keyword makes the jmp instruction smaller)
 
 Msg:    db &quot;Hello World! &quot;
 EndMsg:
 
 Start:  mov bx, 000Fh   ;Page 0, colour attribute 15 (white) for the int 10 calls below
         mov cx, 1       ;We will want to write 1 character
         xor dx, dx      ;Start at top left corner
         mov ds, dx      ;Ensure ds = 0 (to let us load the message)
         cld             ;Ensure direction flag is cleared (for LODSB)
 
 Print:  mov si, Msg     ;Loads the address of the first byte of the message, 7C02h in this case
 
                         ;PC BIOS Interrupt 10 Subfunction 2 - Set cursor position
                         ;AH = 2
 Char:   mov ah, 2       ;BH = page, DH = row, DL = column
         int 10h
         lodsb           ;Load a byte of the message into AL.
                         ;Remember that DS is 0 and SI holds the
                         ;offset of one of the bytes of the message.
 
                         ;PC BIOS Interrupt 10 Subfunction 9 - Write character and colour
                         ;AH = 9
         mov ah, 9       ;BH = page, AL = character, BL = attribute, CX = character count
         int 10h
 
         inc dl          ;Advance cursor
 
         cmp dl, 80      ;Wrap around edge of screen if necessary
         jne Skip
         xor dl, dl
         inc dh

To compile the above file, suppose it is called 'floppy.asm', you can use following command:
 nasm -f bin -o floppy.img floppy.asm
While strictly speaking this is not a bootloader, it is bootable, and demonstrates several things:
*How to include and access data in the boot sector
*How to skip over included data (this is required for a BIOS Parameter Block)
*How to place the 0xAA55 signature at the end of the sector (NASM will issue an error if there is too much code to fit in a sector)
*The use of BIOS interrupts

On Linux, you can issue a command like
 cat floppy.img &gt; /dev/fd0
to write the image to the floppy disk (the image may be smaller than the size of the disk in which case only as much information as is in the image will be written to the disk). Under Windows you can use software such as RAWRITE.

== Hard disks ==

{{Wikipedia|Master boot record}}
Hard disks usually add an extra layer to this process, since they may be partitioned. The first sector of a hard disk is known as the Master Boot Record (MBR). Conventionally, the partition information for a hard disk is included at the end of the MBR, just before the 0xAA55 signature.

The role of the BIOS is no different to before: to read the first sector of the disk (that is, the MBR) into RAM, and transfer execution to the first byte of this sector. The BIOS is oblivious to partitioning schemes - all it checks for is the presence of the 0xAA55 signature.

While this means that one can use the MBR in any way one would like (for instance, omit or extend the partition table) this is seldom done. Despite the fact that the partition table design is very old and limited - it is limited to four partitions - virtually all operating systems for IBM PC compatibles assume that the MBR will be formatted like this. Therefore to break with convention is to render your disk inoperable except to operating systems specifically designed to use it.

In practice, the MBR usually contains a boot loader whose purpose is to load another boot loader - to be found at the start of one of the partitions. This is often a very simple program which finds the first partition marked ''Active'', loads its first sector into RAM, and commences its execution. Since by convention the new boot loader is also loaded to address 7C00h, the old loader may need to relocate all or part of itself to a different location before doing this. Also, ES:SI is expected to contain the address in RAM of the partition table, and DL the boot drive number. Breaking such conventions may render a bootloader incompatible with other bootloaders.

However, many boot managers (software that enables the user to select a partition, and sometimes even kernel, to boot from) use custom MBR code which loads the remainder of the boot manager code from somewhere on disk, then provides the user with options on how to continue the bootstrap process. It is also possible for the boot manager to reside within a partition, in which case it must first be loaded by another boot loader.

Most boot managers support chain loading (that is, starting another boot loader via the usual first-sector-of-partition-to-address-7C00 process) and this is often used for systems such as DOS and Windows. However, some boot managers (notably GRUB) support the loading of a user-selected kernel image. This can be used with systems such as GNU/Linux and Solaris, allowing more flexibility in starting the system. The mechanism may differ somewhat from that of chain loading.

Clearly, the partition table presents a chicken-and-egg problem that is placing unreasonable limitations on partitioning schemes. One solution gaining momentum is the [[w:GUID Partition Table|GUID Partition Table]]; it uses a dummy MBR partition table so that legacy operating systems will not interfere with the GPT, while newer operating systems can take advantage of the many improvements offered by the system.

== GNU GRUB ==

The [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/ GRand Unified Bootloader] supports the flexible [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/html_node/index.html ''multiboot''] boot protocol. This protocol aims to simplify the boot process by providing a single, flexible protocol for booting a variety of operating systems. Many free operating systems can be booted using multiboot.

GRUB is extremely powerful and is practically a small operating system. It can read various file systems and thus lets you specify a kernel image ''by filename'' as well as separate module files that the kernel may make use of. Command-line arguments can be passed to the kernel as well - this is a nice way of starting an OS in maintenance mode, or &quot;safe mode&quot;, or with VGA graphics, and so on. GRUB can provide a menu for the user to select from as well as allowing custom loading parameters to be entered.

Obviously this functionality cannot possibly be provided in 512 bytes of code. This is why GRUB is split into two or three &quot;stages&quot;:
*Stage 1 - this is a 512-byte block that has the location of stage 1.5 or stage 2 hardcoded into it. It loads the next stage.
*Stage 1.5 - an optional stage which understands the filesystem (e.g. FAT32 or ext3) where stage 2 resides. It will find out where stage 2 is located and load it. This stage is quite small and is located in a fixed area, often just after Stage 1.
*Stage 2 - this is a much larger image that has all the GRUB functionality.

Note that Stage 1 may be installed to the Master Boot Record of a hard disk, or may be installed in one of the partitions and chainloaded by another boot loader.

Windows can not be loaded using multiboot, but the Windows bootloader (like those of other non-multiboot operating systems) can be chainloaded from GRUB, which isn't quite as good, but does let you boot such systems.

== Example of a Boot Loader ‒ Linux Kernel v0.01==

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
SYSSIZE=0x8000
|
|	boot.s
|
| boot.s is loaded at 0x7c00 by the bios-startup routines, and moves itself
| out of the way to address 0x90000, and jumps there.
|
| It then loads the system at 0x10000, using BIOS interrupts. Thereafter
| it disables all interrupts, moves the system down to 0x0000, changes
| to protected mode, and calls the start of system. System then must
| RE-initialize the protected mode in it's own tables, and enable
| interrupts as needed.
|
| NOTE! currently system is at most 8*65536 bytes long. This should be no
| problem, even in the future. I want to keep it simple. This 512 kB
| kernel size should be enough - in fact more would mean we'd have to move
| not just these start-up routines, but also do something about the cache-
| memory (block IO devices). The area left over in the lower 640 kB is meant
| for these. No other memory is assumed to be &quot;physical&quot;, i.e. all memory
| over 1Mb is demand-paging. All addresses under 1Mb are guaranteed to match
| their physical addresses.
|
| NOTE1 above is no longer valid in it's entirety. cache-memory is allocated
| above the 1Mb mark as well as below. Otherwise it is mainly correct.
|
| NOTE 2! The boot disk type must be set at compile-time, by setting
| the following equ. Having the boot-up procedure hunt for the right
| disk type is severe brain-damage.
| The loader has been made as simple as possible (had to, to get it
| in 512 bytes with the code to move to protected mode), and continuous
| read errors will result in a unbreakable loop. Reboot by hand. It
| loads pretty fast by getting whole sectors at a time whenever possible.

| 1.44Mb disks:
sectors = 18
| 1.2Mb disks:
| sectors = 15
| 720kB disks:

|

== Testing the Bootloader ==

Perhaps the easiest way to test a bootloader is inside a virtual machine, like VirtualBox or VMware.&lt;ref&gt;

== Why Learn Assembly? ==

Assembly is among some of the oldest tools in a computer-programmer's toolbox. Entire software projects can be written without ever looking at a single line of assembly code. So the question arises: why learn assembly? Assembly language is one of the closest forms of communication that humans can engage in with a computer. With assembly, the programmer can precisely track the flow of data and execution in a program in a mostly human-readable form. Once a program has been compiled, it is difficult (and at times, nearly impossible) to reverse-engineer the code into its original form. As a result, if you wish to examine a program that is already compiled but would rather not stare at hexadecimal or binary, you will need to examine it in assembly language. Since debuggers will frequently only show program code in assembly language, this provides one of many benefits for learning the language.

Assembly language is also the preferred tool, if not the only tool, for implementing some low-level tasks, such as bootloaders and low-level kernel components. Code written in assembly has less overhead than code written in high-level languages, so assembly code frequently will run much faster than equivalent programs written in other languages. Also, code that is written in a high-level language can be compiled into assembly and &quot;hand optimized&quot; to squeeze every last bit of speed out of it. As hardware manufacturers such as Intel and AMD add new features and new instructions to their processors, often times the only way to access those features is to use assembly routines. That is, at least until the major compiler vendors add support for those features.

Developing a program in assembly can be a very time consuming process, however. While it might not be a good idea to write new projects in assembly language, it is certainly valuable to know a little bit about it.

== Who is This Book For? ==

This book will serve as an introduction to assembly language and a good resource for people who already know about the topic, but need some more information on x86 system architecture. It will also describe some of the more advanced uses of x86 assembly language. All readers are encouraged to read (and contribute to) this book, although prior knowledge of programming fundamentals would definitely be beneficial.

== How is This Book Organized? ==

The first section will discuss the x86 family of chips and introduce the basic instruction set. The second section will explain the differences between the syntax of different assemblers. The third section will go over some of the additional instruction sets available, including the floating point, MMX, and SSE operations.

The fourth section will cover some advanced topics in x86 assembly, including some low-level programming tasks such as writing bootloaders. There are many tasks that cannot be easily implemented in a higher-level language such as C or C++. For example, enabling and disabling interrupts, enabling protected mode, accessing the Control Registers, creating a Global Descriptor Table, and other tasks all need to be handled in assembly. The fourth section will also deal with interfacing assembly language with C and other high-level languages. Once a function is written in assembly (a function to enable protected mode, for instance), we can interface that function to a larger, C-based (or even C++ based) kernel. The fifth section will discuss the standard x86 chipset, cover the basic x86 computer architecture, and generally deal with the hardware side of things. 

The current layout of the book is designed to give readers as much information as they need without going overboard. Readers who want to learn assembly language on a given assembler only need to read the first section and the chapter in the second section that directly relates to their assembler. Programmers looking to implement the MMX or SSE instructions for different algorithms only really need to read section 3. Programmers looking to implement bootloaders, kernels, or other low-level tasks, can read section 4. People who really want to get to the nitty-gritty of the x86 hardware design can continue reading on through section 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''ionic wind thruster''' is a booster based on ionizing air to create thrust.  These thrusters work by adding an electron to a particle of air so that the air is forced away from a the negatively charged grid.  This produces a level of thrust T=mv, with ''T'' being thrust, ''m'' being the mass of the air, and ''v'' being the velocity of the air.

A common science fair project may be using a charged grid to 'levitate' an object several decimeters above a surface; more interesting applications may include levitating the hull of a car and building something more akin to [[w:Luke Skywalker|Luke Skywalker's]] speeder or a hoverboard as seen in Back to the Future 2.

The basic design involves using a 555 timer to repeatedly and rapidly pulse a high voltage, low current electrical charge through a grid of wire.  Typical values would be 30,000V at 0.001A, or 30kV at 1mA.  This is typically enough power to levitate a small grid on its own; however, the grid can be combined with a light-weight plastic skirt or cone to better control the thrust angle and create backpressure.  The function of such a cone would be to prevent air from going out sideways, which decreases the amount of thrust in the direction we want; however, too much backpressure will also overpower the total thrust of the system and negate the effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''railgun''' is a form of electromagnetic weaponry that works on Lorentz forces, magnetic fields created by running power through metal rails connected by a metal projectile.  Commonly, video games use [[Do-It-Yourself/Gauss gun|gauss gun]]s and call them railguns, for example Quake 2 and 3.  Wikipedia has an [[w:Railgun|article on railguns]].

[[Image:Railgun-1.png|thumb|340px|Schematic diagram of a railgun]]
As stated, railguns utilize an electromagnetic force called the Lorentz force to propel an electrically conductive projectile that is initially part of the current path.  The current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field between them and through the projectile perpendicularly to the current in the rail.  In short, the rails and the projectile push away from each other, and you wind up throwing a hunk of metal away from wherever the battery is connected.

Railguns have an inherent problem with the amount of power driving the projectile; the rails are forced apart, electrical arcing occurs, and the rails are partially vaporized.  Because of this, most railguns can only be fired once before the rails need to be replaced.  Our model will be a simple, low-power model designed to throw a projectile, but not do anything particularly spectacular like vaporize a car on impact.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A '''Gauss Gun''' or '''Coil Gun''' is a gun that works by using a coil of wire to generate an electromagnetic field used to laterally accelerate a metallic projectile; the projectile becomes the core of a solenoid, but being loose it leaves the barrel after being fired.

Gauss guns come in varied designs, some of which can fire nails or BBs through cardboard; while others make viable hunting rifles suitable for penetrating a deer's skull.  Unlike [[Do-It-Yourself/Railgun|railgun]]s, gauss guns can typically be put to practical use in a hobbyist environment; '''''both should be treated as deadly weapons'''''.  Please note that with many of the designs here, '''''you can kill someone'''''; treat these projectile weapons with the care you would give to a store-bought firearm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have a problem with the text concerning ancient Roman housing:
&quot;but normal houses were much smaller and regular-looking,&quot;
By &quot;normal&quot; houses, do you mean that of the average citizen? What was &quot;normal&quot; in ancient Rome? And what is &quot;regular-looking&quot;?  Regular to who?  What's regular to me may not be &quot;regular&quot; to someone living in India.
I would not consider this text comparable to any high school textbook we have in our schools.  The writing is of poor quality. Sorry, but I would definitely discourage my students from using this information.

== What did they believe (Romans in Ancient Civilizations) ==

There are so many spelling and grammar errors in this section that I am appalled &amp; vow never to let my students use a WikiText for research - ever!  This is the problem when anyone can write anything on the web and call it valid information.  I don't know if the facts here are correct because the person's writing is incomprehensible.  Our students deserve better than this.

== Correct Latin Pronoucation ==

Technically, Julius Caesar's name would be pronounced &quot;You-lee-us Ki-sir&quot; The &quot;I&quot; was pronounced as a &quot;y&quot; (later the y became &quot;j&quot; in the middle ages&quot;, and all &quot;c&quot; were prononced as hard, i.e. as &quot;k&quot;s, not like &quot;ch&quot; in teh current book. 

Please change, or if someone would like to argue. :)

This is a great module. It seems complete and is easy to read and follow. Thanks for contributing this module to Wikibooks and Wikijunior. I think kids will find this very fun and interesting. [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 03:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

== Image replacement ==

I just replaced the image for the geographic context of the Empire. The previous image was ''far'' too detailed (in my opinion) for the book's target audience: 8-12 year olds. It might appear to the reader that the three Prefectures other than Italy were not part the Empire, or cause some other confusion. The new image is a single color, and should be much easier to comprehend. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 01:19, 5 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this module we will introduce the concept of the spanning tree, the minimum spanning tree, and some methods of finding minimum spanning trees.

Firstly, we must say what we mean by a tree.  A tree is a graph where there is exactly one path between any pair of vertices.  This means that a tree is connected, i.e. there exists at least one path between each pair of points.

A tree is the most efficient way of connecting a set of vertices, in the sense that if we have a tree then every edge is necessary, as if we remove any edge, then the graph is no longer connected.  Also all trees on a graph with n vertices have exactly n - 1 edges.

If we have a connected graph G then another graph H is a spanning tree of G, if it is a tree with the same vertices as G, and all the edges of H are edges of G.

Finally, we will introduce the concept of a minimum spanning tree.  For this to make sense, we must consider graphs called networks.  A network is a graph where each edge has a weight.  The weight can be the length of the edge, or the distance between the two points, or it could represent the difficulty of going between the points, or the cost.  In any case, the weight is a number.  It will usually be positive (or non-negative, with zero a possibility), but the maths is the same if we allow negative numbers.  As it is each edge of the graph that will be assigned a distance, rather than the pairs of vertices themselves, no distance is assigned for pairs of vertices not joined by an edge.  

Given a graph G with distances assigned to its edges, then a minimum spanning tree, H, is a spanning tree of G, where the sum of the weights of the edges are the lowest possible.  There may be more than one minimum spanning tree.  For a trivial example, any spanning tree of a graph G, with all weights 1, will be a minimum spanning tree, with the relevant sum equal to n-1, where n is the number of vertices of the original graph.

==Kruskal's algorithm==

Krustal's algorithm is one way of finding a minimum spanning tree for a network G.  We start with  a graph H consisting of all the vertices of G, but with no edges.  Then we follow the following instructions:

#Consider the set E of edges in G, that will connect the end points when added to H
#Find the member of E with the lowest weight.  If there are more than one such member, pick any one.
#Add this edge to H
#If H is not connected, then go back to step 1.  Otherwise, H is a minimum spanning tree of G.

===Example===

[[Image:Spanning1.png|none|thumb|200px|figure 1]]

Above is the diagram (figure 1) for a graph, for which a spanning tree will be constructed using Kruskal's algorithm.  Each edge is given a weighting.  The lines are dotted, as the edges of the spanning tree will be indicated with solid lines.

Below are figures 2 to 5, which indicate the stages of the construction of a spanning tree.

[[Image:Krustalexample1a.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 2]]
[[Image:Krustalexample1b.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 3]]
[[Image:Krustalexample1c.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 4]]
[[Image:Krustalexample1d.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 5]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

In figure 2, we add an edge of weight 2, as that is the edge of lowest weight.  For figure 3 there are two options, both of weight 3, that could have been added.  Note that the edge added is not connected to the first edge.  This is allowed under this algorithm, but not Prim's algorithm, described below.  In figure 4 the other edge of weight 3 is added.  Finally, in figure 5 we add an edge of weight 6, out of two allowable.  There are edges of lower weight, such as that of weight 4, but these all join edges we have already been connected.  The final spanning tree is given below in figure 6, with the other edges in the original graph, and their weights, not given.  The total weight is 2+3+3+6 = 14.

[[Image:Krustalexample1e.png|none|thumb|200px|figure 6]]

==Prim's algorithm==

Prim's algorithm is an alternative way of finding a minimum spanning tree for a network G.  Again, we start with a graph H, consisting of all the vertices of G, but with no edges.  Then we follow the following instructions:

#Pick any vertex v in the graph
#Make it the only member of a set S
#Consider the set E of edges joining one member of S to a vertex not in S.
#Find the member of E with the lowest weight.  If there are more than one such member, pick any one.
#Add this edge to H, and the add the vertex not in S, to S.
#If H is not connected, then go back to step 3.  Otherwise, H is a minimum spanning tree of G.

===Example===

[[Image:Spanning1.png|none|thumb|200px|figure 7]]

Above is figure 7, which is the same as figure 1, the graph used for the example for Kruskal's algorithm.  We will construct a different spanning tree, although as is guaranteed, the total weight  will be the same.  The first step is to choose a vertex to start with.  This will be the top most vertex.  Below are figures 8 to 11, the stages in the construction of a spanning tree.

[[Image:Primexample1a.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 8]]
[[Image:Primexample1b.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 9]]
[[Image:Primexample1c.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 10]]
[[Image:Primexample1d.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 11]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

At the start, only the top vertex is in S.  The edges with lowest weight between S, and other vertices are those with weight 6, so in figure 8 one is chosen, thus adding the middle right vertex to S.  In figure 9 the edge of weight 2 is added, adding the bottom right vertex to S.  In figure 10, one of the edges of weight 3 is added, the other not having a vertex in S on either end.  This edge is then added in figure 11.  This is now allowed, as the middle left vertex was added to S in figure 10.  The final spanning tree is given below in figure 12.  The total weight is again 2+3+3+6=14, although the actual spanning tree is different from that for Krustal's algorithm.

[[Image:Primexample1e.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 12]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

===Matrix representation===

An alternative way of finding minimum spanning trees is when the graph we are interested in is in matrix form.  A matrix in this case is simply a table of numbers, the numbers corresponding to the weights of the edges.  For example, below is table 1, the matrix form of the graph we have been using in our examples, along with figure 13, the familiar graphical representation:

{| 
| 
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ table 1
|-   
|
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5
|-
| 1
|   || 8 || 6 || 6 || 9   
|-
| 2
| 8 ||   || 3 || 3 || 4
|-
| 3
| 6 || 3 ||   || 5 || 2 
|-
| 4
| 6 || 3 || 5 ||   || 7   
|-
| 5
| 9 || 4 || 2 || 7 ||   
|}
| [[Image:Spanning1.png|none|thumb|200px|figure 13]]
|}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

The vertices are given numbers 1 to 5, with 1 the top vertex, 2 and 3 the middle-left and middle-right vertices, and 4 and 5 the bottom-left and bottom-right.  The row and column headings correspond to these numbers, and the other numbers are the weights of the appropriate edges.  For example, the number 8 in row 1, column 2, is the weight, 8, of the edge between vertices 2 and 3.  Note that there is symmetry in the matrix, in that, for example, row 2, column 1 is also 8.  This is because the edge between 1 and 2, say, is also the edge between 2 and 1.  Also, there is no edge between a vertex and itself, so row 1, column 1, row 2 column 2, etc., are all empty.

Using this form we can apply Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree.  We will start with vertex 4, making that the only member of S.  To denote this, we write it in bold, and will for other members of S later.  You can use any method you want to indicate members of S, such as cicling.  Below is table 2, with vertex 4 marked as a member of S.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ table 2
|-
| ||1 || 2 || 3 || '''4''' || 5
|-
| 1
|   || 8 || 6 || 6 || 9   
|-
| 2
| 8 ||   || 3 || 3 || 4
|-
| 3
| 6 || 3 ||   || 5 || 2 
|-
| '''4'''
| 6 || 3 || 5 ||   || 7   
|-
| 5
| 9 || 4 || 2 || 7 ||   
|}

Now, we must pick the next edge.  This will have one vertex in S, and one not in S.  These correspond to the numbers in row 4 (the one in bold), where it doesn't cross column 4 (also in bold).  This gives the numbers 6, 3, 5 and 7, the lowest of which is 3, which corresponds to row 4, colunn 2, so the edge between vertices 4 and 2.  We thus add this to our tree, and 2 to S.  Below is table 3, with both 2 and 4, the members of S, in bold.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ table 3
|-
| ||1 || '''2''' || 3 || '''4''' || 5
|-
| 1
|   || 8 || 6 || 6 || 9   
|-
| '''2'''
| 8 ||   || 3 || 3 || 4
|-
| 3
| 6 || 3 ||   || 5 || 2 
|-
| '''4'''
| 6 || 3 || 5 ||   || 7   
|-
| 5
| 9 || 4 || 2 || 7 ||   
|}

Now, the edges to select from correspond to numbers in rows 2 and 4 (those in bold), but not in columns 2 and 4.  This gives the numbers 8, 3, 4, 6, 5 and 7.  The lowest is 3, corresponding to an edge between vertices 2 and 3.  Thus we add 3 to S, and this edge to our tree.  Below is table 4, with 3 now in bold.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ table 4
|-
| ||1 || '''2''' || '''3''' || '''4''' || 5
|-
| 1
|   || 8 || 6 || 6 || 9   
|-
| '''2'''
| 8 ||   || 3 || 3 || 4
|-
| '''3'''
| 6 || 3 ||   || 5 || 2 
|-
| '''4'''
| 6 || 3 || 5 ||   || 7   
|-
| 5
| 9 || 4 || 2 || 7 ||   
|}

Now, we have the numbers 8, 4, 6, 2, 5 and 7.  The lowest is 2, which corresponds to the edge between vertices 3 to 5.  We thus add this edge to our tree, and vertex 5 to S.  In table 5, this vertex is added to S, and thus in bold.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ table 5
|-
| ||1 || '''2''' || '''3''' || '''4''' || '''5'''
|-
| 1
|   || 8 || 6 || 6 || 9   
|-
| '''2'''
| 8 ||   || 3 || 3 || 4
|-
| '''3'''
| 6 || 3 ||   || 5 || 2 
|-
| '''4'''
| 6 || 3 || 5 ||   || 7   
|-
| '''5'''
| 9 || 4 || 2 || 7 ||   
|}

Here, the numbers are 8, 6, 6 and 9.  There are thus two possible edges, between 1 and either 3 or 4.  The previous edges were between 4 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 5.  Below are figure 14 and 15, images of the spanning trees formed by choosing one of the two edges.  Figure 14 has the edge between vertices 1 and 3, and figure 15 that between 1 and 4.

[[Image:Primexample1e.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 14]]
[[Image:Krustalexample1e.png|left|thumb|200px|figure 15]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

Note that these are the spanning trees generated by Prim's algorithm, and Krustal's algorithm, respectively.  Also note that when finding the lowest number, we only considered the case where the member of S is the row, and the non-member is the column.  This leaves out the possibility that the member of S is the column, and the non-member is the row.  However, as we have discussed, each edge is listed twice, and our way of considering elements includes each edge once.  For example, if 1 is in S, and 2 not, then we include the edge between them as row 1, column 2, but not as row 2, column 1.

Traditionally, a '''beurre blanc''' consists of nearly equal parts white wine and good white wine vinegar reduced dramatically with shallot, held in emulsion with quite a lot of butter.  Once the basic technique has been mastered, don't be afraid to experiment with new ingredients. Many modern variations exist employing any number of herbs and flavorings.  

The sauce, whose name means &quot;white butter,&quot; traces its roots to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]] of the Loire Valley, and would be conventionally served with river fish, like [[Cookbook:Trout|trout]] or pike.  

Correctly prepared, a basic beurre blanc should be creamy and tangy with a good savory component, pairing well with lean meats, particularly fish.  I recommend it highly with a nice preparation of pan-seared halibut, seasoned simply with salt and pepper.  What follows is a recipe for a simple, semi-traditional beurre blanc.

===Ingredients===
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of good white [[Cookbook:White Wine|wine]] (dry aromatic white, preferably French, such as Pouilly-Fumé)
* [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|juice]] of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* 1 - 2 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]], very finely chopped
* 1 cup unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], in cubes or lumps
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]] 
* 1 Tbs heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], (optional and non-traditional)

===Procedure===

# For four portions, start with a cup of good white wine with a strong acidity (think dry aromatic white, preferably French, such as Pouilly-Fumé) in a non-reactive saucepan with the juice of one lemon and one or two very finely chopped shallots.
# Reduce the mixture to about two tablespoons, and don't be shy about letting it boil: it will not adversely affect the sauce.  Once reduced, the shallot should still be fairly moist. If you're looking at a dry pan, there's a good chance your sauce won't hold.
# Reduce heat to low flame. If you want to increase the holding power of your sauce, you can add a tablespoon or so of heavy cream at this juncture, but every authority on traditional French preparation would disapprove.
# Begin to add smallish cubes of very good, very cold unsalted butter while whisking vigorously. From a technical standpoint, the sauce should stay under 200°F (95°C), so do some of the whisking off the flame.  Whisk in one or two cubes and add more, and continue until you've added about 10 to 12 tablespoons of butter.  
# Season with salt and white pepper and serve immediately. The sauce can be held in a vacuum container, such a Thermos, but I don't recommend it for long periods of time.

American chefs may try to enhance the presentation of the sauce by straining the shallot out before plating, but the French know better. If the shallot has been sufficiently chopped it has no deleterious effect on the texture of the finished product.

== Sam2p - a better graphics file converter than ImageMagic ==
I have struggled for some time with ImageMagic to get correct bounding-boxes in  .eps graphics files (converted from .jpg, .png, .pdf format). 

Generally speaking I found it unsatisfactory, so I searched for an alternative and finally found Sam2p (see http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/sam2p/). After using it for some months I was so impressed by its quality that I have come to use it exclusively instead of ImageMagic.

Like ImageMagic, Sam2P is a commandline program and Open Source. It is more recent than ImageMagic however and seems to boast a number of improvements over ImageMagic (other than finding bounding boxes) which are listed on its website.   
Highly recommended.

== Bug in file extension in graphicx package ==

Adding a figure with in this format : [filename.eps] produces an error : &quot;Unknown graphics extension .eps&quot;.

However removing the extension from the parameter solves the problem.

So, the correct format : [filename].

:Yes, seems to be a bug for .eps files, but I'm not sure. Anyway, it works flawlessly without extension. This detail has been added to the chapter. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 12:41, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

== eps - what about using pdflatex ==

indeed, &quot;.eps&quot; extension is not needed in modern implementations of (la)tex, at least not in tetex.
An extra advantage is that if you also have a pdf-version of the picture, then it will automatically be picked up, instead of eps-version, when you run pdflatex

In the list of software producing EPS graphics, it is worth mentioning IDL, Matlab and Mathematica, used by many scientists.

At least since version 2010.20288-1, pdflatex natively handles EPS files by converting them to pdf.

-- [[User:Karper|Karper]] ([[User talk:Karper|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Karper|contribs]]) 20:38, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

== Creating vector graphics natively in LaTeX ==

LaTeX has some primitive line drawing functions in the picture environment that can be used to create graphics. Although it's quite simple and probably not so useful anymore, an extension of it called [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/ Portable Graphics Format (PGF) and TikZ] is really useful and amazingly extensible. I think it should be placed after Inkscape. (I just saw that there is an entire page called [[LaTeX/Creating_Graphics|Creating Graphics]], so this should definitely go into that page) --[[User:Cengique|Cengique]] ([[User talk:Cengique|talk]]) 18:37, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

== Examples do not work ==

Examples on this page do not work. LaTex keeps complaining Cannot determine size of graohic, or, no bounding box. 

None of the given examples actually do something usefull. This page is a waste of time.
:You do have to place the pictures with the exact same name (LaTeX is capital sensitive) in a directory where LaTeX searches (in jou directory where the .tex file is is a good option).

[[LaTeX/Importing_Graphics#Document_Options]] In this subsection there is said that the default is ''draft''.

==Images as Figures==

The images as figures section sounded like two guys having an editting war. I think that both people had a point; images are not figures, definately, but the figures page (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions#Figures) jumps straight into more complex figure usage. I thought that a bare-minimum example was needed, so provided two; one that's almost completely useless, and a slightly longer one which provides a basic 'all you need' example for using figures and images. I think this is a much better way to present the concept than pushing people towards a more advanced topic, as most people who come looking for how to insert images are most likely looking for a figure &amp; image example to copy/paste into their documents.

== Process LaTeX article that use png or jpg image files to eps ones ... ==

I have created with some days of effort this script in order to convert a LaTeX using jpg files to one using eps.
All is done automatic. The new source folder is ready to be compiled using latex instead of pdflatex.
I did this for my self use in order to save many effort, specially looking for the included images through a complex images folder tree and calculating for each one its final dimension in &quot;cm&quot; in order to be converted to eps and able to be used for proffesional publication or by editors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This file explains how to increase the thick slab mode limitation of 90 imags, however volume rendering via thick slab anything past 90 images is unstable.  It works well with mean and MIP. (make sure you follow the two columns on each page, before going to the next of the three pages.)

==Other names: Mucopolysacchardosis III, Type A, B, C, and D==
*So, it is a syndrome in which the large saccharides are not broken down properly in the lysosomes. It's a lysosomal storage deficiency.

==Characteristics==
*Most common of the MPS diseases
*Normal to fast growth 1-3 years. Slow growth after that.
*Slow development by 1-3 years then deterioration
*Short stature
*Hearing loss
*Poor gait
*Poor speech
*Poor behavior
*Synophrys (joined eyebrows)
*Mild cardiac involvement
*Clear corneas
*Sleep disturbances
*Upper respiratory tract infections
*Many die of pneumonia (10-20 years)

==Genetics==
*Autosomal recessive in all types
*Sanfilippo A = defect in heparan N-sulfatase
*Sanfilippo B = deficiency in N-acetyl-alpha-delta glucosaminidase
*Sanfilippo C = deficiency of acetyl-CoA: alpha-glucosaminide-N-acetyltransferase
*Sanfilippo D = deficiency of N-acetyl-alpha-delta glucosaminide-6-sulfatase

==Diagnosis==
*By clinical features mentioned above (same for all four types except type D)
**Overactivity
**Destructive tendencies
**Weakness in all extremities
*Presence of excess heparan sulfate in the urine

==Introductions==

==Contracting==
*Medical update
*Physical exam
*Answer any new questions

==Medical Update==
*How are your hands?
*Carpal tunnel repair… any complications?
*Current medications
*Current activities at school
*How's the replacement therapy going?
*How's your vision currently?

==Scheie Syndrome==
*Definition: It is a mucopolysaccharidoses Type I disease. This means the body has trouble breaking down the large molecules in the lysosomes. Instead of breaking them down completely, they kick out only partially degraded molecules = storage occurs as well. So there is an increase of stuff in the lysosomes causing a build up in various parts of the body
*Incidence
**1/500,000 births
*Characteristics
**Broad mouth and fill lips
**Clouding of corneas/visual impairment
**Aortic valve defects
**Hairy body
**Hernias are common
**Carpal tunnel syndrome
**Joint limitation leading to claw hand.
**Normal life span
*Genetics
**Autosomal recessive
**Chromosome 4p16 has a defect = the alph-L-iduronidase gene

==Recommendations==
*Ophthgamology
*Cardiology
*Physical Therapy
*Occupational Therapy

==Treatment==
*Bone marrow transplants -experimental
*Fetal tissue transplants - experiemntal
*Enzyme replacement - experimental (When lysosomal storage diseases were discovered, hopes were raised that they could be treated by enzyme substitution. When exogenous lysosomal enzymes are injected into the patient, this enzyme can eventually be taken up by enzyme-deficient cells. This uptake is regulated by certain receptors on the cell surface. Different tissue have different receptors. It is therefore necessary to change the natural enzyme to enable uptake in the tissue of interest. If properly designed, the missing enzyme could be injected regularly like the diabetic subject injects insulin. In many in vitro studies with the purified active enzyme added to the media of enzyme-deficient fibroblasts, the lysosomal substrate accumulation was corrected, but in vivo treatment has been hampered through the problem of producing the sufficient quantity of enzymes, immunological problems, and that the substituted enzyme does not pass the blood-brain barrier.
*Since it can be expected that enzymes supplied from the outside do not pass the blood brain barrier, suitable candidates for enzyme replacement are disorders without neurological involvement (e.g. Maroteaux Lamy, Morquio B, Fabry, late onset Pompe disease).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Seizure Medications'''

==Contracting==
*Introductions and small talk
*Confirm referring physician
*Assess understanding of the reason for the referral to genetics
*How much information has your physician given you about the possible effects of taking seizure medications while pregnant?
*Despite the increased risk of problems, there is a greater than 90% chance that the baby will be just fine
*Control of seizures is important because they may cause injury to you or the fetus
*Stillbirths or miscarriages are more common for women who have epilepsy, occurring in 1.7 percent of pregnancies (about three times the amount in the general population)
*There is a small increase in mortality rates during the first year of life for children of mothers with epilepsy. That risk is only about 0.6 percent, but is higher if seizures are not well controlled. (increased risks probably related to periods where the fetus does not get enough oxygen due to changes in the circulation of blood in the uterus and placenta during seizures)
*What concerns or questions do you have that you would like to discuss today?
*Outline session agenda
**Medical and family history questions
**Some of the possible effects that anticonvulsants can have on the pregnancy
**Options available to you
**Discussion of concerns and questions

==Elicit Medical History==
*Confirm LMP: __________
*EDC: __________
*Today's gestational age: __________
*Have you had an ultrasound?
*Date of ultrasound: __________
*Results of ultrasound: __________
*How has the pregnancy been going so far?
*Have you had any seizures during your pregnancy
*What medications are you taking?
**Amount and frequency of each.
**When did you start taking each?
*At what age did you begin having seizures?
*What type of seizures do you typically have?
*Any complications other than the seizures? Infections, colds, exposures etc.

==Elicit Family History==
(3 generations)
*Anyone else with seizures?
*Anyone had: multiple SAB, SB, early deaths or babies that required surgery as infants?
*Anyone born with birth defects such as cleft lip or palate, spina bifida, or heart problems
*MR/LD
*Has anyone in family had cancer (dx. &lt;50) or chronic illnesses (heart disease, diabetes)

==Discuss possible side effects of taking anticonvulsants during pregnancy==
*Stress importance of taking medicines- to keep you healthy and therefore the baby healthy
*Although it's very important for you to take these medications, sometimes seizure medications can have some effects on a developing baby
*There appears to be an increased risk of Stillbirth correlated with carbamazepine or valproic acid intake during first 6 weeks (2-5% risk of causing stillbirth)
*All pregnancies are at a 3-5% risk of birth defects or mental retardation
*Women who take anticonvulsants are at a 2-3 times increased risk for some specific problems (consensus seems to be about 7-10%)
*This doesn't mean that the baby will be born with a problem, it just means that we know that based on your special circumstances, your pregnancy is at an increased risk
*Some of the things that we sometimes see in children who have been exposed to seizure medications during pregnancy include:
**Subtle changes in the facial features of the baby
***such as the shape of the eyes and nose
***usually so subtle features that you might not even recognize them
**Sometimes we see changes in the length of the fingers (slightly shortened) and the fingernails may be small
**But sometimes children can be born with more apparent changes such as a cleft lip/palate or spina bifida
**Occasionally we see kids who have some delays in development (usually ranging from borderline normal intelligence to mild mental retardation)
**Heart defects have been reported in infants of a group of women who were treated with a number of different anticonvulsants (RR of 2.2, 1.4-3.5)
**RR of other birth defects when the group of meds was considered together was 2.5 (1.5-2.4) for oral clefts and 2.5 (1.2-5.0) for urinary tract anomalies
*** But this was for the group of meds considered together and not for individual meds
*Some children who have been exposed to anticonvulsants during pregnancy have several of these features and some have none
*Just based on your history I can't tell you whether or not your baby will have some or none of these features
*However, we can offer you a level II ultrasound that can often determine if the there is a major birth defect

==Options==
*Level II ultrasound -- performed at 18 -20 weeks
**Done by an experienced technician
**Can detect many of the birth defects for which your fetus is at increased risk
**Developing organs will be looked at in detail
**Can often detect abnormalities in the formation of the limbs, spine, heart, and brain
**U/S is good to make us suspicious of some birth defects but it can't tell us everything
**We won't know if there is mental deficiency by u/s
**Also, u/s is dependent upon cooperation of the baby. Sometimes we just can't get a great view and may not be able to see everything we are looking for
**But it can usually provide some reassurance to see that organs and body parts have formed properly
*MSAFP at about 16-18 weeks is optimal
**Screening performed on a sample of your blood
**Can provide an indication that a fetus may be at a higher or lower risk than the general population to have an ONTD, but it will not tell us for certain if there is a neural tube defect
**Detects about 80-90% of ONTD's (so it can miss some)
**Blood test can also look at other markers in the blood and determine if there may be an increased risk for two chromosomal abnormalities (for which you are not at an increased risk for based on your history of seizures and medications)
*Amniocentesis at about 15-18 weeks
**Can detect about 95-98% of open neural tube defects (when test both AFP and AchE)
**Procedural risk for miscarriage of 1 in 200
**Although you are not at an increased risk for other specific types of birth defects caused by changes in the chromosomes or hereditary material, amnio can also look at the chromosomes and determine if there is a chromosome abnormality with high accuracy

==Other medications==
*Studies of women have shown that neither other medication you are taking (Zoloft and Zantac) cause an increase in birth defects when compared to what would be expected in the general population. However, high levels of Zantac are found in breastmilk and it is recommended that a woman who is taking Zantac not breast-feed

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*Guilt over doing something that may cause birth defects
*Catch 22 (don't want to hurt the fetus, but need to make sure that mom is healthy because if mom were having seizures that too would put the fetus at risk)
*Are there other health concerns or circumstances that would make this a difficult pregnancy
*Assess support system and coping strategies

==Follow-up==
*Questions?
*Registry for patients taking anticonvulsants…
*Do you plan to breast feed the baby?
*Provide information about Epilepsy foundation at 1-800-EFA-1000 or www.efa.org

==Carbitrol, Epitol, Tegretol (Carbamazepine) Facts==
*Anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer
*Clearance increases during pregnancy so doses may need adjustment
*Series of 125 infants exposed, 17 (12%) had congenital anomalies
*Several other reports show a 2-3 times as great of risk for birth defects as in the general population (this is similar to reports of children born to women treated with other anticonvulsants)
*Study with controls who had trivial exposure to ethanol
**Found malformations in 18% of babies exposed to Carbitrol during pregnancy
**Hypoplastic fingernails, short nose, long philtrum, upslanting palpebral fissures, distal digital hypoplasia and microcephaly
**But major birth defects not increased
**20% of exposed were found to have developmental delay (5 of 25 offspring)
***problems with the design though
*may be confounded by SES status or parental IQ
*used only one standard deviation as the cut off rather than two
*Other studies fail to show any significant effects of prenatal exposure on head size, IQ, or neurologic function
*Incidence of spina bifida
**When data from 22 published studies was pooled, a relative risk of 14 was calculated
**Questions about adequacy of data because many of 21 published studies that were used reported 0-1 cases
**Nested case control study showed odds ration of 6.0 for NTD's but not statistically significant, but is suggestive of a relationship
**May therefore be a risk and the risk is generally quoted at 1 in 200 to 1 in 100 (up to 10 times the risk for general population which is about 1 in 1,000)
**Folate supplements often recommended because carbamazepine is folic acid antagonist
*When in combination with other anticonvulsant drugs especially valproic acid, higher frequencies of birth defects have been observed
*Considered &quot;probably safe&quot; to consume while breastfeeding

==Topamax (Topiramate) Facts==
*Mechanism of action unknown --Appears to block the spread of seizures rather than raise the seizure threshold
*Not well studied in humans
*Most studies have been done on mice, rats, and rabbits
**developmental toxicity shown at all doses tested (lowest 20% of human dose)
**Show craniofacial malformations most commonly such as cleft lip and palate
**Caused limb reduction anomalies in rats at 10 times human dose
**Delays in physical development seen when used during late pregnancy and lactation in rats
**Skeletal abnormalities at 6 times the human dose in rabbits (maternal toxic dose)
**Intrauterine death in 2 times the human dose (maternal toxic dose)
*8 exposed pregnancies
**5 chose to terminate
**3 infants were normal
*Case report (abstract) one woman only on topamax throughout gestation (700mg) had infant with prenatal onset growth deficiency and multiple minor anomalies (5th nail hypoplasia, generalized hirsutism, third fontanelle, short nose and anteverted nares)

==Zoloft (Setraline) Facts==
*SSRI antidepressant
*Studies in rats and rabbits
**20 times the dose in pregnant rats and rabbits produced NO INCREASE in birth defects
**Neonatal survival was decreased at maternal doses of 5 times higher than recommended in humans
*Report of 147 women followed prospectively
**Comparable incidence of malformations to that found in unexposed controls
*Offspring of 112 women in another study
**Babies DID NOT have an increase in birth defects compared to control population
**Admission to a special care nursery were associated with late pregnancy exposure
*Case report of infant with withdrawal symptoms
**Agitation, poor feeding, constant crying, insomnia
**Intense for 48 hours then subsided
*Nystagmus reported in another infant and resolved after 72 hours
*Zoloft is excreted in breast milk, along with active metabolite
*Studies suggest that there is minimal transfer of active drug to the infant though

==Zantac (Ranitidine) facts==
*Histamine H2 antagonist used for peptic ulcer disease
*No increase in birth defects or fetal toxicity in rats or rabbits
*Frequency of major malformations NOT increased among children of 142 women taking various H2 receptor antagonists
*No increase in incidence of birth defects in 330 infants exposed to Zantac during first trimester
*Cohort study with 176 infants showed rate of birth defects NO greater than expected
*Not recommended during breast feeding because may accumulate in breast milk up to 6-12% of maternal daily dose

**Then we will answer all your questions and explain what we believe might be the cause of the problems ____ has experienced

==Pedigree==
*Learning difficulties or mental retardation
*Birth defects
*Seizures
*Eye problems
*Problems with growth
*Infertility
*History of pregnancy losses
*Anyone died at a young age or unexpectedly
*Chronic health problem
*Anything that seems to be running in your family

==Take medical history==
(follow form)
*Explain how mosaic turner syndrome was ruled out as an explanation for her short stature and absent periods

==Introduce septo-optic dysplasia also called SOD==
*A rare disorder where some of the structures in the middle of the brain don't form properly
*This can lead to changes in the way they function and a number of symptoms and characteristic findings
*A number of findings on ______'s MRI suggested that she might have septo-optic dysplasia
*Septo refers to the center structure of the brain
*The septum pellucidum is a membrane that separates one of the fluid filled spaces in the brain (show picture)
*This membrane is missing in ________.
*The pituitary gland is also located in the center of the brain and does not seem to be functioning properly in _____.
*The term optic refers to the optic nerve, which is what carries the messages from the eyes to the brain
*______'s optic nerves are underdeveloped and small
*Dysplasia means that these structures are not formed properly

==Symptoms of SOD==
*The problems that can occur in individuals with SOD vary and can range from mild or serious
*A person with SOD can have a combination of any number of symptoms or characteristics
**Eye problems
***If the optic nerve is small or not developed properly will have fewer connections to the brain and can therefore have poor vision
***This is called optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH)
***Vision doesn't usually decrease over time though
***Most with ONH also have unusual eye movements where the eyes move around and don't focus well (nystagmus)
**Brain Structure and Function
***Septum pellucidum missing (agenesis)
***Some have an abnormal corpus callosum which is the group of nerve fibers connecting the brain
***Other structural changes (larger than usual fluid filled cavities (ventricles), and fluid filled sacs in the ventricles (cysts) )
***Sometimes changes in structure alter function and sometimes there is no brain function affected
***Can be mildly to severely affected and cause developmental delays and cognitive problems
***Some also have seizures
*Pituitary Gland
***Found in middle of brain and is master control gland
***Makes important chemicals (hormones) which direct other glands in other parts of body to make other hormones
***These other hormones are needed for things such as proper growth of body, energy control, sexual development

==GH (growth hormone)==
*About 6:10 children with ONH don't make enough growth hormone
*Can be treated with growth hormone shots
*GH also necessary after growth is complete to maintain bone strength and normal metabolism

==Thyroid hormone can be lacking in kids with ONH/SOD==
*Pituitary releases signal TSH to tell thyroid gland in neck to make thyroxin
*Thyroxin necessary for growth and metabolism
*Without enough can cause: poor growth, weight gain, slowing of mental function, feeling cold, irregular periods, dry skin, brittle nails, hair loss
*Can be replaced with pills taken every day

==Gonadotropins (FSH and LH)==
*Signal the ovaries and testes to produce sex hormones
*Without sex hormones sexual development may be delayed

==Cortisol==
*Made by adrenal glands above the kidneys
*ACTH from pituitary tells adrenal gland to make cortisol
*Increased amounts of cortisol needed when injured or sick
*If pituitary doesn't work right in telling adrenal glands to make more than may need to take cortisol pills daily

==ADH (anti-diuretic hormone)==
*Keeps water in the body by controlling amount of urine
*Without enough may lose too much water
*Feel thirsty, dry mouth, but urinates a lot
*May become dehydrated and have problems (called diabetes insipidus or water diabetes)
*Treatment available

==Prolactin==
*May have high prolactin
*Leads to no known health problems
*Used to test how pituitary is functioning

==Services==
*Children may need many tests and services
*Often followed by Ophthalmology, Endocrinology and Neurology
*Need early intervention
*May need IEP in school
*Services may include PT, OT, speech therapy depending on child's needs
*Special needs for those with severe vision problems

==Etiology of SOD==
*Exact cause of SOD is not known
*Probably due to a combination of genetic and environmental influences early in gestation at about 6 wks gestation
*Usually thought to be sporadic meaning that it is not something that was inherited
*Cases have been reported where it appears to be autosomal recessive (presence of two copies of altered copies of a gene)
*Mutations were in homeodomain of HESX1 gene
*Found similar phenotype in mice that were mutant for homologous gene Hesx1
*Also identified heterozygous mutations in HESX1 that correlated with milder pituitary phenotypes

==Recurrence Risks==
*Dependent on whether it is a sporadic case or a mutation is present
*Few documented reports of affected siblings
*Testing was available on a research basis for the HESX1 gene as of first part of Nov. 2001, but we would need to contact the researcher to see if they are still searching for mutations (researcher is in UK).

==Psychosocial considerations==
*May be a lot of new information and it is not simple
*We have some written information that you can read through if you would like
*May regret not having diagnosis earlier
*May feel that more could have been done if it was diagnosed earlier
*What are plans for her in the future
*Will she live at home or in a group home
*Is she connected with anyone who can help her with a job placement when school is done

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Short Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase (SCAD)'''

==General Information==
*a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by a defect in the oxidation of short-chain fatty acids resulting in neurologic and gastrointestinal manifestations
*SCAD is one of four enzymes in the mitochondria responsible for the breakdown of short-chain (C4-C6) fatty acids to 2-carbon fragments (acetyl-CoA) in the beta oxidation pathway
*homozygous patients are unable to mobilize large fat stores and are thus at risk for becoming hypoglycemic when stressed (i.e., during infection or fasting) during which time the long and medium acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are unable to compensate for the lack of SCAD
*gene map locus: 12q22-qter
*autosomal recessive inheritance

==Diagnosis==
*diagnosis is difficult because patients do not consistently excrete characteristic metabolites
*it is necessary to collect and analyze several urine and plasma specimens in patients with neurologic abnormalities that suggest this disorder
*deficiency of SCAD activity in leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts
*prenatally, a deficiency of SCAD activity in cultured chorionic villi or amniocytes can be detected

==Clinical Evaluation==
*two distinct clinical phenotypes have been identified :
*one type observed in infants with acute acidosis and muscle weakness (generalized)
*one type observed in middle-aged patients with chronic myopathy (localized to skeletal muscles)
*cases with neonatal onset have a variable phenotype
*includes metabolic acidosis, failure to thrive, developmental delay, seizures and myopathy
*no episodes of nonketotic hypoglycemia (characteristic of medium-chain and long-chain acyl dehydrogenase deficiencies)

==Infantile type==
*metabolic: neonatal acidosis, low-normal plasma total carnitine, highly esterified
*GI: poor feeding, vomiting, failure to thrive
*muscle: progressive skeletal muscle weakness, hypotonia
*neurological: developmental delay
*laboratory results: generalized SCAD deficiency, ethylmalonate urinary excretion, low normal highly esterified muscle carnitine

==Adult type==
*muscle: lipid-storage myopathy
*lab results: skeletal muscle carnitine low, deficiency of skeletal muscle mitochondrial short-chain acyl-CoA (butyryl-CoA)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Short Stature'''

==Considerations for Short Stature==
*Abnormally short stature may result form a primary abnormality of skeletal organization, growth, or development (skeletal dysplasia - metabolic or single-gene), or from extraosseous defect (nutrition, teratogen, endocrine, psychosocial, or cytogenetic).
*The use of growth curves with attention to ethnic and family background will help identify the patient with pathologic short stature.
*The initial step in the clinical evaluation of short stature is to determine whether the body is proportionate or disproportionate. (Proportionate growth suggests an extraosseous defect, while disproportionate growth suggests a skeletal dysplasia.) Precise body measurements, such as upper to lower-limb-segment ratios, sitting height, arm span, and hand and foot measurements are diagnostically useful.
*The next step is to determine whether the growth deficiency was of prenatal or postnatal onset. (Prenatal onset suggests a fetal environment insult or genetic defect, while a postnatal onset suggests chronic disease, endocrine disorder, or psychosocial issues.)
*A family height history should be discussed and parental heights should be measured. A pregnancy history should be taken and teratogen exposure should be discussed. Cytogenetic studies, including a karyotype should be done. Skeletal films of the hand will determine bone age. Growth hormone assays and thyroid studies should be coordinated through endocrinology.

==Considerations for Failure to Thrive==
*The term failure to thrive is used for children and infants who, without superficially evident cause, fail to gain and often lose weight.
*Most instances of FTT result from psychosocial circumstances which adversely affect the child's intake, absorption, or utilization of food (including emotional deprivation, physical neglect or abuse, and withholding food).
*FTT may be related to a physical handicap, such as cerebral palsy or cleft palate.
*FTT may also result from obscure organic abnormalities or overt diseases in which growth failure occurs.
*Hospitalization for study and treatment allows for quantification of factors controlling the net caloric intake (food intake, vomiting, and stools) and for observation of the child's interactions with the family. This hospitalization frequently leads to dramatic improvement of weight gain and provides evidence that the environmental factors are the cause.
*Making a growth chart and developmental flow sheet flow sheet may identify the point in time where the child began to fail to thrive. If the child's growth has been steady, just below the expected level (if the child is following their own growth curve), then diagnoses like constitutional short stature, hypopituitarism, or chromosomal abnormality may be considered.
*If the medical history and physical examination suggest disturbances in any particular organ systems, then diagnostic study should be pursued. This could begin with routine screening tests, like blood counts and urinalyses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sickle Cell Anemia'''

==Introduction==
*Determine what the patient already knows about sickle cell
*Assess what concerns the patient wants to address today

==Elicit Medical History==

==Elicit Family History and Pedigree==

==What is sickle cell disease?==
*inherited blood disorder affecting the oxygen carrying part of the blood cells called hemoglobin
*hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia forms a &quot;sickle&quot; or banana shape
**normal hemoglobin is called hemoglobin A
**sickle cell hemoglobin is called hemoglobin S
*this shape causes it to be broken down in the liver leading to not enough blood cells
*people with sickle cell disease experience pain, damage to organs, and sometimes early death
**this is due to sickle shaped blood cells blocking tiny blood vessels
**this leads to prevention of blood flow to certain areas of the body

==Diagnosis==
*diagnosis is made by a blood test called hemoglobin electrophoresis
**those with mostly hemoglobin S have sickle cell disease
**those with only hemoglobin A do not have sickle cell disease
**those with both hemoglobin A and hemoglobin S are heterozygote carriers and have sickle cell trait
***this means they are carriers of the sickle cell gene
***they generally do not have any health problems but can pass the gene to their children
**this test requires 3cc of blood in a red-capped EDTA tube
**prenatal testing is also available
**in Ohio children are now tested for sickle cell as part of the newborn screening program

==Symptoms==
*chronic hemolytic anemia - may lead to reduction in energy and cause growth retardation
*Vaso-occlusion - blockage of small blood vessels that may lead to pain and tissue damage.
*Splenic sequestration - increase in spleen size due to storage of red blood cells
*Organ failure - may result from insufficient blood flow later in life
*other problems may arise such as neurological effects, stroke, chronic eye disease, renal disease, and leg ulcers

==Treatment==
*mainly symptomatic
*drugs such as hydroxyurea are used to increase fetal hemoglobin
*vasodilators and lubricants used to prevent microvascular blockage with very little success

==Inheritance==
*Sickle cell disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion
**people with sickle cell disease have two copies of the mutated gene
**people with sickle cell trait have one normal gene and one mutated gene
*Parents who both have sickle cell trait will have a 25% chance of having a child with sickle cell disease, a 50% chance of having a child with sickle cell trait, and a 25% chance of having a normal child who is not a carrier
*If one parent has sickle cell disease and one parent has sickle cell trait, they have a 50% chance of having a child with sickle cell disease but the child will have sickle cell trait.
*If one parent has sickle cell disease and the other parent is normal the child will have sickle cell trait but 0% chance of having sickle cell disease.

Clarification: In order for a child to have sickle cell disease both parents must have at least one copy of the abnormal sickle cell gene, or in other words both parents must have sickle cell trait for the child to have sickle cell disease.

==Population Genetics==
*African-Americans: 1/12 are carriers
*1/400-600 children are born with sickle cell disease
*People of Hispanic, Greek, Italian, Arabic, and Asian Indian also have high carrier rates

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Guilt over passing on trait to children
*people with sickle cell trait may be treated as though they are sick despite having no symptoms
*people with sickle cell trait may also be more worried about their health despite having no symptoms
*worry over reproductive decisions

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome'''

==Contracting==
*Make small talk and establish rapport with the family.
*Elicit the family's concerns. What issues would you like to discuss today?
*Briefly outline the topics to be covered during the visit.

==Eliciting Interim History==
*Interim Family History:
*Have there been any new births, deaths, or diagnoses in the family?
*Is there any consanguinity in the family?

==Psychosocial==

==Genetic Etiology==
*Autosomal recessive inheritance
*Caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 7DHCR, the final enzymatic step in the cholesterol biogenesis pathway.
*Molecular Genetics
*The gene encoding 7DHCR is located at 11q12-13, and is named DHCR7.
*19 different mutations have been reported (including 13 missense, 5 frameshift, and 1 nonsense mutation).
*Milder phenotypes can be seen if the mutation renders the enzyme partially active.
*The mechanism leading to the manifestations seen appears to be the result of a deficiency in cholesterol.
*Cholesterol is a critical component of myelin and other CNS proteins
*Cholesterol is also a precursor to the sex steroids, estrogen and testosterone, thus hypocholesterolemia results in a deficiency of these hormones.
*The derangement of sterol composition in the cell membranes may result in abnormal cell-to-cell interactions in the developing embryo. (? Explains polydactyly and cleft palate and growth deficiency seen in some??)
*Penetrance:
*100% penetrant with variable expressivity

==Recurrence Risks==
*The risk of recurrence is 25%

==Incidence==
*The incidence is estimated to be 1:40,000- 1:60,000
*The carrier frequency is approximately 1:122
*More common in people of European background, and has been seen rarely in those of African American and Asian descent.
*There is an excess of males diagnosed with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (bias of ascertainment as a result of hypogenetalism seen in boys).

==Diagnostic Criteria and Clinical Features==
*Diagnosis is usually made based on the recognition of a constellation of characteristic clinical features, with diagnostic confirmation based on measurement of elevated 7DHC in plasma or other tissues.
*The cardinal features include:
*Prenatal growth deficiency with subsequent failure to thrive
*Developmental delay/ mental retardation (moderate to severe)
*Poor muscle tone (hypotonia)
*Characteristic facies (change with age and are difficult to recognize in adulthood)
*Microcephaly with narrow bifrontal diameter
*Ptosis (50%)
*Down-slanting palpebral fissures
*Short nose with depressed nasal bridge, with anteverted nares
*Low set and posteriorly rotated ears
*Retrognathia
*Cleft palate (37-52%)
*Cardiac defects (36-38%)
*AV canal defects, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return defects
*Gastrointestinal anomalies (25%)
*Pyloric stenosis, malrotation, Hirschsprung disease
*Polydactyly
*Cutaneous 2-3 toe syndactyly (90%)
*Genital abnormalities (70%)
*Hypospadias, cryptorchidism, micropenis, hypoplastic scrotum, and microutethra.
*Upper tract anomalies (57%) include hydronephrosis, renal cystic dysplasia, renal duplication, renal agenesis, and reflux.

==Occasional Abnormalities==
*Seizures
*Demyelination in the cerebral hemispheres, cranial nerves, and peripheral nerves.
*Cataracts
*Dislocation of the hip

==Natural History==
*Congenital onset
*Many are born in breech presentation
*Stillbirth and early neonatal death are not uncommon
*Feeding difficulty and vomiting, hypotonia, and irritable behavior with shrill screaming have been frequently reported problems in infancy
*Of those who survive, 20% die within the first year.
*Death is commonly related to pneumonia
*The degree of mental deficiency is usually moderate to severe (adults described had IQ's in the 20's).

==Testing==
*Diagnostic:
*Increased 7DHC levels in blood or other tissues
*Clinical evaluation
*Prenatal:
*Measurement of elevated 7DHC in amniotic fluid or chorionic villi
*Carrier testing:
*Not currently available
*Differences of 7DHC in heterozygotes is indistinguishable from homozygotes (normal).
*With the discovery of the gene, it is hoped that mutation analysis will assist in heterozygote identification.

==Surveillance, Management, and Treatment Options==
*Growth and Feeding:
*Adequate caloric intake should be ensured.
*Consideration should be given to cholesterol supplementation to improve weight gain.
*Oral-motor training with OT to help patient take food orally
*G-tube to assist in feeding if oral intake is not adequate
*Development and behavior
*EI, special education programs, and therapies to enhance the developmental potential of the patient.
*Supervised setting for adults (group home) - improved behavior and development has been noted in patients receiving cholesterol supplementation
*Craniofacial
*Cleft palate repair at age 12-18 months
*Ophthalmologic
*If there is a suggestion of visual compromise from ptosis, cataracts, or any other abnormality, referral to an ophthalmologist is recommended.
*Cardiovascular
*Specific to malformation identified
*Special consideration should be given in those cases where prognosis is poor.
*Gastrointestinal
*Surgical referral and standard treatment for each specific condition
*Genitourinary
*Ultrasound of urinary tract at diagnosis
*Treatment is dependent upon the condition identified
*Repair of hypospadias
*Observe boys with cryptorchidism to see if spontaneous descent occurs
*Determine chromosomal sex if ambiguous genitalia is present.
*Musculoskeletal
*Simple excision of supernumerary digits
*Skin
*Cholesterol treatment has been reported to cause a decrease in photosensitivity and skin rashes.
*Limit length of sun exposure to avoid sun photosensitivity

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Chromosomal abnormalities including Trisomy 18 (Growth deficiency, cleft palate, and DD) and Trisomy 13 (Growth retardation, polydactyly, and DD)
*Noonan syndrome (short stature, DD, cardiac defects, cryptorchidism)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sotos Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*Overgrowth syndrome
*etiology still uncertain although researchers in Japan found a gene that may be the cause of Sotos syndrome in a large number of individuals with classical Sotos syndrome (published paper in 2002)
*usually sporadic
*&lt;2% show autosomal dominant inheritance (4 of 200 families, but facial gestalt is different)

==Incidence==
*Unknown slightly less common than Beckwith-Wiedemann with prevalence of 1 in 13,700 births

==Diagnosis==
*Diagnosis is clinical
*4 core features (must have at least 3 of the 4 to really make a diagnosis)
*First 3 features are relative to general population so setting a cutoff is not always clear
**rapid early growth pre and postnatal
**advanced bone age
**developmental delay
**characteristic facial appearance specific to Sotos syndrome
***alters in childhood and adolescence
***in newborn period (macrocephaly, high bossed forehead, dolichocephaly, high palate, appearance suggestive of hypertelorism)
***face lengthens, jaw becomes more prominent, dolichocephaly (tall narrow skull) and frontal bossing (prominent forehead) become more obvious
***delay in growth of hair which is often thin &quot;appearance of receding hairline&quot;
***midchildhood downslant to palpebral fissures, wear and discoloration of teeth, tendency for a rosy coloration of cheeks, chin, and nasal tip.
*All 4 core features are present in at least 75% of true cases of Sotos syndrome and &lt;20% of other specific and nonspecific overgrowth patterns

==At birth==
*Often the presence of a high arched palate, poor suck, and low muscle tone which often produce feeding problems
*Jaundice occurs frequently.

==Molecular Genetics and Genetic Testing==
*Gene mutation found in a number of Japanese patients with Sotos syndrome
*Located at 5q35 gene named NSD-1
*Lab in Chicago and Germany are doing clinical testing
*Details found at http://www.genes.uchicago.edu/clinic/SotosTest.html
*FISH analysis for NSD1 deletion detection. Mutation analysis is currently being validated for clinical use; please check back on availability.
*No lab listed on GeneClinics doing research testing presently, but lab in UK may be doing research testing
*FISH - 12 days and cost is $325
*NSD1 encodes 2,696 amino acids and may interact with nuclear receptors (NRs)
*expressed in the fetal and adult brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, spleen, and the thymus, and faintly in the lung.
*Among 42 SS patients examined, we detected 4 (10 %) de novo point mutations in NSD1
*In addition, FISH analysis using BAC clones flanking the 5q35 breakpoint revealed submicroscopic deletions involving the entire NSD1 gene in 20 (67%) of 30 patients whose chromosomes were available (Nat Genet 30:365-366, 2002)
*http://caroll.vjf.cnrs.fr/cancergene/CG1830.html discusses the NSD1 protein

==Neuroradiological findings==
*Ventricular abnormalities (prominence of trigone, prominent occipital horns, ventriculomegaly)
*Midline defects and absence or hypoplasia of corpus collosum

==Growth and Feeding==
*Feeding problems common in neonatal period
*Most LGA (most evident in length and in head circumference)
*Height and head circumference most significantly larger and run parallel to growth curve but sig. above 97th centile
*Excess growth mostly in limbs rather than trunk
*Girls in UK population were an average of 6.2 cm above calculated target height based on parental heights, but were within usual height range
*Boys height less predictable and greater tendency for increased adult stature

==Development, learning, behavior==
*Almost all have developmental delay and cognitive impairment (may be selection bias because this is used as diagnostic criteria)
*Behavioral problems common
*Poor concentration and ADHD common
*Difficulty with social interactions results in tendency to associate with younger children and social isolation later in life
*Reliance on routines common in many children
*May have impetuous behavior
*Poor sleep patterns common
*Unusual anxiety and subsequent phobias commonly reported

==Neurological==
*Hypotonia usually present from birth but improves during childhood
*Poor coordination and delayed motor skills primarily gross motor (swimming is sport many succeed in)
*Febrile convulsions in almost 50%
*Almost half with febrile seizure will go on to have nonfebrile seizures
*Seizures managed same as in other children/adults

==Immune system==
*Infections very common in early childhood
*Recurrent OM and potential conductive hearing loss
*Urinary tract infections in up to 20% (caused by structural abnormalities and reflux usually)

==Eye problems==
*poorly documented
*Refractive errors and strabismus (less common, glaucoma and nystagmas reported)
*Regular evaluations

==Dental abnormalities (common)==
*Early teeth eruption (54%)
*Excessive wear and discoloration
*Teeth may be crooked due to changes in craniofacial structure and many require orthodontic work

==Heart problems==
(thought to be rare)
*Overt congenital heart disease is thought to be rare may be up to 10%
*Most common are ASD, VSD, PDA
*Routine echo not necessary

==Malignant tumors==
(rare, but may occur in approximately 2-4% of individuals with Sotos syndrome)
*Embryonal tumors
*Neuroblastoma
*Mephroblastoma
*Hepatoblastoma
*Age of onset is wide and no clear benefit from surveillance

==Musculoskeletal==
*Hypotonia, large size, joint laxity can cause complications
*Foot deformities (~50%)
*Flat feet common
*Kyphoscoliosis

==GI==
*Tendency for severe constipation in over 10%

==Main Psychosocial Considerations==
*Intellectual, social, and emotional maturity may evolve on widely different timetables
*How is school going? (confirm that she is in 4th grade and ask specifically about math and language skills)
*Does she have a new IEP since last visit?
*Is she getting the help you would like her to?
*Math tutoring and speech therapy?
*How is attention and behavior?
*Assess social relationships (is she being teased or socially isolated)
*Any changes in the family?
*Confirm number of siblings

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Number of other generalized overgrowth syndromes
*Sotos syndrome is distinguished from others by presence of developmental delay and characteristic facial features.
*Other overgrowth syndromes have other commonly associated characteristics that also aid in distinction

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA1)'''

SMA is the number one genetic killer of children under the age of 2

==Introduction==
*Establish rapport with small talk and introduce myself
*Assess the concerns of the family and what they hope to learn today
*Ascertain the level of understanding of SMA
*Briefly discuss the topics to be discussed during the appointment
*Ask if anyone has any questions

==Elicit Family History and Pedigree==

==Definition==
*Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of inherited neuromuscular diseases that attack motor neurons, which control the movement of voluntary muscles. This disease causes anterior horn cells (lower motor neurons) in the base of the brain and spinal cord to gradually disintegrate.

==Types of SMA==
*Prior to the availability of molecular diagnosis, SMA was classified into subgroups. These subgroup classifications are useful for prognosis and management.
*Infantile progressive spinal muscular atrophy (SMA 1)
*Intermediate SMA (SMA 2)
*Juvenile SMA (SMA 3)
*Adult SMA (SMA 4)
*These forms differ in the age of onset, the severity, the progression rate, and in the adult form, the muscles affected.

==Etiology==
*Mode of inheritance:
**SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder
*Chromosome location:
**Chromosomal locus 5q11-q13
*Molecular Genetics:
**SMN (survival motor neuron) has been identified as the primary SMA-determining gene
***The SMN gene is very complex, containing repetitive sequences, pseudogenes, deletions and inverted duplications
***2 copies exist: the telomeric copy (SMNT ) and the centromeric copy (SMNC)
***These only differ by a few nucleotides
***Unaffected individuals have 2 copies arranged in tandem on each chromosome 5 (centromeric and telomeric)
**A defect in both copies of the SMNT gene causes SMA
**Individuals with SMA are either:
***Homozygous for a deletion of exon 7 of the SMNT gene (95% of cases) or
***Compound heterozygotes for a deletion of exon 7 of the SMNT gene and a subtle intragenic mutation of SMN T (5% of cases)
**Abnormal protein product is produced by mutant SMN T
***Normal gene products are thought to play a role in splicing; it has been shown to be necessary for pre-mRNA splicing

==Incidence==
*One study suggests that SMA occurs at a frequency of ~4: 100,000
*1:40-1:80 are carriers for SMA

==Clinical Features (general for all types of SMA)==
*Progressive degeneration and loss of the lower motor neurons (anterior horn cells) in the spinal cord and sometimes in the brainstem nuclei.
**Results in muscle weakness and atrophy
**The onset varies from before birth until adulthood
**The weakness is symmetric and progressive
*Contractures, usually mild
*Anterior horn cell involvement, apparent due to tongue fasciculations and absent deep tendon reflexes
*Respiratory failure
*Variable cranial nerve involvement: opthalmoplegia, facial diplegia

==Additional Specific SMA1Clinical Features==
*Lack of motor development
*Infants with the gravest prognosis have sucking and swallowing difficulty
*Face muscles are completely spared
*Ocular and diaphragmatic muscles are involved late in the disease
*The heart is normal
*Intellect is normal
*Prognosis depends primarily upon respiratory function

==Risk Assessment==
*~98% of parents of an affected child are carriers, and ~2% are not carriers, thus the mutation was de novo
*The risk of occurrence/recurrence for parents who are both carriers is 25%, while the risk of having an unaffected carrier child is 50%.

==Age of Onset, natural history and life span==
*The age of onset for SMA1 is before 6 months
*The lifespan is two years or less

==Testing==
*Diagnostic: A direct DNA analysis to detect a homozygous deletion of exon 7 of SMNT is used to confirm a clinical diagnosis.
**This test has one limitation, it does not detect intragenic mutations
**If only one deletion SMNT is present, this does not confirm a clinical diagnosis but supports a clinical diagnosis.
*Carrier: Dosage testing for carrier detection. This PCR test determines the # of exon 7 containing SMNT gene copies that are present in an individual.
**Both technical and interpretation limitations for this test
***Some carriers have 2 SMNT gene copies on one chromosome
***Some carriers have one normal allele and a subtle mutation
***de novo mutations occur in 2% of SMA patients, meaning that only one parent is a carrier
*Prenatal: this test is possible for fetuses at a 25% risk when the disease causing SMN mutations in both parents is known
**Analysis of fetal DNA obtained via CVS or amnio
*If the SMNT gene is normal, two other tests are available:
**Neurophysiologic studies-electromyography (EMG). This reveals devervation and diminished motor potential amplitude.
**Muscle biopsy- reveals evidence of devervation with no other structural abnormalities.

==Management==
*Physical therapy and occupational therapy to promote and maintain motor skills
*Monitoring of respiratory function, ventilatory support (usually not used for SMA1 patients)
*SMA1 patients that aren't sucking or swallowing well may need a gastrostomy (g-tube)

==Differential Diagnosis==
*SMA1 is considered in the differential diagnosis of the &quot;floppy child
*Prader-Willi syndrome
*Pompe's disease (when cardiomegaly is present)
*Congenital myotonic dystrophy
*Congenital muscular dystrophy

==Psychosocial Issues==
*The parents,grandparents and immediate family have an impending death (patients with SMA1) and are typically having a difficult time dealing with the severity of the disease.
*Counselors should encourage parents to discuss their feelings and concerns.
*As this disease is very draining on the parents,grandparents and immediate family, the counselor should check on the support network available to the family.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spontaneous Pregnancy Loss and X-chromosome Inactivation'''

==General Information about Pregnancy Loss==
*Common problem
**Approximately 50% of all conceptions spontaneously lost
**Often occurs before pregnancy is diagnosed
**Miscarriage occurs in 20% of confirmed pregnancies
*Recurrent pregnancy loss affects 1 in 100 (1%) of couples who wish to have children
*Potential causes of pregnancy loss
**Most miscarriages due to sporadic chromosome abnormalities
**About 50% of women experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss of &quot;non-genetic&quot; explanation
***Anatomical problems of female reproductive tract
***Infectious diseases
***Hormonal problems
**About 20% of women with recurrent pregnancy loss may have a mutation on their X-chromosome causing skewed X-inactivation
**Many couples have no explanation for their recurrent pregnancy loss

==Skewed X-Chromosome Inactivation (SXCI)==
*Pattern of X-inactivation weighted heavily toward one chromosome
**Would expect random inactivation to inactivate each chromosome about 50% of the time
**Highly skewed is defined as &gt;90% of cells with same active X-chromosome
*May be caused by mutation in an essential gene on one X-chromosome that causes the chromosome to be selected against by the body
**Mutation probably causes the cells that express it to have a growth disadvantage
**The gene must be essential so that cells die when it doesn't function properly
*Usually causes no health problems in females
**If other X-chromosome also has an X-linked recessive mutation, female will be a manifesting carrier
**Have seen women with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Lesch-Nyhan, and hemophilia that are as severely affected as men
**Mutation on active X-chromosome can be new mutation inherited from father's sperm or mutation that affects her father also
*Mutation that causes skewed X-inactivation inherited from mother's side
**May be family history of pregnancy loss on mothers side affecting male conceptions
***Studies show consistently more females in families with skewed X-inactivation than males
***Mutation lethal in males who don't have second X-chromosome to compensate
**Females with SXCI have 32% risk to lose pregnancy compared to 15% risk in general population
**In families with SXCI, females who inherit their mother's inactive X will inactivate the same X chromosome

==X-Chromosome Inactivation Study (X-CIS)==
*Coordinated by Dr. Eric Hoffman at Children's National Medical Center In Washington, DC and Dr. Allen Hogge at Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh
*Will conduct linkage studies on families that show heritable highly skewed XCI and have enough members for significant LOD score
*Participation requirements (Must have one of the following)
**Women who have had more than 1 miscarriage
**Women with at least one spontaneous abortion of a male conceptus
**Manifesting carriers of X-linked recessive disorders or asymptomatic carriers of X-linked dominant disorders
**Females with X-chromosome rearrangements, including X-autosome translocations, deletions, duplications, inversions
*Sample requirements
**Send 7-10 ml blood in 2 purple top (EDTA) tubes at room temperature
**Send overnight mail
**Cost of blood draw and shipping covered by research lab
**Lab will supply kits including vacutainers upon request
*When sending blood, include pedigree, completed intake form, and any pertinent clinical information
*Requires signed consent form for each participant
*Results take 3-5 weeks
*Linkage studies will be done on families of females with highly skewed XCI in more than two generations

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Stickler Syndrome'''

==Introductions==

==Contracting==
*What is your understanding of why your doctor referred you to see us?
*Do you have any questions or concerns?
*You are probably already familiar with Stickler syndrome since you have it yourself, but your doctor probably just wanted to make sure you understand the chance for your child to have it as well as the potential for a child to have different characteristics or symptoms than you.
*We also may have the ability to do prenatal testing to see if your fetus has Stickler syndrome.
*Is this something you are interested in?
*Establish an agenda: Obtain medical and family history to determine if there are any other risks that we might want to talk about, answer any questions you might have about Stickler syndrome, discuss risks

==Elicit Family History==
*Are there any other members of the family who have a diagnosis if Stickler syndrome
*Any family members with cleft palate, recurrent ear infections, nearsightedness, blindness, cataracts, glaucoma, astigmatism, early-onset arthritis, hyperextendable joints, joint replacements in the 30-40s, joint stiffness, hearing impairment (high-tone?), mitral valve prolapse, or a flatened midface
*Anyone die young or unexpectedly
*Anyone with Mental retardation/learning difficulties
*Birth defects (heart defects, CL/CP, spina bifida)
*Chronic illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease
*Anyone with cancer diagnosed at a young age (before 50)

==Stickler Syndrome (a.k.a. hereditary artho-ophthalmopathy)==
*A connective tissue disorder that can affect the ocular (eyes), craniofacial (formation of facial structures), audiologic (hearing), cardiovascular (heart), and skeletal systems.
*Connective tissue (CT) is the most plentiful protein in the body and acts as support tissue. CT can allow for elastic stretching and tightening, especially in the muscles.
*Prevalence: 1/7500 - 1/10,000 - often goes undiagnosed in individuals with mild symptoms
*Affects both sexes

==Clinical Description==
*Symptoms vary from patient to patient, even within the same family)
*Patients do not usually have all the symptoms!!
*Features include:
*Ophthalmologic
**Congenital or early-onset cataracts.
**Myopia (non-progressive, detectable in newborn period) - can lead to retinal detachment, which can result in blindness.
**Glaucoma
**Vitreal anomalies (gel that fills the eye).
***Type 1 characterized by a persistence of a vestigial vitreous gel in the retrolental space and is bordered by a folded membrane, present at birth.
***Type 2 is much less common, and is characterized by sparse and irregularly thickened bundles throughout the vitreous cavity, have milder ocular findings.
***Types of vitreal fluid anomalies breed true within families.
*Craniofacial
**Midface hypoplasia
**Depressed nasal bridge (in childhood)
**Anteverted nares (upturned nose)
**Bifid uvula, submucous cleft, or cleft palate
**Robin sequence (micrognathia, cleft palate, and glossoptosis)
*Audiologic
**Hearing impairment (40%) - degree of impairment (typically high one) is variable and may be progressive.
**Sensorineural hearing loss (common)
**Conductive hearing loss can also be seen.
*Skeletal (problems tend to worsen with age)
**Short stature as compared to unaffected siblings
**Marfanoid body habitus without tall stature
**Hypermobility
**Joint laxity (becomes less prominent with age)
**Mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia
**Precocious osteoarthritis - joint pain in childhood may signify the onset, can be a major complication in adulthood.
**Scoliosis
*Mitral Valve Prolapse (45-50%) - occurs when the heart valve shuts and then protrudes into the next chamber.
*Possible learning difficulties due to sight and hearing problems/

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical diagnosis
*At present, no consensus minimal clinical diagnostic criteria exist.
**A point system was developed to aid in the diagnosis by Rose et al. 2000.
*Molecular testing not reliable for making the diagnosis, only confirmatory.

==Management==
*Eye
**Ophthalmology evaluation - at least annual starting in infancy.
**-Prescribe corrective lenses as early as possible
**-Prophylactic laser photocoagulation of vitreoretinopathy.
**Surgery as needed to remove cataracts or repair detachments.
**Avoid activities such as contact sports which may lead to retinal detachment.
**Patients should be aware of symptoms associated with retinal detachment.
*Hearing Loss
**Baseline audiogram.
**Hearing can be progressive, so follow-up evals are recommended.
*Arthropy
**Full skeletal eval including x-rays for mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia.
**Treatment is symptomatic with anti-inflammatory meds.
**Possible avoidance of high-impact activities.
*Cleft palate
**Deal with growth and feeding issues - bottle feed baby in seated position, use special bottles, frequent weight checks.
**Otolaryngology/craniofacial eval
**Test hearing regularly
**Treat otitis media aggressively, possibly PE tubes
**Cleft palate surgery ~9 months
**Eventual speech therapy.
*Mitral valve prolapse
**Screening for MVP with ECHO
**If MVP exists, need antibiotic prophylaxis for certain surgical procedures.

==Genetics==
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
*Recurrence risk is 50% for each child of an affected parent.
*Prevalence of new gene mutations unknown
*Disease causing mutations in genes COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2, but some families are not linked to any of these loci.
*COL2A1 gene (cause in 75% of families)
**Typically have type 1 vitreous anomaly and a high risk for retinal detachment, normal hearing or mild SNHL, and early-onset arthritis.
*COL11A1
**Typically have type 2 vitreous anomaly and more severe hearing loss
*COL11A2
**Causes &quot;anocular&quot; Stickler syn because protein is not expressed in the eye -a.k.a oto-spondylo-megaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED).

==Molecular Testing==
*Clinical testing available for COL2A1 and COL11A1
**Tulane University Health Sciences Center
Matrix DNA Diagnostics Laboratory New Orleans, LA
**Contact: Charlene Crain, MBA, BSMT (ASCP)
**email:ccrain@tulane.edu phone: (504) 988-7706 fax: (504) 988-7704
**Methodology: Direct DNA
*Research testing may be available for COL11A2 and mutations in unknown loci
*Geneclinics

==Pregnancy and Testing==
*Option of prenatal testing exists for fetuses at 50% risk for Stickler syndrome if a mutation in COL2A1 or COL11A1 has been identified in the affected parent
*molecular testing performed either on sample from chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at about 10-12 weeks' gestation or amniocentesis at 16-18 weeks' gestation.
*Alternatively, or in conjunction with molecular genetic testing, ultrasound can be performed at 19-20 weeks gestation to detect cleft palate,
*HOWEVER not all individuals with Stickler have cleft palate and cleft palates is difficult to detect on ultrasound
*Detection somewhat dependent on position of the fetus

==Psychosocial Counseling==
*Discuss patient experience with Stickler syndrome and perceived burden
*Discuss unaffected husband/partner's comfort-level with the diagnosis.
*Assess whether they are concerned about having a child with Stickler syndrome?
*Assess patient support systems.
*Address potential feelings of guilt.
*Assess whether she would like information about online support group

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tamoxifen - Selective Estrogen Response Modifiers (SERMS)'''

Risk Reduction Agents for Breast Cancer

==Why Estrogen is Important==
*Estrogen is a sex steroid hormone important for many physiologic processes
**Affects growth, differentiation, and function of reproductive system
**Maintains bone density and protects against osteoporosis
**Thought to be cardioprotective, largely through its effects on blood lipids
**Regulates reproductive behavior by effects in the brain
*Estrogen effects are mediated through their binding to nuclear proteins called estrogen receptors (ER)
**Binding activates receptor dimerization which activates or represses transcription depending on other tissue specific co-factors
***ER-mediated transcription is stimulated through at least 2 transactivation domains called AF-1 and AF-2 (AF-1 is hormone-independent, whereas AF-2 is hormone-dependent)
**There are two types of estrogen receptors: ER-alpha and ER-beta
***The exact role of ER-beta in breast cancer is unknown
***The role of ER-alpha is well defined
****Maximum transcriptional activation requires both AF-1 and AF-2
*Prolonged stimulation of breast ductal epithelium by estrogen can contribute to the development and progression of breast cancer
**The role of hormone therapy in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer was first demonstrated in 1895 by Dr. George Beatson in Glasgow, Scotland
***He performed a bilateral oophorectomy in a 33 year old woman with advanced cancer who lived 4 years before dying of recurrent disease
**Approximately 50%-70% of women benefit from hormonal therapy if their tumors are positive for both ER and PR (progesterone)
**Only 11% benefit if their tumors are negative for both types

==What is a Selective Estrogen Response Modifier (SERM)?==
*SERMS have estrogen agonist effects in some tissues and antagonist effects in others
**SERMS bind competitively to the ERs; AF-2 is not activated, but AF-1 remains active and receptor dimerization and nuclear localization occur
**SERMS can initiate transcription in the presence of certain accessory proteins and result in the expression of some estrogen-responsive genes
**The effect depends on the tissue and the gene
***Ideally, we want an anti-estrogen effect in the breast and endometrium and estrogenic effects on lipid profiles, the CNS, skeletal, vagina and cardiovascular systems.
****It is the anti-estrogenic effects in the CNS and vagina that cause menopausal side effects
*Three categories of SERMS
**Triphenylethylene derivatives like tamoxifen
**Other nonsteroidal compounds like raloxifene
**Steroidal compounds that have more complete antiestrogenic activity

==Tamoxifen (Nolvadex; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals)==
*History and Background
**Synthesized in the 1960s
**The first chemotherapy to be approved for the prevention of any cancer
**Approved by the FDA in 1977 for treatment of advanced breast cancer
***Has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer as well as adjuvant treatment in post-menopausal patients following mastectomy, axillary dissection, and breast irradiation
***Indicated as preventative treatment to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in high-risk patients and to reduce the risk of contralateral breast cancer
***Most effective in patients who are ER+, PR+, and postmenopausal
***Approved dose is 20mg daily for 5 years
****Taking tamoxifen for longer than 5 years is not thought to be more effective than 5 years of therapy
***Also used to treat men who have breast cancer
**Approved in 1998, for reducing incidence of breast cancer in high-risk women
***Approximately 1/3 of ER+ cancers are resistant to Tamoxifen
*The Estrogen Effects of Tamoxifen
**Anti-estrogen effect in breast, CNS, and vagina mucosa
**Positive estrogen effect in liver (reducing cholesterol), bone, and endometrium
**Acquired tamoxifen resistance is a cause of treatment failure in breast cancer
***The mechanism of acquired tamoxifen resistance is not well defined
***Mouse studies showed that tamoxifen-resistant tumors remained estrogen dependent in vivo but the resistance was associated with the ability of tamoxifen to stimulate tumor growth
****Altered metabolism of tamoxifen was also seen in the tumor
*Preclinical Studies
**Decreased the incidence of mammary tumors in rodents, but increased the risk of liver tumors. There has been no increase in liver cancer in humans.
*Clinical Trials: 3 randomized trials of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent
**National Surgical Adjuvant Bowel and Breast Project (NSABP): Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT)
***A landmark trial that was stopped early by the independent safety monitoring committee due to promising results
***A trial of Tamoxifen (20mg daily for 5 years) versus placebo in 13,388 healthy women at risk for developing invasive breast cancer
****A randomized, prospective, double-blind study that began June 1st 1992
****Enrollment ended September 30, 1997
****Study was terminated and results disclosed March 24, 1998
***Eligibility criteria
****Age 60 or older
****Or age 35-59 with a 5-year predicted risk of developing breast cancer using the Gail model of 1.66%
****Or over 35 years with a diagnosis of lobular carcinoma in situ
***Results:
****With a median follow-up of 54.6 months, tamoxifen decreased the overall risk of developing invasive breast cancer by 49% and non-invasive breast cancer by 50%
*Breakdown of risk reduction:
**44% in women aged 49 years or younger
**51% in women 50-59 years
**55% in women 60 years or older
**56% in women with a history of LCIS
**86% in women with atypical hyperplasia
****The reduction of breast cancer was limited to the reduction of ER+ breast cancer. No difference was seen in the occurrence of ER- tumors
*The occurrence of ER+ tumors was decreased by 69%
****96% of participants were Caucasian
****There was no difference in mortality between the tamoxifen-treated and placebo groups in the trial
*A meta-analysis of 30,000 women in 55 trials with ER+ or unknown tumor status showed a mortality reduction of 26% during 5 years of follow up
**Royal Marsden Tamoxifen Breast Cancer Prevention Study
***From 1986 to 1996, 2494 women were randomized to tamoxifen (20mg daily) or placebo for 8 years
***Eligibility:
****Age between 30 and 70 with at least one first-degree relative under age 50 with breast cancer
****Or one first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer
****Or one affected first-degree relative of any age plus another affected first- or second-degree relative
****Or a benign breast biopsy and a first-degree relative with breast cancer
***Use of hormone replacement therapy was allowed
****41% of women in the study received HRT which is a potential confounding factor
***Results
****At 70 months follow up, no difference in the incidence of breast cancer was seen
**Italian Randomized Trial of Breast Cancer Prevention in Hysterectomized Women
***In 1992, this trial of tamoxifen (20mg daily for 5 years) versus placebo began
***Ended in 1997 with 5408 women with low to normal risk of breast cancer
****The goal was to recruit 20,000 women
****Half of the women recruited had already had an oophorectomy, which is known to reduce the risk of breast cancer, so only 3986 were available for evaluation
***Eligibility: Healthy women age 35-70 who had a hysterectomy
***Results: At median of 46 months follow up, there was no difference in the number of breast cancer cases in treatment versus control arms.
**How do we explain the discrepancy of the 3 trials?
***The studies are dissimilar in design, population enrolled, and eligibility criteria
***The two European trials together, had fewer than half the number of breast cancer cases of the NSABP
***The Italian trial had a high dropout rate
***Royal Marsden study likely had large number of mutation carriers based on eligibility criteria
***BCPT was largest and did not allow HRT: the influence of HRT on the potential effect of tamoxifen chemoprevention is unclear
***There could be differences in compliance
*Benefits of Tamoxifen
**Fewer bony fractures due to slower bone loss
**Lower blood cholesterol
*Risks of Tamoxifen
**Side effects similar to the onset of menopause
***Hot flashes, vaginal discharge, dryness or itching, and irregular menses
***Headaches, fatigue, nausea and/or vomiting, and skin rash
**Serious side effects
***Endometrial cancer (Risk ratio = 2.53 in Tamoxifen group in NSABP trial)
****No endometrial cancer deaths occurred in the NSABP trial
****All endometrial cancers were Stage I
***Deep Vein Thrombosis (1.6x higher in NSABP trial)
***Pulmonary embolism (3x higher in NSABP trial)
***Stroke
***Cataract development
***Most serious adverse events have occurred in women over age 50

==Other SERMS==
*Raloxifene (Evista; Eli Lilly and Co)
**Background
***A nonsteroidal compound; a benzothiophene derivative
***Binds to ER with an affinity equal to that of estradiol
***Unlike Tamoxifen, does not stimulate uterine tissue
****There is a raloxifene response element that was identified in the promoter region of certain genes which could contribute to some of its functional differences
***Has estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood clotting
**The MORE (Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation) Study
***Study Design
****7704 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were followed for a median of 40 months
*Women taking estrogen or who had a history of breast cancer were excluded
****Randomized, double-blind study of raloxifene (60mg or 120mg per day) versus placebo
***Results
****The primary endpoint was that raloxifene reduced the risk of osteoporosis progressing as seen by the preservation of bone mineral density, the reduction of bone turnover, and the decreased incidence of vertebral fractures
*Approved in the US in 1997 for the prevention of osteoporosis
****Raloxifene also decreased the incidence of invasive breast cancers by 76% among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis during 3 years of treatment
*The risk reduction was similar for both doses of raloxifene and was confined to ER+ tumors
*13 cases of breast cancer were confirmed among the 5129 women assigned to raloxifene versus 27 among the 2576 women assigned to the placebo (RR=0.24)
*Raloxifene decreased the risk of ER+ breast cancer by 90%
****Raloxifene increased the risk of venous thromboembolic disease (RR=3.1), but did not increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
**Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial
***Large, multi-institutional, randomized, double-blind study for breast cancer prevention in postmenopausal women which began in June 1999
***Will randomize 22,000 postmenopausal women at increased risk for developing breast cancer to tamoxifen (20mg daily) or raloxifene (60mg daily) for 5 years
****Women must be postmenopausal and at least 35 years old
****Increased risk is defined as LCIS treated by local excision only or at least a 1.66% projected 5-year probability of developing invasive breast cancer
***Designed to see if raloxifene is more or less effective than tamoxifen in reducing the chance of developing breast cancer in women at increased risk of developing the disease
***STAR trial information
****NCI (800) 422-6237 or cancertrials.nci.nih.gov
****NSABP www.nsabp.pitt.edu
****Anticipated time of final analysis is 2006
**NCI pilot trial is being done to evaluate the safety of 2 years of raloxifene therapy in high-risk premenopausal women.
*Toremifene (Fareston: Schering Corp)
**Very similar to tamoxifen; also a triphenylethylene; differs by only a single chlorine atom
**First synthesized in 1981; first clinical trials done in 1982
**Trials have been done to compare tamoxifen and toremifene
***Response rates are similar
****Median times to progression and overall survival were not significantly different
***Some studies have found a slightly higher incidence of undesirable effects in the tamoxifen treatment group, but these differences are not statistically significant
***There is no clinical data to imply that it causes endometrial carcinoma, although it may unmask pre-existing endometrial tumors
**Approved for use as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer in 1997 in the U.S.

==Chemoprevention for BRCA1/2 Mutation Carriers==
*Will Tamoxifen be as effective in mutation carriers as it is in other women who are at increased risk of breast cancer?
**The risk of BRCA1 tumors appears to be associated with estrogen related risk factors and oophorectomy reduces risk of hereditary breast cancer suggesting tamoxifen may be effective
**From 10 studies, 83% of BRCA1 breast tumors have been found to be ER-, whereas 76% of BRCA2 breast tumors were ER+
**If chemoprevention is needed for at least 10 years to produce and effect, new chemoprevention agents will need to be developed for women in their 30s, as the breast cancer risk curves are steepest between 40 and 50 years of age.
*Mary-Claire King's report of the NSABP trial (2001)
**The main outcome measure was to compare the incidence of breast cancer among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who were receiving tamoxifen versus placebo
**Design and Method
***Peripheral white blood cells were stored from study participants in the NSABP trial in anticipation of the identification of BRCA1/2
***Genomic analysis of BRCA1/2 was done for 288 breast cancer cases
****19 carriers were identified
****5/8 BRCA1 mutation carriers had taken tamoxifen
*RR=1.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-10.7
****3/11 BRCA2 mutation carriers had taken tamoxifen
*RR=0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-1.56
***The power to detect a moderate protective effect was low
**The results were not statistically significant
***Tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers by 62%, but did not reduce the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers
****Must consider that tamoxifen use began at age 35 or older
****It is not known if tamoxifen use at a younger age would reduce breast cancer incidence in BRCA1 mutation carriers.
**King concludes that for women who have not yet developed breast cancer, genotype at BRCA1 and BRCA2 has a major impact on the expected effect of tamoxifen in reducing incidence of primary breast cancer
*Steven Narod's case-control study (2000)
**Results contrast with the results of the NSABP trial, but sample size is much greater
**The aim of the study was to see if tamoxifen protects against contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers since it is known to do so in the general population
**Study Design
***Compared 209 women with bilateral breast cancer and BRCA1/2 mutations (cases) and 384 women with unilateral breast cancer and BRCA1/2 mutations (controls) in a matched case-control study.
**Results
***Tamoxifen use was reported by 10.5% of the 209 bilateral cases and 21.1% of the 384 unilateral controls
***Tamoxifen protected against contralateral breast cancer for carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations
***In women who used tamoxifen for 2-4 years, the risk of contralateral breast cancer was reduced by 75%

==The Future of Chemoprevention==
*To develop hormonally active agents with more favorable toxicity profiles
**Currently SERMS, aromatase inhibitors, and novel hormonal contraceptive regimens are being researched
***Anti-estrogen drugs called ERDs are estrogen receptor down-regulators and act by decreasing the number of active estrogen receptors on a cell or by decreasing their level of responsiveness to estrogen
****On April 25th 2002, the FDA approved an ERD called Faslodex (fulvestrant) for postmenopausal women with advanced ER+ disease for whom tamoxifen is no longer effective
*Given as a monthly intramuscular injection
*Side effects:
**Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, headache, and hot flashes
***Aromatase inhibitors
****They lower the amount of estrogen being produced by the body, rather than block estrogen's ability to &quot;turn on&quot; cancer cells
****In post-menopausal women, androgen is converted to estrogen by aromatase
****Aromatase inhibitors block this conversion and are often used by women who have already tried other anti-estrogen therapies
****Examples
*Arimidex (anastrozole)
*Femara (letrozole)
*Aromasin (exemestane)
*To develop agents for the prevention of ER- breast cancer
**Approximately 1/3 of invasive cancers are ER-
**Women under 50 years old are more than twice as likely to have an ER- tumor as women over 50
**Do the majority of pre-cancerous mammary epithelial cells progress from an estrogen-dependent phenotype to an estrogen-independent phenotype later in the carcinogenesis process? Or does it arise de novo?
*To define the precise molecular changes that characterize the progression of a normal breast epithelial cell through premalignancy and malignancy
**Then can search for agents to reverse these changes or prevent malignant transformation from occurring
*To develop biological markers of breast cancer risk and progression
**Biomarkers could be used to refine short-term risk assessments
**Could be used to predict response to specific classes of preventive agents

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tay-Sachs Disease'''

==Contracting==
*Establish rapport with small talk
*Assess the understanding for the referral to genetics
*Assess the concerns of the family and what they hope to learn today
*Ascertain the level of understanding of Tay-Sachs for those members present
*Discuss topics to be covered during the appointment
*Ask if anyone has any questions

==Elicit Medical History==

==Elicit Family History and Pedigree==

==What is Tay-Sachs Disease (TSD)?==
*Also called Hexosaminidase A deficiency
*A genetic disorder that commonly affects the Ashkenazi Jewish population
*Hexosaminidase A is a lysosomal enzyme that is required to catalyze one step in the catabolism of gangliosides.
*The lack of hexosaminidase A results in the faulty metabolism of sphingolipids
*A specific sphingolipid, GM2 ganglioside accumulates in the cells, especially nerve and brain cells
*Death usually occurs before age 4 in the infantile type of disease
*Juvenile, chronic, and adult onset forms of the disorder also exist
*No specific therapy is currently available.

==Genetic Etiology==
*Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion
*The chromosomal locus of HEXA is 15q23-q24
*Mutations in the HEXA gene are associated with the Tay-Sachs phenotype

==Molecular Genetics==
*The HEXA gene is ~35 kb, has 14 exons and both 5' and 3' UTRs
*The normal gene product is Beta-hexosaminidase alpha chain
**The gene encodes the alpha chain of the heterodimeric protein, beta-hexosaminidase A (HEX A)
**The protein has a single alpha chain and a single beta chain; both HEX A and HEX B show GM2 ganglioside cleaving acitivity, but that of HEX A is 8x greater than HEX B
**The gene for HEX B is located on chromosome 5; this subunit is responsible for most of the catalytic activity
*More than 90 HEXA mutations have been identified
**The majority are associated with the infantile phenotype
**2 null mutations result in 90-95% of the cases of infantile Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
*The abnormal gene product: mutations result in many effects ranging from processing or subunit assembly to defective catalytic activity

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*1:3600 Ashkenazi Jewish live births.
*The carrier rate is 1:25-30 Ashkenazi Jewish persons
*The carrier rate for the French-Canadian population is 1:50
*Among non-Jews, the disease incidence is about 100 times less common and the carrier rate is 1:250-1:300.
*As the result of extensive genetic counseling of carriers identified through screening programs and the monitoring of at risk pregnancies, the incidence of TSD has been reduced by greater than 90%.

==Risk Assessment==
*If both parents are carriers, the risk of occurrence is 25% with each pregnancy
*If either or both parents are carriers, the risk to have a carrier child is 50% for each pregnancy
*When both parents are carriers, unaffected children have a 67% risk of being carriers.

==Age of Onset and Life Span==
*Onset at age 3-6 months
*Death before the age of 4

==Clinical Features==
*Hexosaminidase A deficiency is characterized by:
**Progressive weakness and loss of motor skills beginning between 3-6 months
**Decreased attentiveness
**Increased startle response
**A cherry red spot of the fovea centralis of the macula of the retina can be seen in &gt;90% of cases
**Hyperreflexia with sustained ankle clonus
*These signs are followed by:
**Progressive neurodegeneration
**Seizures
**Blindness, typically by the end of the 8th month of life
**Spasticity of the limbs
**An increase in head circumference often reaches 3 standard deviations above normal due to an enlargement of the brain NOT hydrocephalus
**Progressive inability to swallow
**Breathing difficulties
*Juvenile, chronic and adult-onset forms have later onset, slower progression, and more variable neurologic findings

==Testing==
*Diagnostic (Biochemical)
**The diagnosis of TSD relies upon the absence or near absence of HEX A in the serum or WBC of a symptomatic individual in the presence of normal or elevated activity of HEX B isoenzyme
**If the HEX A activity is undetectable= homozygote, affected
*Carrier (Biochemical)
**In population screening, assay of HEX A activity in serum or leukocytes using synthetic substrates provides a simple, inexpensive and accurate method for heterozygote identification
**Serum is used for males and women who are not pregnant and not using oral contraceptives
**Leukocytes are used for testing pregnant women, women using oral contraceptives and any individual whose serum activity level was in the inconclusive range.
**If the HEX A activity is ~1/2 the normal level=heterzygote, carrier
*Molecular Genetic Testing:
**Used to identify specific disease-causing alleles in affected individuals and to distinguish pseudodeficiency alleles from disease-causing alleles in individuals with apparent deficiency of HEX A activity identified through screening programs
**Mutation analysis is available for the 6 most common mutations at most clinical laboratories
***Comprised of three null alleles (non expressing) +TATC1278, +1IVC12, +1IVS9, which in the homozygous state or in compound heterozygosity are associated with TSD
***The G269S allele, which is associated with the adult onset form of TSD in the homozygous state or in compound heterozygosity with a null allele
***And two pseudodeficiency alleles R247W and R249W, which are not associated with the neurological disease, but are associated with reduced degradation of synthetic substrate when HEX A activity is determined
*Pseudodeficiency alleles reduce HEX A activity toward synthetic substrates, but not toward the natural substrate GM2 ganglioside
*Since all assays use artificial substrate, a potential problem arises when distinguishing between a true deficient allele and a pseudodeficient allele.
*Problem avoided by using a DNA-based test on any individual who had abnormal activity to identify the disease causing mutation
*Prenatal
**Available when:
***HEX A enzyme assay has shown both parents to be carriers for TSD and molecular genetics has ruled out the possibility of pseudodeficient alleles in either parent
***If one parent is known to be a heterozygote and the other parent has inconclusive enzymatic activity and no disease-causing mutation can be found
***And if the mother is a known carrier and the father's status is unknown or he is unavailable for testing
**Testing can be performed by assay of the HEX A activity in fetal cells obtained by CVS or amniocentesis
**If the mutation has been identified in both parents, then mutational analysis of the HEXA gene in fetal DNA (extracted from fetal cells removed by CVS or amniocentesis) can be done.

==Management and Treatment==
*Treatment for TSD is primarily supportive
*Provide adequate nutrition and hydration
*Manage infectious disease
*Protect the airway
*Control seizures with anticonvulsant medications, alter dose based on severity and type of seizure
*As the patient becomes more disabled, good bowel management is important
*Older patients with the adult-onset form may need antidepressants or antipsychotic therapy
*Enzyme and gene therapy:
**Attempts have been unsuccessful
**Infusions and bone marrow transpantation have had no benefit
**CNS enzyme replacement are in the experimental stage at this time

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Activator deficient TSD
**The enzymatic activity of both HEX A and HEX B is normal
**GM2 ganglioside accumulation occurs due to a deficit of the intralysosomal glycoprotein &quot;GM2 activator&quot; that is required for the degradation of GM2 ganglioside.
**The phenotype is identical to TSD
*The cherry red spot of the fovea centralis of the macula of the retina is seen during the first year of life in patients with Gaucher disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, galactosialidosis, Niemann-Pick type A, and Sandhoff disease
*Neurologic regression during the first 6 months of life is seen in many disorders including: Krabbe disease, Canavan disease, Alexander disease, infantile Gaucher disease, and both infantile and late infantile forms of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis.
*Sandoff disease presents with the same neurological findings as TSD, although it is rarely seen in Jewish infants.
*For the adult form- SMA3, Friedreich ataxia, ALS and other lysosomal storage diseases should be considered

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Impending death
*Devastating disease
*Contemplation of pregnancy termination
*Guilt

==Prevention==
*Heterozygote detection
*Population-based screens for Ashkenazi Jews
*Therapeutic termination

Entropy is the measure of disorder in a system.

==An Example==

First, let's examine a non-chemistry example.  Say you have one card from a deck of playing cards.  It can have one of 52 possible values.  Now you pick up four more cards.  If the deck were shuffled randomly, the odds of you holding, say, a &quot;straight flush&quot; are 0.00154%.  The odds of having a &quot;high card&quot;, which is essentially a &quot;nothing&quot; hand, is 50.12%.  In the case of a straight flush, the cards you are holding are highly organized.  They must be in a specific, exact pattern (like 10 9 8 7 6 of the same suit).  To have a high card, no two cards must have the same rank and the cards cannot be in order.

There is a very low probability of having a straight flush because the cards are in a very orderly state.  There is a large probability of having &quot;nothing&quot; because the cards are in a random, disorderly state.  In our card-playing system, straight flushes have '''low entropy''' because they are so orderly.  &quot;Nothing&quot; hands have '''high entropy''' because they are disorderly and random.  Furthermore, it takes minimal effort to toss all the cards in the air and randomize their order.  Increasing the entropy of the system comes naturally.  On the other hand, sorting the cards in order takes time and effort.  It does not happen randomly.  Decreasing the entropy of the system is unnatural and takes effort, or energy.

=== In Chemistry ===

The entropy of a chemical system is a measure of its disorder or chaos.  More precisely, it is a measure of the ''dispersion of energy''.  A solid has low entropy (low chaos, orderly) because the molecules are locked into a rigid structure.  Their energy is not dispersed freely.  A gas has high entropy (high chaos, disorderly) because the molecules are free to move about randomly.  The energy of the system is dispersed over a large area with unlimited possibilities of the location of each molecule.

{{SideBox|Absolute zero can never be achieved.}}
As temperature decreases, so does entropy.  Theoretically, at '''absolute zero''' (0 K, or -273 °C), the entropy of the system would be zero.  This is because the solid would be perfectly crystallized so that its energy is not dispersed at all.

As you will soon learn, [[General Chemistry/Thermodynamics/The Second Law of Thermodynamics|the Second Law of Thermodynamics]] tells us that the entropy of the universe always increases.  Think about it.  If you have built a house of cards, the entropy of the system is low.  A house of cards is very orderly, with each card having a very specific location.  The house of cards will undoubtedly collapse.  The resulting pile of cards is very disorderly.  The cards can be in any position and still be a random pile of cards.  The entropy has increased spontaneously.  Houses of cards will spontaneously collapse, but they never spontaneously build themselves up.  This is because high entropy is natural and low entropy is unnatural.

== Entropy Changes ==
When analyzing the entropy change of a chemical reaction, you would need specific numbers.  As a guideline, you can estimate the entropy change based on some basic rules:

{{TextBox|1=
* Melting and boiling ''increases'' entropy
* Freezing and condensing ''decreases'' entropy
* Dissolving a solute ''increases'' entropy
* Forming precipitates ''decreases'' entropy}}

If you do happen to know the absolute entropy of substances in a reaction (by looking it up in a chart), you can calculate the change in entropy.  Entropy is symbolized with &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  The change in entropy is &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt;.  As with enthalpy, the degree symbol (&lt;math&gt;\Delta S^o&lt;/math&gt;) represents STP.  The change in entropy is the absolute entropy of the products minus the absolute entropy of the reactants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are precisely three different classes of three-dimensional constant-curvature geometry: Euclidean, hyperbolic and elliptic geometry. The three geometries are all built on the same first four axioms, but each has a unique version of the fifth axiom, also known as the parallel postulate. The 1868 ''Essay on an Interpretation of Non-Euclidean Geometry'' by Eugenio Beltrami (1835 - 1900) proved the logical consistency of the two Non-Euclidean geometries, hyperbolic and elliptic.

== The Parallel Postulate ==

The parallel postulate is as follows for the corresponding geometries.

'''Euclidean geometry:'''
Playfair's version: &quot;Given a line ''l'' and a point ''P'' not on ''l'', there exists a unique line ''m'' through ''P'' that is parallel to ''l''.&quot; Euclid's version: &quot;Suppose that a line ''l'' meets two other lines ''m'' and ''n'' so that the sum of the interior angles on one side of ''l'' is less than 180°. Then ''m'' and ''n'' intersect in a point on that side of ''l''.&quot; These two versions are equivalent; though Playfair's may be easier to conceive, Euclid's is often useful for proofs.

'''Hyperbolic geometry:'''
Given an arbitrary infinite line ''l'' and any point ''P'' not on ''l'', there exist two or more distinct lines which pass through ''P'' and are parallel to ''l''.

'''Elliptic geometry:'''
Given an arbitrary infinite line ''l'' and any point ''P'' not on ''l'', there does not exist a line which passes through ''P'' and is parallel to ''l''.

== Hyperbolic Geometry ==

Hyperbolic geometry is also known as saddle geometry or Lobachevskian geometry. It differs in many ways to Euclidean geometry, often leading to quite counter-intuitive results. Some of these remarkable consequences of this geometry's unique fifth postulate include:

1. The sum of the three interior angles in a triangle is strictly less than 180°. Moreover, the angle sums of two distinct triangles are not necessarily the same.

2. Two triangles with the same interior angles have the same area.

===Models of Hyperbolic Space===

The following are four of the most common models used to describe hyperbolic space.

1. '''The Poincaré Disc Model'''. Also known as the conformal disc model. In it, the hyperbolic plane is represented by the interior of a circle, and lines are represented by arcs of circles that are orthogonal to the boundary circle and by diameters of the boundary circle. Preserves hyperbolic angles.

2. '''The Klein Model'''. Also known as the Beltrami-Klein model or projective disc model. In it, the hyperbolic plane is represented by the interior of a circle, and lines are represented by chords of the circle. This model gives a misleading visual representation of the magnitude of angles.

3. '''The Poincaré Half-Plane Model'''. The hyperbolic plane is represented by one-half of the Euclidean plane, as defined by a given Euclidean line ''l'', where ''l'' is not considered part of the hyperbolic space. Lines are represented by half-circles orthogonal to ''l'' or rays perpendicular to ''l''. Preserves hyperbolic angles.

4. '''The Lorentz Model'''. Spheres in Lorentzian four-space. The hyperbolic plane is represented by a two-dimensional hyperboloid of revolution embedded in three-dimensional Minkowski space.

===Defining ''Parallel''===

Based on this geometry's definition of the fifth axiom, what does ''parallel'' mean? The following definitions are made for this geometry. If a line ''l'' and a line ''m'' do not intersect in the hyperbolic plane, but intersect at the plane's boundary of infinity, then ''l'' and ''m'' are said to be '''parallel'''. If a line ''p'' and a line ''q'' neither intersect in the hyperbolic plane nor at the boundary at infinity, then ''p'' and ''q'' are said to be '''ultraparallel'''.

===The Ultraparallel Theorem===

For any two lines ''m'' and ''n'' in the hyperbolic plane such that ''m'' and ''n'' are ultraparallel, there exists a unique line ''l'' that is perpendicular to both ''m'' and ''n''.

== Elliptic Geometry ==

Elliptic geometry differs in many ways to Euclidean geometry, often leading to quite counter-intuitive results. For example, directly from this geometry's fifth axiom we have that there exist no parallel lines. Some of the other remarkable consequences of the parallel postulate include: The sum of the three interior angles in a triangle is strictly greater than 180°.

===Models of Elliptic Space===

Spherical geometry gives us perhaps the simplest model of elliptic geometry. Points are represented by points on the sphere. Lines are represented by circles through the points.

      <comment>/* Rayleigh Method */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dimensionless analysis''' is a mathematical technique used to predict physical parameters that influence the flow in fluid mechanics, heat transfer in thermodynamics, and so forth. The analysis involves the fundamental units of dimensions MLT: mass, length, and time. It is helpful in experimental work because it provides a guide to factors that significantly affect the studied phenomena.

Dimensionless analysis is commonly used to determine the relationships between several variables, i.e. to find the force as a function of other variables when an exact functional relationship is unknown. Based on understanding of the problem, we assume a certain functional form.

== Units/Dimensions ==
The defined units are based on the modern MLT system: mass, length, time.  All other quantities can be expressed in terms of these basic units.

For example,

{|
|-
|velocity||m/s||= L/T
|-
|acceleration||m/s&amp;sup2;||= L/T&amp;sup2;
|-
|force||kgm/s&amp;sup2;||= ML/T&amp;sup2;
|}

Where L/T, L/T&amp;sup2;, ML/T&amp;sup2;, etc. are referred to as the derived units.

Another system for dimensionless analysis is the FLT system, the force, length, time system.  In this case, mass &amp;equiv; F/a, which makes the units of mass as FT&amp;sup2;/L, since acceleration has units of L/T&amp;sup2;.

==Rayleigh Method==
An elementary method for finding a functional relationship with respect to a parameter in interest is the Rayleigh Method, and will be illustrated with an example, using the MLT system.

Say that we are interested in the drag, D, which is a force, on a ship.  What exactly is the drag a function of?  These variables need to be chosen correctly, though selection of such variables depends largely on one's experience in the topic.  It is known that drag depends on

{|
|-
|&lt;u&gt;Quantity&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;Symbol&lt;/u&gt;||&lt;u&gt;Dimension&lt;/u&gt;
|-
|Size||l||L
|-
|Viscosity||&amp;mu;||M/LT
|-
|Density||&amp;rho;||M/L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Velocity||V||L/T
|-
|Gravity||g||L/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
This means that ''D = f(l,&amp;rho;,&amp;mu;V,g)'' where ''f'' is some function.

With the Rayleigh Method, we assume that ''D=Cl&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''C'' is a dimensionless constant, and ''a'',''b'',''c'',''d'', and ''e'' are exponents, whose values are not yet known.

Note that the dimensions of the left side, force, must equal those on the right side.  Here, we use only the three independent dimensions for the variables on the right side: M, L, and T.

===Step 1: Setting up the equation===
Write the equation in terms of dimensions only, i.e. replace the quantities with their respective units.  The equation then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ML}{T^2}=(L)^a\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{L^3}\right)^b\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{LT}\right)^c\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T}\right)^d\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T^2}\right)^e&lt;/math&gt;

On the left side, we have ''M&amp;sup1;L&amp;sup1;T&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;'', which is equal to the dimensions on the right side.  Therefore, the exponents of the right side must be such that the units are ''M&amp;sup1;L&amp;sup1;T&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;''

===Step 2: Solving for the exponents===
Equate the exponents to each other in terms of their respective fundamental units:

:M: 1 = b + c                 since M&amp;sup1; = M&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;
:L: 1 = a - 3b - c + d + e    since L&amp;sup1; = L&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;-3b&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;
:T: -2 = -c - d - 2e          since T&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; = T&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;-d&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;-2e&lt;/sup&gt;

It is seen that there are three equations, but 5 unknown variables.  This means that a complete solution cannot be obtained.  Thus, we choose to solve ''a'', ''b'', and ''d'' in terms of ''c'' and ''e''.  These choices are based on experience.  Therefore,

{|
|-
|From M:||b = 1 - c||(i)
|-
|From T:||d = 2 - c - 2e||(ii)
|-
|From L:||a = 1 + 3b + c - d - e||(iii)
|}

Solving (i), (ii), and (iii) simultaneously, we obtain

:a = 2 - c + e

Substituting the exponents back into the original equation, we obtain

:D = Cl&lt;sup&gt;2+e-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;1-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;2-c-2e&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

Collecting like exponents together,
:&lt;math&gt;D=C\displaystyle\left(\frac{V^2}{lg}\right)^{-e}\displaystyle\left(\frac{Vl\rho}{\mu}\right)^{-c}{\rho}l^2V^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which means

:D = Cl&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rho;&amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;-2e&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

For the different exponents,

:Terms with exponent of 1:     C&amp;rho;
:Terms with exponent of 2:     l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:Terms with exponent of e:     l&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;-2e&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{lg}{V^2}\right)^e = \displaystyle\left(\frac{V^2}{lg}\right)^{-e}&lt;/math&gt; (iv)
:Terms with exponent of c:     l&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;-c&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{l{\rho}V}{\mu}\right)^{-c}&lt;/math&gt; (v)

The right sides of (iv) and (v) are known as the dimensionless groups.

===Step 3: Determining the dimensionless groups===
Note that ''e'' and ''c'' are unknown.  Consider the following cases:

:If e = 1     then (iv) becomes &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{lg}{V^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:If e = -1    then (iv) becomes &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{V^2}{lg}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:If c = 1     then (v) becomes &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{\mu}{l{\rho}V}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:If c = -1    then (v) becomes &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left(\frac{l{\rho}V}{\mu}\right) = \displaystyle\left(\frac{lV}{\nu}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

::Where ''&amp;nu;'' is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.

And so on for different exponents.  It turns out that:

:&lt;math&gt;{Reynolds\ Number}\equiv\frac{Vl}{\nu}=N_{R}=Re&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{Froude\ Number}\equiv\displaystyle\left(\frac{V^2}{lg}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{V}{\sqrt{lg}}=N_{F}=Fr&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''Re'' and ''N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''Fr'' are the usual notations for the Reynolds and Froude Numbers respectively.  Such dimensionless groups keep reoccurring throughout Fluid Mechanics and other fields.

Choosing exponents of ''-1'' for ''c'' and ''-&amp;frac12;'' for ''e'', which result in the Reynolds and Froude Numbers respectively, we obtain

:D = g(Fr, Re)&amp;rho;l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:Where g(Fr, Re) is a dimensionless function

This can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{{\rho}l^2V^2}=g(Fr,Re)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is a dimensionless quantity, and a function of only 2 variables instead of 5.
This dimensionless quantity turns out to be the drag coefficient, ''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''.

:&lt;math&gt;C_D\equiv\frac{D}{{\rho}l^2V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Notes===
The Rayleigh Method has limitations because of the premise that an exponential relationship exists between the variables.

==The Buckingham &amp;pi; Theorem/Method==
This method will be illustrated by the same example as that for Rayleigh Method, the drag on a ship.

Say that we have ''n'' number of quantities (e.g. 6 quantities, which are ''D'',''l'',''&amp;rho;'',''&amp;mu;'',''V'', and ''g'') and ''m'' number of dimensions (e.g. 3 dimensions, which are ''M'', ''L'', and ''T'').  These quantities can be reduced to ''(n - m)'' independent dimensionless groups, such as ''Re'' and ''Fr''.

Say that 

:''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = f(A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)''

where ''A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' are quantities such as drag, length, and so forth, as mentioned under the ''n'' number of quantities, and ''f'' implies the functional relationship between ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the other quantities.

Then re-arranging, we obtain

:''0 = f(A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) - A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = f(A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)''

Which can be further reduced, using the Buckingham &amp;pi; Theorem, to obtain

:''0 = f(&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt;)''

===Forming &amp;pi; Groups===
For each &amp;pi; group, take ''m'' of the quantities, ''A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', known as ''m'' repeating variables, and one of the other remaining variables.  Note that experience dictates which quantities make the best repeating variables.

The &amp;pi; groups, in general form, would then be

:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''
:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''
:&amp;#8942;
:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''

which are all dimensionless quantities.

===Step 1: Setup &amp;pi; groups===

For the MLT System, ''m = 3'', so choose ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the repeating variables.

Using the Buckingham &amp;pi; Theorem on the Drag Equation:

:''f(D, l, &amp;rho;, &amp;mu;, V, g) = 0''

Where ''m = 3'', ''n = 6'', so there will be ''n - m = 3'' &amp;pi; groups.

We will select ''&amp;rho;'', ''V'', and ''l'' as the repeating variables (RV), leaving the remaining quantities as ''D'', ''&amp;mu;'', and ''g''.  Note that if the analysis does not work out, we could always go back and repeat using new RVs.  Thus,

:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;D''
:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mu;''
:''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;g''

Which are all dimensionless quantities, i.e. having units of ''M&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''

===Step 2: Determine &amp;pi; groups===
For the first &amp;pi; group,

:&lt;u&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;math&gt;M^0L^0T^0=\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{L^3}\right)^{x_1}\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T}\right)^{y_1}(L)^{z_1}\displaystyle\left(\frac{ML}{T^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding and collecting like units, we can solve for the exponents:

:For M:     0 = x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1               &amp;rArr; x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = -1
:For T:     0 = -y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - 2              &amp;rArr; y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = -2
:For L:     0 = -3x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1   &amp;rArr; z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3(-1) - (-2) - 1 = -2

Therefore, we find that the exponents ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' are -1, -2, and -2 respectively.  This means that the first dimensionless &amp;pi; group, &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is

:&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;rho;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;l&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;D = &lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{{\rho}V^2l^2}&lt;/math&gt;

For the second &amp;pi; group,

:&lt;u&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;math&gt;M^0L^0T^0=\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{L^3}\right)^{x_2}\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T}\right)^{y_2}(L)^{z_2}\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{LT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the exponents,

:For M:     x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1 = 0               &amp;rArr; x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -1
:For T:     -y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - 1 = 0              &amp;rArr; y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -1
:For L:     -3x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - 1 = 0   &amp;rArr; z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 - (-1) + 3(-1) = -1

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2=\rho^{-1}V^{-1}l^{-1}\mu=\frac{\mu}{{\rho}Vl}=\frac{\nu}{Vl}&lt;/math&gt;

However, we will now invert &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2=\frac{Vl}{\nu}=Reynolds\ Number&lt;/math&gt;

It is permissible to exponentiate any &amp;pi; group, e.g. &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;frac12;&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, etc., to form a new group, as this does not alter the functional form.

For the third &amp;pi; group,

:&lt;u&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;math&gt;M^0L^0T^0=\displaystyle\left(\frac{M}{L^3}\right)^{x_3}\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T}\right)^{y_3}(L)^{z_3}\displaystyle\left(\frac{L}{T^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the exponents,

:For M:     x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0                   &amp;rArr; x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
:For T:     -y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - 2 = 0              &amp;rArr; y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = -2
:For L:     -3x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 1 = 0   &amp;rArr; z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = -1 - (-2) = 1

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_3=\rho^0V^{-2}lg=\frac{lg}{V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Raising it to the power of ''-&amp;frac12;'',

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi_3}}=\frac{V}{\sqrt{lg}}=Froude\ Number&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the three &amp;pi; groups can be written together as

:&lt;math&gt;f\displaystyle\left(\frac{D}{{\rho}l^2V^2},Re,Fr\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Finally,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{{\rho}l^2V^2}=f(Re,Fr)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is the same result as obtained with the Rayleigh Method, but with the Buckingham &amp;pi; Method, we did not have to assume a functional dependence.

==Common &amp;pi; Groups==
Using the Buckingham &amp;pi; Theorem, we will now examine the &amp;pi; groups which appear most frequently in fluid dynamics.  Most fluid flow situations depend on the following quantities:

{|
|-
|''l''||length
|-
|''D''||diameter
|-
|''&amp;epsilon;''||surface roughness
|-
|''V''||velocity of flow
|-
|''&amp;rho;''||density of fluid
|-
|''&amp;Delta;p''||pressure drop
|-
|''g''||gravity
|-
|''&amp;mu;''||absolute/dynamic viscosity
|-
|''&amp;sigma;''||surface tension
|-
|''K'' or ''E&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''||Compressibility/Bulk Modulus
|}

There are 10 quantities, ''n = 10'', and 3 dimensions, ''m = 3'', so this gives ''n - m = 7'' &amp;pi; groups.  Choosing ''V'', ''&amp;rho;'', and ''l'' as the repeating variables, performing the Buckingham &amp;pi; analysis, and using different exponents for some &amp;pi; groups, we obtain the following &amp;pi; groups, which are common in the study of Fluid Mechanics:

&lt;math&gt;\pi_1=\frac{{\Delta}p}{{\rho}V^2}=Pressure\ Coefficient=C_P&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_2=\frac{V}{\sqrt{gl}}=Froude\ Number=Fr&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_3=\frac{Vl\rho}{\mu}=Reynolds\ Number=Re&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_4=\frac{V^2l\rho}{\sigma}=Weber\ Number=We&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_5=\frac{V}{\sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}}}=Mach\ Number=Ma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_6=\frac{l}{D}=Length:Diameter\ Ratio&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\pi_7=\frac{\epsilon}{D}=Relative\ Roughness&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Conservation of Mass */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Control Volume Analysis ==
A fluid dynamic system can be analyzed using a ''control volume'', which is an imaginary surface enclosing a volume of interest.
The control volume can be fixed or moving, and it can be rigid or deformable.
Thus, we will have to write the most general case of the laws of mechanics to deal with control volumes.

===Conservation of Mass ===
The first equation we can write is the conservation of mass over time.
Consider a system where mass flow is given by ''dm/dt'', where ''m'' is the mass of the system. The term on the left denotes the rate of change of the mass of the system. The first term on the right describes the amount of flow across the control surface. The second term on the right refer to the condition within the control volume.
We have, 

&lt;math&gt;
  \dot m = \int_{CS} \rho
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA +\frac{d}{dt}\int_{CV}\rho dV
&lt;/math&gt;

However, by definition of a system the mass of which is a constant; thus the left-hand side of the above equation equals to zero and it could be rewritten as: 

&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{CS} \rho
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA =-\frac{d}{dt}\int_{CV}\rho dV
&lt;/math&gt;

For steady flow, the time derivative of the quantity is zero, we have

&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{CS} \rho
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA =0
&lt;/math&gt;

And for incompressible flow, we have

&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{CS}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

If we consider flow through a tube, we have, for steady flow,

&lt;math&gt;
  \rho_1A_1V_1 = \rho_2A_2V_2
&lt;/math&gt;

and for incompressible steady flow,  ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

===Conservation of Momentum===
Law of conservation of momentum as applied to a control volume states that

&lt;math&gt;
  \sum F = \frac{d}{dt}
  \left(
    \int_{CV} \!\mathbf{V} \mathbf{\rho} \,dV
  \right) + \int_{CS} \mathbf{V}\mathbf{\rho}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right)dA
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the velocity vector and ''n'' is the unit vector normal to the control surface at that point.

The sum of the forces represents the sum of forces that act on the entirety of the fluid volume (body forces) and the forces that act only upon the bounding surface of a fluid (surface forces).
Body forces include the gravitational force.

===Conservation of Energy===
The law of Conservation of Energy in fluid mechanics is a specific application of the First Law of Thermodynamics.

&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{d\mathbf{Q}}{dt} + \frac{d\mathbf{W}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}
  \left(
    \int_{CV} e\mathbf{\rho}
  \right) + \int_{CS} e\mathbf{\rho}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right)dA
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the energy per unit mass.

== Conservation Equations of Mass, Momentum and Energy ==

=== Equation of Continuity ===

* A differential mass balance relating density change to velocity.
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot
  \left(
    \rho \mathbf{V}
  \right) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;


* For incompressible fluids the equation of continuity reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt; 
  \rho 
  \left(
    \nabla \cdot 
    \mathbf{V}
  \right) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

:since 
::&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
:for all incompressible fluids



=== Euler's Equation ===

* applies conservation of momentum to inviscid, incompressible flow.
: &lt;math&gt;
  \rho \mathbf{g} - \nabla p = \rho\frac{d\mathbf{V}}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stokes' Equation ===

* applies conservation of momentum in creeping flow limit (low Reynold's Number)

:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla p = \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{V}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fluid Kinematics ==

In this section fluid motion will be described without concern with the actual forces necessary to produce the motion.  The principles of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum permit some patterns of fluid motion, and exclude others.  Many important real-world situations can be analyzed using this approach, without considering friction.

== I.The Velocity Field ==

Fluids tend to flow easily, which results in a net motion of molecules from one point in space to another point as a function of time. Using the continuum hypothesis, fluids are broken down into fluid particles, which are composed of numerous fluid molecules. These particles interact with one another and with their surroundings. Thus the motion of a fluid, using a Eulerian model (continuum hypothesis), can be described in terms of the acceleration or velocity of fluid particles and not in terms of molecular motion. 

The continuum assumption allows for any fluid property (density,pressure, velocity, acceleration, ...) to be described as a function of fluid location. The representation of fluid parameters in terms of spacial coordinates is called a ''field representation''. 

Ex:       T = T(x,y,z,t)


=== Eularian &amp; Lagrangian Flow ===

''Eulerian analysis'' uses the field concept, derived from the continuum assumption.

''Lagrangian analysis'' involves following individual fluid particles as they move about, and determining how fluid properties vary as a function of time. 


(-See below)

=== Steady vs Unsteady Flow ===
When the flowing particle velocity, temperature and pressure do not change with respect to time is called steady flow. It should be noted that the conditions are different at different points, but at a particular point it is constant.

=== Streamlines, Streaklines, Pathlines ===

== II.Acceleration Field ==

The acceleration of a particle is the time rate of change of its velocity. Using the an Eulerian description for velocity, the ''velocity field'' '''V''' = '''V'''(''x,y,z,t'') and taking deriving it with respect to time, we obtain the ''acceleration field''. 

Now, consider a fluid particle A, moving along its pathline with velocity '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; 


'''V'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;,t) = '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;[''x''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ''y''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ''z''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;(t), ''t'']


Differentiate to obtain the acceleration: (chain rule)

'''(1)''' &lt;math&gt; \vec{a} &lt;/math&gt;= dV/dt + dV/dx dx/dt + dv/dy dy/dt + dv/dz dz/dt 

''Note: these are partial derivs, since velocity a function with several variables.'' 
Changing the partial velocity components u = dx/dt, v = dy/dt, w = dz/dt in EQ. 1 we obtain: 

&lt;math&gt; \vec{a} = {D\vec{V} \over Dt} = {\partial \vec{V} \over \partial t }+u{\partial \vec{V} \over \partial x}+v{\partial \vec{V} \over \partial y}+w{\partial \vec{V} \over \partial z } &lt;/math&gt;

=== Material Derivative ===

The material derivative is sometimes referred to as the substantial derivative, ...

=== Unsteady and Convective Effects ===
The material derivative, as seen above, contains two types of terms. Those involving the time derivative d()/dt and those involving spatial derivatives d()/dx, ... , ... . The time derivative portion is denoted as the local derivative, and represents the effects of unsteady flow. The local derivative occurs during unsteady flow, and becomes zero for steady flow. 

The portion of the material derivative represented by the spatial derivatives is called the ''convective derivative''. It accounts for the variation in fluid property, be it velocity or temperature for example, due to the motion of a fluid particle in space where its values are different.

=== Streamline coordinates ===

=== III. Reynolds Transport Theorem ===
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{D}{Dt} \int_{V(t)} \mathcal{F}(\vec{x},t) dV = \int_{V(t)} \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial t} dV + \int_{S(t)} \mathcal{F} \vec{u} \cdot \hat{n} dS
&lt;/math&gt;

== Fluid Mechanics as a Subset of the Continuum Mechanics ==

== Frames of Reference in Fluid Mechanics==
There are two different frames of reference that are commonly used in the analysis of fluid mechanics problems: Fixed (Eulerian) reference frames and Material (Lagrangian) reference frames.

* In fixed reference frames fluid motion is defined with respect to a coordinate system that does not vary with time or fluid motion.  

* In material reference frames fluid motion is defined with respect to a coordinate system that follows the motion of the fluid so that the same volume of fluid remains enclosed throughout the analysis.  The Reynold's Transport Theorem (to be defined later) is used to solve fluid mechanics problems when the frame of reference is Lagrangian.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== In a Nutshell ==

Success in the classroom has a lot to do with your personal attitude and self-control. 

Condition yourself to attend class, prepare, observe, listen, take notes, ask questions and discuss.

Make sure you are well rested. Try to have your A game on, but still have fun inside and outside the classroom.

== Introduction ==

The bulk of college courses are still taught through the medium of a classroom.

The effectiveness of classroom teaching can vary highly, and is highly dependent on your attitude, and somewhat on the tutor.

You have to quickly figure out two things:

1. Am I required to be in class? 
 
Attendance policies may vary.  Some instructors do not keep attendance records, and some instructors will count your attendance as part of your overall grade. It is always a good idea to attend class regularly.

2. Is attending class efficient?

Always attend class.  This is where you will learn what information is most important for exams, and it also serves as an opportunity to ask questions when you need to.  Your instructor has to be in class every day, so it is respectful to honor their time.  When you can show your instructors that you are serious about the class by showing up on time every day, they are more likely to work with you when you have an issue.

== When Attending Class ==

Make sure you can see visual material.  Make sure you can hear spoken presentations.  (It's worthwhile to go see an eye doctor once a year and have your ears tested AT LEAST once when you enter college)  

Arrive early and find a spot where you can see and hear everything.  The front of the class typically increases your odds of successfully hearing and seeing all relevant material.

Carry a notebook and pen and take notes.  Make sure you know how to take notes: [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/success/notes.html]

Maintain basic personal hygiene (bath, comb your hair, wash your clothes, brush your teeth) to make life bearable to those that attend class with you.

== Your Classroom Tutor/Teacher ==

Your professor/teacher (or other tutor) is a key factor in your success.
  
This is the person that you have to convince that you have sufficient command over a subject to get a successful grading. He or she is also a human with strengths, weaknesses, likes, fears, hangups and quirks.  Try to understand what those are and work around them. Listen carefully for clues about themselves when they speak. Talk to older students. Scan a few publications by that tutor, or look at web pages where the tutor is expressing him/herself. Take great care to always be courteous, respectful, and polite when talking to them, in spite of any quirks they might have. 

It's important to realize that even in a large class, a professor can typically see exactly what everyone is doing. Most people feel that in a class of 20+ people they kind of &quot;vanish&quot;. This is simply NOT true. The tutor can see exactly what you are doing, and especially so if you are doing something that differentiates you, such as talking to your neighbor, sleeping, doodling, playing games on your cell phone, and so forth. Activities such as these might earn you a mental note as a &quot;non-attention-paying&quot; member of the class and reduce your grade. When you are in class, mentally discipline yourself to pay attention, make eye contact, take notes and participate in class discussions.

If your tutor is good at explaining complex topics, you are fortunate and in for a treat. You will learn new things from an old salt that knows how to enlighten you. Unfortunately, this can be rare. That means you may have to ask questions to seek greater understanding. Not all teachers welcome questions, because it takes time to answer them well. If that's the case, go see the tutor in his/her office or after class and ask him/her to explain the issue, or ask via e-mail or via phone. If there is something you don't get, and your tutor can't explain it well, try other students (or teacher's assistants) or even other lecturers teaching the same subject, students that have successfully learned the material previously, or the Internet.

Your teacher wields a lot of power. Your success is literally in his/or her hands. Some students have a problem with that, mostly because they have a general problem with authority. Discipline yourself to view your tutor not as &quot;the enemy&quot; or an obstacle to your success, but a key partner on the road to success.

== Summary ==

The college classroom will have an incredibly strong impact on your future. 

Your mental attitudes before, during and after class will be a key contributor to your eventual success.

      <comment>/* DbC */ CKWG: Definitly needs rewording.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== DbC ==

With all due respect, the treatment of Design by Contract 
is sloppy, to put in mildly, and somewhat bragging about
Ada's type system. In fact, DbC is formally specified,
see ECMA 367, 8.9. It is
integrated into Eiffel's vocabulary, and checked both
at runtime and at compile time, covering a lot more than
Ada can now hope to achieve. (See for example the discussion
of introducing pragma Precondition and pragma Postcondition
in the AI database.)

Ada's expressiveness is not the same in this regard, so I think it isn't
the best thing to establish and instrumentalize a fuzzy notion of precisely
defined concepts of DbC. (Except perhaps for anti-Ada
trolls.) It is appropriate to make a reference to DbC, though. 

It is true that the SPARK language and Eiffel have some common &quot;mechanics&quot;.
You can specify pre/post-conditions, you can have check-correctness and
loop correctness, at the Ada subprogram/Eiffel feature level, for example.
Of course, exception correctness is not needed in SPARK, but it would be
needed in Ada, were DbC introduced to Ada.

But where is the class consistency in Ada, provided by class invariants
in Eiffel?
Initialising an object of a tagged type must establish the class invariant
INVC, every call of a primitive operation must then reestablish 
INVC. This is of course integrated with the pre/postconditions of
subprograms. How do you express this in the Ada language.
I think it is fair to say that class correctness/package correctness is
not available in Ada.  What about package-scope operations
not bound to the tagged type, yet affecting object components?

Inheritance in DbC means that contracts are inherited in a similarly consistent
way that must follow formal rules. Failing that, the compiler will not
accept the program text. (Roughly, oring of the preconditions,
and anding of the postconditions, etc). I think talking about the pros
of Ada's type system is not the same as talking about DbC,
a formally specified, integrated part of a standardised language.

Last but not least, the notion of DbC includes a proof obligation. This thing
is present in SPARK, but not in Ada.

Yeah, I should write an example package demonstrating DbC in
Ada to match ECMA 367, 8.9 (plus visibility (= export status)
and inheritance).
Then we could demonstrate how Ada's type sytem and DbC can
synergetically produce programs with less bugs than usual.

Wait, isn't this what SPARK is about? :-)

CKWG: This definitly needs rewording. I don't know much about DbC, so I won't do it. 19. November 2013

=== It`s a Wiki ===

Well this is Wiki - you can allways improve the text and I would welcome that.

But note that this module originates from [[Computer programming/Error handling]]. [[Computer programming/Error handling]] is about error handling in generall - without  any particular language in mind. The aim is more about telling people that errors need to be handled - and preferly in the language - then pushing DoC. More for &quot;anti error handling trolls&quot; then &quot;anti Ada trolls&quot;. Yes they exitst. Programmers who belive that they can do it better then any sofisticated programming lanuguage.

[[Ada Programming/Error handling]] are only examples on how your can archive an particular technique in Ada. Have you seen the other page? Have you noticed how they share text and where they are different?

: seen them, and I disagree with what is said about DbC, and optimization for example.

Sad that there is no Eiffel or Spark book on Wikibooks. It would really be interesting have to have [[Eiffel Programming/Error handling]] or [[SPARK Programming/Error handling]] as better example of DoC.

And have you read [[w:Design by contract]]? Every time I look at it there are more DbC implementations.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:08, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

: I disagree. There is an increasing number of &quot;me too&quot;s, yes. How do they integrate inheritance and contracts? Where are the loop invariants? Can you write check-correct programs? Are they exception-correct? That is to  say, how can you specify that the postcondition is going to be true in case of a handled exception, using these wannabe DbC systems?

:: I never said I find them any good ;-) - as far as I see it only &quot;D&quot; and &quot;SPARK&quot; realy deverve to be called a DoC language. And even there I might be wrong. It seams that you know a lot about the subject - more then me for that matter. So could you write up an article about DbC? Wikibooks is still missing one. The appropiate place for a chapter would be [[Computer_Programming/Design by Contract]] or &lt;small&gt;(Not using a trademark)&lt;/small&gt; [[Computer_Programming/Programming by Contract]] with a link to that chapter at [[Computer_Programming#Paradigms]] and/or [[Computer_Programming#Key_concepts]]. Of corse you can allways start a new book as well if you have enough material. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:34, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

::::I have now added [[Computer_Programming/Design by Contract]]. (Programming by contract reminds me too much of employer/employee) The page isn't very well connected yet, I'll try to inject some links in the proper places

::::And the page has moved to [[Computer programming/Design by Contract]], joining the other pages.

: Writing a function in a Hoare triple is not DbC yet.

: o.K. I'll have a try rewriting some of the remarks.

:: I tried, but where is the text??? After clicking the edit link (which takes me Computer_Programming/Error_handling/5), editing, previewing, and saving, the old text comes back. What am I doing wrong? The new text is still there when I do it again:

::: Nothing, the page cache has fooled you. You can either wait until the cache expires or click here http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_programming/Error_handling&amp;action=purge to purge the cache. 

 In Design by Contract (DbC) functions must be called with the correct parameters. This is the caller's
 part of the contract. If the types of actual
 arguments match the types of formal arguments, and if the actual arguments have values that make
 the function's preconditions True, then the subprogram gets a chance to fulfill its postcondition.
 Otherwise an error condition occours.
 Now you might wonder how that is going to work. Lets look at the example first:

=== Programming by Contract ===

Just read http://www.aechmea.de/html/german/Information01_e.htm. Since Eiffel has hogged the term &quot;Design by Contract&quot; they use the term &quot;Programming by Contract&quot; - Alltrue I hate it when companys hogg general terms for trademak it might be better to use the non protected term.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:37, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

:In the case of Eiffel, they have created the thing. There was little O-O correctness theory of practical use before Eiffel AFAIK. Now everyone is trying to follow suit. If we, too, start using well defined terms in a sloppy manner, are we still doing it the Ada way? DbC is too valuable to be equated to just some checking in my view.

:[[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 21:51, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

== Please make any Programming by Contract book generic (language agnostic) ==

Most programmers do not have the luxury of choosing the language they use.  For several years I have been programming almost exclusively in VB6, next year I wil have to return to C++ for a while.  Neither include direct support for PbC but that doesn't mean that programmers who are forced to use them can't benefit from the ideas.  If PbC is introduced through the medium of a specific language, whether it is Eiffel, SPARK, or ADA busy programmers who use other languages will simply not be encouraged to apply the lessons of PbC even though quite a lot of them can be applied even in the absence of compiler support.  So please separate the concepts of PbC from the language specific implementation.  By the way I think that Programming by Contract is a better name than Design by Contract, especially if Betrand Meyer and co. have registered the latter as a trademark.   --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:13, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:I have tried to follow your advice in [[Computer_Programming/Design by Contract]]. Since DbC is well thought out and integrated (criticism of arguably minor issues notwithstanding), I have stuck to DbC, in fairly general terms. Some pre/postcondition additions seem to miss quite a bit of DbC, however laudible they are. Comments etc. most welcome. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 04:27, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

== Error handling should be described as correctly as possible ==

I think that we should get this page correct,
or else there is a risk of looking a little foolish.

However, before crossing out half of the text
and adding another new half (which might not be
good enough either), I'd like to discuss this.

Example:

Add the following function to Error_Handling_5 and observe
that the compiler does indeed NOT help you to
fullfill your contractual obligation. You'd think
that calling Square_Root is all right, because
all parameters are &gt;= 0, but the compiler cannot
tell this! Add this function, and see the compiler
be happy:

   function &quot;**&quot;(X: Float; E: Integer) return Float is
   begin
      return -1.0;
   end &quot;**&quot;;

Then run the program and notice Constraint_Error.
Hence, as DbC requires, it is the programmer who MUST
pay attention to calling a function with proper
arguments. The Ada compiler cannot in general help
you, even though it does some (sub)type checking.

Even if this example seems silly, absent SPARK it should prove
that there is no a way for an Ada compiler to replace proper
obedience to preconditions with type based magic.

So at the very least, the presentation requires
rewording, and maybe a different theoretical model.

[[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 07:01, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

=== True ===

A propper error handling chapter is indeed very important. There are to many false claims floating about - mostly from C programmers which allways thing they don't need support from the compiler. And if that means that DbC is not Ada then we need to say so - correctness of [[Computer_programming/Error_handling]] is more important then showing of Ada as a jack of all trades.

However In DcB or Strong-Typing I believe it is important to stess that runtime checks can be minimized. In languages without automated runtime checks you often have either to many checks (paranoid programmers adding checks anywhere) or to little checks (lazy programmers adding checks only when the problem happened at least once.

:Could someone in the know please instruct how to edit the text and the examples ''after'' the first paragraphs of a section? There is a load of misinformation not just about DbC, but also about the pre/post of Sqrt, sorry, and I'd like to correct this. However, each time I try to edit, I get the first paragraph of the section and nothing else. What should I read/do? [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 20:08, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

::This page is made up using transclusion, that is, including the text of other pages in it, as if they were templates. When you are hitting the edit link, you are using the one of a section that is inside of one of those pages. For editing the text after that fragments, you have to use the edit tab of this page. You will see in the wiki source where are other pages transcluded (using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Page name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;), and then you can choose if you want to edit the text of this page, or the text of one of the transcluded pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''''''Communication''' is deeply rooted in human behaviors and societies.  It is difficult to think of social or behavioral events from which communication is absent. Indeed, communication applies to shared behaviors and properties of any collection of things, whether they are human or not.

We may turn to [[w:en:etymology|etymology]] for clues: &quot;communication&quot; (from the Latin &quot;communicare&quot;) literally means &quot;to put in common&quot;, &quot;to share&quot;. The term originally meant sharing of tangible things; food, land, goods, and property.  Today, it is often applied to [[w:en:knowledge|knowledge]] and [[w:en:information|information]] processed by living things or computers.

We might say that communication consists of transmitting information. In fact, many scholars of communication take this as a working definition, and use [[w:en:Harold Lasswell|Lasswell's]] maxim (&quot;who says what to whom&quot;) as a means of circumscribing the field of communication. Others stress the importance of clearly characterizing the historical, economic and social context. The field of [[w:en:communication theory|communication theory]] can benefit from a conceptualization of communication that is widely shared. 

[[w:en:communication theory|Communication Theory]] attempts to document types of communication, and to optimize communications for the benefit of all.

Indeed, a theory is some form of explanation of a class of observed phenomena. [[w:en:Karl Popper|Karl Popper]] colorfully described theory as 
&quot;the net which we throw out in order to catch the world--to rationalize, explain, and dominate it.&quot; The idea of a theory lies at the heart of any scholarly process, and while those in the social sciences tend to adopt the tests of a good theory from the [[w:en:natural science|natural sciences]], many who study communication adhere to an idea of communication theory that is akin to that found in other [[w:en:academic fields|academic fields]].

This book approaches communication theory from a biographical perspective, in an attempt to show theory development within a social context. Many of these theorists would not actually consider themselves &quot;communication&quot; researchers. The field of communication study is remarkably inclusionary, and integrates theoretical perspectives originally developed in a range of other disciplines.

==Theories and Models==
[[Image:Communication sender-message-reciever.png|thumb|250px|A simple communication model with a [[w:en:sender|sender]] which transfers a [[w:en:message|message]] containing [[w:en:information|information]] to a [[w:en:receiver|receiver]].]]

Many suggest that there is no such thing as a successful body of communication theory, but that we have been relatively more successful in generating models of communication. A [[w:en:model (abstract)|model]], according to a seminal 1952 article by [[w:en:Karl Deutsch|Karl Deutsch]] (&quot;On Communication Models in the Social Sciences&quot;), is &quot;a structure of symbols and operating rules which is supposed to match a set of relevant points in an existing structure or process.&quot; In other words, it is a simplified representation or template of a process that can be used to help understand the nature of communication in a social setting. Such models are necessarily not one-to-one maps of the real world, but they are successful only insofar as they accurately represent the most important elements of the real world, and the dynamics of their relationship to one another.

Deutsch suggests that a model should provide four functions. It should organize a complex system (while being as general as possible), and should provide an heuristic function. Both these functions are similar to those listed above for theories. He goes on to suggest that models should be as original as possible, that they should not be obvious enough that they fail to shed light on the existing system. They should also provide some form of measurement of the system that will work analogously within the model and within the actual system being observed.

Models are tools of inquiry in a way that theories may not be. By representing the system being observed, they provide a way of working through the problems of a &quot;real world&quot; system in a more abstract way. As such, they lend themselves to the eventual construction of theory, though it may be that theory of the sort found in the natural sciences is something that cannot be achieved in the social sciences. Unfortunately, while models provide the &quot;what&quot; and the &quot;how,&quot; they are not as suited to explaining &quot;why,&quot; and therefore are rarely as satisfying as strong theory'''

==Contracting==
*Introduce myself to Mrs. Doe. Remind her that we met 2 days ago.
*How has Lil' John been doing? What are your concerns? How are you and your husband feeling about everything? empathy
*Remember that Lil' John was referred to us to see if there might be something in his genetic makeup that could explain why he was born with some of the problems he has.

==Give Results==
*I know it things are really crazy the day we met. Do you remember that we asked to take some of Lil' John's blood to look at his chromosomes?
*We talked a little about how chromosomes hold all our genetic information and are inherited from our parents, so we're supposed to have 2 copies of each one.
*We got Lil' John's test results back today. Unfortunately, they showed something different from what we would normally expect to see.
*Lil' John has 3 copies of chromosome #13. This means that he has a condition called Trisomy 13.
**silence
**&quot;I'm so sorry to give you this news&quot;
**respond to her reactions
**use empathy

==What is Trisomy 13?==
*Trisomy 13 is why Lil' John was born with his medical problems. Since our chromosomes have all the instructions that make our bodies develop and grow, when there is the wrong number (too many), our bodies are affected and don't develop correctly.
*This is why Lil' John is so small, why he has a cleft lip &amp; cleft palate, why he has a heart defect, and why he has extra fingers and holds his hands the way he does. This also means that Lil' John's brain didn't develop properly and he has profound mental retardation (why his head is so small).

==What does this mean?==
*I'm very sorry to tell you that Trisomy 13 is considered to be a lethal condition. 50% die in the first week, 95% die by 6 months. Males have a poorer prognosis.
*frequent causes of death: apnea, cardiopulmonary arrest, congenital heart disease, pneumonia
**shocked
**devastated

==How did this happen?==
*When Lil' John was created, either the sperm or egg that made him had an extra copy of this chromosome in it, so he has three copies. (this is rare)
*This is not anyone's fault. There is nothing you did to cause it &amp; nothing you could have done to prevent it from happening.

==What do we do now?==
*These children are usually not recommended for major medical intervention.
*Try to keep the child comfortable - provide food (g-tube) and supportive care.
*Decisions regarding prolonging life (ventilators), continued hospitalization, taking him home with support from Hospice Care (Starshine), residential home placement (St. Joseph's Home) - there are people who can help you take care of him.
*No decisions must be made today. We'll support what you decide.
**How are you feeling about everything? (overwhelmed, sad, angry)
**empathy
**normalize

==Support Group Info.==
*SOFT - Support Organization for Trisomy 18 &amp; 13
*fellow parent

==Follow-Up==
*Any other questions or things you would like to discuss?
*I would like to give you a call later to see how you, Lil' John, and your family are doing. Can meet with your husband later too.
*Here is my card - feel free to call me anytime if you have questions.
*I'll write you a letter that summarizes everything we talked about today, so you don't have to remember it all.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*How will you tell your husband? How will he react?
*Who else will you tell - friends and family?
*What kind of support do you have?
*Infertility - tried to conceive for 8 years . . . how has this affected your marriage?
*ART - 3 rounds of IVF and ICSI
*AMA - age 43
*declined prenatal testing because of miscarriage risk - how does that make you feel? would you have done anything differently?
*interested in future children?
*recurrence risk 0.5% - 1% (at 43, age related risk of CA is 3.23%)
*how will this affect your marriage?
*how have you and your husband dealt with difficult situations in the past?
**Listen
**ask more about her responses - why?

Spain already had difficulty controlling its vast territories in the Americas when the [[../French Revolution/]] aligned Spain with France, causing problems in the colonies. Eventually there were declarations of independence on the American continents.



=== Independence of Haiti ===
{{wikipedia|History of Haiti}}
Haiti had experienced the [[w:Haitian Revolution|Haitian Revolution]] in the 1790s. Haiti was a self-governing colony of France. Napoleon sent a force to attack Haiti in 1802 or 1803 (FIXME exact year?), with the intention of restoring slavery and resuming direct control of the colony. As a result, the indigenous forces overran the invading French force. The indigenous leader, [[w:Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], declared independence of Haiti on January 1, 1804.

Parts of Haiti opposed the rule of Dessalines. Someone assassinated him in 1806 and Haiti split into two governments.

=== Slave Revolts in the United States ===

=== British invasion of South America ===
{{wikipedia|British invasions of the River Plate}}
* Why did the British decide to attack South America? [C]
* Which South American cities were the targets of British action? [C]
* Who resisted the attack? [P]
* How was Spain involved in resisting this attack? [G]
(to do: What weapons were involved? [w])&lt;br&gt;

The British invasions of the Río de la Plata (Spanish: Invasiones Inglesas al Río de la Plata) were an unsuccessful series British attempts of military controlling the Spanish colonies located around the Río de la Plata basin in South America, between 1806 and 1807, as part of the global impact of the Napoleonic Wars. Spain was an ally of Napoleon at the time and, along with its South American colonies, cooperated in a trade boycott against the forces opposing Napoleon. The resistance of the local people and its active participation in the defence with no support from the Spanish Kingdom are seen as the penultimate step toward their independence.

In 1806, a British force of 1,000 to 2,000 men attacked Buenos Aires, the capital of the Viceroyalty of the River Plate. In 1807, a second invasion with at least 10,000 men targeted Montevideo and Buenos Aires. The northern port of Montevideo fell and became a British base. A large force approached Buenos Aires with the intent of capture.

At this point, Spain seemed to weak to defend its colony. However, the people of Buenos Aires decided not to welcome the British forces. The local population engaged the British in urban combat. (FIXME find a good description of the battle, and discover whether Spain sent any force)

==Client &amp; Partner Information==
*Medical history
**Any other chronic illnesses?
***Migraines
**Information about your husband:
***Name, age, occupation?
***Any exposures?
***Any chronic illnesses?
*Psychosocial assessment
**Loss of prior pregnancy
***Guilt about termination
***Mourning for loss of fetus
***Anxiety about future pregnancies
***Self-blame
***Did you name the fetus?
***Do you have anything from the fetus such as ultrasound photos?

***What did you tell people about the loss?
***How has it affected your marriage?
**Future reproductive plans

***How do the recurrence risk numbers feel to you?

==Elicit History==
*Construct pedigree:
**Abnormal # miscarriages, stillbirths, infant deaths?
**Previous children with chromosome abnormality, Down syndrome, birth defects, mental retardation?
**Consanguinity? Ethnicity? Other concerns/risk factors?

==What is AMA?==
*Woman is age 35 &amp; above at expected date of delivery.
*As maternal age increases, risks of birth defects increase.
**Women do not make new eggs like males make sperm.
**They are born will all the eggs they will have in their life and these eggs mature with age.
*There are procedures that can be done to assess the risk, but there are also risks associated with the procedures.
**As women age, their risk of having a child with a chromosomal difference increases.  Advanced maternal age begins at 35 years of age because a woman's risk of having a child with a chromosomal difference at 35 is equal to the risk of having a miscarriage via an amniocentesis (both risks are equal to 1 in 200).
*The background risk for major birth defects for women of all ages is 3-5%.

==Explain Chromosome Abnormalities==
*Explain genes and chromosomes
*Show karyotypes
**Show karyotype of fetus
*Explain nondisjunction
**Be prepared to explain meiosis in males versus females
**Nondisjunction has not been found to be associated with environmental factors such as occupational exposures.
*Show abnormal karyotypes (trisomy 13)
*Give a general description of the clinical features and prognoses.
**Trisomy 18 &amp; 13 are most severe with most affected dying before the age of 1 year
**Trisomy 21 is more mild; characteristic physical features and mild to moderate MR
**Turner and Kleinfelter's syndromes are sex chromosome anomalies. Also usually mild.

==What is Trisomy 13?==
*A chromosomal disorder resulting in a syndrome characterized by specific (midline) dysmorphic features and organ malformations
*Pathogenesis:
**A single defect during the first 3 weeks of development of the mesoderm
**Leads to morphologic defects of the midface, eyes and forebrain
*Natural History
**Very poor prognosis
***Median survival is 2.5 days
***82% die within the first month
***5% survive the first 6 months
****Survivors show:
*****Severe mental defects
*****Seizures
*****Failure to thrive
**Life-sustaining emergency surgery to a newborn with trisomy 13 may be inappropriate
*Clinical Manifestations
**Dysmorphic Features
***Facial
****Microcephaly
****Wide sagittal sutures and fontanelles
****Microphthalmia or anophthalmia
****Cleft lip, cleft palate, or both
****Abnormal or low-set ears often with deafness
***Skeletal
****Thin posterior or missing ribs
****Simian crease
****Flexion of the fingers
****Camptodactyly
****Polydactyly
**Organ Malformations
***Central Nervous System
****Severe mental retardation
****Holoprosencephaly (lack of the septation of the forebrain)
****Apnea
****Seizures
***Cardiovascular
****Coarctation, ASD, PDA, VSD, dextroposition
***Gastrointestinal
****Inguinal or umbilical hernia
****Omphalocele
***Genitourinary
****Polycystic kidneys
****Males: cryptorchidism, abnormal scrotum, ambiguous genitalia
****Females: bicornuate uterus
*Etiology
**Trisomy 13
***Occurs in 75% of cases
***Due to meiotic nondisjunction
**Translocation
***20% of cases
***May be de novo or familial
**Mosaicism
***5% of cases
***Due to postzygotic mitotic nondisjunction
***Usually less severe than full trisomy 13, but is variable
*Incidence
**1/5000 - 1/12,000 live births
**AMA is a risk factor
**The prevalence of unbalanced chromosomal abnormality in the whole newborn population is about 1/250
*Recurrence
**Trisomy 13
***There is not accurate empiric recurrence risk data for trisomy 13
***It remains to be shown whether a true increased risk, taking maternal age into account, really exists
***But, presumed that likelihood for recurrence is of &quot;very low magnitude&quot; for full trisomy 13 cases
***Several studies have found no recurrences following approximately 100 pregnancies with trisomy 13
**Prenatal diagnosis may be offered for reassurance
***Maternal Serum Screening
***CVS
***Amniocentesis
***Level II ultrasound

==Quote Risks==
*Show charts to figure risk of chromosome abnormalities.
*Give age-specific risks:
**Age at EDD: ____________
**Trisomy 13: 1 in ________
**Down syndrome: 1 in _______ ( %)
**Any CA: 1 in ________ ( %)
Exposures in Pregnancy
*Types of studies done to assess safety in pregnancy
**Animal studies
**Case reports

****Questionnaire of women who sterilize instruments in hospitals found increase in miscarriage as compared to controls and compared to staff who were not involved in this activity during pregnancy
****16.7% in sterilizing staff, 10.6% in controls, 6.0% in sterilizing staff not exposed
****BUT…when adjusted for age and other exposures, the significant increase in the miscarriage rate did not persist for glutaraldehye (it did for ethylene oxide)
****No information on birth defects was reported
**Endozime
***Bacteriostatic dual enzyme cleaner produced by Ruhof Corporation
***No data on Reprotox
*Migraine Medication
**Must weigh the risk: benefit ratio
***Asses the potential fetal risks
***Determine the value of the medication to management of the mother's condition
***Should speak to prescribing physician for recommendations
**Imitrex (Sumatriptan)
***A sulfonamide derivative used as a vasoconstrictor
***Animal data
****RATS
*****Did not impair fertility or reproductive success in rats at unspecified dose
*****No embryolethality at plasma levels 50x those in humans
*****No increase in congenital anomalies at unspecified subcu dose
****Rabbits
*****Embryolethality occurred in pregnant rabbits treated at doses close to those producing maternal toxicity
**This is 3x higher than dose attained in therapy for humans
*****Fetal
***Human data
****15% of a single dose crosses the placenta as shown by in vitro studies
****GlaxoSmithKline has a registry for exposure during pregnancy
*****194 exposed pregnancies showed increase in adverse pregnancy outcome to be 3.1% which is the rate expected in the general population
****There is a low level of excretion in breast milk, but this should not pose a risk because it is administered as a single dose at infrequent intervals
**Zomig (Zolmitriptan)
***Serotonin 1D agonist used as an antimigraine drug
***Animal data
****Administration to rats did not impair fertility
****At plasma concentrations 5000x humans, there was an increase in embryolethality in rats
****At 11x human dose in rabbits, embryolethality was also seen
****Maternal toxicity occurred in these studies
***Human data
****There are no published references on human reproductive effects
****Method of action is similar to Imitrex
**Phenergan (Promethazine)
***A phenothiazine with antihistaminic activity
***Has been used as an antiemetic for morning sickness and an adjunct to narcotic analgesia during labor
***Human data
****Isolated reports of abnormalities have appeared, but have included other drugs and lacked proper control groups.
****Better designed studies have shown no association with birth defects
*****For example the Collaborative Perinatal Project
****Readily crosses the placenta when given near term
****There are conflicting reports on neonatal respiratory depression after administration
****There is no data on breast milk excretion
**Demerol (Meperidine)
***One of the most commonly used opioid analgesics
***Animal Data
****Increased incidence of exencephaly, cranioschisis, and other lesions in the hamster
***Human Data
****No association between use in the first trimester and abnormal morphologic development
****Crosses the placenta and enters fetal circulation
****Commonly used during parturition to sedate parturient and neonate (inadvertently)
****Excreted into breast milk in small amounts; no adverse effects identified in nursing infants

==Discuss the Screening Options for Chromosome Abnormalities==

==Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)==
*What is it?
**The chorionic villi are wisps of fetal tissue or finger-like projections that attach the pregnancy sac to the uterine wall
**CVS is the technique in which this sample of placental tissue is obtained
**It is unique because it is used to diagnose certain birth defects in the 1st trimester of pregnancy rather than later in the pregnancy like amniocentesis
***It is usually performed at 10-12 weeks gestation
*What can it NOT tell me?
**CVS cannot detect neural tube defects such as spina bifida
***For this reason, it may be useful to measure the amount of AFP in the maternal serum at 15-18 weeks gestation
***Also, follow-up with US at 18-20 weeks is recommended
**It cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation
***For example, congenital heart defects, cleft lip &amp; palate cannot be seen.
***Also the severity of the defect cannot be known from CVS
*Exactly what does the procedure involve?
**Show figures of CVS
**Transcervical CVS:
***Done at 10-12 weeks gestation
***Gentle suction is applied to the tube to remove the villi
***Discomfort is often minimal, perhaps similar to a pap smear
**Transabdominal CVS:
***Done at 10 weeks gestation or later
***Using US to guide, a spinal needed is inserted through the abdomen into the uterine wall and into the placenta
***The needle is moved back and forth several times through the placenta
***Suction is used to remove the villi sample
**CVS takes approximately 5-7 minutes (not including prep time)
**The baby's heartbeat is monitored by US
**The collected sample is examined under the microscope to confirm that fetal tissue and not maternal tissue was collected
**If maternal cells were collected, the CVS will be repeated
**The sample is sent to the lab
**Results are available in approximately 10 days
*What are the risks?
**The background rate of pregnancy loss at 10-12 weeks is 2-3%
**CVS increases the risk of miscarriage by 1/100 (1%) in women with a normal uterus
***Reinforce that 99% of women will have a healthy baby
**Some studies indicate an increased risk for limb defects when CVS is done before 10 weeks gestation
***When performed at 10-12 weeks, most recent studies do not report an increased risk because limbs have already formed at this point
***The risk is approximately 1/3000 (0.0003%)

==Amniocentesis==
*What is it?
**Procedure used to obtain a small sample of fluid from the fluid-filled sac that surrounds the fetus
**Performed at 15 weeks gestation or later
***15-18 weeks is optimal because it leaves the patient with options
***22 weeks is probably the latest it can be done leaving the option of elective abortion
**Amniotic fluid contains the fetus's urine as well as other cells from the skin, throat, and digestive tract
**Fluid is studied in the lab for abnormalities
*Exactly what does the procedure involve?
**Show figure of amniocentesis.
**You will lie down on your back with hands behind your head.
**Your abdomen will be cleaned with alcohol or iodine.
**A local anesthetic may be applied to your stomach.
**Ultrasound will be used to locate the position of the baby and the placenta and to find a safe spot for the needle.
**A long, thin needle will be inserted through the skin, into the uterus.
**Then a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons) of fluid is removed and the needle is withdrawn.
**The procedure itself usually takes ~5 minutes.
**The baby will quickly replace the fluid that is removed.
**The baby's heartbeat will be monitored by ultrasound.
**Fluid will be sent to the lab and results are available in 1-2 weeks.
*What are the risks?
**The risk of miscarriage is between 1/400 and 1/200.
**This means that the added risk for pregnancy loss attributable to the procedure is 0.5% or less.
**There is a risk of uterine infection but this is less than 1 in 1,000
**There is a remote chance that birth defects can be caused by the amnio (0.1%).
**There are special considerations for mothers who are Rh negative. They need to take RhoGam after the amnio procedure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Trisomy 18'''

==Contracting==
*What do you know about why you have been referred?
*What do you know about the triple screen? What is your understanding of your test results?
*What questions or concerns would you like to address today?
*Overview of session:
**Family and medical history
**Explanation of maternal serum screening
**Overview of results and what they mean
**Explanation of genes and chromosomes
**Information on Trisomy 18
**Options for the future

==Prenatal Intake==
*Important to obtain information on pregnancy and family history to help assess potential risks to pregnancy
*Prenatal intake
**How many times have you been pregnant? Any previous miscarriages or stillbirths?
**History of infertility?
**LMP beginning of November? EDC middle of August?
**Any illness - infections, colds, fever, rashes?
**Any bleeding?
**Any exposures - X-rays (including dental), smoking, alcohol, recreational drugs, medications?
**Any problems with pregnancy?
**Personal background - occupation, religion, ethnicity, chronic illnesses for consultand and partner
**Consanguinity?
*Family history
**Review information obtained previously
**Any history of miscarriages, infertility, stillbirths, birth defects?
**Other chronic illnesses, learning problems, health problems that we did not discuss?

==Maternal serum screening==
*Background
**Screening test
***Not a diagnostic test
***Used to identify women who are at increased risk for certain birth defects
****These women then offered diagnostic testing
****Negative or &quot;normal&quot; result does not mean that a child will not have a birth defect
****Positive result is not a diagnosis of an abnormality
***Can identify women at increased risk for Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18, or open neural tube defects
**Blood test
***Fetal and placental products can be detected in mother's blood serum during pregnancy
***Can be offered from 14-22 weeks but most accurate at 16-18 weeks
*Indirect measure of levels of three substances in mother's blood
**Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
***Produced by liver of fetus and excreted into amniotic fluid
***Passes into mother's bloodstream and concentration rises gradually throughout pregnancy
**Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
***Pregnancy hormone made by the placenta
***Level peaks at 10 weeks and declines throughout pregnancy
**Unconjugated estriol (uE3)
***Hormone made by fetus and placenta
***Level increases throughout pregnancy

==Risk assessment==
*Laboratory calculates a woman's risks based on levels of three substance plus other factors
**Gestational age
***Marker levels change throughout pregnancy
***Inaccurate dates are common reason for false positive
***Gestational age can be confirmed by ultrasound
**Maternal age
**Multiple gestations
**Maternal weight
***Increased weight means increased blood volume
***Markers will be diluted in serum and their concentration lower
**Maternal race
**Diabetic status
***Insulin-dependant diabetics have increased risk for neural tube defects
***Tend to have lower AFP levels, so use lower AFP cutoff
*Your specific results:
**Every pregnancy has 3-5% risk for congenital malformation
***Background risk
***Most of these problems cannot be detected prenatally
**As a woman's age increases, her risk for certain birth defects increases
**Risk figures for your pregnancy:
***ONTD: ________
***Down Syndrome: ________ compared to age associated risk _______
***Trisomy 18: ________ compared to age associated risk _______
**Screen positive for increased risk for Trisomy 18
***Occurs when AFP, hCG, and uE3 levels are all lower than expected
***Evaluation of screening performance
****Up to 100 of every 1,000 women who take test will have abnormal result (up to 10%)
*****Only 3 of those 100 women will have a baby with a birth defect
*****Most abnormal test results indicate dates are wrong or another factor above has not been accurately accounted for
*****Important to remember that test cannot identify all birth defects
****Abnormal result could be normal variation
****Sometimes no explanation for abnormal results - increased risk for 3rd trimester complications
****Test can detect:
*****60% of Trisomy 18
*****80% of ONTD
*****60% Down Syndrome

==Genes and Chromosomes==

==Trisomy 18==
*Clinical picture
**Can cause heart problems, kidney problems and other health issues
**Usually fatal within first year of life
**Children that survive have severe mental retardation
*Increased risk for pregnancy loss

==Options for further testing==
*Ultrasound
**Confirm gestational age or identify multiple fetuses to help interpret triple screen results
**Can detect many major birth defects - rule out 95% of NTDs if visualization is not limited
**Many fetuses with Trisomy 18 have certain &quot;markers&quot; that can be identified on ultrasound
***Growth retardation
***Single umbilical artery
***Heart problems
***Polyhydramnios
**Can't diagnose chromosomal abnormalities
*Amniocentesis
**Performed after 15 weeks
**Diagnostic test for some conditions
***99.7% accuracy for fetal chromosome analysis
***Detects 96% of open neural tube defects by testing AFAFP
***Cannot detect all birth defects or mental retardation
**Risk of pregnancy loss due to procedure is 0.5%
**Explain amniocentesis if interested
***Insert needle into abdomen through uterus to take sample of amniotic fluid that contains cells from fetus used for karyotyping
***Procedure:
****Ultrasound to locate fetus and placenta
****Abdomen cleaned with betadeine and local anesthetic (xylocaine) used to numb outer layer of skin
****Physician inserts needle in abdomen through uterus under ultrasound guidance
*****Needle inserted 1-2 minutes
*****May feel some discomfort similar to menstrual cramp
****Fluid is sent to lab and results ready in 1-2 weeks
***Recommendations
****No strenuous activity for 24 hours
****Notify doctor if severe cramping, bleeding or leakage of fluid because there is very small risk of infection
****Rh negative mothers should take RhoGAM

==Potential Psychosocial Issues==
*Emphasize the importance of choice
*Religious beliefs impact decisions about testing and termination
*Anger, distrust because of family physicians advice
*Anxiety, sadness, disbelief, fear concerning possibility of Trisomy 21
**Provide reassurance when possible
**Explain benefits of prenatal diagnosis to help prepare emotionally, mentally, and socially for birth of child with chromosome abnormality
*False positive may cause unnecessary anxiety

===The other group of order 4===
For the following example, image the number 0 through 3 written in binary, then add the digits without any carrying.  For example, 
  2 +  3 
 10 + 11
    01 
    1
Since binary addition (without carry) is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; we view this group as being two copies of &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; joined together.  That's where the name comes from.

==Familio (Family)==

===The Suffix -IN===

In most languages there are separate words for items of different sexes. For example, in English a female bovine creature is a &quot;cow&quot; and a male bovine creature is a &quot;bull&quot; or &quot;steer&quot;. This of course leads to much memorization of separate words, which is tedious and frustrating. Fortunately, Esperanto does away with this with two glorious letters: &quot;in&quot;. Adding ''-in'' to the end of a noun's root transforms that word into a female version of the root. For example, the Esperanto word for a bovine creature (&quot;bull&quot;, &quot;steer&quot; or &quot;cow&quot;) is ''bovo''. Adding ''-in'' to the root results in the word ''bovino'', which translates to &quot;cow&quot;. With only a few exceptions (those roots implicitly male or female), if a noun does not have the suffix ''-in'', then the sex of the noun is unspecified. If one wants to emphasize that something is masculine, one may use the root ''vir-'' as a prefix, but this is rarely done.

===The Prefix GE-===

In Esperanto, the prefix ''ge-'' is used 1) to indicate the presence of both sexes in a group described by a male or female root (Esperanto does have a very few such words) or 2) to emphasize the presence of both sexes in a group. For example, Pedro has two friends: Esmerelda and Johano. When referring to them, Pedro could call them either ''amikoj'' or ''geamikoj'', because ''amiko'' is simply a &quot;friend&quot;. But his brother and sister must be his ''gefratoj'', because ''frato'' is the word for &quot;brother&quot;).

Examples words using the prefix ''ge-'' :
*gelernejo - co-ed school
*gepatroj - parents
*geamikoj - friends
*gefratoj - siblings

[[File:Lydekker - Marbled Cat.JPG|250px|right]]
The '''marbled cat''' is the big cat that isn't big at all, only slightly larger than a domestic cat.  Scientists place it in the same closely related group as the lion, tiger and leopard, the ''Subfamily Pantherinae'', and even though it's much smaller than the clouded leopard it has the same long fangs and a very similar fur pattern.  Scientific examination of their blood (blood serum analysis) suggests that they are similar in form to the forest ancestors of the big cats some ten million years ago. However, they may have also decreased in size more recently due to competition with other big cats.

==Where do marbled cats live?==
[[File:Marbled Cat area.png|thumb|left|Places where marbled cats live are colored blue.]]
The marbled cat may be found in the forests of the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo and some neighboring small islands.

==What do marbled cats look like?==
Marbled cats look similar to clouded leopards but they are smaller, have shorter faces more like a domestic cat, and have a fuzzier tail. Its beautiful, striking coat is pale brown, with irregular slightly darker brown blotches sharply outlined in dark brown or black. Its long cylindrical tail is full from rump to tip and carries its body pattern.

==What do marbled cats eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Marbled cats spend a great deal of time in the trees and it is likely that they catch much of their prey there, hunting birds, squirrels, rodents, frogs and reptiles.  They have been seen hunting on the ground on the island of Borneo, and this may be a local habit.  Not much is known about their habits because they are rare in the wild and there are no specimens currently kept in zoos.

==Fun facts==
* Marbled cats make sounds similar to a domestic cat, but they purr rarely and their meow is somewhat like a twittering bird call.
* The longest a marbled cat lived in captivity was 12 years.

==Third Law of Thermodynamics==

The Third Law of Thermodynamics extends the definition of Entropy:

'''Entropy is zero only in a ''perfect crystal'' at absolute zero ( 0 kelvin [- 273.15 degree Celsius ]).'''

The Third Law of Thermodynamics can mathematically be expressed as 

lim ST→0 = 0 (1)

where 

S = entropy (J/K)

T = absolute temperature (K)

At a temperature of absolute zero there is no thermal energy or heat. At a temperature of zero Kelvin the atoms in a pure crystalline substance are aligned perfectly and do not move. There is no entropy of mixing since the substance is pure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tuberous Sclerosis'''

== What is Tuberous Sclerosis? ==
* Referred to both as tuberous sclerosis (TS) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The term TSC is used in scientific literature to distinguish tuberous sclerosis from Tourette's syndrome.
* Autosomal dominant disorder that causes benign tumors to form in many different organs, primarily in the brain, eyes, heart, kidney, skin and lungs
* The disease affects some people severely, while others are so mildly affected that it often goes undiagnosed
* The clinical symptoms of TSC vary greatly and may often not appear until later in life
* Some people with TSC experience developmental delay, mental retardation and autism.
* Many people with TSC are living independent, healthy lives
* There are presently no cures and there is no way to predict how severely or mildly an individual may be affected by TSC
* There can be complications in some organs such as the kidneys and brain that can lead to severe difficulties and even death if left untreated.
* To reduce these dangers, people with TSC should be monitored throughout their life by their physician for potential complications.
* Most people with TSC will live an average life span.

== Who is affected? ==
* Prevalence of TSC is unknown, but its incidence is estimated to be 1 in 6,000 live births. This means approximately 50,000 individuals in the United States and more than 1 million worldwide have TSC
* It occurs in both sexes and in all races and ethnic groups
The tumors are not cancerous!
* The tumors resulting from tuberous sclerosis are benign, but may still cause problems.
* Tumors that grow in the brain can block the flow of cerebral spinal fluid in the spaces (ventricles) in the brain. This can lead to behavior changes, nausea, headaches or a number of other symptoms.
* In the heart, the tumors are usually at their largest at birth, and then decrease in size as the individual gets older. These heart tumors, called cardiac rhabdomyomas, can cause problems at birth if they are blocking the flow of blood or causing severe arrhythmia problems.
* The tumors in the eyes are not as common, but can present problems if they grow and block too much of the retina.
* The tumors in the kidney (renal angiomyolipoma) can become so large they eventually take over all of the normal kidney function. In the past, the patient was left until they developed kidney failure. Today, doctors are more aggressive and remove individual tumors before they get too large and compromise healthy kidney tissue. Very rarely (less than 2 percent of) individuals with TSC develop malignant (cancerous) kidney tumors.

== Inheritance and Recurrence Risks ==
* Approximately 33 percent, or one-third, of people with TSC inherit it from a parent who also has TSC
* A parent who is affected has a 50% or 1 in 2 chance of having an affected child
* In the remaining 66 percent, or two-thirds of people with TSC, neither parent shows any symptoms or signs of TSC. It appears that one of the normal genes from either parent changes to the abnormal form, leading to a new (or sporadic) occurrence of TSC in the child
* Normally, these parents do not have another child with TSC because the mutation was sporadic, not inherited
* However, some families have more than one child with TS, even though neither parent showed symptoms or findings of TSC. This is due to germline mosaicism
* Germline mosaicism is relatively rare, and this explanation does not apply to most families with a sporadically affected child.
* However, due to germline mosaicism recurrence risk are quoted to be 1 to 3 percent
* There is no simple way to determine whether an unaffected parent of a child with TSC has germline mosaicism.

== Genes responsible ==
* Two genes have been identified that can cause tuberous sclerosis.
* Only one of the genes needs to be affected for tuberous sclerosis to be present.
* The TSC1 gene is located on chromosome 9 and is called the hamartin gene.
* The other gene, TSC2, is located on chromosome 16 and is called the tuberin gene.
* The functions of hamartin and tuberin are not fully understood.
* Hamartin and tuberin have been shown to form heterodimers, suggesting that these two proteins may act in concert to regulate cell proliferation
* Both the TSC1 and TSC2 genes are believed to suppress tumor growth in the body.
* When either of these genes is defective, tumors are not suppressed and tuberous sclerosis results.
* The genes also play a role in the early fetal development of the brain and skin.
* The genes (TSC1 and TSC2) are involved in approximately 70 percent of TSC diagnoses.
* It is still unclear where the mutation lies in the remaining 30 percent of people tested.

== Penetrance ==
* The penetrance of TSC, after careful, detailed evaluation of each person known to carry a TS mutation, is now thought to be 100%.
* Rare cases of seeming non-penetrance have been reported; however, molecular studies have resolved these cases, revealing two different sporadic TSC mutations in one family and the existence of germline mosaicism in others

== Variable expressivity ==
* The variability in expression exists because TSC is autosomal dominant at the level of the organism but recessive at the cellular level. (There is an element of chance involved)
* Both the TSC1 and TSC2 genes have properties consistent with tumor suppressor genes functioning according to Knudson's &quot;two hit&quot;
* The clinical variability occurs secondary to the random nature of the second &quot;hit&quot; in individuals carrying a germline mutation.

== Genotype-Phenotype Correlations ==
* The TSC1 and TSC2 phenotypes have been considered to be identical.
* The phenotype is different in cases of a contiguous gene syndrome involving large gene deletions and rearrangements of both the TSC2 gene and the PKD1 gene on 16p13
* One study found a greater risk of renal malignancy in patients with TSC2 and patients with TSC2 mutations have been found to have a higher frequency of mental
* Genotype and phenotype correlation studies provide statistical support of a milder phenotype in patients with a TSC1 mutation.
* A decreased proportion of individuals with TSC1 among sporadic cases of TSC has been reported. This might represent a true biologic phenomenon or decreased ascertainment of individuals with sporadic TSC1 because of a somewhat less severe phenotype.

== Diagnosis and testing ==
* The diagnosis of TSC is based on clinical findings (see clinical diagnosis in the category below)
* Molecular testing is presently available on a research basis only
* It is available on a clinical basis only to those families with a known TSC1 or TSC2 mutation identified through previous research studies.
* Development of clinically available DNA analyses of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes has been hampered by the large size of the two genes, the large number of disease-causing mutations, and the high rate of somatic mosaicism (10-25%)

== Prenatal Testing ==
* DNA-based diagnostic testing is possible for pregnancies at 50% risk in a family with a known TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutation previously identified through a research study and confirmed in a clinical laboratory
* DNA extracted from cells obtained from chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at about 10-12 weeks' gestation* or amniocentesis at 16-19 weeks' gestation can be analyzed for the known familial disease-causing mutations.
* For other families, high-resolution ultrasound examination for tumors is available, but its sensitivity is unknown.
* The risk for TSC is 50% in a fetus without a known prior increased risk for TSC, in which cardiac lesions consistent with rhabdomyoma are identified on ultrasound examination. Mutation analysis is currently not clinically available to further evaluate a fetus with this prenatal finding.

== Clinical Diagnosis ==
* The diagnostic criteria for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) were revised at the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus *Conference, July 1998
* Definite TSC: Either two major features or one major feature plus two minor features
* Probable TSC: One major feature plus one minor feature
* Possible TSC: Either one major feature or two or more minor features

== Major Features ==
* Facial angiofibromas or forehead plaque
* Non-traumatic ungual or periungual fibromas
* Hypomelanotic macules (three or more)
* Shagreen patch (connective tissue nevus)
* Multiple retinal nodular hamartomas
* Cortical tuber 1
* Subependymal nodule
* Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma
* Cardiac rhabdomyoma, single or multiple
* Lymphangiomyomatosis 2
* Renal angiomyolipoma 2

== Minor Features ==
* Multiple randomly-distributed pits in dental enamel
* Hamartomatous rectal polyps
* Bone cysts
* Cerebral white matter radial migration lines 1
* Gingival fibromas
* Nonrenal hamartoma
* Retinal achromic patch
* &quot;Confetti&quot; skin lesions
* Multiple renal cysts
** When cerebral cortical dysplasia and cerebral white matter migration tracts occur together, they are counted as one rather than two features of TSC.
** When both lymphangiomyomatosis and renal angiomyolipomas are present, other features of tuberous sclerosis must be present before TSC is diagnosed.

== Clinical Manifestations ==
* We still cannot predict the severity of physical symptoms in a person with a new diagnosis of TSC.
* A person can have TSC and have very few or mild symptoms, while a family member with TSC can have more severe or extensive
 
== symptoms ==
* In most individuals, the disease affects only some of these organs.
* The severity of TSC can range from mild skin abnormalities to, in severe cases, mental retardation or renal failure.
* Many TSC manifestations also develop later in life.
* Most individuals who are mildly affected by TSC lead active and productive lives

== HEART INVOLVEMENT ==

=== Manifestations ===
* Echocardiogram can show rhabdomyomas, the most common primary cardiac tumor of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in infancy and childhood.
* The incidence of these tumors in TSC has been reported to vary from 47 percent to 67 percent.
* Childhood tumor regression is the rule. In other words, in most cases, cardiac tumors are their largest at birth and may shrink or disappear as the individuals grow older.
* A second peak in the incidence of these tumors may occur during puberty.
* If cardiac outflow obstruction does not occur at birth, the patient is unlikely to have health problems from these tumors later.
Treatment
* Cardiac rhabdomyomas are more likely to be the cause of heart failure in a newborn infant or young child than in an adult with TSC.
* Most rhabdomyomas of the heart are asymptomatic, but they should be treated by an experienced cardiologist if an arrhythmia or other cardiac problem is present.
* Cardiac arrhythmias infrequently have developed in children just after starting carbamazepine (Tegretol), used for the treatment of epilepsy. Reports have also shown a significant increase in the size of cardiac rhabdomyomas in infants with TSC with infantile spasms who are treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Therefore, echocardiograms and EKG baseline measurements should be obtained before initiating these treatments.

== BRAIN INVOLVEMENT ==
* CNS tumors lead to the most morbidity and mortality in TSC
* Brain and Neurologic Function: Several types of brain lesions are seen in individuals with TS; some people will have all the lesions, whereas others will have no brain involvement at all.
* Cortical tubers (from which TSC is named)
** Occur in 70% of patients
** thought of as a &quot;birth defect&quot; on the brain
** small areas in the cortex (the outer layer of the brain) that do not develop normally
** It is thought that the presence of cortical tubers, which disrupts the normal &quot;wiring&quot; of the brain, is what causes seizures in individuals with TSC.
* Subependymal nodules
** occur in 90% of patients
** develop near the walls of the cerebral ventricles (the cavities in the brain that contain cerebrospinal fluid)
** Typically, these nodules accumulate calcium within the first few months or years of life.
** Because of this calcification, they can be easily detected with a computed tomography (CT) scan.
** The subependymal nodules are not directly responsible for neurological problems.
* Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs).
** occur in 6-15% of all patients
** Typically, SEGAs do not occur in very young children, and the chance for their growth decreases after age 20.
** If a giant cell astrocytoma grows large enough, it can block the flow of fluid inside the ventricles of the brain, can result in significant morbidity and mortality, the tumor will have to be removed and/or the ventricles shunted to relieve fluid buildup and pressure.
*** Symptoms include vomiting, nausea, and headaches as well as changes in appetite, behavior, and mood.
*** These symptoms may or may not signal growth of a tumor, but they do signify that there may be a problem and that the child should be seen by a physician.
Brain imaging should be done at the time of diagnosis to get a baseline image and then every 1 to 3 years afterwards. A brain scan can sometimes show growth of a tumor even before symptoms develop.

== EPILEPSY/SEIZURE DISORDERS ==
* Seizures occur in 60 percent to 90 percent of individuals diagnosed with TSC
* They are often the first symptom of TSC.
* Early in life, the seizures may consist only of brief head nodding or staring, or they may be more generalized, with spasms of the limbs and flexion and extension of the head and trunk.
* In older children and young adults, the seizures sometimes occur less often or cease.
* If seizures are suspected, an electroencephalogram (EEG) is usually conducted.
* Seizure control in a child with TSC is important.
* There appears to be a direct relationship among the age of the child at the onset of seizures; their frequency, duration, and severity; and the degree of mental handicap.
* Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), properly administered, may control the seizures completely, although in some people the seizures return or cannot be controlled.
* Some children with TSC have &quot;infantile spasms.&quot; During this type of seizure, the child brings his legs up to his chest in a repeated motion.
* Infantile spasms can sometimes be eliminated by the use of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone from the pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisone. This medication is not used for long periods of time because of adverse side effects.
* Valproic acid (Depakene) has also been used to treat infantile spasms.

== COGNITIVE, PSYCHIATRIC AND BEHAVIORAL INVOLVEMENT ==
* The behavior of a child with TS can often be the most difficult and trying problem for parents and family.
* Aggression, sudden rage, hyperactivity, attention deficit, acting out, obsessive-compulsive behavior, repetitive behaviors, staying in their &quot;own world,&quot; being nonverbal even at an age when most children are speaking, and other autistic behaviors have all occurred in children with TSC.
* At least 50% of patients have developmental delay or mental retardation
* Some children with TSC, usually those who have a mental disability, are also diagnosed with autism.
* There appears to be a connection between TSC and autism that is not understood, and active research is exploring this link
* Occasionally, individuals with TSC are also diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disease (manic depression), depression, or other psychiatric disorders.

=== Manifestations ===
* lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) - pulmonary cystic disease
** estimated to occur in 1-6% of cases
** primarily affects women between the ages of 20 and 40 years
* The first symptoms of lung involvement in an individual with TSC may be shortness of breath after mild exercise, spontaneous pneumothorax, or coughing.
* Progression to pulmonary failure may develop, but not usually until the third or fourth decade of life, if at all.
* Pulmonary involvement in TSC can be severe, and some individuals will require lung transplantation.

=== Diagnostic screening and follow-up ===
* Recent studies have shown that many women with TSC have minor, asymptomatic lung involvement.
* The Consensus Conference Panel on Lung Involvement recommended that female patients should have a chest CT scan (not an x-ray) sometime before age 18 or at the time of diagnosis for women older than 18.
* A CT scan of the lung is superior to an X-ray because the early signs of lung involvement may easily be missed on an X-ray.
* If pulmonary involvement is noted, the individual should be monitored closely and should have repeated chest CT scans as needed.

=== Treatment ===
* Pulmonary involvement in TSC can be severe, even fatal.
* Recently, tamoxifen and progesterone have been used to treat pulmonary TSC with encouraging results.
* Any individual with TSC with lung involvement should see a pulmonologist who is knowledgeable about LAM.
* National Institutes of Health is also conducting clinical research of LAM
* Call the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance or the LAM Foundation for more information.

== KIDNEY INVOLVEMENT ==
* The second leading cause of early death (27.5%) in patients with TSC is renal disease
* In a recent study, an estimated 80% of children with TSC were found to have an identifiable renal lesion by the mean age of 10.5 years

=== Manifestations ===
* TSC can present itself as five different lesions in the kidneys:
** benign angiomyolipomas-(occurring in 70 percent to 80 percent of adults and older children with TSC)
*** Renal angiomyolipomas-made up of vascular tissue (angio), smooth muscle (myo), and fat (lipoma)
*** They are benign hamartomas.
*** These hamartomas are well circumscribed groups of cells that multiply excessively, growing as benign tumors that may or may not cause symptoms.
*** The prevalence of TSC-related renal angiomyolipomas increases with age, and in adults bilateral tumors or multiple tumors in one kidney are common.
*** Angiomyolipomas begin in childhood in many individuals with TSC, but they usually grow very slowly and may not be problematic until young adulthood.
*** Individuals with TSC should have their kidneys imaged at the time of diagnosis and then regularly throughout their lives.
*** Accurate noninvasive ultrasound, CT, or MRI diagnosis of these benign lesions is highly dependent on their fat content
*** It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between a small or low-fat-content angiomyolipoma and a malignant tumor.
*** When tumors become larger than 4 cm, bleeding of the angiomyolipoma, the primary complication of this lesion, increases in frequency.
*** Pain may also become a significant problem with angiomyolipomas.
** Cysts (occurring in 20% of patients)
*** TSC renal cysts are commonly multiple and bilateral.
*** They are the second most frequently occurring kidney manifestation of TSC.
*** Single or multiple renal cysts occur less often in individuals with TSC than do angiomyolipomas, but they may appear earlier.
*** Some cysts may collapse and disappear.
*** One important research finding was the discovery of the TSC2 gene in close proximity to the gene for polycystic kidney disease (PKD1) on chromosome 16.
*** A small group of individuals with TS have a large segment of chromosome 16 deleted, which means that both the TSC2 and PKD1 genes are removed.
** malignant angiomyolipoma (&lt;1%)
*** Malignant angiomyolipomas should be removed as soon as possible after their detection.
** oncocytoma (benign adenomatous hamartoma) (&lt;1%)
*** Oncocytomas are benign tumors only occasionally seen in individuals with TSC.
** renal cell carcinoma (&lt;1%)
*** rarely seen in individuals with TSC, but when these tumors are present, they often are multi-centric and bilateral.
*** These tumors should also be removed as soon as possible after their detection to prevent metastasis.

=== Diagnostic screening and follow-up ===
* Both renal angiomyolipomas and cysts are often asymptomatic and may not require treatment
* Both should be followed closely with imaging every 1 to 2 years because aggressive treatment can preserve kidney function with minimal trauma to the individual or the kidney.
* If the tumors are allowed to grow, they may lead to obstructive uropathy or displacement of much of the normal kidney tissue.
* There is also a significant risk of hemorrhage if the angiomyolipomas or cysts grow larger than 4 cm.
* Hematuria, back or abdominal pain, or internal hemorrhage may be the initial signs of kidney problems.
Treatment
* The renal lesions that appear in many individuals with TSC may remain stable and require no specific treatment.
* Renal tumors must sometimes be removed, however, if they grow rapidly, if there is an indication that they may be malignant (i.e., a solid tumor with little or no fat content), or to alleviate obstruction.
* With more frequent imaging of the kidneys and good clinical care, an individual with TSC should not have to lose an entire kidney or experience hemorrhaging from an angiomyolipoma.
* Early and aggressive treatment is much better for most individuals with TSC
* Unfortunately, some individuals with TSC who also have polycystic kidney disease will also have problems maintaining normal blood pressure levels.
* Their blood pressure usually can be controlled with medication early in the disease process; however, dialysis, and sometimes even renal transplantations, may eventually be necessary.
* Renal transplantation has been performed successfully in individuals with TSC; there does not appear to be a recurrence of angiomyolipomas in transplanted kidneys

== SKIN INVOLVEMENT ==
* The skin is affected in virtually 100% of patients.
* Individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) often see the disease manifested on the face, body and nails.
* In some cases, skin growths can become obtrusive but in most cases, the growths themselves are harmless.
* However manifestations such as facial angiofibromas can have a social impact and treatments are available.

=== Manifestations ===
* hypomelanotic macule
** (87-100% of patients)
** patches of skin lighter than the surrounding skin (can be any size or shape or may be the classic &quot;ash-leaf&quot; shape)
* shagreen patch-(20-80%)a patch of skin that is tough and dimpled like an orange peel
* periungual or subungual fibromas-(17-87%) fibrous growths that appear around the fingernails and toenails
* facial angiofibromas-(47-90%)
** cause the most disfigurement
** benign tumors of the face
** may not be present at birth; do not usually appear until between the ages of 3 and 5 at the earliest
* Fibrous plaquessometimes appear on the forehead of individuals with TSC. There may also be fibrous, hairless scalp plaques surrounded by thin, white tufts of hair.
* Occasionally an individual with TSC coincidentally will have café au lait spots (areas of skin darker than the surrounding skin, but lighter and usually larger than a mole)
** these skin lesions are not diagnostic of TSC.
** A child with three or more or an adult with five or more café au lait spots may be diagnosed with neurofibromatosis

=== Diagnostic screening and follow-up treatment ===
* At the initial testing, the physician uses a Wood's lamp (an ultraviolet light) to better visualize the hypomelanotic macules-white patches on the skin that often are difficult to see, especially on infants and people with very pale skin.
* The entire body should be examined.
* The skin should be carefully examined for the other skin manifestations of TSC as well.

== EYE INVOLVEMENT ==

=== Manifestations ===
* The appearance of retinal lesions varies from the classic mulberry lesions adjacent to the optic disk to the more common
plaque-like hamartoma.
* Retinal hamartomas
** occasionally noted in individuals without other manifestations of TS and in individuals with other disorders.
** although they are suggestive of TSC, single lesions are not diagnostic of TSC.
** The frequency of retinal hamartomas in individuals with TSC has varied in reports from almost negligible to 87 percent of individuals (a difference probably reflecting the technique used and the expertise of the examiner)
* Although less common than the retinal hamartoma, a defect in the pigment of the iris has also been observed in some individuals with TSC.
* In addition, white depigmented patches, reminiscent of the hypopigmented macules on the skin, have also been observed on the retina of some individuals with TSC.

=== Diagnostic testing and follow-up ===
* Retinal lesions may be difficult to identify without pupillary dilation and indirect ophthalmoscopy, particularly difficult to examine in uncooperative children.
* Most retinal hamartomas remain dormant, although occasionally individuals with TSC have visual impairment resulting from a large hamartoma in the macular region.
* Instances of visual loss following retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, or hamartoma enlargement are rare.

=== Treatment ===
* For the most part, treatment of the retinal lesions and repeated ophthalmologic examinations are unnecessary.
* Normal eye care should be maintained.

== OTHER ORGAN INVOLVEMENT ==
* Cysts and tumors similar to those observed in the kidney sometimes appear in the liver, lung, pancreas, and other organs. These lesions are not usually seen until later in life and are rarely symptomatic.
* Bone cysts can also develop but usually do not cause problems until later in life.
* In addition, pits have been noted in both baby and adult teeth in over 90 percent of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), but their significance is not known.
* Rectal polyps have also been reported but do not appear to cause problems.

=== Initial Evaluation ===
* It is recommended that individuals suspected of having TSC have the following initial evaluation to establish the diagnosis and to identify potential complications for timely treatment. The evaluation and management plan described below was developed by the Clinical Issues Panel, Panel 1, at the Tuberous Sclerosis Consensus Conference in July, 1998
* Medical history, especially for features of TSC
* Family history, especially for features of TSC
* Physical examination with use of a Woods lamp (ultraviolet light) in a darkened room and special attention to dermatologic findings
* Cranial CT/MRI
* Renal ultrasonography
* Ophthalmologic examination
* Electrocardiography and echocardiography, if cardiac symptoms indicate
* Electroencephalography, if seizures are present
* Neurodevelopmental and behavioral evaluation
* Chest CT for adult females

== Differential Diagnosis ==
* Many of the features of TSC are nonspecific and can be seen as isolated findings or as a feature of another disease.
* Depigmented patches have been reported to occur in up to 8 per 1000 newborns and in most cases have no medical significance.
* Other diseases that have hypopigmented macules as part of the phenotype include
** Vitiligo
** nevus depigmentus
** nevus anemicus
** piebaldism
** Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome
* acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, or multiple trichoepithelioma can be mistaken for angiofibromas
* shagreen patchrd are rare but can be seen in families or sporadically
* Ungual fibromas can result from trauma but generally these are single lesions and their presence can be explained
* Renal cysts are seen in 1-2% of population, but not usually in people under 30 years of age
* Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are rare tumors sometimes observed in individuals with no other medical problems. They show loss of heterozygosity TSC2.
* 50 % of Infants with cardiac rhabdomyomas are affected with TSC and the others are an isolated finding

== Psychosocial Issues ==
* Denial is a common reaction when a parent first learns of the diagnosis
* They may feel overwhelmed, sad, fearful, angry, guilty
* A survey of families associated with a TS support group in North Carolina
o Most parents reported that their concerns were initially ignored
o It took a median of 3 physicians before a diagnosis established in children with infantile spasms
o Infantile seizures were not diagnosed correctly in 40% of the TS patients
* The disfigurement caused by the tumors can lead to social isolation and self-esteem issues
* Stress and anxiety may persist due to health concerns

*most adults adjust to petite stature
*Feeding problems common including freq. spitting, vomiting and difficulty sucking and latching on also can have gastroesophageal reflux and failure to thrive
*Obesity can be problem in later childhood and adult (excess calorie intake decrease expenditure -- short girls less likely to physical activity not intrinsic metabolic abnormality

'''Serves &gt; 1'''

== Ingredients ==
* 1 large, ripe tomato
* 1 large, or 2 small culinary mushrooms
* 1 sliced onion slab, or coin, approx 1/4th inch (0.5cm) thick.
* 4 fresh basil leaves, or 2 tsp dried basil
* 2 tbls fresh parsley, or 2 tsp dried parsley flakes
* 1 tsp dill weed
* 2 dashes black pepper
* 1 dash of garlic powder
* 1 dash salt
* 5 drops cooking oil

== Procedure ==
# On the head of a fresh tomato, cut two concentric rings, one near the stem, the other near the slope of the tomato's shoulder. 
# Remove this ring to expose the juicy seed compartments. 
# Slice the mushrooms into small, flat slabs, and cut the onion coin in quarters, like a pie or quiche. Separate the layers.
# In the open ring sprinkle the dried spices. 
# Force the mushrooms and small arcs of onion through the spices and into the seed compartments, pushing the basil/dill/parsley/etc in with them. Stuff in as many as possible without forcing out tomato pulp. If using fresh basil leaves, fold them over the slices of mushrooms and push them in together.
# Drizzle five or so drops of cooking oil in a spot on a baking sheet or small roasting flat. Rub in a small circle with a diameter equal to the foot, or butt of the tomato. 
# Place the tomato on the oil and the pan into an oven preheated to 350° (180c). 
# Roast for 15 to 20 minutes.

'''Note:''' the onion slice will produce enough pieces for at least four stuffed tomatoes. If making several, one should be all you need.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The influence of The Assent is not limited to personal values and rituals, but in public as well. Some law makers call the influence of The Assent in public policy as &quot;Islamic law&quot;, some just call it &quot;law&quot;. Even when it is called Islamic Law, the exact legislation may differ from country to country. In Malaysia, it is even different from state to state.

Such difference is expected, since each country or state has different goals and different history. Koran only regulates upper and lower Theoretical Legal Limits as mentioned in [[s:Quran/4#11-14 | Koran 4:13-14]]. This allows every nation to pick any point or range within The Theoretical Legal Limits to be their legislation. As an example of lowering the maximum limit, Brunei Darussalam abolished the death penalty [http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/brn-summary-eng]. Another, the Queen of Jordan does not cover her hair. Its neighbor, Saudi Arabia has raised the minimum limit, so it is a crime not cover a female hair. So, please maintain that this chapter will only cover the theoretical legal limits and not the various actual local legislation of the same law.

Koranic concept of public policy is mentioned in [[s:Quran/3#102-109 | Koran 3:104]]. In this book, the policy of acceptable and unacceptable is called legislation. In [[s:Quran/42#30-43 | Koran 42:38]], mutual consultation is the best way to decide the legislation and leadership between people but without violating the Koranic Legal Limits. Therefore the Koranic concept of consultation is somehow comparable to the concept of Democracy. At the same time, Koranic concept of Legal Limits is somehow comparable to the concept of Human Rights. These legal limits are designed to guarantee not only freedom but also fairness (justice).

Scholars differs on the role of Islam in the public policy. Scholars like Ayman Dhawahiri in Afghanistan/Pakistan does not accept any other source of law outside Koran and Hadith. Scholars like Muhammad Shahrour from Syria takes Koran as Legal Limits and Hadith as example, while allowing their implementation as wide as allowed by the Legal Limits imposed by God. Scholars like Yusuf Qaradhawi in Qatar, also the head of the European Council for Fatwa and Research, takes the middle road. However, they all are agreed on the importance of The Assenter's charter and The Believer's charter in the private life.

=== Civil Law Limits ===
NOTE: 
# Bible are referred for comparison only.
# These are limits. The actual law may differs significantly but does not violates the limits, for example actual dress-code law may be much more restricted than God's limits.
# Some of these limits are restricted only to a specialized group. But legislation can be made to extend it, for example limits only for prophets wives can be extended to all believing women, or even to all women.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Turner Syndrome'''

==Contracting==
*Introductions and acknowledge prior contact
*Forewarning to provide an opportunity for cognitive and emotional preparation
**When we met two weeks ago, Dr. Doktour ordered a chromosome test to see if you had any missing or extra genetic material that might explain why you have a shorter stature and why you haven't started menstruating.
*Acknowledge previous visit- discussion of Turner syndrome
**As we discussed last time, individuals with Turner syndrome only have one X-chromosome instead of the expected two copies (show visual aid to reinforce).
**Women that have Turner syndrome are unable to reproduce because ovulation does not occur.
*Acknowledge her pain
**I know that you and your fiancé were really looking forward to having children, I'm so sorry it turned out this way.

-An edit from someone with experience receiving this diagnosis: A very helpful thing to say instead in that moment is something along the lines of, &quot;If you want to be a mother, you will be.&quot;

==Discuss agenda==
(Assess understanding throughout discussion)
*There are many areas that we can discuss today. We can talk about as much or as little about Turner syndrome as you would like.
*Areas we can discuss today
**How this happened, what the diagnosis means for you, reproductive options.
*What would you like to talk about?
**How did this happen?
***Genes and chromosomes- less specific if needed
***Some of your genetic material is missing- you only have one X-chromosome instead of the expected two copies.
***The X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes and two copies are required for sexual development in a female to occur as expected.
***Reinforce (considering family hx. of short stature and &quot;late bloomers&quot;) that Turner syndrome does not run in families

==What this diagnosis means for you and your health==
*Mild physical differences: short neck, low hairline, broad chest, small fingernails, and often have many moles.
**Women with Turner syndrome do not look very different from women that do not have Turner syndrome. In most cases, you and I would not be able to tell the difference-usually only someone that is trained to look for these differences would be able to do so.
*Medical complications:
**Endocrine:
***Ovaries do not develop properly therefore the hormones produced by the ovary, estrogen and progesterone, are not produced.
***These hormones are required for:
****Development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics
****Preparation of the uterus for pregnancy
****Development of the mammary gland
*****Hormone replacement regimen- to promote 2ndary sexual characteristics and to initiate menses.
***Hypothyroidism (insufficient thyroid secretion of T3 and T4) is common in Turner syndrome
**Renal anomalies-
***Sometimes the kidneys fuse together or there is a duplication of the ureters (this just means that you are at a higher risk of UTI's)
***Order renal ultrasound
**Cardiac anomalies-
***Coarctation of the aorta, VSD, bicuspid aortic valve
***Some are born with heart defects- (about 15-20%)
***Risk for other complications (aortic aneurysm) in those that have coarctation or bicuspid aortic valve.
***Hypertension is also commonly seen in individuals with Turner syndrome.
****Risk increases with age and obesity
****Will need routine blood pressure checks
***We will need to order an echocardiogram (type of ultrasound that we can use to visualize all of the internal parts of the heart)
**Hearing
***Increased frequency of chronic ear infections (80%)
***Some hearing loss may be due to chronic infections
**Ophthalmologic:
***Ocular problems are present in ½ of girls
****Strabismus
****Ptosis
****Hyperopia (far-sightedness)
****Myopia (near-sightedness)
****Cataracts
****Nystagmus
***Musculoskeletal:
***Short stature (100%)
***Cubitis valgus (increased carrying angle at the elbow)
**Lymphadema-
***Puffiness in utero is a major feature of Turner syndrome
*TAKE HOME MESSAGE: we will want to schedule some tests for you:
**Echocardiogram
**Renal ultrasound (also evaluate ovaries and uterus)
**Routine blood pressure checks- monitor hypertension
**See an endocrinologist for hormone replacement
**Screen for thyroid function annually
***Family planning options:
****(Spontaneous pregnancies have occurred in mosaics-some cells have both X's and some only have one X)- don't discuss unless client wishes to do so.
****Artificial reproductive therapy (ART)- although ovulation does not occur, the uterus is usually structurally normal, which means that women with Turner's syndrome are capable of carrying a child.
****In-vitro fertilization: donor egg + fiancé's sperm, create embryo in the laboratory and then implant the embryo into your uterus.
*****Expensive though
*****Treat with hormones, estradiol and progesterone early in pregnancy until sufficient placental production of hormones
****Adoption
*****Can provide information on centers in the area, if you decide this is an option for you.
***Life Expectancy:
****Studies have shown that individuals with Turner syndrome have a normal life expectancy if no heart or renal defects are present.

==Psychosocial Counseling/ Questions==
*How are you feeling right now?
*What questions do you have?
*Am I making sense to you?
*Tell me what you are feeling right now…..
*Normalize…it is very normal to feel this way
*Acknowledge the patient's reaction to the news
**This must be very overwhelming for you
**I can see that this is very hard for you….I'm sorry for your pain
*How have you handled difficult situations in the past?
*Do you have family/friends in the area?
*Provide hope…discuss family planning options….no decreased lifespan…a lot of the medical problems associated with TS, we know that you do not have.

==Planning and following through==
*I'm going to call you tomorrow afternoon, is that ok?
*I have scheduled an appointment to meet next week. Will your fiancé be back in town?
*I will schedule appointments for you to have testing done and will notify you with those dates.
**These are not urgent tests that have to be done tomorrow. You have lived 27 years with Turner syndrome. Nothing has changed, except that now you know why you have short stature and haven't begun menstruating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''VATER Association'''

==What is VATER Association?==
*VATER association is an acronym for a sporadic constellation of findings that occur together more often than by chance alone.
*The major anomalies associated with this constellation are: Vertebral defects, Anal atresia, Tracheoesophageal fistula, Esophageal atresia, and Renal/Radial defects.
*The term VACTERL association is sometimes used in place of VATER because two additional features (cardiac and limb/radial) are more specifically identified in the acronym.

==Diagnosis==
*The VATER/VACTERL association represents a core group of 7 anomalies (see above), but very few patients have all 7 features.
*The average number of features per patient is 3 to 4, but no minimum criteria have been agreed on regarding which of these features or what combination of these constitutes a secure diagnosis.
*Some propose that at least 1 anomaly in each of the 3 geographic regions of involvement (limb, thorax, and pelvis/lower abdomen) should constitute a &quot;secure&quot; diagnosis.
*Thus, qualification as &quot;probable&quot; VATER/VACTERL association requires at least 2 anomalies in each of 2 geographic areas to qualify.
*VATER/VACERL represents a classic example of a &quot;diagnosis of exclusion.&quot; There is no facial gestalt to aid pattern recognition, and its core features are commonly found in other situations and syndromes.
*Thus, clinicians need to exclude all other similar clinical entities, to have obtained a normal chromosome analysis, and to exclude teratogenic exposure during early gestation.

==Prognosis==
*The long-term prognosis for children with the VATER/VACTERL association is variable.
*Each surgical anomaly seems, prognostically, independent of the other.
*If each surgical defect can be satisfactorily repaired and/or medically treated, the prognosis is excellent. If some defects cannot be totally repaired or persist with sequelae, then the prognosis is the sum total of the residual problems.
*There is generally a good prognosis for intelligence.

==Features of VATER Association==
*Other anomalies and abnormalities that occur in the VATER/VACTERL association are:
o Single umbilical artery
o Cleft lip
o Polydactyly (preaxial)
o Small intestinal atresia
o Auricular aberrations
o Genital/urogenital defects
*Rare instances of caudal regression and lower extremity defects have also been reported.
*Intrauterine growth retardation of unexplained etiology is occasionally present.
*The differential diagnosis list when considering the VATER/VACTERL association is long because so many anomalies can be found as components of other syndromes.
*Congenital heart failure, renal dysfunction, or gastrointestinal disorder can cause poor growth; therefore adequacy of caloric intake should be assessed. Gastrostomy tube feedings may be necessary.
*Early psychomotor delay, and behavioral problems can occur.
*Poor body image may be noted especially in children with limb deficiencies, short statures, complicated anal atresia with persistent intestinal problems, or external genital abnormalities.
*Vertebral anomalies are generally not extensive and most often occur in upper to mid thoracic and lumbar regions, with sacral and lower cervical defects being less common. Hemivertebrae are most common, but dyssegmented and fused vertebral bodies can also be found.
*Limb anomalies are restricted to the upper limbs and are usually preaxial, involving underdevelopment or agenesis of the thumbs and radial bones. These defects are usually bilateral but often asymmetric in degree.
*50-60% of patients with VATER/VACTERL association have either tracheoesophageal fistula or esophageal atresia. The majority of children with these abnormalities survive if their other associated anomalies are amenable to therapy.
*Approximately 37% of patients with tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia have cardiac defects.
*Anal atresia (imperforate anus) requires immediate attention. The presence of anal atresia is associated with an increased incidence of external anomalies of the genitalia, internal anomalies of the urinary and reproductive tracts, and vertebral defects of the lumber and sacral spine.

==Management==
*VATER/VACTERL association is very complex from the clinical management standpoint because all 7 of its core features may necessitate surgical intervention.
*There are potentially an impressive number of specialists that could be required for any one child including a geneticist, orthopedist, urologist, cardiac surgeon, nephrologist, gastroenterologist, pulmonologist, physical therapist, nutritionist, psychologist, and more.
*The need for long-term follow-up by most of the specialists is labor intensive for the child and family.
*Physical therapy and infant stimulation are important because of the frequent and prolonged hospitalizations.

==Prevalence and Inheritance==
*VATER association is a relatively common, nonrandom multiple-malformation condition.
*The incidence is reported to be 1.6 in 10,000 (Cassidy).
*No consistent or recurring etiology has been established for the VATER/VACTERL association. It has been more frequently reported in the offspring of diabetic mothers.
*Most cases occur as sporadic events with low recurrence risk.
*It is generally felt to be a heterogeneous disorder with the various yet-to-be established etiologies working through a common embryological pathway.

==Recurrence Risks==
*The pattern of malformation has generally been a sporadic occurrence; thus, there is probably a low recurrence risk (&lt;1%).

==Definitions==
*Esophageal atresia: congenital failure of the esophagus to develop
*Anal atresia: imperforate anus, anus without an opening
*Tracheoesophageal fistula: congenital defect linking the trachea and the esophagus, resulting from failure of the lungs to separate from the GI tract during development. Surgery is needed to prevent recurring episodes of aspiration pneumonia in the newborn.
*Hypospadias: abnormal congenital opening of the male urethra upon the undersurface of the penis.
*Anoplasty: reconstructive surgery of the anus
*Colostomy: opening of a portion of the colon through the abdominal wall to its skin surface.
*Nissen fundoplication: surgical correction of esophageal hernia or gastroesophageal reflux, by wrapping the gastric cardia with adjacent portions of the gastric fundus. The procedure re-establishes the gastroesophageal angle and prevents intrathoracic displacement of the stomach.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Velo-Cardio-Facial Syndrome (VCF)'''

==Introduction==
*Who referred you here today?
*What specific questions would you like to have answered today?
*What information have you already been given?

==Elicit Medical History==

==Elicit Family History and Pedigree==

==What is VCF?==
*VCF is an alternate name used in past literature for the condition currently referred to as 22q11 Deletion Syndrome.
*A highly variable syndrome of associated anomalies including congenital heart disease, dysmorphic features, palate anomalies, and some degree of learning disabilities or mental retardation
*Children with VCF often have feeding problems and speech problems

==Etiology and Natural History==
*VCF occurs in about 1/4000 live births
*About 90% of people with VCF have a deletion at 22q11.2
*Most cases are a result of a new mutation
*In 10-20% of cases one parent also has a deletion and VCF phenotype

==Recurrence Risk==
*Children of those with VCF have a 50% chance of inheriting the deletion
*Parents of a child with a new mutation have a very low risk of having another child with the mutation

==Clinical Features==
*Heart Defects
**Congenital heart disease occurs in about 74% of patients
**These defects are generally conotruncal defects
*Tetrology of Fallot - 22%
*Interrupted Aortic Arch - 15%
*Ventral Septal Defect - 13%
*Truncus Arteriosus - 7%
*Other Defect - 17%
*Palate
**Palatal Defects occur in 69% of patients
**Velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI) is the most common defect (27%)
*Disorder of the velopharyngeal valve which is required for normal speech
*Can lead to hypernasal speech, nasal air emission, or other speech problems
**Submucosal and overt cleft palate are also common
*Feeding
**30% of patients have feeding problems
**nasal regurgitation is the most common problem
**many feeding problems are a result of the palate defects
*Thymus
**Many patients (specifically those with diGeorge sequence have a dysplastic or absent thymus)
**This results in a decrease in T-cells leading to decreased immune response
**Absent thymus can also cause hypocalcaemia which may lead to seizures
*Dysmorphology
**A variety of dysmorphic features are associated with VCF
*Microcephaly
*Narrow palpebral fissures
*Wide nasal root
*Bulbous nasal tip
*Thin upper lip
*Micrognathia
*Short stature
*Eye and ear abnormalities
*Neurological Defects
**Most patients have some degree of learning disabilities or mental retardation
**Intelligence generally in low normal range
**Often have language difficulties
*Specifically with reading comprehension and expressive language
*Other associations
**Kidneys: may be polycystic or dysplastic
**Growth: may be smaller in some cases due to lack of growth hormone
**Rheumatoid Arthritis: more frequent than general population

==Molecular Testing==
*Chromosomal region is called DGCR
*FISH analysis can be used to identify a deletion on chromosome 22
*Chromosome analysis should be run at the same time in order to locate the occasional disruption caused by a translocation of part of 22

==Management==
*Monitor heart function
**Repair defects if necessary
*Evaluate palate
**Intervention for feeding problems
**Repair of palate if necessary
*Monitor blood calcium levels
*Renal ultrasound to check kidneys
*Monitor lymphocytes
**Prevent use of live virus vaccines in patients with reduced immune response
*Provide speech therapy early in development
*Provide early intervention for school

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Concern over what problems to anticipate with VCF
*Parents may feel guilt or anger over diagnosis
*Confusion if mutation not found
*Self-esteem issues for children with VCF due to learning disabilities
*Social stigma due to speech difficulties

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Velopharyngeal Inadequacy (VPI)'''

==Contracting==
*What have you been told about VPI?
*What concerns would you like to address today?
*Discuss the agenda for the appointment
**Dr. Doktour - geneticist
**Dr. Doktour2 - ENT
**Dr. Doktour3 - speech pathologist

==Intake and family history==
*Important because we need to determine if VPI is isolated or is part of a genetic syndrome
**To ensure best medical treatment of any possible effects of a genetic condition
**To determine inheritance pattern and recurrence risks
*Ask about exposures/medications/illnesses during pregnancy
*Elicit medical history
*Ask about family history of clefts, birth defects, heart problems, learning problems, early deaths, miscarriages

==Genetic etiology and natural history==
*Caused by inadequacy of velopharyngeal valve to close during speech
**The velum (soft part of palate in back of mouth) separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity
**Normally the valve is open to allow air to flow, but it should close during speech
**Muscles in pharynx (throat) also contract to move its walls inward
**VPI occurs if velum is not long enough to cover the hole, the pharynx is too wide, or the muscles in the velum or pharynx are not strong enough to close
*Terminology
**Velopharyngeal Inadequacy - general term for velopharyngeal dysfunction
**Velopharyngeal Insufficiency - anatomical or structural defect that prevents adequate velopharygeal closure
**Velopharyngeal Incompetence - neuromotor or physiological disorder resulting in poor movement of structures
**Velopharyngeal mislearning - inadequate closure secondary to faulty learning of appropriate articulation patterns
*Occurs often in individuals with history of cleft palate or with a submucous cleft
*May be associated with genetic syndrome or underlying congenital anomaly
**Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCF)
***About 20% of individuals with VPI are diagnosed with VCF in this clinic
***Highly variable condition:
****Conotruncal heart defects (50%)
****Tortuosity and medial displacement of carotidarteries
****Characteristic facies:
*****Microcephaly
*****Narrow palpebral fissures
*****Wide nasal root
*****Bulbous nasal tip
*****Vertical maxillary excess
*****Thin upper lip
*****Long face
*****Micrognathia
*****Minor auricular anomalies
****Short stature (below 10th percentile)
****Kidney or urinary tract anomalies
****DiGeorge sequence
****Hypotonia
****Learning problems or mental retardation
****Behavioral problems
***FISH studies find deletion of 22q11 for 90% of patients
**Stickler syndrome
***Most common cause of cleft palate
***Autosomal dominant with various expressivity
****Classical presentation
*****Pierre Robin sequence
*****Early onset osteoarthiritis
*****Severe myopia and retinal detachments
****Sensorineural and conductive hearing loss
****Characteristic facies
*****Micrognathia in infancy
*****Flat facial profile
*****Epicanthal folds
*****Midface hypoplasia
*****Flat nasal bridge
****Development usually normal
***Diagnosis usually made clinically because genetically heterogeneous
*May be due to teratogenic exposure during pregnancy
***Critical period for palatal development from weeks 8-11
***Includes viruses, drugs, infections, and radiation

==Clinical features==
*Hypernasality
*Nasal air emission
*Weak or omitted consonants
*Short utterance length
*Altered rate and speech segment durations
*Compensatory and obligatory articulation productions
**Nasalization of oral consonants
**Glottal stop
**Nasal sniff
**Breathiness

==Assessment==
*Done by multidisciplinary team
*Perceptual speech assessment
**Listen to speech and observe facial movements during articulation
**Detect abnormal air flow through nose
***Nasometry
***Airflow measures
*Endoscopy
**Allows visualization of valving mechanism during speech
**Pass flexible tube through nasal passages
*Multiview videofluoroscopy
**For children too young for endoscopy
**May require barium for contrast

==Management==
*Nonsurgical
**Mild VPI cases
**Speech therapy to improve articulation and strengthen closure patterns
**Prosthetic devices
***For patients who cannot undergo surgery or are not helped by repeated surgeries
***Obturator (dental prosthesis) that extendsinto velopharyngeal space and closes valve when pharyngeal walls move inward
***Palatal lift lifts soft palate into position so that velum is close to pharyngeal walls if palatal motion is not sufficient
*Surgical
**Recommended when possible
**Usually performed around 4-5 years old
**To prevent abnormal leakage of air through faulty valve
**Pharyngeal flap
***Create flap of mucous membrane and muscle from back of throat to soft palate
***Small openings remain on either side to allow air to move through nose
***Must be careful of abnormally placed carotid arteries in kids with VCF
*Sphincter pharyngoplasty
***Repositioning muscles that run vertical from soft plate to sides of pharynx
***Not as common
**Children require close monitoring after surgery
***Healing takes about 1 year
***Still may require speech therapy

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Feelings about the diagnosis (anxiety, fear, guilt, depression, relief)
*Support - family, friends
*Disruption of school, family life for management

      <text xml:space="preserve">Framing walls begins with cutting the top and bottom [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_plate plates] to the desired lengths.  If the wall is to be sheathed, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_plate plates] should be cut on 16&quot; intervals, for example, the total length of the wall will be 26', the first plates should be cut at 16' and then the second set at 10', attached together at the ends. This ensures that once the stud spacing is laid out for the wall (every 16&quot; on center in our example) a stud will land on the joint in our plates therefore supporting the joint. Having the plates together on edge and ensuring they are flush at one end, we hook our tape measure on to that end of our 16' set of plates and begin placing a mark every 16&quot;.  This mark represents the center of our studs when we secure them.

Secure the studs to the one plate (perpendicularly) and then secure the other plate to the other end of the studs.  A second top plate is often required.  This second top plate will strengthen the joint in our original top plate and aid in securing our wall to other walls by overlapping as well as ensuring a proper load distribution from the trusses or joists above them to the studs of the wall being framed.

If sheathing or diagonally bracing the wall prior to raising, you must &quot;square&quot; the wall first.  Secure the bottom of the wall(permanently or temporarily). Given that the length of the wall is the same at the top and bottom, and that the height is the same at both ends, a diagonal measurement is taken from one corner to the other, switch corners, shift the top of the wall side to side until both corner to corner measurements are equal. Secure top of wall temporarily to keep it square.

Begin sheathing from the same end you started laying out your studs so that the sheets break on the studs, or if the wall does not require sheathing, brace diagonally. Unsecure top of wall and raise wall until vertical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vitamin C Deficiency'''

(Ascorbic Acid Deficiency, Scurvy)

==General Information==
*Vitamin C is reducing agent that is easily oxidized or destroyed by heat
*Deficiency can cause defects in collagen formation
*Adrenal glands and lenses have high concentrations of Vitamin C

==Etiology==
*Infants born with adequate stores of Vitamin C if mother's intake was good
**Breast milk also provides adequate source of Vitamin C
**Infants not breastfeeding or whose mothers are deficient require supplements
*Majority of cases occur from 6-12 months
*Febrile illnesses increase need for Vitamin C
**Particularly infectious or diarrheal diseases
**Iron deficiency, cold exposure, protein depletion, and smoking also increase need for intake of Vitamin C

==Pathology==
*Collagen formed during deficiency is low in hydroxyproline
**Leads to hemorrhage, defective tooth dentin, and loosening of teeth
**Endochondral bone formation ceases
**Bones may become brittle and fracture easily
*Periosteum becomes loosened and hemorrhages in femur and tibia common
*Degeneration in skeletal muscles, cardiac hypertrophy, bone marrow depression, adrenal atrophy if severe.

==Clinical Manifestations==
*Begins with irritability, tachypnea, digestive disturbances, and loss of appetite
*General tenderness, especially in legs
**Pain causes pseudoparalysis with legs in &quot;frog position&quot;
**Swelling and hemorrhage along legs
*Face appears apprehensive, gums swollen
*Depression of sternum
*Petechiae in skin or mucous membranes
*Hematuria, melena, orbital, or subdural hemorrhages
*Anemia due to inability to utilize iron or impairment in folic acid metabolism
*Swollen joints

==Roentgenographic Manifestations==
*Usually basis of diagnosis of Vitamin C deficiency
*Changes in long bones especially at knee
**Begin as simple atrophy
**Zone of well calcified cartilage appears as thick, irregular white line around bone
**Difficult to diagnose at this stage
*Subperiosteal hemorrhages at ends of bone may become more intense as deficiency becomes more severe

==Diagnosis==
*Based mainly on clinical findings and history of poor intake of Vitamin C
*Laboratory tests not very good index
*Can get estimate from amount of urinary excretion of Vitamin C after test does of ascorbic acid
**Children with deficiency secrete less ascorbic acid than those without
**Check concentrations 3-5 hours after administration of test dose

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Arthritis or acrodynia due to pain in limbs exacerbated by movement
*Rheumatic fever - rare in children under 2 years of age
*Suppurative arthritis and osteomyelitis
*Syphilis due to pseudoparalysis - usually occurs at earlier age and has other symptoms
*Polio - doesn't cause tenderness in limbs
*Henoch-Schonlein purpura, thrombocytopenic purpura, leukemia, meningococcemia, nephritis also may be considered

==Prognosis==
*Recovery rapid when treated correctly
**Pain ceases within few days
**May take months for subperiosteal hemorrhage to disappear
**Body growth resumes quickly
*Unrecognized/untreated cases may lead to death
**From malnutrition, exhaustion, intercurrent disease
**Uncommonly have permanent deformity

==Treatment==
*Can be prevented by providing formula fed infants 25-50 mg ascorbic acid daily
**Lactating mothers should have minimum intake of 80 mg per day
**Children and adults need 50 mg per day
*Therapeutic dose of ascorbic acid is 100-200 mg daily

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Von Gierkes Disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type I)'''

==Description==
*Pathway= The body needs sugar in the form of glucose to function. Glucose is what give sall of our cells the energy they need to function properly. In ordet o get it, it has to be broken down from larger molecules that store it (glycogen). It is primarily stored in the liver and muscles. Ths disorder has achnage in the genes that make the pieces that break down the larger molecules into sugar = the levels of sugar are too low and the large molecules start to build up.
*Deficiency in the breakdown of glucose. G6Pase activity requires 2 components of the microsomal membrane: (1) a glucose-6-phosphate specific transport system that shuttles G6P from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (a G6P translocase), and (2) an enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase, bound to the luminal surface of the membrane.
*Three types
**GSD Ia = the basic defect in glucose-6-phosphatase activity ion the liver, kidney and intestinal lining.
**GSD Ib = defect is in the glucose-6-phosphate transfer gene so you can see activity of glucose-6-phosphatase when testing.
**GSD Ic = defect is in the pyrophosphate transfer - RARE
**GSD Id = defect in glucose transport - RARE

==Characteristics==
*Type Ia (most commonly associated with vGD.
**Short stature &amp; growth delay
**Abdomen protrusion
**Build up of glycogen and fat in the liver
**Enlarged liver and malignant/benign growths in the liver
**Yellow plaques on skin (xanthomas)
**Spider-like arteries, gout in the ear or kidney
**Bleeding disorders
**Hypoglycemia
**Hypertension
**Doll-like faces with large cheeks
*Type Ib
**All of the above
**Small numbers of nuetrophils in the blood (neutropenia)
**Bacterial infections
**Oral and intestinal sores.

==Genetics==
*Type Ia maps to chromosome 17q21.
*Type Ib maps to chromsome 11q23
*All are autosomal recessive

==Diagnosis==
*Based on variety of lab results
**G6PD
**Increase in lipids in blood (lipidemia)
**High levels of uric acid in blood (hyperurcemia)
**High levels of ketones in blood (ketonemia)
**Metabolic acidosis (increase of acids or decrease in water fluid)

==Treatment==
*Glucose drinks during the day
*Infusion at night through a nasogastric tube
*Cornstarch throughout the day for older children
*Dietary restrictions on fructose and galactose = need to supplement with calcium and multivitamins.
*Add Allopurinol to reduce uric acid levels which occurs because of the decrease in renal clearance and the increased production of uric acid as glycogen is not broken down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome'''

==Overview of Cancer==
*Cancer is caused by a mixture of genes and environment
**All cancer is genetic, but not all cancer is hereditary
**Most cancers are sporadic
*Cells in our bodies are always growing and dividing
**Genes control and regulate cell growth
**Changes in these genes result in a cell that grows out of control
***Uncontrolled cell growth is cancer
***Changes in DNA occur due to damage to genetic material
****DNA contains instructions for making proteins
****Proteins determine how cells work and regulate our development
****DNA must be copied each time a cell divides, and mistakes can occur in this process
*Hereditary cancer occurs when a person inherits one non-working copy of a gene
**One step closer to developing cancer than person with two working copies
**Features of hereditary cancer:
***Earlier age of onset
***Multiple generations affected
***Bilateral or multiple primary cancers
***Siblings both affected with related cancers

==Etiology of VHL==
*VHL gene located on chromosome 3p26-25
**Tumor suppressor gene
**Normal gene product has several functions:
***Transcriptional regulation by interaction with elongin
***Post-transcriptional repression of genes induced by hypoxia
***Regulation of p27 (cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor)
**Over 150 mutations have been identified
*Incidence is 1/35,000 to 1/40,000
**5-20% of mutations are de novo
**Penetrance is 80-90%
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
*There is genotype-phenotype correlation

==Clinical Features==
*Hemangioblastoma
**CNS hemangioblastoma
***Characteristic lesion of VHL
***80% develop in brain and 20% in spinal cord
***Clinical symptoms
****Headache, vomiting, and gait disturbance or ataxia if in brain
****Pain, sensory and motor loss, or asymptomatic if in spinal cord
***Generally slow growing but may also be rapidly enlarging cysts in brain causing hydrocephalus and papilledema
**Retinal
***Found in about 70% of patients and are often initial manifestations
***May be detected on ophthalmoscopy
***Clinical symptoms
****Asymptomatic in some individuals
****Visual field defect
****Loss of visual activity due to retinal detachment or hemorrhage
***Number of hemangiomas doesn't increase with age but probability of vision loss does
*Renal lesions
**Multiple renal cysts are common
**Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 40% of patients
***Usually clear cell type
***Develop within cyst or in surrounding parenchyma
***Leading cause of mortality
*Pheochromocytoma
**May cause sustained or episodic hypertension or be asymptomatic
**Located on one or both adrenal glands usually but may be in other places
**Rarely cause malignant degeneration
*Pancreatic lesions
**Most are simple cysts and are usually multiple
**Rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency
***Cysts in head of pancreas can cause biliary obstruction
***Neuroendocrine tumors of pancreas can develop and become malignant
*Endolymphatic sac tumors (10% of patients)
**Cause deafness of varying degrees of severity
**Vertigo or tinnitus may be presenting complaint
**Large tumors can invade other cranial nerves
*Epididymal tumors
**Relatively common in males
**May cause infertility if bilateral
**Women may develop equivalent papillary cystadenoma of broad ligament - uncommon
*Natural history
**Wide variation in age of onset of symptoms
**Organ system involvement and disease severity also vary greatly

==Genotype - Phenotype Correlation==
*Type 1 - no pheo
**Partial gene deletion
**Small insertions or deletions (frameshifts)
**Nonsense mutations
**Splice site mutations
*Type 2 - with pheo
**Missense mutations
**Type 2A
***Without renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic cysts
***Y98H, Y112H, V116F, L188V
**Type 2B
***With renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic cysts
***R167Q and R167W
**Type 2C
***With pheos only
***V155L and R238W

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical diagnosis
**Features needed for diagnosis
***Isolated case with two or more characteristic lesions
***Asymptomatic individual with positive family history with one or more of following
****Retinal hemangioblastoma
****Spinal or cerebellar hemangioblastoma
****Pheochromocytoma
****Multiple pancreatic cysts
****Epididymal cystadenoma
****Multiple renal cysts
****Renal cell carcinoma before age 60
**Tests used to make diagnosis
***CT scans or MRI to look for CNS and visceral tumors
***Ultrasound exam of epididymus, broad ligament, and possibly kidneys
***Radioiodine labeled MIBG if extra-adrenal tumors are susected
***Urinary catecholamine metabolite analysis
****VMA, metanephrine, and total catecholamine
****Suggest presence of pheos even if hypertension not present
*Molecular genetic testing
**Available clinically
**For cases that meet strict clinical criteria, mutation detection nears 100%
***Southern blotting
****Detects complete or partial gene deletions
****Responsible for about 28% of cases
***DNA sequence analysis
****Of all three exons to detect point mutations
****Missense mutations not previously characterized must be interpreted with caution
**Indicated in all individuals with known or suspected VHLdiagnosis
**Prenatal testing
***For pregnancies at 50% risk if mutation identified in affected parent
***Typically adult-onset so requires careful genetic counseling

==Treatment/Management==
*Surveillance
**DNA testing in at-risk family members can reduce need for costly screening in those who test negative
**Early recognition of manifestations may allow for improved outcome
**Ophthalmological screening beginning at age 5
**Annual blood pressure monitoring and measurement of urinary catecholamine metabolites beginning at age 5 in families with pheos
**Annual abdominal ultrasound beginning at age 16
**CT or MRI of suspicious lesions in kidney, adrenal gland, or pancreas
**Possible baseline MRI of brain and spine in young adults
*Management of tumors
**CNS hemangioblastoma
***Some advocate early surgical removal while others follow lesions with imaging
***Most lesions eventually require intervention
***Gamma knife surgery can be used for small tumors or those in inoperable sites
***Surgical complications include paraplegia and operative mortality (10%)
**Retinal hemangioblastoma
***Laser and cryosurgery used with varying degrees of success depending on location, size, and number of lesions
***Recurrent tumors have been noted
**Renal cell carcinoma
***Early surgery is best option
***Renal transplantation in patients who require bilateral nephrectomy
**Pheochromocytoma
***Surgically removed
***Preoperative treatment with alpha-adrenergic blockade for 7-10 days
**Endolymphatic sac tumors
***Slow growing
***Possible deafness if removed
**Epididymal or broad ligament papillary cyst adenomas usually don't require surgery

      <text xml:space="preserve">Email began as an experiment by the military to be able to send to and from the battlefield.  Thus was born email or electronic-mail

The first email was sent in 1972 using two machines by an engineer named Ray Tomlinsin. Later he wrote a mail program for Tenex, the BBN-grown operating system that, by now, was running on most of the ARPANET's PDP-10 machines. (Heliomedia)
The mail program was written in two parts (1)to send messages, you would use a program called SNDMSG; (2)to receive mail, you would use the other part called READMAIL.(Heliomedia)

In 1972, the commands MAIL and MLFL were added to the FTP program and provided standard network transport capabilities for email transmission. FTP sent a separate copy of each email to each recipient, and provided the standard ARPANET email functionality until the early 1980's when the more efficient SMTP protocol was developed. Among other improvements, SMTP enabled sending a single message to a domain with more than one addressee, after which the local server would locally copy the message to each recipient. (Livinginternet) 

Over the years the email has evolved with many different programs put with it and many people working to improve the email systems.

In 1993, the large network service providers America Online and Delphi started to connect their proprietary email systems to the Internet, beginning the large scale adoption of Internet email as a global standard. (Livinginternet)

[[Category:Internet Technologies]]

The first important email standard was called SMTP, or simple message transfer protocol. SMTP was very simple and is still in use - however, as we will hear later in this series, SMTP was a fairly naïve protocol, and made no attempt to find out whether the person claiming to send a message was the person they purported to be. Forgery was (and still is) very easy in email addresses. These basic flaws in the protocol were later to be exploited by viruses and worms, and by security frauds and spammers forging identities. Some of these problems are still being addressed in 2004.

(Category: Net History)

Ian, Peter; http://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/email.html


E-mail predates the Internet; existing e-mail systems were a crucial tool in creating the Internet. 1965 as a way for multiple users of a time-sharing mainframe computer to communicate. Although the exact history is murky, among the first systems to have such a facility were SDC's Q32 and MIT's CTSS. E-mail was quickly extended to become network e-mail, allowing users to pass messages between different computers. The early history of network e-mail is also murky; the AUTODIN system may have been the first allowing electronic text messages to be transferred between users on different computers in 1966, but it is possible the SAGE system had something similar some time before. The ARPANET computer network made a large contribution to the evolution of e-mail. There is one report [1] which indicates experimental inter-system e-mail transfers on it shortly after its creation, in 1969. Ray Tomlinson initiated the use of the @ sign to separate the names of the user and their machine in 1971 [2]. The common report that he &quot;invented&quot; e-mail is an exaggeration, although his early e-mail programs SNDMSG and READMAIL were very important. The first message sent by Ray Tomlinson is not preserved; it was &quot;a message announcing the availability of network email&quot;[3]. The ARPANET significantly increased the popularity of e-mail, and it became the killer app of the ARPANET.


((Origins of E-mail)

http://www.lookforemails.com/EmailFacts.aspx



BBN was the first company to send an e-mail. BBN stands for Bolt Beranek and Newman. BBN was hired by the US Defense Department and created what is known as the ARPANET. The ARPANET helped to evolved into what is known today as the internet. The first e-mail was sent three years later in 1971 by Ray Tomlinson. Ray Tomlinson eventually was the first to use the @ symbol in his emails to show which message was sent at which computer to show that it wasnt a local host.

http://www.mailmsg.com/history.htm

One of the first new developments when personal computers came on the scene was &quot;offline readers&quot;. Offline readers allowed email users to store their email on their own personal computers, and then read it and prepare replies without actually being connected to the network - sort of like Microsoft Outlook can do today. (Net History)

This was particularly useful in parts of the world where telephone costs to the nearest email system were expensive. (often this involved international calls in the early days) With connection charges of many dollars a minute, it mattered to be able to prepare a reply without being connected to a telephone, and then get on the network to send it. It was also useful because the &quot;offline&quot; mode allowed for more friendly interfaces. Being connected direct to the host email system in this era of very few standards often resulted in delete keys and backspace keys not working, no capacity for text to &quot;wrap around&quot; on the screen of the users computer, and other such annoyances. Offline readers helped a lot. (Net History)

The first important email standard was called SMTP, or simple message transfer protocol. SMTP was very simple and is still in use - however, as we will hear later in this series, SMTP was a fairly naïve protocol, and made no attempt to find out whether the person claiming to send a message was the person they purported to be. Forgery was (and still is) very easy in email addresses. These basic flaws in the protocol were later to be exploited by viruses and worms, and by security frauds and spammers forging identities. Some of these problems are still being addressed in 2004.  (Net History)

But as it developed email started to take on some pretty neat features. One of the first good commercial systems was Eudora, developed by Steve Dorner in 1988. Not long after Pegasus mail appeared. (Net History)

When Internet standards for email began to mature the POP (or Post Office Protocol) servers began to appear as a standard - before that each server was a little different. POP was an important standard to allow users to develop mail systems that would work with each other. (Net History)

These were the days of per-minute charges for email for individual dialup users. For most people on the Internet in those days email and email discussion groups were the main uses. These were many hundreds of these on a wide variety of topics, and as a body of newsgroups they became known as USENET. (Net History)

With the World Wide Web, email started to be made available with friendly web interfaces by providers such as Yahoo and Hotmail. Usually this was without charge. Now that email was affordable, everyone wanted at least one email address, and the medium was adopted by not just millions, but hundreds of millions of people. (Net History)</text>

== What is the Cookbook?==
The cookbook is a collaborative effort to document all aspects of cooking from recipes to culinary techniques. As a Wikibook, anyone is free to add, edit, or change content. A wiki is an ideal forum for communicating information such as recipes because it allows users to give feedback about recipes they have tried themselves. Consult the [[Help:Wikibooks|Wikibook help]] page for a well-organized and comprehensive overview of Wikibooks.

==How is the Cookbook organized?==
The Cookbook is organized around [[Categories]] and types. Category pages are useful as tables of contents, but do not have additional content written about them. When a new recipe is created, a category, e.g., Italian_Recipes, can be added to the bottom of the new recipe page. By doing so, this new recipe is added to that category page, which is simply an automatically generated listing of all pages referring to that Category. Cookbook entries are also organized by types. Types are groupings that are substantial enough to have additional content written about them. For example, the page for the type [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Italy]] has information about Italian cooking techniques, historical information, and a selective listing of the most important Italian recipes. When a new Italian recipe is created, its type is entered into the top of its page and the user has the option of manually linking to that recipe from the type page if they deem the new recipe important enough.

==How can I add a recipe?==
Consult the [[Cookbook:Policy|Policy page]] for an explanation of how pages are formatted.

==How do I keep track of recent changes to the Cookbook?==
First, select the recent changes module in the left-hand navigation. By default, the module displays changes made to all of the Wikibooks. You can then filter the listing by namespace, such as [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentChanges&amp;namespace=102 Cookbook] or [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentChanges&amp;namespace=103 Cookbook talk], using the drop-down list and then clicking on the Go button.

Alternatively, you can use the watchlist to keep track of a particular entry. On the top of the page, when you are logged in, there is a tab that says &quot;watch&quot;. When you click that button, the page will go onto your personal watch list. Then, to see your watchlist, you can click the &quot;My Watchlist&quot; link in the upper right-hand corner (near your user name). Alternatively, when you edit a page, there is a check box labelled &quot;Watch this page&quot;, which has the same effect. If you want to automatically watch every page you edit, you could click on the &quot;preferences&quot; link (right next to &quot;my watchlist&quot;), and under the &quot;editing&quot; button, click the checkbox called &quot;Add pages you edit to your watchlist&quot;. Then, every time you edit a page in the cookbook, it will add that page to your watchlist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Importance of Elephants==

As the strongest Arimaa piece, the elephant is unique in its value. Although it cannot be pushed or pulled, an elephant is not entirely immune from capture&amp;mdash;if it voluntarily enters a trap square, it needs an adjacent friendly piece to keep it alive. With a game still in progress, an elephant loss will almost always be devastating. A strong elephant blockade can also be ruinous. 

The only thing worth more than an elephant is a guaranteed goal&amp;mdash;an elephant may need to be sacrificed to help a friendly rabbit reach goal, but since the game has been won there is no problem.  In rare circumstances, such as move 38s of [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/games/jsShowGame.cgi?gid=181966&amp;s=w this game], giving up one's elephant may be the only way to stop an enemy goal.

|By pushing or pulling the silver rabbit away from the f3 trap, Gold can capture the silver elephant.
}}

==Value of Other Pieces==

The practical value of each piece depends on its strength relative to the opponent's remaining forces. If both enemy horses are gone, a friendly camel and horse are nearly equal in strength, since a dog is the strongest piece which either can threaten. The absence of enemy horses also makes friendly dogs stronger, as they face few threats.

As the board clears, ''quantity'' of material becomes increasingly important. &quot;Weak&quot; pieces will need to block enemy goals, and rabbits are obviously needed to create one's own goal threats. Try not to trade two pieces for one moderately stronger piece. 

In the endgame, ''goal threats'' are often worth more than material&amp;mdash;when an enemy rabbit has a path to goal, goal defense must take priority over captures. A strong goal threat of your own may also be preferable to a material lead.  At the end of [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=43158&amp;s=w this game], Silver gave up his camel but created a strong goal threat, which Gold was unable to stop. In taking the silver camel, the gold elephant stayed too far away from where it was most needed.

== &quot;Even&quot; Exchanges ==

Often an ''even exchange'' (the capture of identical forces on each side) will benefit one player more than the other. In chess, the player with stronger pieces usually benefits from even trades, but in Arimaa the weaker side often benefits. Consider a situation in which Gold has lost a dog and a cat while Silver has lost its camel, with all other pieces remaining. Gold is poised to overload the silver elephant, now the only piece which can threaten a gold horse. Gold's horses are now stronger than Silver's, and thus an &quot;even&quot; horse trade would favor Silver. Two such trades, removing all horses from the board, put Silver in the driver's seat; Silver is still up two-to-one in dogs and cats, pieces which now face fewer threats. The gold camel can't easily attack, or it will be taken hostage, giving Silver a large advantage in free pieces despite his own camel's absence. After losing his camel in a significant setback, Silver has by two &quot;even&quot; exchanges gained a decisive advantage. 

Some general rules of thumb:

* When material is identical, a player who has a strategic advantage due to holding a blockade, frame, or hostage usually attempts to win material outright, because even exchanges can diminish the advantage:
** A player whose elephant is blockaded will normally benefit from even trades, which will leave the opponent fewer pieces to spare for blockade duty.
** A player whose elephant is pinned to the defense of a framed piece will usually benefit from even trades, because with fewer pieces the opponent will have a harder time maintaining the frame.
** A player holding a camel hostage should try to maximize his advantage in free pieces, otherwise the hostage may lose its value.  
* When material is not identical, the exchange of a weak piece reduces the relative value of every stronger piece, whereas the exchange of a strong piece increases the relative value of every weaker piece.
** A player who has won a dog for nothing in the opening, and thus retains two dogs to the opponent's one, will then benefit by exchanging camels or horses, as this will leave fewer pieces which can threaten a dog. Cat-for-cat or rabbit-for-rabbit trades, however, will weaken the dog advantage, as one has given up equal material for pieces which a dog might have captured outright.
** A player who has won a camel for nothing in the opening is best served by trying to win further material outright. However, if he can take another piece or two without losing anything himself, he has then gained a significant edge in quantity of material. Even trades then become very favorable, as they in effect increase that edge.
** When a player has the only remaining camel on the board but not a significant edge in quantity of material, he should do his best to avoid &quot;even&quot; horse trades, especially with only one friendly horse left. When the enemy lacks a camel of his own, only his elephant can threaten a horse; the camel and the horse can thus force the enemy elephant to choose which to defend against. With no horse on its side, however, the camel will have a harder time attacking. 
** If one player has stronger pieces and the other has more numerous pieces, the player with more numerous pieces usually benefits from an even exchange. 
** The side with the greater number of Rabbits will usually benefit from any exchange which is roughly equal, such as two Dogs for a Horse and a Cat.

Finally, when a human plays a bot, &quot;even&quot; exchanges give the bot fewer possible positions to evaluate.

== Uneven Trades ==

When material is traded for non-identical material, the implications likewise depend on what has happened beforehand. Some rules of thumb '''when the board is full''':

* A Cat is worth more than a Rabbit, but not by much
* A Dog is worth approximately two Rabbits
* A Horse is worth approximately a Dog and a Rabbit
* A Camel is worth approximately a Horse and a Cat

These values correspond to opinions as of April 2011, and are subject to change as strategy is further refined.  

Once even material is exchanged, quantity becomes more of an issue, and thus a two-for-one trade would increasingly tend to favor the player capturing two pieces. The fewer rabbits one retains, the more a rabbit loss will hurt, as goal possibilities are further depleted.

== Sacrifices ==

Sometimes, material can be sacrificed to gain an overall advantage in the position. In a common example, you may find that you can take a [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Camel_Hostage|camel hostage]], but using your turn to that end would leave a friendly piece vulnerable to capture. Holding the enemy camel hostage does not automatically put one in control; in general, a hostage is only of benefit when one has an advantage in free pieces, which will be somewhat diminished by any material sacrifice. Moreover, if the enemy elephant chooses to abandon its camel, it will likely get something in return, having a head start while you make the capture. Add that to an initial sacrifice, and your opponent could come out fully compensated for his camel loss. A camel hostage is rarely worth sacrificing more than a cat for, and may not even be worth a rabbit. Such a dilemma requires you to carefully consider the entire position, thinking ahead to how you could capitalize and how your opponent could counter.

In [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=32065&amp;s=w this game], Silver sacrificed a cat to gain a camel hostage.

== Conclusion ==
It is not always clear which side has the advantage. Even an apparently favorable position depends on the player knowing how to capitalize; the real advantage is with the player who best understands the situation at hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''[[Federal Rules of Evidence]]''' are a staple of American legal education. Almost all law students learn the rules in their first or second year of law school. An understanding of the rules is critical when arguing a case in the courtroom, and important for any lawyer seeking to protect their client when a suit is filed.

Article I of the Federal Rules sets forth some basic laws which govern the application of the other rules of evidence.

==Rule 101. Scope==
:''These rules govern proceedings in the courts of the United States and before United States bankruptcy judges and United States magistrate judges, to the extent and with the exceptions stated in rule 1101.''

The purpose of this rule is to define when the Federal Rules of Evidence are authoritative.  Most generally, the rules apply in federal courts at any level.  However, the rules are also germane to proceedings in state courts because as of January 1, 2004, 41 states and Puerto Rico had adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Each state likely made several moderate and some substantial changes to the rules before they were officially codified by the state legislature.

There is no direct mention of rule 104, and there probably should be because while the rules generally govern proceedings in the district courts, they do not govern preliminary questions on the admissibility of evidence, except for rule 501.  
[[../Miscellaneous Rules|Rule 1101]] specifically states when the rules are applicable or inapplicable. Military courts use the evidence rules of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

==Rule 102. Purpose and Construction==
:''These rules shall be construed to secure fairness in administration, elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay, and promotion of growth and development of the law of evidence to the end that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined.''

Rule 102 is rarely cited by lawyers, but it quietly grants judges a huge deal of authority over trials, inviting them to &quot;eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay&quot; and &quot;grow&quot; and &quot;develop&quot; the law of evidence through their administration of the rules.

==Rule 103. Rulings on Evidence==
:'''''(a) Effect of erroneous ruling.''' Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and''

::'''''(1) Objection.''' In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context; or''
::'''''(2) Offer of proof.''' In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.''

:''Once the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.''

If you've ever watched a courtroom drama on TV or in the cinema, you've probably seen lawyers make &quot;objections&quot; in the courtroom. Lawyers raise and argue issues of evidence through these objections. Objecting is important because '''if a lawyer fails to object to evidence, they cannot appeal''' their case on the grounds that the evidence was improperly admitted. Rule 103(a) forces lawyers to object to any evidence they think might unfairly decide their case, so as to &quot;preserve error.&quot;

Objections come in many forms. Many objections are raised &quot;''in limine'',&quot; before the trial even starts. This keeps attorneys from having to argue about sensitive evidence in front of the jury. Some objections are made when one side's attorney asks a witness a question that makes the other side uncomfortable. Objections can even be made after the evidence is heard by the jury: such an objection is called a &quot;motion to strike,&quot; and while it won't keep the evidence away from the jury, it will preserve error.

:'''''(b) Record of offer and ruling.''' The court may add any other or further statement which shows the character of the evidence, the form in which it was offered, the objection made, and the ruling thereon. It may direct the making of an offer in question and answer form.''

:'''''(c) Hearing of jury.''' In jury cases, proceedings shall be conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in the hearing of the jury.''

After an objection is made, an attorney or the judge will often request to speak &quot;at sidebar,&quot; meaning out of the jury's earshot.

:'''''(d) Plain error.''' Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.''

While an objection is usually necessary to preserve error, appeals courts occasionally take notice of truly egregious errors by trial judges, even when there is no objection. However, such cases are rare: it's always important to object to any evidence that might become an issue of contention on appeal.

==Rule 104. Preliminary Questions==

:'''''(a) Questions of admissibility generally.''' Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subdivision (b). In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges.''

When a judge decides whether or not to admit evidence, they usually do so under Rule 104(a), with only two exceptions (noted below). A 104(a) determination is fairly straightforward: the attorneys present arguments for and against admissibility, often supported by extrinsic evidence, and the judge determines whether the contested evidence should be admitted. The arguments and evidence heard by the judge need not be admissible in front of the jury, with the caveat that privileged information (such as attorney-client communications) cannot be considered. (Privileges are discussed in further detail in [[../Privileges|this chapter]].)

:'''''(b) Relevancy conditioned on fact.''' When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.''

Rule 104(b) is used in determining two types of evidentiary questions: authentication of evidence (Rule 901) and prior bad acts (Rule 404(b)). When these issues are being considered, the attorney must &quot;tie up&quot; the admissibility by presenting extrinsic evidence that proves admissibility. This can be done either before or after the evidence is presented, at the judge's discretion.

:'''''(c) Hearing of jury.''' Hearings on the admissibility of confessions shall in all cases be conducted out of the hearing of the jury. Hearings on other preliminary matters shall be so conducted when the interests of justice require, or when an accused is a witness and so requests.''

Although judges have leeway to conduct evidentiary arguments in the presence of the jury, they will usually hear arguments at sidebar if either side requests it.

:'''''(d) Testimony by accused.''' The accused does not, by testifying upon a preliminary matter, become subject to cross-examination as to other issues in the case.''

:'''''(e) Weight and credibility.''' This rule does not limit the right of a party to introduce before the jury evidence relevant to weight or credibility.''

==Rule 105. Limited Admissibility==
:''When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.''

Almost every trial contains at least one &quot;limiting instruction,&quot; where the jury hears a damaging piece of evidence and the judge tells them they may only consider it for one purpose. Many lawyers argue against limiting instructions, claiming that &quot;the bell cannot be unrung&quot;&amp;mdash;once the evidence has been heard, the jury will want to consider it for any end that seems relevant. However, appeals courts usually assume that the jury will follow the limiting instruction, except in rare cases where the evidence is powerfully incriminating in a patently unfair way.

As with objections, a lawyer must request a limiting instruction in order to preserve error on appeal. If they do not request the instruction, they cannot fault the trial judge for not imposing the instruction.

==Rule 106. Remainder of or Related Writings or Recorded Statements==
There are two basic types of evidence: '''testimony''', evidence provided by the statements of witnesses in court, and '''exhibits''', evidence provided in physical form.

Exhibits have to have a '''foundation''' that makes their admissibility valid. One key part of this foundation is '''authentication''', or proving that the exhibit is what the proponent claims it is. For example, to show a &quot;murder weapon&quot; to the jury, the prosecutor must first establish that the weapon is the one used to commit the murder. Authentication rules are covered in depth in [[../Authentication|Article IX]].

Writings and recorded statements follow additional rules on top of authentication, and Rule 106 is one such rule, requiring that writings and recorded statements be presented in '''context''' if the other side demands it.

:''When a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article II of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''judicial notice'''.

==Rule 201. Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts==
:'''''(a) Scope of rule.''' This rule governs only judicial notice of adjudicative facts.''

:'''''(b) Kinds of facts.''' A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.''

Judicial notice is a very simple way to introduce a fact as evidence, but it is not frequently invoked.

The best-known example of judicial notice comes from the 1858 trial of [[w:William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong|&quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was charged with murder and defended by [[w:Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln]], then a Chicago railroad lawyer. An eyewitness claimed that Armstrong was able to see the victim in the moonlight. Lincoln produced a copy of the ''Farmers' Almanac'', and asked the judge to take judicial notice that the moon was too low in the sky to produce moonlight on the night in question. The judge agreed, and Armstrong was acquitted.

Judicial notice may be based on &quot;sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,&quot; such as Lincoln's almanac. Judicial notice can also be based on local general knowledge. A lawyer trying a case in New York may ask the judge to take judicial notice that the East River is located between Manhattan and Brooklyn, or that the Empire State Building is the tallest building in the city. In such a case, no extrinsic evidence would be necessary. However, if the New York lawyer wanted the judge to take judicial notice that the river is forty-five feet deep, or that Minneapolis is located west of St. Paul, the lawyer would probably need extrinsic evidence.

:'''''(c) When discretionary.''' A court may take judicial notice, whether requested or not.''

Rule 201(c) is often implied when dealing with the validity of scientific tests. &quot;Radar guns&quot; are a common example. When they were first introduced to measure the speed of cars, many judges would require attorneys to establish the validity of their readings before the readings could be considered as substantive evidence. Today, most judges take judicial notice of the reliability of these readings whether counsel asks for it or not, since radar gun evidence is common in the courtroom. Opposing counsel can object, but judges need not obtain evidence to overrule the objection.

:'''''(d) When mandatory.''' A court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information.''

Note that Rule 201(d) does not mean that all requests for judicial notice will be granted. Any judicial notice must be of a fact that falls under Rule 201(b). The judge may (and legally, should) refuse to take judicial notice of any fact that is not generally known or readily verifiable.

:'''''(e) Opportunity to be heard.''' A party is entitled upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed. In the absence of prior notification, the request may be made after judicial notice has been taken.''

:'''''(f) Time of taking notice.''' Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding.''

:'''''(g) Instructing jury.''' In a civil action or proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed. In a criminal case, the court shall instruct the jury that it may, but is not required to, accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed.''

Rule 201(g) differentiates criminal cases from civil cases. Its practical effect is on the jury instructions that come near the end of the trial. In the ''Armstrong'' case above, the judge's instruction would be:

* &quot;You '''may''', but '''are not required to''', accept as a fact that there was no moonlight on the night in question.&quot;

If ''Armstrong'' were a civil case (e.g., for wrongful death), the instruction would be:

* &quot;You '''must accept''' as '''conclusively true''' the fact that there was no moonlight on the night in question.&quot;

      <comment>/* Burden of going forward */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Article III of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''presumptions''' and '''burdens of proof'''. It applies to civil actions&amp;mdash;cases arising under non-criminal laws, such as contract, property and tort.

==Rule 301. Presumptions in General Civil Actions and Proceedings==
:''In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by Act of Congress or by these rules, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.''

The term &quot;burden of proof&quot; is often used in legal discourse, but for a technical analysis of the law, it is too vague. There are actually two forms of the burden of proof, commonly referred to as the '''burden of going forward''' and the '''burden of persuasion'''. Both of these burdens are addressed by Rule 301.

===Burden of going forward===

At any given time, one party is obligated to produce evidence regarding a claim or defense. This is the burden of going forward. When a presumption of fact is triggered, the other side has the burden to prove the non-existence of that fact.  Yet the committee notes and house judiciary report for Rule 301 rejects a '''bursting bubble approach''' to the burden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_301, Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, even if a party introduces adequate evidence contrary to the presumed fact, the presumption does not simply vanish--the presumption remains a part of the fact-finder's calculus.

For example, take a hypothetical civil case where one element of the claim is that it was raining on a given night. The plaintiff introduces evidence that the ground was wet the next morning. Imagine this creates a presumption that it rained the night before. The defendant must then rebut this presumption with other evidence: maybe eyewitnesses who say it wasn't raining, maybe evidence that a truck dumped water on the ground overnight. If a preponderance of the evidence disproves the presumption, the defendant has met his burden of persuasion.  However, the presumption that it rained the night before remains may still be considered by the jury or finder of fact, and alone may be sufficient evidence of the rain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_301, Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nevertheless, some Federal Courts still apply the bursting bubble approach.  Under this approach, in the above example, the eye-witness testimony that it did not rain would entirely negate the presumption that it rained, and the presumption could not be considered by the finder of fact.

This approach is unique to civil cases. Presumptions are not found in criminal cases because of the due process guarantees of the Constitution. The prosecution must always prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

===Burden of persuasion===

'''Beyond a reasonable doubt''' is one example of a burden of persuasion. That particular burden is the burden that applies when proving a criminal charge. In civil cases, the usual burden of persuasion is either '''preponderance of the evidence''' (&quot;more likely than not&quot;) or '''clear and convincing evidence'''.

Unlike the burden of going forward, the burden of persuasion never shifts. Allowing it to shift would make no sense, because it only applies in the context of the factfinder's final decision&amp;mdash;to the reasoning of the judge or jury in reaching their verdict. The plaintiff always has the burden to persuade the factfinder that their claim is valid; the civil defendant always has the burden to persuade the factfinder that their defense is valid.

Note that in criminal cases, the burden of persuasion rests with the prosecution at all times, even when the burden of going forward shifts to the defendant. For example, if the defendant raises an affirmative defense, the prosecution must persuade the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense is invalid.

==Rule 302. Applicability of State Law in Civil Actions and Proceedings==
:''In civil actions and proceedings, the effect of a presumption respecting a fact which is an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision is determined in accordance with State law.''

Rule 302 applies to civil cases brought to federal court under diversity jurisdiction. Diversity jurisdiction is a complex issue of civil procedure that merits little discussion here, except to say that it involves federal courts interpreting the law of states. Whenever a federal court is considering an issue of state law, Rule 302 requires the court to apply that state's law on presumptions to the proceeding. This means that the burden of going forward in such cases may not necessarily follow Rule 301.

      <comment>/* Rule 406. Habit; Routine Practice */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Article IV of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''relevancy'''&amp;mdash;the first consideration in determining the admissibility of evidence.

==Rule 401. Definition of &quot;Relevant Evidence&quot;==

:''&quot;Relevant evidence&quot; means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.''

Relevancy is the notion that every piece of evidence admitted in the courtroom must be &quot;tied&quot; to the case somehow. Any probative value will make evidence relevant. Note that relevancy is different from credibility. If evidence is merely unbelievable, the presumption is that it should be admissible, and the jury should decide whether or not to believe it.

Relevant evidence need not be probative of the core issues of the case, or of a disputed issue. Matters &quot;of consequence&quot; can include the background of parties and witnesses, or any other matter which weighs for or against the case of one of the parties.

==Rule 402. Relevant Evidence Generally Admissible; Irrelevant Evidence Inadmissible==

:''All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.''

Rule 402 makes relevancy the first consideration when objecting to evidence. If evidence cannot be tied to a matter of consequence, it cannot be admitted at all, regardless of whatever rules might indicate its validity. If evidence is relevant, then the other rules of evidence come into play.

==Rule 403. Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of Time==

:''Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.''

Rule 403 provides a &quot;balancing test&quot; for excluding relevant evidence. The balancing test is strongly weighted toward admission; there must be a danger of unfair prejudice that substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence. &quot;Unfair prejudice&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;prejudice&quot;&amp;mdash;almost all relevant evidence is prejudicial to one side or the other. Proving unfair prejudice is often difficult; proving the balance is even moreso.

Ordinarily, a 403 objection is the ''last'' objection a lawyer makes when seeking to exclude evidence. Besides the burden of tipping the balance, another key problem is that a 403 objection concedes the relevance of the evidence.

==Rule 404. Character Evidence Not Admissible To Prove Conduct; Exceptions; Other Crimes==
===Rule 404(a). Character evidence generally===

:''Evidence of a person's character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:

::(1) Character of accused - Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same, or if  evidence of  a trait of character of the alleged victim of the crime is offered by an accused and admitted under Rule 404 (a)(2),  evidence of the same  trait of character of the accused offered  by the prosecution;

::(2) Character of alleged victim - Evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the alleged victim of the crime offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same, or evidence of a character trait of peacefulness of the alleged victim offered by the prosecution in a homicide case to rebut evidence that the alleged victim was the first aggressor;

::(3) Character of witness - Evidence of the character of a witness, as provided in rules 607, 608, and 609.

===Rule 404(b). Other crimes, wrongs, or acts===

:''Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the accused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.

==Rule 405. Methods of Proving Character==
===Rule 405(a). Reputation or opinion===
:''In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of character of a person is admissible, proof may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into relevant specific instances of conduct.''

===Rule 405(b). Specific instances of conduct===
:''In cases in which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, proof may also be made of specific instances of that person's conduct.

==Rule 406. Habit; Routine Practice==
:''Evidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice.''

This is a cleverly worded rule, in the sense that it’s unique for a reason.  It states that habit evidence is ''relevant'' for a particular reason, to prove conformity on a particular occasion.  Normally, the rules specify a theory of relevance for which the evidence can or cannot be admitted; this rule does neither.  By specifying that the evidence is relevant for a particular purpose, the rule does not preclude exclusion by any other rule.  By not stating that it is ''admissible'' for that purpose, the rule does not preclude admission for other purposes by the principle of ''expressio unius est exclusio alterius''.   
	The rule's application and effect depends on how ‘habit’ is defined.  Habit is difficult to distinguish from character.  Usually, the trait must be proven to be a conditioned response and not otherwise inadmissible under rule 404(a).  A habit is the person’s regular practice of meeting a particular kind of situation with a specific type of conduct, such as the habit of going down a certain stairway two stairs at a time; a habit action is semi-automatic.  Still, it can be difficult to separate from character.  Routine practice, as it relates to more commercial and mechanical actions, does not pose the same problem.  Both are highly persuasive evidence.  To be properly admitted, it must directly relate or be connected to the conduct which it purports to prove.
	At common law, habit evidence wasn’t admissible unless corroborated and there were eye witnesses.  Obviously, the federal rule has changed this.

==Rule 407. Subsequent Remedial Measures==
:''When, after an injury or harm allegedly caused by an event, measures are taken that, if taken previously, would have made the injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence, culpable conduct, a defect in a product, a defect in a product's design, or a need for a warning or instruction. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.
''

This rule is constructed along familiar lines: it excludes evidence (the undertaking of subsequent remedial measures) when it is presented under specified theories of relevance.  However, the rule only bars subsequent remedial measures that would have prevented the harm that is the subject of the litigation.  The rule incorporates language that clearly indicates the arena of products liability; the reasoning behind this is parallel to the foundational policy behind the rule: the judiciary does not want to dissuade manufacturers, or anyone else, from taking remedial measures that might prevent future harm.  However, some courts allow it in products liability cases on the theory that the greater risk of liability, if admitted, would trigger the change, which is somewhat of a circular argument as it is designed to encourage improvements.

	The purposes for which the evidence may be admitted are limited by the requirement that the offer is made to prove a ''controverted fact''.  It can’t be offered to prove ownership or feasibility of precautionary measures unless the opponent has denied ownership or that taking remedial measures was possible.

	The rule does not bar evidence that measures have not been taken, but this might not be relevant unless the defense is lack of knowledge of the dangerous condition or product.  Evidence of subsequent remedial measures made by someone other than the instant defendant, like a peer corporation, is not excluded by the rule.  Firing an employee is a widely considered a subsequent remedial measure.

==Rule 408. Compromise and Offers to Compromise==
(a) '''Prohibited uses'''.--Evidence of the following is not admissible on behalf of any party, when offered to prove liability for, invalidity of, or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount, or to impeach through a prior inconsistent statement or contradiction:

(1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish--or accepting or offering or promising to accept--a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise the claim; and

(2) conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding the claim, except when offered in a criminal case and the negotiations related to a claim by a public office or agency in the exercise of regulatory, investigative, or enforcement authority.

(b) '''Permitted uses'''.--This rule does not require exclusion if the evidence is offered for purposes not prohibited by subdivision (a). Examples of permissible purposes include proving a witness's bias or prejudice; negating a contention of undue delay; and proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.

==Rule 409. Payment of Medical and Similar Expenses==
:Evidence of furnishing or offering or promising to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses occasioned by an injury is not admissible to prove liability for the injury.

==Rule 410. Inadmissibility of Pleas, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements== 
:Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence of the following is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions:

::(1) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn;
::(2) a plea of nolo contendere;
::(3) any statement made in the course of any proceedings under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or comparable state procedure regarding either of the foregoing pleas; or
::(4) any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.

:However, such a statement is admissible (i) in any proceeding wherein another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced and the statement ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it, or (ii) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record and in the presence of counsel.

==Rule 411. Liability Insurance==
:Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.

==Rule 412. Sex Offense Cases; Relevance of Victim's Past Behavior or Alleged Sexual Predisposition== 
:'''(a) Evidence generally inadmissible.''' The following evidence is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding involving alleged sexual misconduct except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c):
::(1) Evidence offered to prove that any alleged victim engaged in other sexual behavior.
::(2) Evidence offered to prove any alleged victim's sexual predisposition.

:'''(b) Exceptions.'''
::(1) In a criminal case, the following evidence is admissible, if otherwise admissible under these rules:
:::(A) evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior by the alleged victim offered to prove that a person other than the accused was the source of semen, injury, or other physical evidence;
:::(B) evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior by the alleged victim with respect to the person accused of the sexual misconduct offered by the accused to prove consent or by the prosecution; and
:::(C) evidence the exclusion of which would violate the constitutional rights of the defendant.
::(2) In a civil case, evidence offered to prove the sexual behavior or sexual predisposition of any alleged victim is admissible if it is otherwise admissible under these rules and its probative value substantially outweighs the danger of harm to any victim and of unfair prejudice to any party.  Evidence of an alleged victim's reputation is admissible only if it has been placed in controversy by the alleged victim.

:'''(c) Procedure to determine admissibility.'''
::(1) A party intending to offer evidence under subdivision (b) must&amp;mdash;
:::(A) file a written motion at least 14 days before trial specifically describing the evidence and stating the purpose for which it is offered unless the court, for good cause requires a different time for filing or permits filing during trial; and
:::(B) serve the motion on all parties and notify the alleged victim or, when appropriate, the alleged victim's guardian or representative.
::(2) Before admitting evidence under this rule the court must conduct a hearing in camera and afford the victim and parties a right to attend and be heard.  The motion, related papers, and the record of the hearing must be sealed and remain under seal unless the court orders otherwise.

==Rule 413. Evidence of Similar Crimes in Sexual Assault Cases== 
:(a) In a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of sexual assault, evidence of the defendant's commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault is admissible, and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.

:(c) This rule shall not be construed to limit the admission or consideration of evidence under any other rule.

:(d) For purposes of this rule and Rule 415, &quot;offense of sexual assault&quot; means a crime under Federal law or the law of a State (as defined in section 513 of title 18, United States Code) that involved--

::(4) deriving sexual pleasure or gratification from the infliction of death, bodily injury, or physical pain on another person; or
::(5) an attempt or conspiracy to engage in conduct described in paragraphs (1)-(4).

==Rule 414. Evidence of Similar Crimes in Child Molestation Cases==

::(2) any conduct proscribed by chapter 110 of title 18, United States Code;
::(3) contact between any part of the defendant's body or an object and the genitals or anus of a child;
::(4) contact between the genitals or anus of the defendant and any part of the body of a child;
::(5) deriving sexual pleasure or gratification from the infliction of death, bodily injury, or physical pain on a child; or
::(6) an attempt or conspiracy to engage in conduct described in paragraphs (1)-(5).

==Rule 415. Evidence of Similar Crimes in Civil Cases Concerning Sexual Assault and Child Molestation Cases==
:(a) In a civil case in which a claim for damages or other relief is predicated on a party's alleged commission of conduct constituting an offense of sexual assault or child molestation, evidence of that party's commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault or child molestation is admissible and may be considered as provided in Rule 413 and Rule 414 of these rules.

:(b) A party who intends to offer evidence under this Rule shall disclose the evidence to the party against whom it will be offered, including statements of witnesses or a summary of the substance of any testimony that is expected to be offered, at least fifteen days before the scheduled date of trial or at such later time as the court may allow for good cause.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article V of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with privileges. It consists of one rule.

==Rule 501. General Rule==
:''Except as otherwise required by the Constitution of the United States or provided by Act of Congress or in rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority, the privilege of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience. However, in civil actions and proceedings, with respect to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision, the privilege of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be determined in accordance with State law.''

Privilege is an important evidentiary rule, and there was a movement to codify key privileges in the Federal Rules of Evidence. But this movement did not succeed, and today's rules do not expressly state which privileges are recognized and which are not. The privileges themselves remain '''common law'''&amp;mdash;traditional rules which are periodically redefined by the courts.

The privileges that may be invoked in federal court include:

===Attorney-client privilege===
Covers all communications between an attorney, their client, and any other associates within the scope of the attorney's representation of the client. The client waives the privilege if they disclose the privileged information to a third party. There are several exceptions: the attorney may break privilege to prevent the client's commission of a dangerous criminal offense, and should break privilege when he or she knows that the client is lying to the court. The attorney can also use privileged information to rectify any fraudulent or criminal behavior perpetrated by the client with the attorney's unknowing assistance. Attorney-client privilege can also be broken when there is an issue of the attorney breaking his or her duty to the client (malpractice) or of the client breaking his or her duty to the attorney (failure to pay fees). See [http://www.law.harvard.edu/publications/evidenceiii/rules/503_proposed.htm Proposed Rule 503], which was rejected by Congress but contains good guidelines to the scope of the attorney-client privilege.

===Spousal privilege===
Confidential communications between spouses within the martial context are subject to spousal privilege.

===Priest-penitent privilege===
Under common law, a penitent may keep their disclosures to their priest under privilege. (The privilege belongs to the priest under Catholic canon law, and may only be broken with a dispensation from the cardinal, which can only be obtained with the permission of the Pope.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article VI of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] focuses on the competency and credibility of '''witnesses'''. The rules in this article come up often in ''impeachment''&amp;mdash;when one side seeks to discredit the other side's witness.

==Rule 601. General Rule of Competency==
:''Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules. However, in civil actions and proceedings, with respect to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision, the competency of a witness shall be determined in accordance with State law.''

The second sentence of Rule 601 is another reference to diversity jurisdiction, or the application of state law in federal court. When state substantive law is being applied to an issue, witnesses testifying to that issue must meet that state's legal standards for witness competency. These are sometimes identical to the federal standards and usually not significantly different, although there are some exceptions.

==Rule 602. Lack of Personal Knowledge==
:''A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the witness' own testimony. This rule is subject to the provisions of [[../Opinions#Rule 703. Bases of Opinion Testimony by Experts|rule 703]], relating to opinion testimony by expert witnesses.''

The most important prerequisites to be a witness are '''memory''' and '''perception'''. To be a witness, a person must have perceived the matter in question, and they must remember it. If they do not remember, or did not perceive, the matter, then their testimony is '''speculation''' and it is inadmissible.

==Rule 603. Oath or Affirmation==
:''Before testifying, every witness shall be required to declare that the witness will testify truthfully, by oath or affirmation administered in a form calculated to awaken the witness' conscience and impress the witness' mind with the duty to do so.''

The requirement of an &quot;oath&quot; or &quot;affirmation&quot; is misleading, because a formal oath or affirmation is not strictly necessary. Some witnesses, like small children and the mentally disabled, may not understand the meaning of an oath or affirmation. In these cases, it is enough to demonstrate, through testimony, that the witness understands the concept of truth, and the penalties for not telling the truth on the witness stand.

==Rule 604. Interpreters==
:''An interpreter is subject to the provisions of these rules relating to qualification as an expert and the administration of an oath or affirmation to make a true translation.''

==Rule 605. Competency of Judge as Witness==
:''The judge presiding at the trial may not testify in that trial as a witness. No objection need be made in order to preserve the point.''

==Rule 606. Competency of Juror as Witness==
:'''''(a) At the trial.''' A member of the jury may not testify as a witness before that jury in the trial of the case in which the juror is sitting. If the juror is called so to testify, the opposing party shall be afforded an opportunity to object out of the presence of the jury.''

:'''''(b) Inquiry into validity of verdict or indictment.''' Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury's deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror's mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror's mental processes in connection therewith, except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror. Nor may a juror's affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.''

==Rule 607. Who May Impeach==
:''The credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness.''

==Rule 608. Evidence of Character and Conduct of Witness== 
:'''''(a) Opinion and reputation evidence of character.''' The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.''

:'''''(b) Specific instances of conduct.''' Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness' character for truthfulness, other than conviction of crime as provided in rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness' character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified. The giving of testimony, whether by an accused or by any other witness, does not operate as a waiver of the accused's or the witness' privilege against self-incrimination when examined with respect to matters that relate only to character for truthfulness.''

==Rule 609. Impeachment by Evidence of Conviction of Crime== 
Rule 609 is the second rule that deals with the admissibility of prior convictions. It differs from [[../Relevancy#Rule 404(b). Other crimes, wrongs, or acts|Rule 404(b)]] in that the conviction can only be used to impeach the witness's credibility, not as substantive evidence. Because of the limited purpose for which the conviction is offered under this rule, only two types of convictions fall under its scope.

:'''''(a) General rule.''' For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness,''

::''(1) evidence that a witness other than an accused has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted, subject to [[../Relevancy#Rule 403. Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of Time|Rule 403]], if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness was convicted, and evidence that an accused has been convicted of such a crime shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused; and''

::''(2) evidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if it involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.''

A 609(a)(1) conviction is relevant because of its severity, and is presumptively admissible unless it fails the Rule 403 balancing test for unfair prejudice. The key term is &quot;punishable&quot;&amp;mdash;a conviction can be admitted under Rule 609(a) even if it was not punished at all, so long as there was a prospect of the death penalty or an extended prison sentence.

If a criminal defendant is being attacked with a 609(a)(1) conviction, a &quot;reverse 403&quot; balancing test applies. Note that the balancing test weighs toward inadmissibility.

A 609(a)(2) conviction is relevant because it is probative of the witness's honesty or truthfulness. Convictions that might be admissible under this rule include fraud, theft, perjury and insider trading. But many crimes&amp;mdash;even heinous crimes like murder, assault and kidnapping&amp;mdash;are not necessarily dishonest or untruthful.

While a conviction itself might be admissible under Rule 609, its details are not. Evidence under Rule 609 is usually limited to (1) the offense, (2) the conviction, (3) the date of the conviction, and (4) the sentence. A conviction admitted under Rule 404(b) may be fleshed out in much more detail. But remember: fewer convictions are admissible under Rule 404(b).

:'''''(b) Time limit.''' Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. However, evidence of a conviction more than 10 years old as calculated herein, is not admissible unless the proponent gives to the adverse party sufficient advance written notice of intent to use such evidence to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to contest the use of such evidence.''

Although the &quot;ten-year rule&quot; appears to be quite bendable, it is usually a complete bar to the admissibility of convictions. Some judges will, however, allow convictions beyond the ten-year rule if they pass the balancing test within the rule, and these decisions are usually not overturned on appeal.

Note that &quot;confinement&quot; does not include parole or probation: the ten-year clock begins on the date of conviction or release from prison, whichever is more recent.

:'''''(c) Effect of pardon, annulment, or certificate of rehabilitation.''' Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under this rule if (1) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted, and that person has not been convicted of a subsequent crime which was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year, or (2) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of innocence.''

:'''''(d) Juvenile adjudications.''' Evidence of juvenile adjudications is generally not admissible under this rule. The court may, however, in a criminal case allow evidence of a juvenile adjudication of a witness other than the accused if conviction of the offense would be admissible to attack the credibility of an adult and the court is satisfied that admission in evidence is necessary for a fair determination of the issue of guilt or innocence.''

:'''''(e) Pendency of appeal.''' The pendency of an appeal therefrom does not render evidence of a conviction inadmissible. Evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.''

==Rule 610. Religious Beliefs or Opinions==
:''Evidence of the beliefs or opinions of a witness on matters of religion is not admissible for the purpose of showing that by reason of their nature the witness' credibility is impaired or enhanced.''

==Rule 611. Mode and Order of Interrogation and Presentation==
:'''''(a) Control by court.''' The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.''

:'''''(b) Scope of cross-examination.''' Cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. The court may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.''

Examination of witnesses is often said to follow an &quot;inverted funnel&quot; pattern. On direct examination, any relevant matter can be brought up in questioning. The cross-examiner is limited to the scope of the direct examination and to credibility issues. On re-direct, the examiner is limited to the scope of the cross-examination. If the cross-examiner wishes to re-cross, they will be limited to the scope of the re-direct. And so on. When a lawyer crosses outside the permitted subject matter under Rule 611(b), it is called &quot;exceeding the scope,&quot; and is objectionable.

:'''''(c) Leading questions.''' Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness' testimony. Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination. When a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation may be by leading questions.''

Leading questions are banned on direct examination to keep lawyers from &quot;feeding&quot; their witnesses the answers to each question.

The orthodoxy among courtroom lawyers today is that ''only'' leading questions should be used on cross-examination, because the witness can be counted on to give an unfavorable answer if they are given any room to respond. This principle is also why lawyers are allowed to lead hostile or adverse witnesses. An example of &quot;a witness identified with an adverse party&quot; is a police officer from the perspective of a criminal defendant.

In some cases, the direct examiner may need to lead the witness for reasons unrelated to hostility. Small children, for instance, are often confused by open-ended questions. In such situations, the examiner will usually ask the judge for permission to lead.

==Rule 612. Writing Used to Refresh Memory==
:''Except as otherwise provided in criminal proceedings by section 3500 of title 18, United States Code, if a witness uses a writing to refresh memory for the purpose of testifying, either:''

::''(1) while testifying, or''
::''(2) before testifying, if the court in its discretion determines it is necessary in the interests of justice,''

:''an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness. If it is claimed that the writing contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony the court shall examine the writing in camera, excise any portions not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto. Any portion withheld over objections shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal. If a writing is not produced or delivered pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice requires, except that in criminal cases when the prosecution elects not to comply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if the court in its discretion determines that the interests of justice so require, declaring a mistrial.''

In some situations, a witness has first-hand knowledge of relevant facts, but cannot recall them when questioned in court. If this happens, the lawyer questioning the witness can use Rule 612 to &quot;jog their memory&quot; by showing them a record of their prior statement. The witness cannot get their testimony from the record itself: under Rule 612, the record is only shown to them to refresh their recollection. The questioning might go like this:

*Q. Do you remember the license plate number?
*A. KX... uh, no, I'm afraid I don't.
*Q. I'm showing you Defense Exhibit A. ''(hands over a copy of the witness's statement to the police)'' Please read it to yourself.
*A. All right.
*Q. Now turn it over and set it aside. Do you remember the plate number?
*A. Yes... it was KX4-56F.

In the above example, the witness has to ''remember'' the plate number, not just repeat what is on the paper in front of them. However, if they cannot remember independently, the exhibit can be offered into evidence under Rule 803(5), discussed in the chapter on [[../Hearsay|hearsay]].

==Rule 613. Prior Statements of Witnesses== 
:'''''(a) Examining witness concerning prior statement.''' In examining a witness concerning a prior statement made by the witness, whether written or not, the statement need not be shown nor its contents disclosed to the witness at that time, but on request the same shall be shown or disclosed to opposing counsel.''

:'''''(b) Extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statement of witness.''' Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require. This provision does not apply to admissions of a party-opponent as defined in rule 801(d)(2).''

Rule 613 is about '''prior inconsistent statements'''. When a witness says one thing out of the courtroom and then says something else on the witness stand, the opposing party can use their inconsistency to attack their credibility. Rule 613(a) allows a lawyer to &quot;ambush&quot; their opponent's witnesses with a prior inconsistent statement: Rule 613(b) forces the lawyer to ambush the witness on cross-examination, not later when they are unable to respond.

Prior inconsistent statements ''given under oath'' are also admissible as substantive evidence under [[../Hearsay#Prior inconsistent statements|Rule 801(d)(1)(A)]]. The key difference between the two rules is that 613 statements are only useful for impeaching a witness, while 801 statements can be used for any relevant purpose. 801(d)(1)(A) statements can be thought of as a subset of 613 statements; all prior inconsistent statements are admissible to impeach, but only some are admissible for their truth. 801(d)(1)(A) admissibility also overcomes the 613(b) restriction on extrinsic evidence.

Although Rule 613(a) does not specifically apply to &quot;inconsistent&quot; statements, prior ''consistent'' statements are irrelevant for the purposes of impeachment: they can, however, be admitted as substantive evidence under [[../Hearsay#Prior consistent statements|Rule 801(d)(1)(B)]].

==Rule 614. Calling and Interrogation of Witnesses by Court== 
:'''''(a) Calling by court.''' The court may, on its own motion or at the suggestion of a party, call witnesses, and all parties are entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called.''

:'''''(b) Interrogation by court.''' The court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or by a party.''

:'''''(c) Objections.''' Objections to the calling of witnesses by the court or to interrogation by it may be made at the time or at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.''

==Rule 615. Exclusion of Witnesses==
:''At the request of a party the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion. This rule does not authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person, or (2) an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney, or (3) a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party's cause, or (4) a person authorized by statute to be present.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article VII of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with the '''opinions''' of witnesses&amp;mdash;both '''lay opinions''' and the opinions of '''expert witnesses'''.

==Rule 701. Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses== 
:If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.

==Rule 702. Testimony by Experts==
:If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.

==Rule 703. Bases of Opinion Testimony by Experts==
:The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence in order for the opinion or inference to be admitted. Facts or data that are otherwise inadmissible shall not be disclosed to the jury by the proponent of the opinion or inference unless the court determines that their probative value in assisting the jury to evaluate the expert's opinion substantially outweighs their  prejudicial effect.

==Rule 704. Opinion on Ultimate Issue==
:(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.

:(b) No expert witness testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case may state an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged or of a defense thereto. Such ultimate issues are matters for the trier of fact alone.

==Rule 705. Disclosure of Facts or Data Underlying Expert Opinion== 
:The expert may testify in terms of opinion or inference and give reasons therefor without first testifying to the underlying facts or data, unless the court requires otherwise. The expert may in any event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-examination.

==Rule 706. Court Appointed Experts==
:'''a) Appointment.''' The court may on its own motion or on the motion of any party enter an order to show cause why expert witnesses should not be appointed, and may request the parties to submit nominations. The court may appoint any expert witnesses agreed upon by the parties, and may appoint expert witnesses of its own selection. An expert witness shall not be appointed by the court unless the witness consents to act. A witness so appointed shall be informed of the witness' duties by the court in writing, a copy of which shall be filed with the clerk, or at a conference in which the parties shall have opportunity to participate. A witness so appointed shall advise the parties of the witness' findings, if any; the witness' deposition may be taken by any party; and the witness may be called to testify by the court or any party. The witness shall be subject to cross-examination by each party, including a party calling the witness.

:'''(b) Compensation.''' Expert witnesses so appointed are entitled to reasonable compensation in whatever sum the court may allow. The compensation thus fixed is payable from funds which may be provided by law in criminal cases and civil actions and proceedings involving just compensation under the fifth amendment. In other civil actions and proceedings the compensation shall be paid by the parties in such proportion and at such time as the court directs, and thereafter charged in like manner as other costs.

:'''(c) Disclosure of appointment.''' In the exercise of its discretion, the court may authorize disclosure to the jury of the fact that the court appointed the expert witness.

:'''(d) Parties' experts of own selection.''' Nothing in this rule limits the parties in calling expert witnesses of their own selection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article VIII of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''hearsay'''&amp;mdash;the rule that a statement made out of court may not be admitted for its truth. Hearsay is a complicated rule fraught with exceptions, and hearsay issues are a common point of argument in the courtroom.

==Rule 801. Definitions==
:''The following definitions apply under this article:''

:'''''(a) Statement.''' A &quot;statement&quot; is (1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion.''

:'''''(b) Declarant.''' A &quot;declarant&quot; is a person who makes a statement.''

===Rule 801(c). Hearsay===

:''&quot;Hearsay&quot; is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.''

Rule 801(c) defines hearsay, and also opens up the first &quot;hole&quot; in the rule: to be hearsay, a statement must be offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. '''An out of court statement can be admitted for any purpose other than showing that it is true, so long as that purpose is relevant''' and not barred by another rule of evidence.

This means that commands, questions, and other statements that do not assert anything as true can never be hearsay. Even a matter-of-fact statement can be admitted for purposes other than its truth. Some examples:

* '''Legal fact'''. An old man says &quot;I am the Lord Jesus Christ!&quot; If offered to show that the man is senile or otherwise mentally incompetent, the statement is not hearsay: it is being offered to prove a separate, relevant fact. The statement ''is'' hearsay if offered to show that the man is actually the Lord Jesus Christ. Statements of permission and consent are not hearsay to show permission or consent.
* '''Effect on the listener'''. A caller to 911 says &quot;Someone's breaking into a house on Elm Street!&quot; The statement is hearsay if offered to show that there was a break-in on Elm Street. It is not hearsay if offered to show why the police rushed to Elm Street.

===Rule 801(d). Statements which are not hearsay===

Rule 801(d) makes several types of out-of-court statements admissible for their truth. Rule 801(d)(1) focuses on the statements of witnesses; Rule 801(d)(2) focuses on the statements of parties, which are known as '''admissions'''.

:''A statement is not hearsay if--''

::'''''(1) Prior statement by witness.''' The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is (A) inconsistent with the declarant's testimony, and was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition, or (B) consistent with the declarant's testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive, or (C) one of identification of a person made after perceiving the person; or''

::'''''(2) Admission by party-opponent.''' The statement is offered against a party and is (A) the party's own statement, in either an individual or a representative capacity, or (B) a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth, or (C) a statement by a person authorized by the party to make a statement concerning the subject, or (D) a statement by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship, or (E) a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The contents of the statement shall be considered but are not alone sufficient to establish the declarant's authority under subdivision (C), the agency or employment relationship and scope thereof under subdivision (D), or the existence of the conspiracy and the participation therein of the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered under subdivision (E).''

====Prior inconsistent statements====

Under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), '''prior inconsistent statements''' are not hearsay when the declarant testifies at the trial, is subject to cross-examination, and gave the prior statement under oath subject to perjury.

Prior inconsistent statements under this rule are a subset of prior inconsistent statements under [[../Witnesses#Rule 613. Prior Statements of Witnesses|Rule 613]]. Rule 613 allows all of a witness's prior inconsistent statements to be admitted for the sole purpose of ''impeachment'', or discrediting their testimony. But 613 statements are limited: they can only be used to impeach, and their existence cannot be proven with extrinsic evidence unless the declarant is given an opportunity to explain the discrepancy.

Once a statement qualifies under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), on the other hand, it can be used for any purpose for which it is relevant. The statement's existence can be proven with extrinsic evidence if the declarant denies having made the statement. The statement can also be admitted as ''substantive'' evidence of its truth. Where possible, lawyers usually attempt to admit prior inconsistent statements under 801(d)(1)(A), simply because of the greater leeway they have to use the statement.

====Prior consistent statements====

Under Rule 801(d)(1)(B), '''prior consistent statements''' are also not hearsay if the declarant testifies at the trial, is subject to cross-examination, and the statement is introduced to rebut a charge that the declarant fabricated their testimony or has an improper influence or motive.

====Statements of identification====
Rule 801(d)(1)(c) It's a statement that is not hearsay. It allows witness' previous identification of a defendant to be used as substantive evidence against defendant during trial.

====Party admissions====

Rule 801(d)(2) stands for the proposition that a party &quot;owns their words.&quot; Out-of-court statements by a party to a case are almost always admissible against that party, unless the statements are irrelevant or violate another rule of evidence.

==Rule 802. Hearsay Rule==

:''Hearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority or by Act of Congress.''

===Constitutional hearsay: ''Roberts'' and ''Crawford''===

Before continuing further, it is important to point out a further qualification to the hearsay rule. The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides that &quot;in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.&quot; This '''confrontation clause''' has been interpreted as a further restriction on the admissibility of statements by out-of-court declarants in criminal cases.

''Ohio v. Roberts'', 448 U.S. 56 (1980), established that a hearsay exception must meet one of two Constitutional standards: it must have been &quot;firmly rooted&quot; at the time the Sixth Amendment was written, or it must have &quot;particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.&quot;

''[[w:Crawford v. Washington|Crawford v. Washington]]'', 541 U.S. 36 (2004), established a rule that testimonial statements made out of court are inadmissible against a criminal defendant unless the defendant has an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Although the Supreme Court in ''Crawford'' did not give a clear definition of a testimonial statement, it can be understood as any statement which the declarant would understand would eventually be used in a courtroom. Examples of such statements probably include statements to police and official reports during a criminal investigation. Unless the defendant can (or could) cross-examine the declarant, the statement is inadmissible, ''even if'' it meets a hearsay exception under the Federal Rules.

==Rule 803. Hearsay Exceptions; Availability of Declarant Immaterial==
:''The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:''

Rule 801 establishes which statements are considered hearsay and which statements are not. Rules 803 and 804 deal with ''exceptions'' to the hearsay rule&amp;mdash;statements which &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; hearsay, but are nevertheless admissible. The 803 exceptions are preferred to the 804 exceptions, as they generally carry greater credibility.

:'''''(1) Present sense impression.''' A statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter.''

A present sense impression can be thought of as a &quot;play by play.&quot; The witness makes the statement as the event is unfolding; the doctrine assumes that the witness does not have the time or the motivation to make up a story in such a situation. Calls to 911 are a good example of a present sense impression.

:'''''(2) Excited utterance.''' A statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.''

An excited utterance may be made immediately after the startling event, or quite some time afterward. The key factor is that the declarant must still be under the stress of excitement. Cries for help to police are a good example of an excited utterance, although depending on their content, they may not be admissible against a criminal defendant under the &lt;em&gt;Crawford&lt;/em&gt; rule. 

:'''''(3) Then existing mental, emotional, or physical condition.''' A statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant's will.''

A statement of a then-existing condition must be &quot;self-directed&quot;: either describing what the declarant is feeling or what the declarant plans to do. The statement is only admissible to prove the declarant's condition: if others are included in the statement, the statement will not be admissible to prove anything related to the others.

:'''''(4) Statements for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.''' Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.''

803(4) statements do not have to be made to medical professionals; the declarant may make the statement to any caretaker figure. A child's statement to a parent, or an elderly person's statement to the younger relative taking care of them, could both be 803(4) statements. They also do not need to be made to a ''treating'' physician; a statement to a doctor hired in preparation for litigation can still be admissible under 803(4). Evaluating an 803(4) statement requires both a subjective determination that the declarant was contemplating diagnosis or treatment, and an objective determination that the statement was pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.

:'''''(5) Recorded recollection.''' A memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately, shown to have been made or adopted by the witness when the matter was fresh in the witness' memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly. If admitted, the memorandum or record may be read into evidence but may not itself be received as an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party.''

Rule 803(5) is a close relative of Rule 612, discussed in the [[../Witnesses/]] chapter. If a witness cannot recall something when a document is shown to them to &quot;jog their memory&quot; under Rule 612, the content of the document can be directly introduced under Rule 803(5), so long as the witness can testify that they once had personal knowledge of its contents.

:'''''(6) Records of regularly conducted activity.'''  A memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, or by certification that complies with Rule 902(11), Rule 902(12), or a statute permitting certification, unless the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness. The term &quot;business&quot; as used in this paragraph includes business, institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling of every kind, whether or not conducted for profit.''

:'''''(7) Absence of entry in records kept in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (6).''' Evidence that a matter is not included in the memoranda reports, records, or data compilations, in any form, kept in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (6), to prove the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of the matter, if the matter was of a kind of which a memorandum, report, record, or data compilation was regularly made and preserved, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.''

:'''''(8) Public records and reports.''' Records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth (A) the activities of the office or agency, or (B) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel, or (C) in civil actions and proceedings and against the Government in criminal cases, factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.''

:'''''(9) Records of vital statistics.''' Records or data compilations, in any form, of births, fetal deaths, deaths, or marriages, if the report thereof was made to a public office pursuant to requirements of law.''

:'''''(10) Absence of public record or entry.''' To prove the absence of a record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, or the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of a matter of which a record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, was regularly made and preserved by a public office or agency, evidence in the form of a certification in accordance with rule 902, or testimony, that diligent search failed to disclose the record, report, statement, or data compilation, or entry.''

:'''''(11) Records of religious organizations.''' Statements of births, marriages, divorces, deaths, legitimacy, ancestry, relationship by blood or marriage, or other similar facts of personal or family history, contained in a regularly kept record of a religious organization.''

:'''''(12) Marriage, baptismal, and similar certificates.''' Statements of fact contained in a certificate that the maker performed a marriage or other ceremony or administered a sacrament, made by a clergyman, public official, or other person authorized by the rules or practices of a religious organization or by law to perform the act certified, and purporting to have been issued at the time of the act or within a reasonable time thereafter.''

:'''''(13) Family records.''' Statements of fact concerning personal or family history contained in family Bibles, genealogies, charts, engravings on rings, inscriptions on family portraits, engravings on urns, crypts, or tombstones, or the like.''

:'''''(14) Records of documents affecting an interest in property.''' The record of a document purporting to establish or affect an interest in property, as proof of the content of the original recorded document and its execution and delivery by each person by whom it purports to have been executed, if the record is a record of a public office and an applicable statute authorizes the recording of documents of that kind in that office.''

:'''''(15) Statements in documents affecting an interest in property.''' A statement contained in a document purporting to establish or affect an interest in property if the matter stated was relevant to the purpose of the document, unless dealings with the property since the document was made have been inconsistent with the truth of the statement or the purport of the document.''

:'''''(16) Statements in ancient documents.''' Statements in a document in existence twenty years or more the authenticity of which is established.''

:'''''(17) Market reports, commercial publications.''' Market quotations, tabulations, lists, directories, or other published compilations, generally used and relied upon by the public or by persons in particular occupations.''

:'''''(18) Learned treatises.''' To the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert witness in direct examination, statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art, established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness or by other expert testimony or by judicial notice. If admitted, the statements may be read into evidence but may not be received as exhibits.''

:'''''(19) Reputation concerning personal or family history.''' Reputation among members of a person's family by blood, adoption, or marriage, or among a person's associates, or in the community, concerning a person's birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, death, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family history.''

:'''''(20) Reputation concerning boundaries or general history.''' Reputation in a community, arising before the controversy, as to boundaries of or customs affecting lands in the community, and reputation as to events of general history important to the community or State or nation in which located.''

:'''''(21) Reputation as to character.''' Reputation of a person's character among associates or in the community.''

:'''''(22) Judgment of previous conviction.''' Evidence of a final judgment, entered after a trial or upon a plea of guilty (but not upon a plea of nolo contendere), adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year, to prove any fact essential to sustain the judgment, but not including, when offered by the Government in a criminal prosecution for purposes other than impeachment, judgments against persons other than the accused. The pendency of an appeal may be shown but does not affect admissibility.''

:'''''(23) Judgment as to personal, family or general history, or boundaries.''' Judgments as proof of matters of personal, family or general history, or boundaries, essential to the judgment, if the same would be provable by evidence of reputation.''

==Rule 804. Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable==

:'''(a) Definition of unavailability.''' &quot;Unavailability as a witness&quot; includes situations in which the declarant--

::(1) is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the declarant's statement; or

::(2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant's statement despite an order of the court to do so; or

::(3) testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant's statement; or

::(4) is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or

::(5) is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarant's attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision (b)(2), (3), or (4), the declarant's attendance or testimony) by process or other reasonable means.

:A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if exemption, refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of a statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.

:'''(b) Hearsay exceptions.''' The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:

::'''(1) Former testimony.''' Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.

::'''(2) Statement under belief of impending death.''' In a prosecution for homicide or in a civil action or proceeding, a statement made by a declarant while believing that the declarant's death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be impending death.

::'''(3) Statement against interest.''' A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.

::'''(4) Statement of personal or family history.''' (A) A statement concerning the declarant's own birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family history, even though declarant had no means of acquiring personal knowledge of the matter stated; or (B) a statement concerning the foregoing matters, and death also, of another person, if the declarant was related to the other by blood, adoption, or marriage or was so intimately associated with the other's family as to be likely to have accurate information concerning the matter declared.

::(5) [Transferred to Rule 807]

::'''(6) Forfeiture by wrongdoing.''' A statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.

==Rule 805. Hearsay Within Hearsay==
:''Hearsay included within hearsay is not excluded under the hearsay rule if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the hearsay rule provided in these rules.''

Rule 805 is also known as the &quot;food chain&quot; or &quot;telephone&quot; rule. It is invoked when the declarant makes a statement to a third party, who then retells the statement to the reporter. There can be any number of intermediaries in the chain, so long as each statement between declarant and reporter corresponds to a hearsay exception.

For example, a patient complains to their doctor (803(4)), and the doctor writes down the complaint in a medical record (803(6)), which frightens a nurse and causes him to run to tell an orderly (803(2)), who writes another medical record (803(6)), which is introduced as evidence. Since each statement in the chain falls under a hearsay exception, the statement is admissible.

''If any one of the above links constituted inadmissible hearsay, the statement would be inadmissible.'' Each witness in the chain must also be competent, and each piece of physical evidence has to be authenticated.

==Rule 806. Attacking and Supporting Credibility of Declarant== 
:When a hearsay statement, or a statement defined in Rule 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E), has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness. Evidence of a statement or conduct by the declarant at any time, inconsistent with the declarant's hearsay statement, is not subject to any requirement that the declarant may have been afforded an opportunity to deny or explain. If the party against whom a hearsay statement has been admitted calls the declarant as a witness, the party is entitled to examine the declarant on the statement as if under cross-examination.

==Rule 807. Residual Exception==
:A statement not specifically covered by Rule 803 or 804 but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, is not excluded by the hearsay rule, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence. However, a statement may not be admitted under this exception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the proponent's intention to offer the statement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the declarant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article IX of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''authentication''' and '''identification''' of evidence.

==Rule 901. Requirement of Authentication or Identification==
:'''''(a) General provision.''' The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.''

When a piece of physical evidence is presented in the courtroom, other evidence must often be presented to prove that the evidence is what it is claimed to be. Rule 901(b) provides an incomplete list of many ways to do this.

:'''''(b) Illustrations.''' By way of illustration only, and not by way of limitation, the following are examples of authentication or identification conforming with the requirements of this rule:''

::'''''(1) Testimony of witness with knowledge.''' Testimony that a matter is what it is claimed to be.''

Such testimony can be very simple. &quot;I'm showing you what has been marked as Exhibit A. Do you recognize it?&quot; &quot;Yes. It's a picture of my cat. I can recognize the spot on her tail.&quot; Or it can be very complicated, depending on the nature of the evidence and the attitude of opposing counsel.

::'''''(2) Nonexpert opinion on handwriting.''' Nonexpert opinion as to the genuineness of handwriting, based upon familiarity not acquired for purposes of the litigation.''
::'''''(3) Comparison by trier or expert witness.''' Comparison by the trier of fact or by expert witnesses with specimens which have been authenticated.''
::'''''(4) Distinctive characteristics and the like.''' Appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances.''

Although only Rule 901(b)(2) mentions handwriting specifically, handwriting can also be authenticated by comparison under Rule 901(b)(3), or by expert opinion under Rule 901(b)(4).

::'''''(5) Voice identification.''' Identification of a voice, whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or recording, by opinion based upon hearing the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.
::'''''(6) Telephone conversations.''' Telephone conversations, by evidence that a call was made to the number assigned at the time by the telephone company to a particular person or business, if (A) in the case of a person, circumstances, including self-identification, show the person answering to be the one called, or (B) in the case of a business, the call was made to a place of business and the conversation related to business reasonably transacted over the telephone.
::'''''(7) Public records or reports.''' Evidence that a writing authorized by law to be recorded or filed and in fact recorded or filed in a public office, or a purported public record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, is from the public office where items of this nature are kept.
::'''''(8) Ancient documents or data compilation.''' Evidence that a document or data compilation, in any form, (A) is in such condition as to create no suspicion concerning its authenticity, (B) was in a place where it, if authentic, would likely be, and (C) has been in existence 20 years or more at the time it is offered.
::'''''(9) Process or system.''' Evidence describing a process or system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system produces an accurate result.
::'''''(10) Methods provided by statute or rule.''' Any method of authentication or identification provided by Act of Congress or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority.

==Rule 902. Self-authentication== 

:Extrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition precedent to admissibility is not required with respect to the following:

::(1) Domestic public documents under seal. A document bearing a seal purporting to be that of the United States, or of any State, district, Commonwealth, territory, or insular possession thereof, or the Panama Canal Zone, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or of a political subdivision, department, officer, or agency thereof, and a signature purporting to be an attestation or execution.

::(2) Domestic public documents not under seal. A document purporting to bear the signature in the official capacity of an officer or employee of any entity included in paragraph (1) hereof, having no seal, if a public officer having a seal and having official duties in the district or political subdivision of the officer or employee certifies under seal that the signer has the official capacity and that the signature is genuine.

::(3) Foreign public documents. A document purporting to be executed or attested in an official capacity by a person authorized by the laws of a foreign country to make the execution or attestation, and accompanied by a final certification as to the genuineness of the signature and official position (A) of the executing or attesting person, or (B) of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness of signature and official position relates to the execution or attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness of signature and official position relating to the execution or attestation. A final certification may be made by a secretary of an embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States, or a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United States. If reasonable opportunity has been given to all parties to investigate the authenticity and accuracy of official documents, the court may, for good cause shown, order that they be treated as presumptively authentic without final certification or permit them to be evidenced by an attested summary with or without final certification.

::(4) Certified copies of public records. A copy of an official record or report or entry therein, or of a document authorized by law to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed in a public office, including data compilations in any form, certified as correct by the custodian or other person authorized to make the certification, by certificate complying with paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this rule or complying with any Act of Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority.

::(5) Official publications. Books, pamphlets, or other publications purporting to be issued by public authority.

::(6) Newspapers and periodicals. Printed materials purporting to be newspapers or periodicals.

::(7) Trade inscriptions and the like. Inscriptions, signs, tags, or labels purporting to have been affixed in the course of business and indicating ownership, control, or origin.

::(8) Acknowledged documents. Documents accompanied by a certificate of acknowledgment executed in the manner provided by law by a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments.

::(9) Commercial paper and related documents. Commercial paper, signatures thereon, and documents relating thereto to the extent provided by general commercial law.

::(10) Presumptions under Acts of Congress. Any signature, document, or other matter declared by Act of Congress to be presumptively or prima facie genuine or authentic.

::(11) Certified domestic records of regularly conducted activity.  The original or a duplicate of a domestic record of regularly conducted activity that would be admissible under Rule 803(6) if accompanied by a written declaration of its custodian  or other qualified person, in a manner complying with any Act of Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority, certifying that the record:

:::(A) was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge of those matters;
:::(B) was kept in the course of the regularly conducted activity; and
:::(C) was made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular practice.

::A party intending to offer a record into evidence under this paragraph must provide written notice of that intention to all adverse parties, and must make the record and declaration available for inspection sufficiently in advance of their offer into evidence to provide an adverse party with a fair opportunity to challenge them.

::(12) Certified foreign records of regularly conducted activity.  In a civil case, the original or a duplicate of a foreign record of regularly conducted activity that would be admissible under Rule 803(6) if accompanied by a written declaration by its custodian  or other qualified person certifying that the record:

:::(A) was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge of those matters;
:::(B) was kept in the course of the regularly conducted activity; and
:::(C) was made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular practice.

::The declaration must be signed in a  manner that, if falsely made, would subject the maker to criminal penalty under the laws of the country where the declaration is signed. A party intending to offer a record into evidence under this paragraph must provide written notice of that intention to all adverse parties, and must make the record and declaration available for inspection sufficiently in advance of their offer into evidence to provide an adverse party with a fair opportunity to challenge them.

==Rule 903. Subscribing Witness' Testimony Unnecessary==
:The testimony of a subscribing witness is not necessary to authenticate a writing unless required by the laws of the jurisdiction whose laws govern the validity of the writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Article X of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] deals with '''writings, recordings and photographs'''&amp;mdash;documentary evidence.

==Rule 1001. Definitions==
:For purposes of this article the following definitions are applicable:
:'''(1) Writings and recordings.''' &quot;Writings&quot; and &quot;recordings&quot; consist of letters, words, or numbers, or their equivalent, set down by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, magnetic impulse, mechanical or electronic recording, or other form of data compilation.
:'''(2) Photographs.''' &quot;Photographs&quot; include still photographs, X-ray films, video tapes, and motion pictures.
:'''(3) Original.''' An &quot;original&quot; of a writing or recording is the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by a person executing or issuing it. An &quot;original&quot; of a photograph includes the negative or any print therefrom. If data are stored in a computer or similar device, any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an &quot;original&quot;.
:'''(4) Duplicate.''' A &quot;duplicate&quot; is a counterpart produced by the same impression as the original, or from the same matrix, or by means of photography, including enlargements and miniatures, or by mechanical or electronic re-recording, or by chemical reproduction, or by other equivalent techniques which accurately reproduces the original.

==Rule 1002. Requirement of Original==
:''To prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by Act of Congress.''

Rule 1002 is commonly known as the '''original document rule''' or '''best evidence rule'''. It states that an original document should be produced in court when its terms are material to the argument&amp;mdash;when it is the &quot;best evidence&quot; available.

==Rule 1003. Admissibility of Duplicates== 
:A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original or (2) in the circumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.

==Rule 1004. Admissibility of Other Evidence of Contents==
:The original is not required, and other evidence of the contents of a writing, recording, or photograph is admissible if--

:'''(1) Originals lost or destroyed.''' All originals are lost or have been destroyed, unless the proponent lost or destroyed them in bad faith; or
:'''(2) Original not obtainable.''' No original can be obtained by any available judicial process or procedure; or
:'''(3) Original in possession of opponent.''' At a time when an original was under the control of the party against whom offered, that party was put on notice, by the pleadings or otherwise, that the contents would be a subject of proof at the hearing, and that party does not produce the original at the hearing; or
:'''(4) Collateral matters.''' The writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.

==Rule 1005. Public Records==
:The contents of an official record, or of a document authorized to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed, including data compilations in any form, if otherwise admissible, may be proved by copy, certified as correct in accordance with rule 902 or testified to be correct by a witness who has compared it with the original. If a copy which complies with the foregoing cannot be obtained by the exercise of reasonable diligence, then other evidence of the contents may be given.

==Rule 1006. Summaries==
:The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation. The originals, or duplicates, shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be produced in court.

==Rule 1007. Testimony or Written Admission of Party== 
:Contents of writings, recordings, or photographs may be proved by the testimony or deposition of the party against whom offered or by that party's written admission, without accounting for the nonproduction of the original.

==Rule 1008. Functions of Court and Jury==
:When the admissibility of other evidence of contents of writings, recordings, or photographs under these rules depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the question whether the condition has been fulfilled is ordinarily for the court to determine in accordance with the provisions of rule 104. However, when an issue is raised (a) whether the asserted writing ever existed, or (b) whether another writing, recording, or photograph produced at the trial is the original, or (c) whether other evidence of contents correctly reflects the contents, the issue is for the trier of fact to determine as in the case of other issues of fact.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Automator is a powerful app for quickly accomplishing a set of repetitive or time-comsuming tasks. It allows the user to automate actions for other apps to take. The user does this by creating &quot;workflows,&quot; sets of commands for the automator to take.
[[Image:Apple_automator_.app_fullscreen_1.png|thumb|right|250px|Fig 1:The Automator interface]]
=When to Use Automator=
One should use Automator if one must accomplish a series of simple, repetitive tasks and UI (user interface) is not an issue. The Automator should generally be used only for very simple actions, for creating a complicated workflow can take longer than the time saved.
=Creating a Workflow=
To create a workflow, simply drag the desired actions from the left pane to the central one. One will notice that the inputs and outputs of each action link. These show where information flows from one action to the next. This can be turned off by clicking on the input then clicking &quot;Ignore results from previous action.&quot;
[[Image:Apple automator app closeup run.png|frame|right|200px|Fig 2:The &quot;run&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; buttons, located in the upper-righthand corner of the main Automator window (see Fig 1).]]
=Using a Workflow=
After a workflow has been created, it can be run by clicking the &quot;run&quot; button in the &lt;!--Can someone please correct the hyphen?--&gt;upper-right hand corner. The workflow will then execute all specified actions. A workflow can be canceled at any time by clicking &quot;stop&quot; (next to &quot;run&quot;)
=List of Actions=
This section lists all actions that can be taken by Automator. They are grouped by application of origin, as they are in Automator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
[[Image:Tiger DVD Player Window.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 1 - DVD Player playing a movie.]]
Soon after audio CDs and CD-ROM discs took the world by a storm, the world's largest technology corporations began work on next-generation discs capable of holding over eight times as much information as their predeccessors. Two rival disc types were developed, but the companies producing them agreed to merge them together into one unified format: the DVD.

While everyone knew from the start that DVD-ROM discs would catch on for storing computer data, the primary use of this breakthrough storage technology would be storing video. And unless you've been living under a rock for the past few years, you'll know that the DVD disc has completely replaced the VHS tape, which is often no longer sold in stores.

The most popular place to play a video DVD will probably always be in a standalone DVD player plugged into a TV. However, every Mac that Apple has shipped this decade includes a built-in DVD Player for convenience. Simply insert a video DVD into your disc drive, and watch as its icon appears on your desktop. But if you double-click this icon, you're greeted by a confusing mess of unusable files containing the movie. 

To navigate this mess of files, you need Apple's DVD Player application. It's easy enough to find; it's in your applications folder along with every other app you have in your collection. In fact, since there's not much you can do with a video DVD without DVD Player, &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;your Mac will automatically open DVD Player when you insert a video DVD (assuming you haven't adjusted the settings in the CDs &amp; DVDs pane of System Preferences)&lt;/font&gt;.


{{Mac Note Box|If your Mac came with an Apple Remote, you have a second way to play a DVD: with Apple's Front Row feature. Please refer to the wikibook [[iLife]] for information on Front Row and how to use its DVD Player.}}

=Playing a DVD=
When DVD Player loads, the movie should begin to play automatically. Most movies start by displaying a menu with options. Each DVD has a different menu, and menus can vary dramatically in appearance and layout.

=Region Codes=
[[Image:DVD-Regions with key.png|830px|thumb|center|Fig. 2 - A map of DVD regions.]]
If you are ever confronted by a dialog box asking you about changing a region code, then you've just had an encounter with one of the big movie studios' favorite tricks for regulating how their content is distributed. What exactly ''are'' these region codes, you ask?

&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Region codes are embedded into every DVD player, and some (but not all) DVD discs.&lt;/font&gt; In general, big-budget movies are more likely to contain a region code than smaller, less professional productions. The specific code inside is different depending on the country in which the player or disc was purchased. For example, american DVDs and DVD players have the code &quot;1&quot; embedded in them. DVD players are programmed to refuse discs with different codes. British DVDs (which contain the code &quot;2&quot;) '''do not play''' in american DVD players (which contain the code &quot;1&quot;).

Here's a simple scenario that shows why movie studios use region codes. Let's say that an english movie studio has just finished running its latest movie in theaters. The movie was a hit, so now they want to show it overseas in american theaters. Meanwhile, they also want to release it on DVD in England around the same time.

Without region codes, retailers in England would immediately export the DVD version to America, and people in America would be able to buy the movie on DVD while it was still in theaters. But since region codes exist, the british DVDs would contain the code &quot;2&quot;, and american DVD players couldn't play them.

Problem solved for the movie studio, and extra hassle created for the consumer.

The DVD Player application is just a standalone DVD player in software form, so it adheres to the same rules. However, the DVD Player app comes without a region code set. The region code is automatically set when you first insert a region-protected DVD. That is, if the first DVD you play contains the code &quot;1&quot;, then the DVD Player application turns into a Region-1 DVD player. But what if you move? Yes, you can change the region code. This takes us full circle to the dialog box asking about the region code.

&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;If you ever insert a DVD with a different region code than the DVD Player application, you get a dialog box asking if you'd like to change DVD Player's region code to match the DVD. However, you can only do this five times.&lt;/font&gt; Sorry, but it's how things work! If you choose not to change the code, then you will not be able to play the DVD. It is not reccomended that you change the region code just to watch one DVD and then change it back - the five changes allowed will go by very quickly this way.

To see which DVD region you live in, please refer to the map in figure 2. Region 7 has been reserved for future use, and Region 8 is for airplanes and cruise ships.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Maintaining a strong back will reduce pain and injury to people with back problems

Exercises should have the tingling sensation of a stretch, but shooting or painful burning indicate that you should stop the exercise. While a personal trainer is useful, it is good enough if you use common sense and exercise with a friend. A personal trainer is not a doctor, if you hurt yourself, the personal trainer cannot snap you back into place. They will do exactly what an exercise partner or friend would do, call for help. But these exercises are not dangerous, and if you mind your conditions and be cautious, they are completely safe.

==Exercise One==

Get on your hands and knees. Now, lift your right arm and your left leg. Straighten them up in the air. Hold for 2 seconds or as long as you are comfortable holding. Get back on all fours, then lift your left arm and your right leg. Repeat this process always using opposite sides of legs and arms. If you are tense, you might not be able to completely extend your leg or arm, in this case do not push it, just go as far as you comfortably can and repeat the exercise. Over many repetitions over several days, you should be able to get closer to extending those arms and legs straight.
Also, do not forget to breathe. Either because of the difficulty of the activity, or because of the percieved difficulty of it, some people hold their breath, sometimes out of a habit of holding breath or not breathing naturally when exercising. In general, it is a good idea to breathe through your nose if you can. This will be less tiring than breathing through your mouth. 

If you like, you can do this exercise on top of a towel, or a stiff foam mat. It is important not to do exercises like this on a bed or other springy, non solid surface. But it can irritate your knees to be on all fours, so you can do this exercise on a blanket, towel or camping mat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Characteristics==
Egyptian deities are often portrayed as having animal heads in art; as an example, Anubis is often portrayed in statuary as having the body of a human, but the head of a canine. Many gods were portrayed with different animal heads, depending upon the situation. The Egyptians did not actually believe that most of their gods had animal heads; rather, they portrayed them that way as artistic symbolism. This may have been for the benefit of the illiterate.

==Descriptions and Unique Traits==

[[File:Anubis_standing.jpg | thumb | left | 80px |  | Anubis]]; Anubis : God of Embalming, Friend of the Dead, originally god of the dead 

: '''Details : ''' The son of Ra and Hathor, Anubis was the first god of the underworld. He was most often portrayed as a man with the head of a jackal but sometimes appeared as fully human or jackal. In later mythology he was replaced as king of the dead by Osiris. Instead he became the gatekeeper to the underworld and protector of souls. One of Anubis's duties was to weigh the heart of the dead against the feather of Ma'at. If the heart weighed the same as the feather, the person being subjected to the test would enter the Field of Reeds, and could enjoy the afterlife. If not they would suffer destruction, and would not exist.

; Neith : goddess of war, then great mother goddess

; Osiris : god of the underworld, fertility and agricultural, maternal brother of Anubis 
: '''Details : ''' Osiris was the second king of the underworld and one of the four children of the earth (Geb) and the sky (Nuit), and was the husband of Isis, who represented life. As god of the dead, Babi, the god who devoured unworthy souls, was described as his first-born son.In art, since he was representative of death, Osiris was usually depicted as a mummified man, with a beard, and, as ruler of the underworld, was also given the symbols of kingship - the crown, flail, and crozier. Usually, he also was depicted as having green skin, a reference to rotting flesh, and thus to death.

; Ptah : a creator deity 
: '''Details : ''' Ptah, in Egyptian mythology (specifically Memphite), is the creator god. He existed before time was time and began the world. His creation of the world was seen as procreative, although he initially existed alone. Due to this fact, his hand was assigned feminine qualities, and was in itself worshipped as a goddess. Ptah was the patron deity of craftsmen, as everything he created was created by his mind alone.

; Ra : the sun, possible father of Anubis 
: '''Details : ''' For much of Egyptian history, Ra was the chief of gods. He controlled day and night, the passage of time, and the continual cycle of death and rebirth. However, his appearance as the sun god was just one of his many aspects. He was worshipped as a creator, as an ancestor to the pharaohs, and as many other things. He was also called amun ra.

; Sekhmet : goddess of war and battles 

; Sobek : Crocodile God 
: '''Details : ''' In Egyptian mythology, Sobek was the crocodile-god who symbolized the fertility of the Nile River. He was also the god of pharaohs and leaders and so was viewed as immensely powerful.

; Set : God of Storms, possible father of Anubis, later became god of evil 
: '''Details : ''' As the god of the desert, Set was associated with sandstorms, and desert caravans. Due to the extreme hostility of the desert environment, Set was viewed as immensely powerful, and was consequently regarded from time to time as the chief god. In art, Set was mostly depicted as a mysterious and unknown creature, referred to by Egyptologists as the Set animal, with a curved snout, square ears, forked tail, and canine body, or sometimes as a human with only the head of the Set animal. It has no complete resemblence to any known creature, although it does resemble a composite of an aardvark, and a jackal, both of which are desert creatures.

; Taweret : Goddess of pregnant children and protector at childbirth 
; Tefnut : goddess of order, justice, time, Heaven and Hell and weather 

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;hiero&gt;G26-t:Z4&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
; Thoth : god of the moon, drawing, writing, geometry, wisdom, medicine, music, astronomy, and magic 
: '''Details : ''' Thoth is the Egyptian God of the moon and Wisdom. He is credited in ancient egyptian mythology as the creator of writing and the scribe of the gods.

; Wepwawet : a wolf deity, worshipped in Lycopolis.

This chapter introduces the subject of corporate law.

==What is a corporation?==

A corporation is an entity created by people as a method to pool capital and socialize liability. This text focuses on '''business corporations''', which are created for profit. A corporation can also be created for other reasons. Many churches and charities are established as non profit corporations. Many government entities take a corporate form. Whatever its purpose, a corporation has several unique features under the law.

# '''Individuality'''. Corporations are legal entities. They can theoretically last forever: some corporations have been in continuous operation for hundreds of years. A corporation is also treated like an artificial person for many (but not all) legal purposes. It can enter into contracts under its own name, it can sue or be sued, and it has many of the same constitutional rights enjoyed by '''natural persons'''.
# '''Separation of ownership and control'''. A corporation used to be owned by '''shareholders''', but, as it increased in size and shareholders became dispersed at the turn of the 20th century, it became controlled by a '''board of directors'''. While shareholders vote on the board of directors, in practice, board members are selected by other board members who then manage the corporation.  The board has a fiduciary duty to the corporation as a whole, not just shareholders. Shareholders can also freely transfer their interest in the corporation, which is known as '''stock'''.
# '''Limited liability'''. Under normal circumstances, shareholders cannot lose any more than the amount of their investment in the corporation. If creditors demand more than the corporation can pay, the shareholders' personal assets are usually safe.

==Corporations versus other business entities==

While corporations are perhaps the archetype of a business entity, they are by no means the only way to form a business. The choice to form a corporation is not always an easy one.

===Sole Proprietorship===

Rather than start a corporation, an entrepreneur can go into business under their own name as a '''sole proprietor'''. This has the advantage of simplicity: there is no need to file paperwork with the government or hold meetings and elections, all of which must take place in a corporation.

A sole proprietor, however, is &quot;one with their business.&quot; Their profits and losses are treated as personal income on their taxes. If they accumulate business debts, creditors can go after their personal assets. If a sole proprietor dies, their business is treated like any other personal asset, and ends up in the hands of whomever they will it to. Most importantly, a sole proprietorship is just one person: if more than one person wants to start a business, they need a more complex form.

===Partnership===

The '''partnership''' is the most basic form of collaborative business. Like a sole proprietorship, it has the advantage of simplicity.

Two or more people can start a business with no special formalities, and their business will be treated as a '''general partnership'''. They directly control the partnership and can make binding decisions with a simple majority vote. Assets of the business will be listed in their names individually, and the partners will jointly be liable for any debts incurred by the partnership. The partners are also entitled to take home any profits made by the partnership. They are taxed individually on their share of the partnership's profits, regardless of whether they keep these profits or reinvest: the partnership is not taxed separately, which offers a huge advantage over corporate taxation.

'''Limited partnerships''' (LPs) allow individuals to invest as &quot;limited partners,&quot; which gives them the limited liability of shareholders at the expense of relinquishing their right to participate in management of the partnership. A partnership can also file with the state to be treated as a '''limited liability partnership''' (LLP), which offers some of the limited liability benefits of a corporation. A few states allow the general partners in an LP to file for LLP status, creating a '''limited liability limited partnership''' (LLLP), but such organizations are still rare. (See, e.g., [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=Ch0620/SEC1102.HTM&amp;Title=-%3E2005-%3ECh0620-%3ESection%201102#0620.1102 Fla. Stat. § 620.1102(10)], [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+50-73.78 Va. Code § 50-73.78].)

Regardless of type, all partnerships are considered to be an aggregate of their partners, rather than a separate entity. Unlike corporations, in which stock can be freely traded (assuming a willing buyer), a partner involved in the management of the partnership can only transfer their interest with the consent of the other partners. If the mutual consent to form a partnership breaks down, the partnership breaks down as well. This means that partnerships do not last as long as corporations, and the form is unsuited for larger businesses, especially those that wish to take advantage of public equity markets, like stock markets, to seek new investors.

===Limited liability companies===
A Limited Liability company (LLC), or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), is an entity that limits liability to its owners. In this way, it is similar to a corporation. However, unlike a corporation, an LLC is not subject to double-taxation. In this way, an LLC is similar to a partnership or an S-Corporation. An LLC differs from a partnership in that it continues to exist if one of the owners dies. An LLC differs from an S-Corporation in that it does not require that profits be paid evenly to share holders.

==History of corporate law==

:''This section incorporates text from Wikipedia, &quot;[[w:Corporation|Corporation]].&quot;''

Early corporations of the commercial sort were formed under frameworks set up by governments of states to undertake tasks which appeared too risky or too expensive for individuals or governments to embark upon. The alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world, the Stora Kopparberg mining community in Falun, Sweden, reportedly obtained a charter from King Magnus Eriksson in 1347. Many European nations chartered corporations to lead colonial ventures, such as the Dutch East India Company, and these corporations came to play a large part in the history of corporate colonialism.

In the United States, government chartering began to fall out of vogue in the mid-1800s. Corporate law at the time was very restrictive and very closely regulated by the states. Forming a corporation usually required an act of legislature. Investors generally had to be given an equal say in corporate governance, and the corporation's activities were tightly restricted to its express purposes. Many private firms in the 19th century avoided the corporate model for these reasons (Andrew Carnegie formed his steel operation as a limited partnership, and John D. Rockefeller set up Standard Oil as a trust).

Eventually, state governments began to realize the economic value of providing more permissive corporate laws. New Jersey was the first state to adopt an &quot;enabling&quot; corporate law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state. Delaware followed, and soon became known as the most corporation-friendly state in the country; even today, most major public corporations are set up under Delaware law.

The 20th century saw a proliferation of enabling law across the world, which helped to drive economic booms in many countries before and after World War I. After World War II, and especially starting in the 1980s, many countries with large state-owned corporations moved toward privatization, the selling of publicly-owned services and enterprises to private, normally corporate, ownership. Deregulation - reducing the public-interest regulation of corporate activity - often accompanied privatization as part of an ideologically laissez-faire policy. Another major postwar shift was toward conglomerates, in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base. Japanese firms developed a horizontal conglomeration model, the keiretsu, which was later duplicated in other countries as well. 

While corporate efficiency (and profitability) skyrocketed, small shareholder control was diminished and directors of corporations assumed greater control over business, contributing in part to the hostile takeover movement of the 1980s and the accounting scandals that brought down Enron and WorldCom following the turn of the century.

==Sources of corporate law==
===State statute===
Most corporate law comes from state statutes. Under the '''internal affairs doctrine''', every corporation is internally governed by the law of the state in which it is '''incorporated''', or formed. As a result, many larger corporations are incorporated in states that are known for having a business-friendly corporate legal structure. The state best known for this is '''Delaware''', which houses more than half of the Fortune 500: Delaware is known for having a favorable franchise fee structure and highly specialized courts (one court, the '''Court of Chancery''', deals primarily with corporate issues). Smaller corporations usually find it advantageous to incorporate in the state where they do most of their business.

State statutes are all subtly different, but many follow the structure of the '''Model Business Corporation Act''', a &quot;model statute&quot; drafted by the American Bar Association. The MBCA is associated with smaller states which might not have the time or the motive to develop their own corporate statutes. Larger, more economically important states, like New York and California, have more unique corporate statutes, incorporating rules from many sources. The '''Delaware General Corporation Law''' is the most important statute because of the number of corporations it governs. Most American lawyers study the MBCA and DGCL in law school, and this text will focus on the provisions of those two statutes.

===Federal statute===
State laws govern the mechanics of corporations, but many federal laws are applicable to corporations as well. Publicly-traded corporations must comply with federal securities laws, the most important of which are the '''[http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/33act/index1933.shtml Securities Act of 1933]''' (1933 Act) and '''[http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/34act/index1934.shtml Securities Exchange Act of 1934]''' (1934 Act). The '''[http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/SOact/toc.html Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]''' (SOXA) imposed many new rules on public corporations. Corporations must also comply with the wide variety of federal laws governing employment, environmental protection, food and drug regulation, intellectual property and other areas.

===Common law===
Much of corporate law comes from common law - the judge-made law based on tradition, which governs where statutes are silent. Common law principles of agency, contracts and torts are all important in the corporate context.

The common law of corporate governance has not been the subject of a Restatement, but the American Law Institute has compiled a set of suggested rules called the ''ALI Principles of Corporate Governance''.

===Internal law===
Corporations also make their own internal laws. They chiefly do this through two documents: the '''articles of incorporation''' and the '''bylaws'''.

Articles of incorporation can be thought of as the &quot;constitution&quot; of a corporation. The articles, sometimes known as the '''charter''' or '''certificate of incorporation''' depending on the state, contain a few provisions required by statute, such as the name of the corporation and the location of its registered agent, as well as other provisions that regulate the corporation's affairs. The articles of incorporation bind the board of directors and can only be altered with the approval of the shareholders.

Bylaws are &quot;statutes&quot; written by the board of directors and can usually be amended by the board of directors without first obtaining shareholder approval. The bylaws generally establish internal rules for the governance of the corporation, such as officer positions and meeting procedures.

The articles of incorporation must comply with the statute under which the corporation is incorporated, and the bylaws must comply with the articles of incorporation as well as the statute.

The accumulator is a temporary storage space for arithmetic operations. Without it, the result of every operation would have to be written to main memory, and then read back into the ALU, which is very slow. For example, to add up a list of numbers, they are loaded one by one from main memory and added into the accumulator. The final answer is then copied back to main memory.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Back to [[US Corporate Law]])

Forming a corporation is generally considered a simple matter, however if it is done incorrectly this can have severe consequences for all involved. Many corporations are formed with the help of a lawyer (or several) - usually through a service company or directly through a business entity service company. The actual process of forming a corporation is usually a matter of filling in a few blanks on a form, but the process can sometimes be complex depending on what the persons or entities incorporating wish to accomplish. ''For example, some jurisdictions have statutes that grant liability protection to the officers and directors but these statutes need to be specifically invoked before they apply to the [[Wikipedia:business entity|business entity]] and this is not always available on a generic form provided by the [[Wikipedia:business entity|business entity]] filing agency in the jurisdiction where one is incorporating.''


Chapter 2 of the MBCA and Subchapter I of the DGCL outline how a corporation is formed. There are three main steps in the process:

# An '''incorporator''' files '''articles of incorporation''' with the '''secretary of state''''s office. (Note that although the filing office in most United States jurisdictions for corporate filings is the Secretary of State, many United States jurisdictions use other agencies. [[Wikipedia:Alaska|Alaska]], for instance, uses the [http://www.dced.state.ak.us/ Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development] and [[Wikipedia:Michigan|Michigan]] accepts new corporate filings through the [http://www.michigan.gov/cis/ Department of Labor &amp; Economic Growth].)
# The corporation holds an '''organizational meeting''' to select a '''board of directors'''.
# The board of directors meets to adopt '''bylaws''', appoint '''officers''', and other tasks.


==Considerations when incorporating==

All of these things should be considered when choosing what entity type to use, what jurisdiction to incorporate in and how the articles should be drafted - or if a stock form should even be used. This is why this is a process and decision generally considered best left to an attorney or service company specializing in such matters - just as you would likely have a dentist to pull a tooth even though this is also considered a simple matter. ''Note that some jurisdictions require by statute that an official state form be used when filing a [[Wikipedia:Business Entity|business entity]], additional provisions can generally be attached.''

* The laws of the individual state where the [[Wikipedia:business entity|business entity]] is to be filed
* Whether or not the [[Wikipedia:business entity|business entity]] may be ever conducting business in other jurisdictions
* The [[Wikipedia:business entity|business entity]] type
* The business entity's projected revenue
* The business entity's number of shareholders
* The likelihood that the business entity will be sued (in the case of a high-risk business).
* Other variables

The articles of incorporation can be very minimal. Many states provide a one or two-page form for the articles of incorporation: the incorporator can simply fill out the form, provide the filing fee, and their corporation will be chartered. MBCA § 2.02 only requires four elements:

# corporate name
# number of authorized shares
# name and address of the corporation’s [[Wikipedia:Registered Agent|registered agent]]
# name and address of each incorporator

[http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc01/index.htm#P22_1323 DGCL § 102] also requires:

# a statement of the &quot;nature of the business&quot; of the corporation ''(Note that most jurisdictions allow the articles to simply state &quot;Any Legal Purpose&quot; or a variation of this statement).''
# the par value of each share, or a statement that all shares are to be without par value (see the chapter on Securities)
# name and address of each director, if the incorporator's duties are to end upon filing

===Corporate name===

Under MBCA § 4.01, a corporate name must include the word “corporation,” “incorporated,” “company,” or “limited,” or an abbreviation or foreign equivalent thereof. [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc01/index.htm#P22_1323 DGCL § 102] allows the corporation to choose a number of other signifying terms, including &quot;association,&quot; &quot;society,&quot; and &quot;syndicate.&quot; The point of this rule is to place other parties on notice that they are dealing with a limited liability entity.

===Authorized shares===

===The registered agent===
The [[Wikipedia:Registered Agent|registered agent]] (AKA &quot;RA&quot;, [[Wikipedia:resident agent|&quot;Resident Agent&quot;]] or [[Wikipedia:Statutory Agent|&quot;Statutory Agent&quot;]]) is a person or company designated to receive [[Wikipedia:service of process|service of process]] within the state of incorporation.  (Service of process is the act of serving a defendant with court papers in the event of a lawsuit.) The registered agent must provide a physical address to which a process server may personally go to deliver the complaint. Some states require that the registered agent accept his or her appointment by signature, other states do not. The state Articles of Incorporation form will indicate whether the registered agent's signature is required.

Most commonly, a registered agent service company is the designated registered agent. In some cases, the entity's attorney is the designated registered agent. If there is no attorney, the entrepreneur him or herself may be the registered agent, however there are numerous very good reasons for the entrepreneur to NOT serve as the registered agent.

===The incorporator===
Traditionally, corporations had to have three individual incorporators, who had to meet a number of legal requirements, such as being residents of the state of incorporation. Nowadays, one is the norm. The incorporator is usually inconsequential to the company they incorporate. An incorporator might be a lawyer, a secretary, a bicycle messenger, or any other competent adult; other corporations are also allowed to be incorporators in many jurisdictions. Besides having to sign the articles, an incorporator may also (depending on local law):

*Receive the corporate charter in the mail from the secretary of state
*Call the first meeting of the board of directors
*Dissolve the corporation before the board meets
*Amend the articles of incorporation before the board meets

===Purposes and the ''ultra vires'' doctrine===

Traditionally, corporations had to list their purposes in the articles of incorporation. Some states, such as Delaware, retain this requirement, but those states which have such a requirement are very lax about it: the corporation can be formed for &quot;any and all lawful purposes,&quot; or list a few primary purposes with the &quot;any and all&quot; clause tacked on the end. Before this was legally possible, corporate lawyers would load up articles of incorporation with every conceivable purpose for a corporation up to mining cheese on the moon.

''Ultra vires'', Latin for &quot;beyond the powers,&quot; is a legal doctrine stating that corporations cannot act beyond the purposes for which they were incorporated. Many English common law courts applied a dramatic form of ultra vires: any such act of a corporation was legally void. Other courts applied an estoppel theory to force corporations to follow their contracts even if the deal was ultra vires: this is the approach taken by MBCA § 3.04, which provides that &quot;the validity of corporate action may not be challenged on the  ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act.&quot; Compare [http://www.law.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/ez-nylaw?BSC+203 NYBCL § 203].

Although ultra vires is rare due to the lack of fixed corporate purposes, the issue still comes up in states that restrict the powers of corporations by statute. In some jurisdictions, for instance, corporations cannot enter partnerships or make contributions to a non-profit organization. The MBCA comments suggest that ultra vires can be applied:

*When the corporation or its shareholders sue former directors, to recover damages
*When shareholders sue directors to get an injunction against an ultra vires act
*When the state's attorney general wants to dissolve the corporation

===The birth of the corporation===

While rules vary from place to place, the usual law is that the existence of the corporation begins at the time the articles are filed, even though they have not been reviewed or accepted by the government at that point. This means that a corporation can begin operations while its articles are pending approval. If something goes wrong during this period and the articles are later rejected by the state, the corporation's limited liability generally protects the shareholders and directors, so long as they were acting in good faith.

On the other hand, if they knew the corporation was invalid to begin with, they can be personally liable for anything the corporation does during its period of presumptive validity.

'''Securities''' represent a financial interest in a corporation.

==Equity vs. debt financing==

Generally, a corporation receives capital in exchange for '''equity''' securities or '''debt''' securities or a combination of the two. Equity securities are also known as '''stock'''. Debt securities are commonly known as '''bonds''': although they are formally divided into '''bonds''' and '''debentures''', the word &quot;bond&quot; is often used to refer to both.

A bond evidences a loan to the company, rather than a share of the company's equity. The money or other consideration received in exchange for a bond becomes both an asset and a liability to the company. In contrast, the consideration received for stock becomes an asset of the company without becoming a liability; it adds to the company's equity (the difference between assets and liabilities).

==Bonds and debentures==
Life is full of surprises, and even more so when it comes to finances. A person having a good income today may face financial crisis in future. To avoid these unforeseen financial crises everyone invests in different instruments that can fetch extra income. There are many options available in the market that can be classified as risky and non risky. It is very well understood that risky options yield higher gains but non risky ones can give very low returns. Debentures and bonds are two such options that can be taken for good returns on ones investment. Debenture is an instrument issued by a company that can be convertible or non convertible into equities. Bonds are issued by companies or by government and can be seen as a loan taken by them to meet their financial needs. These two instruments are basically loan taken from the investor but have very different repayment conditions.

Debentures

Debentures are issued by a company to raise short to medium term loan needed for expenses or for expansions. Just like equities these can be transferred to anyone, but does not give right of voting in the company’s general meetings. Debentures are simply loans taken by the companies and do not provide the ownership in the company. These are unsecured loans as company is not bound to return the principal amount on the maturity. Debentures are of two types convertible and nonconvertible. The convertible debentures are the ones that can be converted into equity shares at a later time. This convertibility provides attraction to the investor but yield lower interest rates. Non convertible debentures does not convert into equity shares thus can yield a higher interest rate.

Bonds

Bonds are actual contract notes issued by the borrower to pay interest at regular intervals and return the principal on the maturity of the bond. These bonds are issued by the companies for their expenses and future expansions. The bonds are also issued by the government for its expenses. A bond is seen as loan taken by a borrower from the investor so unlike equity share it does not give stake in the company but he is seen as a lender. These bonds are redeemed at a definite time. These are secured loans and can yield low to medium interest rate.

Difference between bonds and debentures

Both bonds and debentures are instruments available to a company to raise money from the public. This is the similarity between the two, but on closer inspection, we find that there are many glaring differences between the two.

Bonds are more secure than debentures. As a debenture holder, you provide unsecured loan to the company. It carries a higher rate of interest as the company does not give any collateral to you for your money. For this reason bond holders receive a lower rate of interest but are more secure.

If there is any bankruptcy, bondholders are paid first and the liability towards debenture holders is less.

Debenture holders get periodical interest on their money and upon completion of the term they get their principal amount back.

Bond holders do not receive periodical payments. Rather, they get principal plus interest accrued upon the completion of the term. They are much more secure than debentures and are issued mostly by government firms.

In Brief: 

• Bonds are more secure than debentures, but the rate of interest is lower

• Debentures are unsecured loans but carries a higher rate of interest

• In bankruptcy, bondholders are paid first, but liability towards debenture holders is less

• Debenture holders get periodical interest

• Bond holders receive accrued payment upon completion of the term

• Bonds are more secure as they are mostly issued by government firms

==Stock==

Holders of stock have two key rights: '''voting rights''' and '''residual rights'''. Voting rights enable stockholders to elect the board of directors and approve or reject certain fundamental transactions. Residual rights allow the stockholders to share the company's profits, as well as recover some of the company's assets in the event that it folds, although they generally have the lowest priority in recovering their investment.

===Types of stock===

====Common and preferred stock====

By default, stock in a corporation is '''common stock'''. Common stock is generally accompanied by a voting right and residual right proportional to the number of shares held in the corporation. If a corporation only offers common stock, an owner of 25 percent of the common stock would control 25 percent of shareholder votes, receive 25 percent of any dividend payout and be entitled to 25 percent of any post-liquidation assets after creditors are paid in full.

Stock can also be designated as '''preferred stock''', which gives it a higher level of residual rights. Generally, common stockholders cannot be paid until preferred stockholders are paid. Preferred stock often, but not always, comes with restricted voting rights, or sometimes with no voting rights at all. It is commonly used by investors such as venture capitalists who wish to invest in new companies but also seek to minimize risk.

Preferred stock can be designated as '''convertible''', meaning that it can be converted into common stock at a certain time or times (e.g. at the holder's option). This gives the preferred stockholder the ability to exercise more control over the business later in exchange for giving up their dividend and liquidation preference. Common stock can also be convertible into preferred stock, although such cases are rare.

====Classes of stock====

The articles of incorporation may also designate various '''classes''' (or '''series''') of stock. Generally, this is done to apportion voting rights and liquidation preferences between various types of investor.

For instance, in a small company, the founders may have Class A common stock, one group of investors may have Class B preferred stock, and another group may have Class C preferred stock. Class A stock may be allotted a certain number of seats on the board so that the founders always have the power to remain on the board. Class B and Class C stock can be given separate allotments of board seats as the shareholders agree, and can be given different levels of liquidation and dividend preference as the shareholders agree.

===Par value and legal capital===

A simple way to define par value is as the &quot;face value&quot; of each share. This is a misleading definition, though: if you buy a share of stock for $75, its par value could theoretically be just about anything. If it has a par value at all, the value is probably low, maybe $1. In most cases, the par value will be completely irrelevant to the shareholder.

Par value comes from an era when small corporations were the norm. Three people might have gotten together and agreed to contribute $10 apiece to form a corporation. When the articles of incorporation were drawn up, the number of shares and par value of each share would be included. For three people investing $10 each, the corporation might issue three shares with a par value of $10, six shares with a par value of $5, or thirty shares with a par value of $1. Whichever numbers its owners chose would be recorded in the articles.

In the beginning, the promoter of a corporation (i.e. the person soliciting investments) would almost always set a fixed ratio between amount invested and number of shares received in exchange for that investment. Par value turned this into an absolute legal requirement. There were several reasons to do this: for one, it ensured that shareholders received equal treatment, as they would get equity and dividend rights proportional to their investment.

The '''legal capital''' (also called '''stated capital''' and '''paid-in capital''') of the corporation would be determined by multiplying par value by the number of shares issued. Lenders were theoretically supposed to use this figure to know how much the corporation was worth at its outset. In practice, this didn't work. Some people learned to contribute property to a new corporation in return for stock at an inflated par value. On the balance sheet, the property would be the corporation's only capital, and because legal capital was fixed, the value of the property would magically go up. While the promoter had $10,000 in stock, the corporation might only have $5,000 worth of assets, but would still be worth $10,000 on paper.

Stocks sold at inflated par values were called '''watered stock''', because the assets of the corporation were &quot;watered down&quot; to increase the apparent value of the stock. Holders of watered stock could be in trouble if a creditor foreclosed on the corporation's assets. If they had received $10,000 in stock for a $5,000 capital contribution, they would not only lose their $5,000 investment but would also be personally liable for the additional $5,000, whether they were the aforementioned promoter lying about the value of their contribution, or an innocent investor relying on par value to gauge the true value of the corporation.

Because par value was such an unreliable indicator of the actual value of stock, and because high par values could create liability for investors if the corporation went belly up, corporate lawyers began advising their clients to issue stocks with low par values. The legal capital of the corporation would still be determined based on par value, but the balance sheet would include the investment over par value as a capital surplus, and everything would still balance. In 1915, New York got wise and authorized corporations to issue &quot;no par stock&quot; with no par value at all, in which case the board of directors would allocate the incoming capital between stated capital and capital surplus.

Thanks in large part to a proliferation of low par and no par stock, watered stock is less of an issue these days. The last major American court case dealing with watered stock was in 1956. (Most corporate statutes also provide that the board of directors exercises conclusive judgment of the value of any property it exchanges for stock, as long as the directors do so in good faith; watered stock still comes up in the context of fraud, though.)

In most places, par value is optional. Under [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc01/index.htm#P22_1323 DGCL § 102(a)(4)], a corporation can choose between par or no par stock, but must make the election in the articles of incorporation. MBCA § 2.02 does not mandate par value, but allows corporations to voluntarily place par value on their stock. For lawyers, one of the most important considerations surrounding par value is: &quot;How much will it cost?&quot; States often charge a franchise fee for corporations based upon the par value of the outstanding stock, with no par stock given an arbitrary par value for purposes of the calculation.

===Distributions===

A '''distribution''' is a transfer of the corporation's wealth to its shareholders. There are two types of distribution: '''dividends''' and '''stock repurchases'''. From the corporation's standpoint, the two transactions are very similar: they both involve a payment from corporate funds to the shareholders.

====In par value states====

Under par value regimes, distributions can only be made from the &quot;surplus&quot; of the corporation. The exact definition of &quot;surplus&quot; varies from place to place, but Delaware defines it as the assets that exceed the legal capital of the corporation—the aggregate par value of its shares. This means that in such states, creditors can only rely upon recovering a fraction of the corporation's assets: the rest are free to be distributed to shareholders at any time.

A few other states impose a further restriction: that distributions have to come from earned surplus, the money that comes from corporate profits. This means that companies cannot pay dividends that would bring their assets below the amount of paid-in capital, the total amount that has been directly paid in by shareholders since the company's incorporation.

====Under the MBCA====

The Official Comments to the MBCA suggest that a corporation must meet two tests before it makes a distribution. These are:

*'''Equity insolvency test''' - After the distribution, the corporation must be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of its business.
*'''Balance sheet test''' - After the distribution, the corporation's total assets must be greater than or equal to its liabilities plus the amount needed to buy out all of the holders of preferred stock.

Some states have adopted these tests verbatim. Others have gone further: in California, for instance, the balance sheet test under [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=3555011204+1+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve CCC § 500] requires the corporation to have assets greater than 125% of its liabilities after the distribution.

Compliance with these rules falls upon the directors themselves. If they break the rules, they can be individually liable to the company's creditors. The Official Comments indicate that the decision to make a distribution should be treated as any other business decision, and therefore should be subject to the business judgment rule. This means that as long as the directors make the decision in good faith, on an informed basis, and absent a conflict of interest, they will usually be safe.

==Securities in public corporations==
Publicly-traded corporations are subject to a number of additional regulatory regimes, most of them federal:

*'''Securities Act of 1933''' - Regulates the public issuance of securities.
*'''Securities Exchange Act of 1934''' - Regulates the public trading of securities.
*'''Glass-Steagall Act of 1933''' and '''Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 2000''' - Bar banks from dealing in corporate securities;
*'''Investment Advisers Act of 1940''' - Regulates professional investment advisors with more than $25 million in managed assets.
*'''Investment Company Act of 1940''' - Regulates securities investment companies respectively. Many investment-related companies fall under these acts, even those engaging in the trade of &quot;securities&quot; not defined as such under the Securities and Securities Exchange Acts. The main target of these laws is mutual funds and similar companies. Foreign investment companies may not publicly offer in the US without making ICA registrations first.
*'''Commodity Exchange Act''' - Covers trading in all types of futures contracts, expansively defined. Forward contracts and derivatives are not included, but many securities-based futures contracts are.
*'''Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002''' (&quot;Sarbanes-Oxley&quot; or &quot;SOXA&quot;) - Adds additional rules to prevent fraud and unfair advantage.
*Rules of the '''Securities and Exchange Commission''' (SEC) passed under the above laws.

In addition, most public corporations must follow the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) or whichever entity is responsible for listing their securities. These exchanges are known as '''self-regulatory organizations''' (SROs), as they can regulate listed companies independently of the federal government.

===Securities Act of 1933===

The Securities Act of 1933 (also known as the '33 Act) is essentially a consumer protection law for &quot;retail&quot; investors (i.e. not money managers, foundations, pensions, etc.)  Its objectives are to provide investors with material financial and other corporate information about issuers of public securities (i.e. stocks and bonds), and to prevent fraud in the offering of such securities. 

Many transactions are exempt from regulation under the Securities Act. [http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/33Act/sec4.html Section 4] of the Act limits its application to '''public offerings''' (according to SEC guidelines, more than 25 offerees) by '''issuers''' and their '''underwriters''' (i.e. investment banks). This means that the Act primarily applies to companies offering securities to the public, and ''not'' to transactions between investors or to sales of stock to small groups of investors (i.e. private placements.)

For public offerings, the main requirement of the Securities Act is '''registration'''. An issuer must prepare an extensive statement describing the securities to be offered and detailing the nature of the issuer's business. Once this statement is registered with and approved by the SEC, its data and forecasts are placed in a '''prospectus''' for potential investors. Any offering of the securities by the issuer or underwriter must thereafter be accompanied by the prospectus.

===Securities Exchange Act of 1934===

While the Securities Act is very limited in scope, the Securities Exchange Act (also known as the Exchange Act or 1934 Act) is much broader. It regulates stock exchanges, brokers, dealers, and even private traders.

===SEC Rule 10b-5===

One of the most important provisions in securities law is '''Rule 10b-5''', a general provision against fraud:

:It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange, 

::a. To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,

::b. To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or

::c. To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, 

:in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.

The rule, along with [http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec10.html Section 10(b)] of the Exchange Act, is used to punish a variety of activities, most notably '''insider trading'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Back to [[US Corporate Law]])

Control over a corporation is vested in a '''board of directors'''. The board of directors have great leeway to operate the corporation as they see fit, but they owe duties to shareholders, and often to others as well.

==The board==

===Board meetings===

The '''meeting rule''' states that directors cannot act unless they meet as a board. See ''Baldwin v. Canfield'', 1 N.W. 261 (Minn. 1879) (board members each individually signed a deed on behalf of the corporation; transfer deemed invalid because board never met). There are legal ways for boards to act without actually meeting, but the general rule is that they must meet if possible.

Although the prototypical board meeting takes place in a &quot;board room,&quot; hidden away inside a skyscraper, board meetings can take place anywhere and at any time. Under MBCA § 8.20 and [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc04/index.htm#P11_124 DGCL § 141(i)], the entire board does not even have to physically meet: a meeting can take place by teleconference or any other method in which the directors can simultaneously hear each other. This permissive rule has caused some courts to take a harder line against board action without a meeting, on the grounds that boards ''should'' be able to meet in just about any situation.

====Notice====
MBCA § 8.22 provides that notice is not necessary for regular board meetings, and that special meetings may be called on two days' notice. The DGCL contains no provisions for statutory notice. The articles or bylaws may fix a different notice requirement. If the board acts at a meeting held without the required notice, the action is invalid. See ''Schmidt v. Farm Credit Svcs.'', 977 F.2d 511 (10th Cir. 1992).

====Quorum====

A quorum must be present at the meeting in order for the board's action to be legally effective. The statutory quorum is a majority of the total number of directors, but can be increased or reduced to as low as one-third under MBCA § 8.24 and [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc04/index.htm#P11_124 DGCL § 141(b)].

====Voting====

Each director has one vote, and the majority of the quorum rules. Directors may not vote by proxy; they must be &quot;present&quot; (i.e. communicating) at the meeting. See MBCA § 8.24; ''Lippman v. Kehoe Stenograph Co.'', 95 A. 895 (Del. Ch. 1910).

===Board decisions without a meeting===

====Written consent====

Under MBCA § 8.21 and [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc04/index.htm#P11_124 DGCL § 141(f)], a board may act by unanimous written consent without a meeting. The idea behind this rule is that forcing unanimous consent ensures that opposing argument will not be silenced during the decision-making process: if a director opposes the action, they can force a meeting by refusing to sign the consent.

====Emergency powers====

If a quick decision is necessary to prevent great harm or take advantage of great opportunity, and a quorum of the board cannot be assembled in time, the directors who are available may make the decision.

====Shareholder consensus====

If the shareholders meet and reach a unanimous agreement, that agreement can bind the corporation. See ''In re Kartub'', 152 N.Y.S.2d 34 (Sup. Ct. 1956).

====Majority approval====

If a majority of directors owning a majority of the corporation's stock reach an agreement, that agreement can bind the corporation. See ''Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Rock Creek Mining Co.'', 449 F.2d 664 (9th Cir. 1971).

==Duties of directors==
Directors' duties are primarily a matter of common law. The DGCL does not address directors' duties at all. MBCA § 8.31 codifies a simplified version of the common law '''business judgment rule'''.

===Business judgment rule===

The business judgment rule is a safe harbor for directors. A director's decision is not subject to review in court so long as it is made in good faith, on an informed basis, and in the best interest of the corporation (i.e. absent a conflict of interest). So long as the director's decision is mere &quot;business judgment,&quot; they will not be personally liable for it.

In ''Shlensky v. Wrigley'', 237 N.E.2d 776 (Ill. App. 1968), a shareholder of the Chicago Cubs' holding company attempted to sue Cubs president Philip Wrigley. At the time, the Cubs were the only Major League Baseball team that didn't have lighting at its home field, Wrigley Field. The court refused to force Wrigley to install lights for night games, stating that &quot;there must be fraud or a breach of good faith which directors are bound to exercise... in order to justify the courts entering into the internal affairs of corporations.&quot;

The business judgment rule has been set aside when directors approve a criminal act in the interest of maximizing profit. See ''Roth v. Robertson'', 118 N.Y.S. 351 (Sup. Ct. 1909) (&quot;strict accountability&quot; for director who paid &quot;hush money&quot; to individuals claiming illegal operation of business); ''Miller v. AT&amp;T Co.'', 507 F.2d 759 (3d Cir. 1974) (directors not insulated from liability on ground that illegal campaign contribution was made in exercise of business judgment).

===Duty of loyalty===

Directors are required to deal fairly in any transaction that creates a conflict of interest, such as when the corporation is dealing with the director himself, or another corporation upon whose board the director sits. Directors cannot take personal windfalls from corporate transactions, and if they run a business that competes with the corporation, they must do so in good faith. They cannot use corporate assets for their personal business.

===Duty of care===

===Duty of oversight===

====Business activities====
A director cannot be a &quot;dummy&quot; on the board. Each director has a duty to attend meetings on a regular basis and to keep track of what is happening in the corporation, including its financial status. Directors who do not fulfill this duty breach their fiduciary duty to the shareholders, and potentially to others; see ''Francis v. United Jersey Bank'', 432 A.2d 814 (N.J. 1981) (holding negligent director of reinsurance broker liable to clients).

====Legal compliance====

Some courts have held that a director need only investigate possible criminal misconduct within the corporation if a &quot;red flag&quot; comes up to alert them to the problem. See ''Graham v. Allis-Chambers Mfg. Co.'', 188 A.2d 125 (Del. 1963).

Others have held that the board must have a reasonable information gathering process in place to monitor the corporation's compliance with the law. See ''In re Caremark Intl., Inc.'', 698 A.2d 959 (Del. Ch. 1996).

===Duty to become informed===

Somewhat more problematic than the duty of oversight is the '''duty to become informed'''. Many courts have imposed a duty upon directors to actively seek information on any major transaction. One of the most controversial cases regarding the duty to become informed is ''[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Smith_v._Van_Gorkom Smith v. Van Gorkom]'', 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985), described below.

====The Trans Union case====

Van Gorkom was chairman and CEO of the Trans Union Corporation, which made much of its revenue from leasing out railway cars. Due to tax issues, Trans Union needed to boost its revenues in order to stay competitive. In September of 1980, Van Gorkom sat down with a friend, Pritzker, who specialized in corporate takeovers. He proposed a sale of Trans Union to Pritzker at $55 a share, and Pritzker accepted this offer a couple of days later. They worked out a deal over the next couple of days in which Trans Union's shareholders would receive $55 cash for each of their shares, and Pritzker would have the option to buy one million shares of Trans Union's unissued treasury stock at $38 per share, 75 cents above market price. Pritzker demanded a response from the board by September 21, just three days away.

On September 20, Van Gorkom called a senior management meeting. Almost all of the other managers thought the idea was ridiculous. The CFO objected to the $55 per share price and to the option to buy treasury shares. Immediately after the management meeting, Van Gorkom summoned the board. He outlined the deal to them without handing over the actual agreement. He brought in a lawyer from an outside firm, who instructed the board that they might face a lawsuit if they didn't take the offer; after all, it was for a shareholder meeting to decide. The CFO told the board that $55 was &quot;at the beginning of the range&quot; of a fair price. The board approved the merger offer after two hours, on the condition that Trans Union would be able to accept any better offer brought within the next 90 days. Van Gorkom signed the merger agreement that night at a party. Neither he nor any members of the board had actually read it.

After the deal was made public on September 22, many officers threatened to resign. Van Gorkom quieted them down by negotiating amendments that would allow Trans Union to solicit other bids through its investment banker, Salomon Brothers. The board approved these amendments on October 8. Two other offers came in, but neither could be completed within the 90-day window. On December 19, a derivative suit was filed. The Delaware Supreme Court overturned the Court of Chancery's ruling for defendants, stating that:

:Under the business judgment rule there is no protection for directors who have made &quot;an unintelligent or unadvised judgment.&quot; A director's duty to inform himself in preparation for a decision derives from the fiduciary capacity in which he serves the corporation and its stockholders. Since a director is vested with the responsibility for the management of the affairs of the corporation, he must execute that duty with the recognition that he acts on behalf of others. Such obligation does not tolerate faithlessness or self-dealing. But fulfillment of the fiduciary function requires more than the mere absence of bad faith or fraud. Representation of the financial interests of others imposes on a director an affirmative duty to protect those interests and to proceed with a critical eye in assessing information of the type and under the circumstances present here. Thus, a director's duty to exercise an informed business judgment is in the nature of a duty of care, as distinguished from a duty of loyalty.

:...In the specific context of a proposed merger of domestic corporations, a director has a duty under (the law), along with his fellow directors, to act in an informed and deliberate manner in determining whether to approve an agreement of merger before submitting the proposal to the stockholders. Certainly in the merger context, a director may not abdicate that duty by leaving to the shareholders alone the decision to approve or disapprove the agreement. Only an agreement of merger satisfying the requirements of (the law) may be submitted to the shareholders.

The Supreme Court sent the case back to the Court of Chancery with instructions to determine the fair market value of the plaintiffs' shares in Trans Union, and award damages to the extent that the fair value exceeded $55 per share. Before this could happen, the directors agreed to settle the claim for $23.5 million, $10 million of which was paid from liability insurance taken out by the directors, and the remaining $13.5 million paid by Pritzker.

Chicago school academics were up in arms over the case. How could directors be liable for approving a deal where shareholders got a 50% premium over the market price of their stock? And what business did the court have second-guessing the directors' judgment? Ira Millstein contended that &quot;99% of boards didn't think that anything wrong had happened. Most everybody wrote about the decision as 'the Delaware courts are going nuts.'&quot;

On the other hand, the decision put board members on notice that they had to be careful not to rush to judgment, especially in deals where there's a lot of money involved. Millstein again: &quot;If you went into a board room before Van Gorkom and tried to talk about legal obligations, they'd say 'We have more important things to do...' When it came down, you were able to walk into a boardroom for the first time and really be heard.&quot;

==Shareholder governance==

===Powers of shareholders===

Shareholders have limited powers over the corporation. The only powers they generally exercise are the powers to elect directors, approve amendments to the articles of incorporation and approve &quot;fundamental transactions.&quot; Some states grant shareholders additional powers, such as approval of &quot;gifts&quot; from corporate funds, and the power to enact bylaws.

====Removal of directors====

Shareholders have an inherent power to remove directors for cause. They must serve specific charges on the director and provide adequate notice and a full opportunity to meet the accusation. See ''Auer v. Dressel'', 118 N.E.2d 590 (N.Y. 1954); ''Campbell v. Loew's, Inc.'', 134 A.2d 852 (Del. Ch. 1957).

[http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc04/index.htm#P11_124 DGCL § 141(k)] allows a majority vote of shareholders to remove directors with or without cause, unless the corporation has opted for a staggered board or cumulative voting.

====Amendment of the articles of incorporation and bylaws====

Under [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc08/index.htm#P21_1808 DGCL § 242] and MBCA § 10.03, shareholders must approve any substantive amendments to the articles of incorporation, but such amendments must be proposed by the board first. The board may make minor amendments and corrections to the articles without shareholder approval.

In Oklahoma, which has a statute similar to the DGCL, shareholders have the power to amend the bylaws. ''Intl. Brotherhood of Teamsters Gen. Fund v. Fleming Cos.'', 975 P.2d 907 (Okla. 1999). Delaware has not made a conclusive ruling on this issue, but ruled that a bylaw depriving the board of its inherent power is legally invalid in ''Quickturn Design Systems, Inc. v. Shapiro'', 721 A.2d 1281 (Del. 1998), leading many to believe that shareholder-originated bylaws may not pass under Delaware law.

====Approval of fundamental transactions====

Shareholders have the statutory power to approve '''fundamental transactions'''&amp;mdash;those which fundamentally change the nature of the corporation. The three basic types of fundamental transaction are '''dissolution,'''  '''merger''' and '''sale of substantially all assets'''.

=====Dissolution=====

=====Merger=====

=====Sale of substantially all assets=====

Under [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc10/index.htm#P11_143 DGCL § 271(a)], shareholders must approve any sale of &quot;all or substantially all&quot; of the corporation's assets. &quot;Substantially all&quot; was defined by the Court of Chancery in ''Gimbel v. Signal Cos., Inc.'', 316 A.2d 599 (1974):

:If the sale is of assets quantitatively vital to the operation of the corporation and is out of the ordinary and substantially affects the existence and purpose of the corporation, then it is beyond the power of the Board of Directors.

====Right of inspection====

===Shareholder meetings===

The shareholders of a corporation generally exercise their limited powers of control at a '''shareholder meeting'''. There are two kinds of shareholder meetings: the '''annual meeting''' usually happens once a year, and a '''special meeting''' may be called for particular purposes from time to time.

The board of directors has great control over shareholder meetings. The actual date for the annual meeting is fixed in the bylaws of the corporation: since the bylaws are written by the board, the board picks when and where the meeting takes place.

There are some legal restrictions on the board in this respect. Under MBCA § 7.03(a), if the board does not call an annual meeting within 15 months of the last one, any shareholder can force the company to call a meeting. The board also has to send written notice of each shareholder meeting to every shareholder, usually between 10 and 60 days before the meeting.

Special meetings can be called by the board, or by any other party named in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Many statutes also allow shareholders to call special meetings, but they have to have a certain percentage of the stock in order to do so: 10 percent under MBCA § 7.02(a). [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc07/index.htm#P11_141 DGCL § 211(d)] does not allow shareholders to call a meeting unless authorized by the articles. (Delaware makes up for this by making it comparatively easy for shareholders to vote in writing without a meeting: see below.)

There has to be a quorum at the meeting for its actions to be effective. The quorum is usually a majority unless the articles of incorporation state otherwise. Some corporations might have a quorum of one-third or two-thirds.

The actual voting can be very complicated. In corporations with more than one class of stock, each class votes separately, and the approval of every class might be required to pass a measure. Many states practice a further convolution: cumulative voting, where a holder of more than one share can &quot;spread their votes&quot; across multiple choices.

The only thing that has to be discussed at an annual meeting is the election of directors.

====Proxies and proxy statements====

In larger corporations, shareholders usually don't attend the meetings: instead, they get a form in the mail which authorizes a proxy to vote on their behalf.

===Shareholder action outside meetings===

Most states allow shareholders to act by &quot;written consent&quot; without calling a meeting. Under MBCA § 7.04(a), every shareholder entitled to vote must give their consent. [http://www.delcode.state.de.us/title8/c001/sc07/index.htm#P231_45170 DGCL § 228] is more liberal: a simple majority of shareholders entitled to vote can give their written consent.

==Transfer of control==

==Derivative litigation==


==Shareholder liability: piercing the corporate veil==

'''Piercing the corporate veil''' is a metaphor for ignoring the limited liability of a corporation. When a corporate veil is pierced, the corporation's creditors can go after the assets of its shareholders.

There are no hard and fast rules for determining when the corporate veil should be pierced. The determination is left largely to the determination of judges, who look at the totality of the circumstances to make their ruling, and choose to pierce the veil if it's necessary to prevent fraud or achieve equity.

===Undercapitalization===

===Equitable ownership===

===Alter ego doctrine===

===Enterprise entity doctrine===

===Misrepresentation===

===Piercing other entities===

Limited liability companies are similar enough to corporations that many courts have been willing to pierce their veils as well. Piercing a limited liability partnership has been more problematic. Partners in LLPs are generally liable for any torts they commit. The tougher issue involves huge LLPs, like accounting firms, and whether the assets of partners can be used to satisfy the demands of the many people claiming against the firm. The ongoing litigation against Arthur Andersen and other big LLPs may shed more light on this issue in the near future.

==Officer positions==

Neither the MBCA nor the DGCL mandates any specific officer positions. Traditionally, there were four officers in every corporation: the president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. Under most traditional statutes, one person could hold more than one of these positions, with the caveat that the president and secretary must be different people. A few jurisdictions allowed all four positions to be held by one person.

*The president is the person given general supervision and control over the corporation's daily affairs. They are responsible for signing contracts and other documents on behalf of the corporation. The president is often, but not always, chairman of the board as well.
*The vice president takes over for the president if the president is unavailable. There can be more than one vice president: they take priority in an order the corporation designates, or lacking such an order, in the order in which they were appointed.
*The secretary is responsible for corporate documents, such as minutes from the board meetings and annual shareholder meetings, and contact records for each shareholder. They also co-sign certain documents, such as stock certificates, with the president.
*The treasurer is in charge of the corporation's finances.

Most small corporations still use the traditional job descriptions. Most big corporations, on the other hand, use &quot;C level&quot; designations: the president becomes a CEO, or chief executive officer; the treasurer becomes a CFO, or chief financial officer, and so on. Many companies have scores of vice presidents, sometimes in several tiers: senior vice president, executive vice president, and so on.

==Authority of managers==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Fate of Our Solar System==

Just as the Solar System relies on the Sun as its source of energy, so too is its fate linked to that of the Sun.

The Sun is right now a middle-aged star. It has existed for about 5 billion years, and will go on shining, pretty much unchanged, for about another 5 billion more. At that time, it will go through major changes that will bring an end to the Solar System as we know it. To understand these changes, we must first understand where the Sun's energy comes from.

==The Power of Fusion==

Like all stars, the Sun is made mostly of hydrogen. This is the simplest of all atoms. Because the Sun is so large and its gravity is so strong, the hydrogen atoms near the center of the Sun - at its core - are under extreme pressure, and are squeezed very close together. Sometimes, four of these atoms are squeezed so tightly together that they collide with enough force to stick together permanently, forming a new, larger, and more complex atom: helium. This process is called '''nuclear fusion''', and when it happens, a small amount of energy is released in the form of heat and light. Due to the massive size of the sun, those small amounts of energy add up to an enormous amount and nuclear fusion is what powers the Sun. (The energy output at the sun's core per cubic meter is about the same as common reptiles, so it IS size that matters here!)

==Out of Gas==

Eventually, the Sun will burn all of the hydrogen in its core, and the fusion will stop. Once this happens, the core will shrink under its own gravity, until it becomes so dense that the helium atoms will begin to collide to form carbon (from three helium atoms) and oxygen (from four helium atoms). These collisions produce much more energy than the hydrogen fusion that powers the Sun today.

The extra energy will cause big changes in the Sun. The core will become much hotter, causing the Sun to swell to over one hundred times its present size, swallowing up the planets Mercury and Venus. Even though the core will be hotter, the surface will be cooler than it is today, changing in color from yellow to red. A star at this stage is called a '''red giant'''.

What about here on Earth? When the Sun expands, the Earth will not be spared. Like Mercury and Venus, Earth will probably be absorbed by the expanding Sun. But even if it is not, it will be no place to live. The oceans will boil, and the atmosphere will be blown away. What is left will be a charred, barren cinder, unable to sustain life.

==An Unstable Ending==

[[Image:M57 The Ring Nebula.JPG|right|thumb|320px|A Planetary Nebula]]Meanwhile, the helium-burning reaction in the Sun will produce '''solar wind''' much stronger than it is today. As it leaves the Sun's surface, it will carry with it some of the hydrogen in its outermost layers, forming a '''planetary nebula'''.

As more matter is carried away from the Sun, the solar wind will continue to strengthen. Eventually, it will blow away so much of the Sun's matter that there will no longer be enough pressure at the core to keep the helium fusion going. At that point, what's left of the Sun will contract under its own gravity, becoming a much smaller, very dense star called a '''white dwarf'''. The white dwarf will radiate off heat that is left over from the earlier nuclear fusion, but it will no longer generate any new energy. 

==A New Beginning==

But will this really be the end? As bleak as this future might sound, there is a silver lining. All of that matter blown away from the Solar System during will eventually be compressed again by gravity, along with the remains of other long-gone stars, into a cloud of gas and dust much like the one that gave birth to our Solar System. In this cloud, many new stars will form with planets of their own, and just possibly, some of these planets may one day produce living beings who will look at the sky and wonder: where did we come from?

}}

== Overview ==

'''''Fleur Isabelle Delacour''''' was once a student at the French magical school, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons Academy]]. She was chosen to be her school's Champion in the Triwizard Tournament that was held at Hogwarts in book 4. A stunningly beautiful witch, she has wavy silver-blonde hair that seems to float behind her as she walks. Many males seem unnaturally attracted to her. 

Fleur's rosewood wand is among the few seen in the series that was crafted by someone other than Mr. Ollivander. Its core contains a Veela hair.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Fleur Delacour enters our story as the students from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] arrive to take part in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. She visits the Gryffindor table that first evening to ask for bouillabaisse, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is stunned by her beauty. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] seems somewhat nettled by this, Ron suggests that there might be some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veela|Veela]] in her ancestry. 

The next evening, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|the Goblet of Fire]] selected her to participate in the Triwizard Tournament at Hogwarts, competing against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]]. She is openly contemptuous of Harry being selected, saying that &quot;'E cannot compete. 'E is too young!&quot; She is, however, overruled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch]]'s interpretation of the rule book.

At the Weighing of the Wands, it is revealed by Mr. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] that Fleur's wand has, as its core, the hair of a Veela. Fleur says that it is her grandmother's, confirming Ron's earlier belief that she has Veela ancestors.

Although the First Task was intended to be a surprise, Fleur Delacour was forewarned of its nature by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Olympe Maxime]], headmistress of Beauxbatons, who discovered what was coming when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] allowed her to see the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragons]]. Fleur's first task was to seize a golden egg from the nest of a mother Welsh Green dragon. She attempted to put it in a trance, but her plan backfired when the dragon snored, lighting her skirt on fire and forcing her to put out the flame with a jet of water from her wand. She did however, manage to collect the egg.

As the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] approaches, Ron, desperate, asks Fleur to the ball; she does not even deign to notice him. Utterly crushed, he retreats to the Gryffindor common room. Harry reveals Fleur's Veela ancestry to him at this point, but he is so defeated that he does not seem to notice. At the Ball, Ron spends some time hiding from Fleur; he is so embarrassed that he does not even want to be seen by her. Fleur, however, is keeping [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Roger Davies|Roger Davies]] entranced, and again does not seem to notice him.

In the Second Task, Fleur had to rescue her sister from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|merpeople]] at the bottom of the lake at Hogwarts. She used an excellent Bubble-Head Charm, giving her a supply of air, but she was attacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Grindylow|grindylows]] and was forced to forfeit. She earned twenty-five points. Like Harry, she had thought that the song of the merpeople was to be meant literally and was afraid that her sister, Gabrielle, would die or be kept underwater forever. So when Harry brought Gabrielle to the surface, Fleur was overjoyed, and ended up kissing him on both cheeks, twice, which left Harry feeling rather as if there was steam coming out his ears. Ron got kissed also, for helping, and seemed extremely pleased about it.

Being in last place, Fleur was the last to enter the obstacle course/maze of the Third Challenge, which was full of enchantments to break and magical creatures to fight. She lost her chance to reach the Triwizard Cup when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] used the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] to force Victor Krum to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] her.

As the Beauxbatons carriage is prepared for departure, Fleur comes up to Harry and Ron on the steps at Hogwarts to say goodbye. Ron becomes somewhat tongue-tied when she approaches, which seems to vex Hermione.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Fleur is largely off-stage here, although it is mentioned that she has stayed in England to &quot;eemprove 'er Eenglish&quot;, tutored by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill_Weasley|Bill Weasley]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In the Half-Blood Prince it is revealed that Fleur will marry Ron's brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]]. The other characters dislike this, mostly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who refers to her as 'Phlegm'. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], though, is delighted at this news; he seems to still secretly have a bit of a crush on her.

When Bill is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 29|attacked]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] and is disfigured, Mrs. Weasley laments that he won't be getting married now. Fleur passionately declares that she loves Bill and will marry him despite his disfigurement and that the scars will just show that her husband is brave. This statement seems to change Mrs. Weasley's feelings for Fleur and she even offers to persuade her great aunt to lend Fleur a goblin-made tiara for the wedding.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

The plan to extract Harry from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']] involves multiple simulacra of Harry, each one traveling to a separate safe house, each with a protector. One of the mock Harrys is Fleur, who will be traveling on a broomstick with Bill as her protector. They are the last pair to arrive at The Burrow, as they were apparently detained by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]], and missed the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] that would have brought them to the Weasleys'.

At The Burrow, Harry finds himself in the midst of the chaos that is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]'s preparations for Bill and Fleur's wedding, set for the first of August. While both Bill and Fleur are present, and are occasionally being set tasks to assist in the preparations, we see very little of them until two days before the wedding, when Fleur's parents and sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]] arrive. It is mentioned then that Gabrielle is following Fleur around.

As Fleur walks up the aisle at the wedding, she is radiantly beautiful; and the radiance seems to make her attendants, Gabrielle and Ginny, especially beautiful as well. And they are wed, and they dance, and everyone dances... and then the Trio must make a hasty exit.

When Ron rejoins the Trio after Christmas, it turns out that he had been staying with Bill and Fleur at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]]. He does not say much about what had been going on there.

When the Trio escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], they end up going to Shell Cottage. Fleur is present at the burial ceremony for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]. Then, Fleur takes care of the wounded, specifically [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]]. She is not terribly happy about caring for Griphook, as she feels that he is treating her as a servant in her own home.

Fleur is part of the celebration that ensues when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] arrives to report that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] has had her baby.

A month or so later, Bill and Fleur are among the people who arrive at Hogwarts for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle at the school]]. They are still in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] arrives; the ensuing awkward moment, as Percy has been estranged from the rest of his family for years, is somewhat defused by Fleur, who asks Lupin how their child is doing. Lupin, in response, produces a photo, which he drops when Percy loudly proclaims his stupidity and begs forgiveness.

While we don't see much of them in the battle, we do see the entire Weasley family after the battle; and in the epilogue we hear mention of Victoire, who we assume to be Bill and Fleur's daughter.

== Strengths ==

By being selected as Beauxbatons' Tri-wizard Champion alone, we can assume that Fleur Delacour was a reasonably talented student. Not only does she have this advantage over others at Beauxbatons, but, being part-Veela, she has a charm that brings many men to their knees. As Fleur's younger sister is chosen as the person Fleur will miss the most it could be said she is family oriented; particularly as she is greatly relieved when Harry rescues her sister.

== Weaknesses ==

Fleur appears standoffish during Goblet of Fire, she makes underhand comments about the food at Hogwarts. Fleur comes across as a cold character.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Ron Weasley accidentally asks Fleur to attend the Yule Ball with him; she ignores him. Harry suggests that this because she has turned on the charm to try to ensnare [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Roger Davies|Roger Davies]], and Ron had been caught in the flux of her spell. Fleur attends the Yule Ball with Roger Davies of Ravenclaw. Fleur is attracted to Bill Weasley and in Half Blood Prince it is announced they are to marry. Fleur has a younger sister Gabrielle who the Merpeople choose as the thing she will miss the most during the 2nd Triwizard Test. Hermione, Ginny, and (initially) Mrs. Weasley all dislike Fleur.

Fleur, because of her Veela background, will tend to have some of the glamour of the Veela, and so will be extremely attractive to almost all males. Presumably, she will have learned that the only way to cut down on the number of admirers is to appear cold, to not be open to approach. This will make her seem aloof and uncaring, and yet she will still leave a trail of attracted men (and boys) behind her. This is bound to incite jealousy in other women, and it is likely this that we see in Hermione, Ginny, and Mrs. Weasley.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Lone Elephant Attack is considered a very safe and cautious strategy and it was by far the most popular during the early years of Arimaa.  As the name suggests, this attack requires only a single piece while the rest of the army stays behind.  If both players employ the Lone Elephant Attack, it is known as a Dual Lone Elephant game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just want to introduce myself to the community. My name is Wil Nusser, and I am somewhere between &quot;amateur astronomer&quot; and &quot;astronomy enthusiast.&quot; I hope that my contribution (first draft of &quot;What Will Happen to the SS in the Future&quot;) proves useful in this project, and I look forward to contributing more to this and other projects in the future.

As I posted this page via BlackBerry, I was unable to include a few things I would've liked. Some images:

Planetary nebula&lt;br&gt;
Nuclear fusion

Also, I read only a few small selections before posting. Afterwards, I read more, and some of it (in particular, the pages on The Sun) suggested that a slight increase in the level of sophistication may be appropriate. For example, in the section on &quot;An Unstable Ending,&quot; I considered discussing the concept of helium flash, but ultimately rejected this in the interest of keeping things at about a third-grade level. (Plus, this would probably necessitate a further tangient on the CNO cycle. Perhaps a box would be appropriate?) Likewise, I did not discuss the role of electrical forces as resistance to fusion. While these are important concepts, I did not deem them vital to the discussion, but I am sure others may disagree.

I'd also like to include a box on stellar evolution, covering neutron stars

In any case, my article is there, for others to edit as they see fit. Feel free to contact me via email at phoenixshade@hotmail.com .</text>

== THROWING INJURIES &amp; SLAP LESIONS ==

DAVID V RAJAN  &amp; CLEMENT JOSEPH
Sports Injury and Arthroscopy Clinic, Coimbatore.

Sports that require overhead arm action (e.g. volleyball, swimming, tennis) and throwing (eg. baseball, cricket, javelin) place significant demands on the shoulder. Approach to the athletic shoulder is quite different from that of normal shoulders. More than 50% of the force of throwing is generated from lower limbs and trunk rotations. The shoulder is the main link in this kinetic chain.1,2 This article discusses the pathomechanisms involved in the problematic overhead shoulder and the prevention and management of superior labral lesions, which put an end to the athletic career.

KINEMATICS 

The throwing action is divided into many phases. In the wind-up phase, the player gets ready with build-up of potential energy. During the cocking phase the player takes the arm high and back (abduction and external rotation). At this stage, the anterior capsule is stressed and rotator cuff, especially subscapularis is very active. The acceleration phase is from the cock-up position to the ball release. Though significant forces are generated in this phase, the shoulder is minimally stressed. The most violent phase is the deceleration phase, which is the arm follow-through, after the ball release. The arm is slowed down by the eccentric contraction (contraction while lengthening) of cuff muscles. During this phase the posterior capsule is stressed to maximum and is responsible for the reactive hypertrophy of the capsule resulting in contracture and loss of internal rotation. 3

PATHOMECHANISM

Two schools of thought exist regarding the basic pathomechanism of the disabled shoulder. The first one regards the stretched out anterior capsule as the primary pathology.4 The second one regards the acquired posterior capsular contracture resulting in a glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) as the primary pathology. The latter is gaining widespread acceptance currently.3,5 

Posterior Capsule tightness
	Significant internal rotation loss occurs in dominant shoulders when the players are not doing proper stretching exercises. With the rotations of humeral head, the capsule and glenohumeral ligaments also move accordingly. During external rotation, the tight band of posteroinferior capsule comes to lie inferior to the humeral head and pushes the glenohumeral rotation point posteriorly and superiorly(fig2). This altered resting position clears the greater tuberosity off the posterosuperior glenoid and allows excessive external rotation. Because of the excessive external rotation, the long head of biceps starts to pull on the superior labrum from a posterior direction. This altered force vector of the biceps results in avulsion of superior labrum resulting in SLAP lesions.3,5,6 







ROTATOR CUFF PATHOLOGY

As we have already seen, the stress during eccentric contraction of rotator cuff can lead to fiber failure.3 In addition, the excessive external rotation of humeral head causes twisting of the cuff fibers causing an additional torsional overload.3 In extreme external rotation the articular side of posterosuperior cuff can impinge against the posterosuperior glenoid resulting in fraying and partial tears (Internal impingement).7,8 All these mechanisms are involved in rotator cuff pathology and in athletic shoulders most of the rotator cuff problems lie on the articular side of the cuff, hence subacromian injections and acromioplasty rarely help. 

BICEPS TENDON
Lesions of the long head of biceps could be minor fraying, partial or complete tears and subluxations. Subluxation is demonstrated by abducting and external rotating the arm while simultaneously palpating the tendon. 

SCAPULA

The scapula and associated muscles provide the platform for the shoulder function. A drooped and protracted shoulder (tennis shoulder) is commonly seen in overhead athletes, which is due to fatigue of scapular muscles and heaviness of the hypertrophied playing arm. The malpositioned scapula can lead to impingement pain (altered acromion position, reducing the subacromial space) coracoid pain (traction tendinitis of pectoralis minor).5 The scapula rhythm is observed as the athlete elevates both the arms. Winging or prominence of medial border also indicate scapular muscle imbalance The management consists of rehabilitation by strengthening, flexibility and plyometric exercises.1,2

NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEMS 

Mononeuropathies involving suprascapular nerve and nerve to latissimus dorsi are commonly seen. The suprascapular nerve can sustain injuries due to traction due to overhead activity or compression by a paralabral cyst arising from a labral tear. If the suprascapular nerve is compressed at suprascapular notch, both supraspinatus and infraspinatus will be affected and if compressed at spinoglenoid notch only infraspinatus is affected. Clinical diagnosis is by observation of wasting and weakness on isolated muscle strength testing.9

INSTABILITY
	Recurrent dislocations in the dominant shoulder preclude overhead athletic activity. Many an athlete have shoulders which are lax, but stable. Laxity (sign) should not be confused with instability (symptom). SLAP lesions can themselves create a pseudolaxity, which disappears after SLAP repair. Rarely a SLAP lesion occurs continous with a Bankart lesion. Gross anterior capsular laxity producing excessive external rotation (&gt;130 degrees) may need capsular plication.5 Any demonstrable anterior instability in a throwing athlete occurs as a tertiary phenomenon due to a tight posterior capsule and SLAP lesion.3

SLAP LESIONS
The labrum serves as an attachment point for capsule, glenohumeral ligaments and long head of biceps. It acts as a bumper and deepens the glenoid. The long head of biceps inserts into the supraglenoid tubercle as well as superior labrum. This biceps – superior labral complex is disturbed in sports as well as other injuries. These lesions were first described by Andrews10 and later classified by Snyder, who gave the acronym SLAP (Superior Labrum Anterior Posterior)11. The superior labrum- biceps complex exhibits normal anatomic variations that should be distinguished from tears. (Fig 3) 

Classification
Superior labral lesions are classified into four major subtypes (Fig 4) and few other less common patterns also have been recognized.

Type I - fraying of the superior labrum
Type II - avulsion of the superior labrum off the glenoid. 
Type III - buckethandle tear of the superior labrum
Type IV The buckethandle tear of the superior labrum extends into the biceps anchor.
Other types include a combination of SLAP with Bankart lesion (Type V) and extension of superior labral tear into the anterosuperior capsule (Type VI).
 Fig. 4
Mechanisms of Injury
               The many varieties of lesions suggest that more than one mechanism is involved in producing these lesions.	
1.	Fall on outstretched hand. A fall with abducted and forward flexed arm can cause the humeral head to compress against the superior labrum
2.	Traction injury: Sudden inferior pulling of the arm as seen in water-skiing injuries can produce SLAP lesions14.
3.	Torsional Peel Back: In the cocking position (Abduction and Hyper-external rotation), the altered direction of pull of biceps tendon on the superior labrum can peel the superior labrum off the glenoid. This mechanism is also supported by recent biomechanical studies. This mechanism is responsible for the type II lesions seen in athletes.3,6,12
4.	Degeneration: It is common to find degenerative changes of superior labrum as well as long head of biceps in the elderly athletes. 

Diagnosis: 
The diagnosis of SLAP lesions is clinical. SLAP lesions can be missed in routine MRI and a normal MRI does not exclude a SLAP lesion. The sensitivity of an MRI can be improved by an MR arthrogram with intraarticular gadolinium. On the other hand no SLAP test is specific and considerable overlap exists between other conditions like cuff, biceps and AC joint pathology.

O’Brien test (active compression test): In this test the subject’s arm is forward flexed to 90o and adducted to 20o and internal rotated to maximum. The examiner places his hand over the forearm and applies a downward force and the patient is asked to resist it. The test is repeated with the forearm supinated. In a positive test, pain produced with pronated foream is reduced in supination.  Pain, which is unaltered with supination, indicates other pathology like AC joint arthritis.13

Jobe’s test: Initially described for instability, the pain produced in the abducted external rotated position is relieved by a posteriorly directed force (relocation maneuver) applied to the proximal humerus. This test is positive in posterior SLAP lesions16
Compression-rotation test: In this test, the shoulder is abducted to 900 and an axial compression force is applied by pushing the elbow and then the arm is rotated internally and externally. SLAP lesions produce pain, or crepitus with this maneuver.14
Anterior Slide Test (Kibler): With the subject’s hand on his hip, the examiner stabilizes scapula with one hand and applies a superiorly directed force to the elbow and the patient is asked to resist the force. Pain or click indicates a positive test.14
Kim’s Biceps Load Test:  With the subject supine, the arm is abducted to 120 degrees and elbow flexed to 90 and forearm pronated, the subject is asked to flex the elbow against the resistance. Pain indicates positive test. 15

PREVENTION
Having seen that the posterior capsular contracture being the root cause of SLAP lesions, most of them are preventable. There exists a stage of “SHOULDER-AT-RISK” in which the GIRD exists without any pathology. Posterior capsular stretching exercises (fig 6) at this stage will stop the progression to SLAP lesions. 3

MANAGEMENT
The basic principle of treatment depends on whether the biceps anchor is intact or not. If the biceps anchor is detached it has to be reattached. Preoperative stretching exercises for posterior capsule are advised. Rotations are examined under anaesthesia; gross loss of internal rotation (IR &lt; 250) may need selective posteroinferior capsulotomy at the end.5,16
Superior labral fraying in Type I lesions requires debridement alone. Avulsions of superior labrum (Type II) require reattachment of the superior labrum to the glenoid. This is accomplished by the placement of suture anchors into the glenoid and the repairing the labrum on to it. The glenoid and labral tissue are freshened before the repair. (Fig 5)

In type III lesions, the inner rim of the labrum is detached from the rest and the biceps’ attachment to the labrum is intact. All that is needed is excision of the buckethandle segment. But in Type IV lesions, the buckethandle tear extends into the biceps root. The management depends on the involvement of biceps root. If the tear involves less than 50% of the biceps root, it can be excised and if it is more than 50% the torn segment is repaired to the remaining tissue.                                                      .    



REHABILITATION 
	After SLAP repair, pendular exercises are started from 3rd day onwards. Sling is used for 3 weeks. Posterior capsular stretching is continued indefinitely. Flexion, extension, passive external rotation with arm at side and posterior capsule stretching (sleeper stretches) are started immediately. onwards. (Fig 6) External rotation in abduction is started from 4 – 6 weeks. Rotator cuff strengthening and biceps strengthening are started from 6th &amp; 8th weeks respectively. Rehabilitation of scapula muscles is also given importance. Gradual return to full overhead activity by 7 – 8 months is advised. 5,16

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

This page will attempt to show some of the basic history of electrical communication systems. 

==Chronology==

{{Wikipedia|History_of_telecommunication}}

1831 Samuel Morse invents the first repeater and the telegraph is born

1837 Charles Wheatstone patents &quot;electric telegraph&quot;

1849 England to France telegraph cable goes into service -- and fails after 8 days.

1850 Morse patents &quot;clicking&quot; telegraph.

1851 England-France commercial telegraph service begins.  This one uses gutta-percha, and survives.

1858 August 18 - First transatlantic telegraph messages sent by the Atlantic Telegraph Co. The cable deteriorated quickly, and failed after 3 weeks.

1861 The first transcontinental telegraph line is completed

1865 The first trans-Atlantic cable goes in service

1868 First commercially successful transatlantic telegraph cable completed between UK and Canada, with land extension to USA. The message rate is 2 words per minute.

1870 The trans-Atlantic message rate is increased to 20 words per minute.

1874 Baudot invents a practical Time Division Multiplexing scheme for telegraph.  Uses 5-bit codes &amp; 6 time slots -- 90 bps max. rate. Both Western Union and Murray would use this as the basis of multiplex telegraph systems.

1875 Typewriter invented.

1876 Alexander Graham Bell and Elisa Grey independently invent the telephone (although it may have been invented by Antonio Meucci as early as 1857)

1877 Bell attempts to use telephone over the Atlantic telegraph cable. The attempt fails.

1880 Oliver Heaviside's analysis shows that a uniform addition of inductance into a cable would produce distortionless transmission.

1883 Test calls placed over five miles of under-water cable.

1884 - San Francisco-Oakland gutta-percha cable begins telephone service.

1885 Alexander Graham Bell incorporated AT&amp;T

1885 James Clerk Maxwell predicts the existence of radio waves

1887 Heinrich Hertz verifies the existence of radio waves

1889 Almon Brown Strowger invents the first automated telephone switch

1895 Gugliemo Marconi invents the first radio transmitter/receiver

1901 Gugliemo Marconi transmits the first radio signal across the Atlantic
1901 Donald Murray links typewriter to high-speed multiplex system, later used by Western Union

1905 The first audio broadcast is made

1910 Cheasapeake Bay cable is first to use loading coils underwater

1911 The first broadcast license is issued in the US

1912 Hundreds on the Titanic were saved due to wireless

1915 USA transcontinental telephone service begins (NY-San Francisco).

1924 The first video signal is broadcast

1927 First commercial transatlantic radiotelephone service begins

1929 The CRT display tube is invented

1935 Edwin Armstrong invents FM

1939 The blitzkrieg and WW II are made possible by wireless

1946 The first mobile radio system goes into service in St. Louis

1948 The transistor is invented

1950 Repeatered submarine cable used on Key West-Havana route.

1956 The first trans-Atlantic telephone cable, TAT-1, goes into operation. It uses 1608 vacuum tubes.

1957 The first artificial satellite, Sputnik goes into orbit

1968 The Carterphone decision allows private devices to be attached to the telephone

1984 The MFJ (Modification of Final Judgement) takes effect and the Bell system is broken up

1986 The first transAtlantic fiber optic cable goes into service

      <text xml:space="preserve">Do you think that this book should remain broad and conceptual, or that it should have say, stream ecology, ecology in the context of urban sprawl etcetera? Specifics like that are more conservation biology than ecology. But maybe there could be the odd box example of conservation biology and the ecology of specific biomes in specific places? I think I might have seen ecology text books have some of those examples in them without any comprehensive discussion of those topics, in boxes separated from the rest of the text. So anyway, what do you think?
I'm starting to think that stuff like SLOSS or fragmentation would need its' own &quot;Conservation Biology&quot; wikibook, but do you think that this conservation stuff should be mentioned here?
Thanks

:You are right to raise this question.   Conservation management is crucial to the future of plane Earth, and although the empirical approach can be used with a fair degree of success, it increasingly relies on experimental evidence.  Therefore, although conservation has been on the periphery of ecology as a subject, it should now be integrated into ecological thinking.  To this end I have started a section on applied ecology, with conservation management as the first subsection.  The aim is to elicit examples of conservation management systems that exemplify the application of six pillars of ecology. --[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 15:27, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
::Thats where that came from.  I think &quot;Applied Ecology&quot; is a good idea. Should it be a separate section or a new book? We can decide of course after you get it underway. The premise of this book in the beginning was just to get the basics out of the way, and the chapters reflect this; but clearly there is lots more that can be said and done in the field and I did earlier set up the idea of separate sections which you are now pushing forward. Great!   - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 17:26, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
::: My first idea was that it should be a separate book.  As you say, as it grows it may well be more useful to detach it.  As I see it the objective of Applied Ecology is to use ecological theory and principles to solve problems associated with intensive human use of the environment.  The following topics are distinct problem areas that are tackled by applying ecological principles on large scales; restorative and and mitigative habitat creation; conservation management; landscape architecture; water-treatment engineering based on wetland ecosystems; disease transmission through ecosystems; rehabilitation of rare species.  They broadly define the scope and of applied ecology as a subject and each one could be developed as the chapter of a book.  I will leave you to decide whether you would like applied ecology with this scope to be initiated in your book.--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 11:12, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
:Having looked more closely at Help:How to start a book and Wickibooks: Naming policy, I have decided that the content would, in the long run, best be handled editorially by starting a new book entitled Applied Ecology.--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 09:02, 22 January 2006 (UTC) 
== Page Renaming ==

I'm writing this book and will decide how and what pages are to be named. I'm not opposed to reviewing &quot;your&quot; convention and maybe applying it, but do not put stupid banners on the book modules - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 17:22, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

: I am happy to fit in with your convention--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 11:12, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

::You are writing this book at Wikibooks and Wikibooks policies apply to your book. Naming of this book is completely unconsistent and misleading. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:33, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Guess what? I checked and there is no &quot;Naming Policy&quot;; only suggestions. Anyway, it is a firmly held rule at Wikipedia (and I assume here also), that suggestions to changes on pages be placed on the discussion page of the article. Banners on article pages are only those intended to convey information to users/readers (whether contributing or not), such as warnings about lack of factual support, controversy, revelation of surprise endings, and the like. Your very obnoxious banners have only the effect of driving users away from reading the article/module material. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:23, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

::::Please do not assume that Wikipedia policies apply here. Wikibooks has its own [[WB:PAG]] page, though much of it is intentionally similar to Wikipedia. [[WB:NP]] has never become {{tl|enforced}}, but I suggest the renaming of [[Basic Ecology Contents]], [[Practical Ecology]], and [[Invasive Species Glossary]] to use &quot;Ecology:&quot; or &quot;Basic Ecology:&quot; like the other modules currently do.

:::No problem. I've always changed my pages in response to whatever style is currently in vogue. My objection is entirely with the tactics being used, especially by self-appointed enforcement police like McDerbeth.

::::Is the &quot;obnoxious banner&quot; a reference to {{tl|Cleanup-NC}}? I always put it on the module, not the talk page, because similar templates like {{tl1|Cleanup|''reason''}} and {{tl1|mergeto|''other module''}} almost always appear at the module, not the talk page. So I presently believe that {{tl|Cleanup-NC}} also belongs on that page. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:25, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Sorry, although you are right, the practice is inconsistent, instructions or requests to editors/writers to do certain things with their text should be on the discussion page, just as any suggestions, requests, ideas, etc. would be. Banners on the module pages that are not intended for the user of the text (for example a student) tend to put the users off (&quot;There must be something wrong with this textbook, I'll go elsewhere for my learning experience&quot;); only makes sense. Also, while all are welcome to contribute, the fact is that only one or a very few people tend to excercise control over a particular texbook as necessary to actually get a book out the subject matter. As Basic Ecology is a book I am working on, I will not accept banners that are requesting something from me on the module page.  I do not mind them on the discussion page; but they are not part of the lesson that the module represents and I excercise my editorial right to move them. And while I do not seem to be having a problem with you and this issue, I do not appreciate a non-contributor like Derbeth suddenly taking over a textbook because he does not like how the modules are named and then attacking me, which is how this &quot;policy&quot; is being implemented. I think that approach is way out of line with Wikipedia (and certainly Wikibooks) philosophy.  - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 01:13, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

===More about renaming===

I would have to agree that the banners across the top of various pages can be very obnoxious and are jarring in term of people who are simply trying to read the content and don't care how the content is stored internally on the webserver.

From the perspective of administrating content on Wikibooks, it helps if there is some sort of consistant naming for a wikibook, although I'm opposed to the current policy that only permits one single possible naming method.  This helps mainly because tools like [[Special:prefixindex]] are available to help find content that has been &quot;lost&quot; due to links that have gone missing, or to help locate the &quot;parent&quot; module if you find a page in the orphan bin.  Far too much content has been lost and forgotten on Wikibooks simply because there are no links available to help find it in the first place.

As you have said marsh, this is something that should be done politely on the talk page first, where contributors are able to make their suggestionss first and give credit to those who are developing the content... not run rough over contributors because you may have a few stripes on your arm as an administrator.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:11, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== Overview ==

'''''Kreacher''''' is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elf]] for the Black family.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Kreacher is first encountered when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] is brought into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]'s headquarters, at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12 Grimmauld Place]]. He resents the new inhabitants of the house that has been a pure-blood stronghold for a long time, and wages his own little psychological warfare on them. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] says that he has been shut up in the house for ten years, taking orders only from the mad [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Paintings|portrait]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Sirius' mother]], and going rather mad himself. It is noted that as Sirius and the others are collecting Black family artifacts to throw out, Kreacher is stealing some of them and hiding them away.

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, and George]] are transported by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] to Grimmauld Place after their father is injured, Kreacher makes a very insulting comment. &quot;Is it true their father is dying?&quot; Sirius, outraged, shouts &quot;Out!&quot; at him, whereupon he vanishes and is not seen again for some days. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] wants to give him a Christmas present, a quilt, but cannot find him; Sirius says that he has a sort of nest under the boiler, and Hermione leaves the quilt there. Harry notes that many of the pictures that he had helped Sirius discard, including a disturbing one of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], are arranged around Kreacher's sleeping space. Eventually, Kreacher reappears; apparently he has been in the attic all this time.

Later on, when Harry tries to find out if his vision of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] being attacked at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Department of Mysteries]] is true, Kreacher says that his master is not home, and that Sirius will never return from the Department of Mysteries, making Harry believe that he must get to London immediately and try to save Sirius.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] arrives at Grimmauld Place, Kreacher laughs at him, telling him that Sirius is gone and won't be back. Dumbledore has to use rather forceful persuasion on Kreacher, but by doing so he learns that Sirius and the other Order members there present ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]]), have gone off to the Ministry to rescue Harry. He also learns that the Death Eaters have learned about Harry's vulnerability to worry about Sirius because, when Sirius had dismissed Kreacher at Christmas, Kreacher had interpreted that as permission to leave the house, and he had gone to the only Black relative that he still respected: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]]. Though unable to reveal any of the secrets of the Order, or anything he was specifically forbidden to talk about by Sirius, he still was able to reveal that Harry cared extremely deeply about Sirius. Additionally, by injuring [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]], Kreacher was able to keep Sirius out of the way when Harry tried to reach him via the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]]. So when Harry spoke to Kreacher, Kreacher was able to lie to him without fear of being contradicted by Sirius.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

By the terms of Sirius' will, Harry has inherited Grimmauld Place and all its contents, including Kreacher. Professor Dumbledore summons Kreacher to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys' house]] to determine whether the inheritance is valid; if there is a charm preventing Harry from inheriting, Kreacher will not accept his orders. Harry's desperate order to Kreacher to shut up is effective, despite Kreacher's quite evident reluctance to accept orders from &quot;the Potter brat,&quot; proving that he, rather than Narcissa (Black) Malfoy or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix (Black) Lestrange]], has actually inherited. Harry then, at a loss for anything else for Kreacher to do, accepts Dumbledore's suggestion and sends him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchens.

Later, as Harry is the only person who believes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] is up to something, he sends Kreacher and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] to follow Malfoy and find out what he is doing. Kreacher's report is largely full of insults for Harry and compliments for Malfoy, but Dobby reports that Malfoy has been going to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry discovers that the mysterious R.A.B. is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Arcturus Black]] when he sees the sign on his bedroom door at Grimmauld Place. After a fruitless search of Regulus' room, Hermione recalls that there was a locket, but that they had thrown it out; Harry recalls that Kreacher was perpetually stealing stuff back, and they go to search Kreacher's sleeping area to see if he has in fact kept it. Kreacher's den is empty of valuables, but it occurs to Harry that Kreacher himself may know what happened to it. Harry summons Kreacher, who reports that he had stolen the locket back, but that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] had then stolen it from him, along with almost everything else of value in the house. Harry demands the full story; Kreacher tells how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] had asked Regulus for a house-elf. Regulus had volunteered Kreacher, telling him that he was to come back as soon as the Dark Lord was done with his services. Kreacher had accompanied Voldemort to the island in the lake that Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 26|had visited with Dumbledore]], where Voldemort had forced Kreacher to drink a potion that left him remembering horrible things. Voldemort had placed a locket in the basin, had refilled it with potion, and then had vanished, leaving Kreacher alone; Kreacher had gone to the lake for a drink of water, and had been pulled under by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]] in the lake, and then had returned to his master, Regulus, as ordered.

Later, Regulus had taken him back to that same island, and had ordered Kreacher to force him to drink the potion, and then replace the locket with the one that Harry had found in the basin, and take the locket back to Grimmauld Place and destroy it. Regulus had drained the basin with Kreacher's assistance, and then struggled to the lake for water, and had been dragged under by the Inferi; and Kreacher had returned with the locket to Grimmauld Place, but had failed his master: he had been unable to destroy the locket, no matter how hard he tried.

Harry tells him that they, too, have the mission of destroying the locket, and as a token of their shared mission, he gives Kreacher the locket that Regulus had had him place in the basin, and that Harry had later recovered. Kreacher is overjoyed at this sign of consideration from Harry. Harry asks him to find Mundungus and bring him back, and Kreacher sets off immediately.

It is some days later that Kreacher returns with Mundungus, saying that he had been hard to trace. A number of times while Harry is interrogating Mundungus, Kreacher threatens him with a frying pan, because he is evidently being disrespectful to Harry.

Over the next month or so, Kreacher's work improves significantly, to the point that Harry is starting to enjoy returning to Grimmauld Place. After the invasion of the Ministry, however, Harry, Hermione, and Ron are forced to leave Grimmauld Place. With Harry gone, Kreacher apparently decides to return to Hogwarts, possibly in the hopes that his master (Harry) will be going there.

Kreacher leads the house-elves at Hogwarts into the second part of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle at Hogwarts]], cutting at the legs of Death Eaters with kitchen implements. After the final battle at Hogwarts, Harry hopes to himself that his four-poster bed in the dormitories at Hogwarts is still there waiting for him, and that Kreacher would be able to bring him a sandwich there...

== Strengths ==

As a house-elf, Kreacher has significant magic ability in his own person, ability that is distinct from human magic. He also has the house-elf trait of extreme loyalty to his Masters, if he accepts them as worthy.

== Weaknesses ==

Kreacher shares the weaknesses of all House-elves: being tied to one family and one location and not being able to disobey their orders, and the relatively low verbal intelligence of the race. He is also, we are told, quite old, and when we first meet him has had no human contact except for Walburga Black's mad portrait for ten years. As such, he is presumed to be somewhat maddened himself. He does seem to recover when separated from Walburga's portrait.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

It is a unclear whether Walburga treated Kreacher well or not. It might seem so, as Kreacher seems to follow the instructions issued by Walburga's painting, while resisting those of Sirius, a live Master. However, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Dumbledore discusses how house elves become loyal and what it means. And in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Harry showed that he was on the same side as Regulus and treated Kreacher with respect, and as a result, Kreacher accepted Harry full-heartedly as his Master. 

At that point, Kreacher, to a great extent, accepted Harry's ideals as his own. We see this particularly in the Battle of Hogwarts, where Kreacher is seen leading the school's house elves to fight against Lord Voldemort, and thus against the values of his earlier Masters. From this, it appears that house elves, despite the strong link of obedience to the family and heritage, have a great loyalty of mind to those &quot;Masters&quot; who treat them well.

== Analysis ==

The author's choice of name for this character is interesting. We have seen that characters names are quite often related to their characteristics; for example, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]], a character hag-ridden by his heritage; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], whose name almost shouts his &quot;furry little problem&quot;; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], white of beard and hair, and eccentrically bumbling about like the bumblebee which is his last name, but with equally hidden purpose. In a world where house-elves are given cutesy, childish names like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hokey|Hokey]], Kreacher, which seems to be a portmanteau of &quot;creature&quot; and &quot;treachery&quot;, is very out of place. The first time we see him, his name alone causes us to distrust him and his motives, and his perpetual string of muttered insults does nothing to change our feelings about him. One feels that the name was selected deliberately to foster that distrust; a name more in line with other house-elf names would have caused a certain cognitive dissonance that would have jarred throughout ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', where an elf with a cute name was saying really horrible things about Harry, Hermione, and Ron. That dissonance would likely have distracted readers from the story.

Kreacher's character is written to be quite childish, in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', and child-like in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. This seems to be consistent with all we know of house elves and their intellectual development. There is more on house-elf intellect in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|that topic]].

#What causes Kreacher's change of heart towards Harry and his friends?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The author apparently insisted that Kreacher be part of the film of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] because he would play an important part in the final chapter. As we can see in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], this is the case.

At least one source had suggested that Kreacher's role would have something to do with the mysterious RAB identified with the locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Having assumed that RAB was, in fact, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]], sources reasoned that it could be Kreacher who accompanied Regulus to the island of the locket; and Kreacher who was required to drink the potion that covered the locket. It is a bit of a surprise to find that it was Regulus who drank the potion, because given that Regulus was a good and loyal Black son, one would expect him to share the Black family disrespect for their servants. 

One finds it hard to imagine that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] would not have protected his Horcrux against other magical creatures; however, we have already seen with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] that house-elf magic is very hard to counter even for very powerful wizards. Additionally, Voldemort has been shown to have no respect for magic he cannot do himself; this tendency to discount non-human magic, and to discount the strength of non-Pureblood wizards, is a large part of what eventually brought him down.

== Overview ==

'''''Moaning Myrtle''''' was a former Ravenclaw student (now a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghost]]) who haunts the girl's bathroom on the first  floor (called the second floor in the US editions of the book) of Hogwarts.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

We meet Myrtle at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]]'s Deathday party. She seems a bit depressed, as many ghosts do; but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] takes the opportunity to mock her to the point that she runs off, crying. Apparently as she returns to her bathroom, she turns on all the taps.

Later, passing the spot where Mrs. Norris, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]]'s cat, was Petrified, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] realize that they are passing Myrtle's bathroom. They stop in to talk to her, but she is not terribly communicative. They are caught exiting from the bathroom by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], who threatens them with a House points penalty.

Because Myrtle's bathroom is such an unwelcoming place, Hermione suggests it would be perfect for their use as they brew up a batch of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]]. They do this starting at about the middle of November. Myrtle doesn't seem to mind this activity much, usually hiding underwater somewhere and gurgling at them. When the time comes for them to use the potion, Hermione finds that she has made a mistake and used a cat hair; Myrtle seems very amused that Hermione has turned partway into a cat and is now stuck there. She finds Hermione's tail especially amusing.

Later, Harry and Ron find Myrtle's bathroom flooded; apparently she has become upset because someone threw a book at her while she was resting in the U-bend. In her anger she has turned on all the water in the bathroom. Harry recovers the book, it turns out to be a diary, originally owned by one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|T. M. Riddle]] fifty years ago.

A clue in that diary leads Harry and Ron to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who in turn sends them to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]]. Aragog, in turn, mentions that the last time the Chamber was opened, a girl died in a bathroom. It suddenly occurs to Harry that this might be Moaning Myrtle.

On their way to visit Myrtle for confirmation, Harry and Ron are caught in the halls by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. Thinking up a reason for their being in the halls, Harry hits upon the idea of saying that they are trying to visit Hermione in the Hospital wing, as she has been Petrified. While visiting Hermione, they find a scrap of paper that she has torn out of a book which describes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisks]]; this tells them what the monster is.

Finally, with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]] in tow, they return to Myrtle's bathroom. Myrtle confirms that it was she who had died the last time the Chamber was opened, and what she remembers matches the effects of a Basilisk; Harry figures out how to open the Chamber, and with Ron and Lockhart, he descends. When he returns, Myrtle suggests that if he had died down there, he would have been welcome to share her bathroom; Ron teases that Harry's got a girlfriend.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Harry is given a hint to the Golden Egg clue by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], and as a result ends up taking the egg to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects']] washroom. Moaning Myrtle joins him there, appearing out of one of the faucets, to his dismay – Harry tries to hide his nakedness under the bubbles; Myrtle after all is a girl. Myrtle guides Harry towards what Cedric did to his Golden Egg: opening it underwater and listening to it there. While Harry is thinking about the meaning of this clue, Myrtle is telling how she became a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghost]]; Harry largely ignores her. When Harry muses how he is going to breathe underwater, Myrtle becomes affronted at being reminded that she doesn't breathe any more.

During the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], Harry, swimming deep in the lake, is again accosted by Moaning Myrtle. Harry is surprised that she is able to get to the lake; she says that sometimes she is sent to the lake by surprise when someone flushes her toilet unexpectedly. She points Harry in the direction of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople's]] settlement under the lake.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

At one point, Harry and Ron step into a bathroom to allow Ron to escape the clutches of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]]. Myrtle appears and is disappointed, saying that Harry had promised to visit her and never did, and that she was hoping that it was the other, sad boy who was coming in. She says that he is worried because he has a task and he has been working at it for a long time, and is not succeeding. Ron manages to insult her by mentioning that she is dead, and she leaves through the plumbing, crying.

Harry, looking at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] in a nearby bathroom with Myrtle. Looking in at them, he sees that Draco is crying. Draco catches sight of him in the mirror, and immediately starts flinging curses at him. Harry retaliates. Draco starts to invoke the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus]] curse, but Harry stops him with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]] curse, one which he has read but never tried to use. This curse makes Harry's wand act like a very long knife, making great cuts appear in Draco's face and torso. Myrtle starts screaming; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] appears and manages to heal Draco.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

Myrtle is offended very easily, at least initially. Any reminder that she is dead will send her off in gouts of tears. When Tom Riddle's diary was thrown into the commode where she happened to be invisibly resting, and it happened to fall through her, this enraged her to the point that she caused all the toilets and taps to effectively erupt, sending water all through her bathroom and out into the hall. It is in part this hypersensitivity that has left her with the name Moaning Myrtle, because in fact that does seem to be what she does most of the time.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

When Harry returns from the Chamber of Secrets, she suggests that if he had died down there, Harry would have been welcome to share her bathroom. Additionally, she helps him a couple of times before and during the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament. This would seem to indicate that she has a little bit of a crush on Harry. However, when Ron and Harry use a bathroom to hide from Lavender Brown in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Myrtle seems disappointed to see them, which would indicate that any romantic interest she has in Harry has been replaced by an interest in another boy, who turns out to be Draco Malfoy.

== Analysis ==

Most unusually for a ghost, it seems Myrtle does have some control over physical matter; apparently her haunting of the bathroom has rendered it unusable, mainly because she keeps flooding the place when she gets depressed. This is useful to the story in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] in two respects: Mrs. Norris is Petrified (in the chapter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber_of_Secrets/Chapter_8|The Deathday Party]]), rather than being killed, because she sees the reflection of the Basilisk rather than seeing the Basilisk directly. The image is reflected in the water that Myrtle has caused to flood out of the bathroom because she was so upset at the insults lobbed at her by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]]'s Deathday party. Additionally, it is Myrtle's unwelcoming presence in the washroom that allows Hermione the time and space to make [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice_Potion|Polyjuice Potion]]; nobody willingly goes in there more than once, after being subjected to Myrtle's aggressive depression.

Myrtle's affinity for water also allows her to help Harry with the Second Task in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]; as the second task involves the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]] under the lake, Myrtle is instrumental in allowing Harry to solve the riddle surrounding the task, and also points him in the right direction when he is looking for the Merpeople during the task proper. Myrtle says that she sometimes ends up in the lake when someone flushes a toilet in her bathroom and she's not expecting it, which may lead us to wonder about Wizarding sanitation practices.

As mentioned, Myrtle is always sad and is apparently still hypersensitive about death. It is true that she had died only fifty years before our story opens, and so could have expected, in the normal run of affairs, to still be alive; it is possible that a ghost will be especially sensitive to thoughts of death until they reach an age at which they would have died normally. As far as her perpetual sadness goes, we must remember that at the time she died, she had been driven to tears by the cruelty of another girl and was hiding in the washroom. From what Nearly Headless Nick tells us in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 38|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] regarding ghostly existence, it is entirely possible that Myrtle is sad as a ghost purely because she was so sad when she died.

== Overview == 

'''Lily Potter''' (née Evans) is a Muggle-born witch and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s mother. She was born 30 January 1960 and died on 31 October 1981 at age 21. She was quite young, 19 years old, when she became pregnant with Harry, giving birth to him at 20.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

At the start of the book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] confirms to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Minerva McGonagall]] that both Harry's parents have been killed.

Harry has been told that his parents had been killed in a car crash, which is why he was living with his aunt and uncle.

In the hut on the rock, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] arrives, there is a fair amount of discussion about Lily. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia Dursley]], her sister, bitterly recounts how proud everyone else was that they had a witch in the family, and of the way she would come home with pockets full of frog spawn and do magic in the house, but she (Petunia) saw Lily for what she was: a freak. Hagrid is shocked that anyone could have believed that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and Lily could have died in a car crash, tells Harry that they were murdered by the evil wizard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], and mentions that James and Lily were head boy and head girl.

Lily's image appears in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|Mirror of Erised]] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] finds it the first time at Christmas.

A large number of pictures of Lily and James are in the photo album given to Harry by Hagrid just before Harry leaves the school for the summer.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Harry, in talking with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], mentions that when they approach him, he can hear Voldemort murdering his mother. Lupin is apparently moved by this revelation. This causes some conflict in Harry; he misses his mother greatly, and would do almost anything to hear her voice and see her face, as we have already seen. But if the only way that can happen is for him to suffer attacks from Dementors? And is he going to be able to fight Dementors, if something he wants so dearly would be removed by that fight?

Lupin later comments that Harry looks extraordinarily like his father, except for his eyes. He has his mother's eyes.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|the Shrieking Shack]], we hear [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]'s side of what happened when he was confronted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]]. Pettigrew had yelled that Sirius had betrayed James and Lily, then blew up the street, changed into his rat shape, and escaped, leaving behind his own cut-off finger and robes. Sirius had then been taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], where he had served time for the murder of Pettigrew. It turns out that it was Pettigrew who had betrayed James and Lily to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

In the battle in the graveyard, while Harry is battling Lord Voldemort, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|shadows]] of the people Voldemort has killed begin appearing. Harry's father and mother both appear and speak with him.

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], during the party that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] throws to celebrate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] being made [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody]] shows Harry an old picture of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]. Harry's father and mother are present in the picture. While Moody clearly intends this as something of a treat, Harry feels that he has been rather taken by surprise, and is evidently dismayed at having this picture presented to him.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], Harry sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape's]] memory of an episode where his father and the other Marauders are bullying a teenage Snape. Harry also sees his then-teenage mother, who yells at Harry's father to leave Snape alone. She even goes to the length of aiming her own wand at James.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When Harry first meets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], Slughorn appears to be biased towards pure-bloods, which is no surprise given that he was head of Slytherin house. However, that doesn't mean that he refuses to see qualities in the Muggle-born; Harry's own mother, for instance, was quite a powerful witch, though of Muggle parentage, and was one of Slughorn's favorites.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] class, Professor Slughorn mentions that Lily had been truly excellent at potions, and attributes Harry's skill to his being Lily's son.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

While [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|viewing Snape's memories]] in the Pensieve, Harry sees Lily as a child at her original Muggle home. Severus Snape, also then a child, informs Lily that she is a witch and that he had been spying on her and seeing her do incredible things. Snape explains the magical world to Lily and they soon develop the bond of friendship, despite the interference of Lily's sister Petunia. Later in the memories, when Lily is at Hogwarts, she explains to Snape that they can't continue their friendship because she has issues with the type of person Snape is becoming and who he associates with. Even though Lily marries James, she is Snape's unrequited love.

As he goes to meet Voldemort in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], Harry finds that he has the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]], and uses it to summon the shades of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|his godfather Sirius Black]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], his father James, and his mother Lily. Lily tells him that he has been so brave, and the four of them accompany Harry to the clearing where Voldemort and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] wait. Harry then drops the Stone, and the four shades vanish.

== Strengths ==

In book six, it is repeatedly mentioned that Lily has extraordinary potions skills. Professor Slughorn, as mentioned, says she was one of his brightest and most charming students.

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Lily's parents are proud to have such a talented daughter, but her sister Petunia despises Lily for her magical abilities, seeing her as a freak. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|the start of the first book]], we learn that Vernon and Petunia have largely cut the Potters out of their family tree.

We learn that she met James Potter in Hogwarts, and although she leaves the impression that she dislikes him because he behaves like an arrogant bully, they eventually fall in love with each other, get married, and have a son, Harry.

As a member of the Order of the Phoenix that opposes Voldemort, we are told that she, with her husband, confronts him three times, and manages to escape. However, when The Dark Lord learns from Severus Snape about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]], he starts looking for the Potter family. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Pettigrew's]] betrayal leads Voldemort to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], where he kills Lily and James.

She seems to have cherished her son, Harry, as she sacrificed her own life to protect him from Voldemort, refusing to stand aside. On those occasions when her shade was brought back, she said that she was proud of him and loved him.

== Analysis ==

Lily Evans Potter is seen as kind and caring person who stands up to bullies, including Lord Voldemort. Her friendship with Severus Snape was a close one, though Lily never loved Severus; this friendship ended when Severus called her a &quot;mudblood&quot;, the most discriminatory name in the Wizarding world. Even though Lily ended the friendship at that point, Severus still promised Albus Dumbledore &quot;anything&quot; in return for protecting her when Voldemort targeted her small son.

Knowing about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|restrictions on magic done by students out of school]], readers may be surprised by Petunia's assertion in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] that Lily was always bringing home frog spawn and doing magic at home. We must bear Petunia's anti-magic bias in mind here, of course. If Lily was born in January, she will have turned 17 and thus come of age in January of her sixth year at Hogwarts. She will have then been able to legally perform magic at home starting with the Easter Break that year, and all later vacations, including the summer between her sixth and seventh years. To our less biased eyes, one summer and three school breaks does not constitute &quot;always&quot;, but one must remember that Petunia, already smarting from being shut out of the Wizarding world, as we discover [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|in the final book]], and seeing this as one more thing that she can't ever do, would have dwelled on these few periods obsessively, and they probably now appear in her memory to occupy far more time than they ever actually spanned.

Our only view of Lily's school days, seen as it is through the eyes of Snape, ends in her fifth year when she broke off her friendship with him. At that time, Lily hated James Potter because of his arrogance. We must assume that between then and her seventh year, James grew up, as she apparently fell in love with the man James became. They married shortly after they graduated Hogwarts, and they joined the Order of the Phoenix to fight Lord Voldemort and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. When her son was born, she cared and loved him more than anything in the world, even to the point where she sacrificed her own life to save him. 

Throughout Harry's life, he lacked the connection between mother and child which is so psychologically necessary to a child. It is possibly because of this lack that he reacts strongly to being surprised by the image of his parents presented by Alastor Moody in Grimmauld Place, during Harry's fifth year. Harry's loss has made his interactions with memories of his mother and father a very private business, and presentation of the picture in such public surroundings leaves him feeling that he must conceal his feelings on having these memories reactivated.

It is, perhaps, surprising that Harry turned out so well despite being reared by Lily's abusive sister. A number of times in the series, we hear that Harry inherited his mother's eyes, and it seems her personality, and good heart and soul. It may have been this gentle strength in himself that sustained him through the difficult times in the Dursley family home. Harry, perhaps, does not recognize this in himself.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

We never discover the shape of Lily's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], but we see that Snape's is a doe. As Dumbledore recognizes immediately that this means Snape's unrequited love for Lily has remained in force, we must assume that there is some relationship there. It is unknown whether Lily's Patronus would also be a doe, or whether Snape simply sees her in that light due to her being &quot;mated&quot; to James, whose Patronus is a stag. While the author has since stated that Lily's Patronus is, in fact, a doe, we should point out that the author, in interviews, often tailors her responses to the audience, and so we must lend less weight to this response than to the published work, in which the shape of Lily's Patronus is not mentioned.

When Harry brought Lily's shade back with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]], she seemed to look at him hungrily and as if she was not able to look at him enough. She also told her son that she was proud of him, and that she will love him forever and be with him until the end of his life.

== Overview ==

'''''Crookshanks''''' is a cat owned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]]. He is quite large, for a cat, orange (&quot;ginger&quot;) colored with brown stripes, and has an ugly, almost flat face and a bottle-brush tail. Although his significance to the the Harry Potter series is limited, readers have picked up traces of skepticism over his bearing. He is actually half-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Kneazle|Kneazle]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Crookshanks enters the story by jumping from the top of stacked cages in the Magical Menagerie in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s head, in an almost-successful bid to catch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]]. Hermione, who intended to purchase an owl, instead buys Crookshanks, over Ron's  protests that Scabbers will never get any rest with &quot;that cat&quot; around, and takes him to Hogwarts. During the trip to Hogwarts, and several times over the school year, Crookshanks attempts to catch Scabbers, often damaging Ron in the process. At least once, Crookshanks seems to be deliberately eating a spider in front of Ron, which Ron sees as direct aggravation. Eventually, we are led to believe that Crookshanks fatally attacks Scabbers in the boy's dormitory.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] later sees Crookshanks in company with the large black dog that has evidently been following Harry around. This reassures Harry, who had believed the dog was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Grim|Grim]]; if Crookshanks can see him, the dog must be real rather than spectral.

As Ron, Harry, and Hermione are headed back to the castle after leaving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] hut, Crookshanks again attacks Scabbers, who was found alive. When Ron and Scabbers are dragged into a tunnel under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] by the mysterious black dog, Crookshanks shows how to still the Willow so Harry and Hermione can follow. 

In the Shrieking Shack, it is revealed that Crookshanks befriended [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], an Animagus wizard who can communicate with Crookshanks while in his dog form. It was Crookshanks who stole the password list from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], allowing Sirius access into the Gryffindor Common Room the night Ron was supposedly attacked, though Scabbers was the actual target. Several times during the ensuing scuffle in the Shack, Crookshanks defends Sirius against Harry: attacking Harry when he tries to recover his wand, and sitting on Sirius' chest exactly where Harry needs to fire a killing spell at Sirius.

As they exit the shack and Lupin turns into a werewolf, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] seizes Ron's wand and uses it to stun Ron and Crookshanks before making his escape.

Finally, when Sirius gives Ron a new owl, Ron holds it under Crookshanks' nose for approval before accepting it. Ginny names the owl [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Crookshanks is at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]] with Hermione. We see him chasing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gnome|gnomes]] in the garden before dinner. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred Weasley]] drops some fireworks as the family prepares to depart for London and the Hogwarts Express, Crookshanks is frightened and mauls a Muggle taxi-driver. He rides in the same taxi as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and all three get rather badly scratched.

On the Express, and throughout the book, Crookshanks is an occasional presence, curled up on a chair, jumping into either Harry's or Hermione's lap, and generally behaving as a cat should. Crookshanks seems to be quite willing to soak up almost any amount of affection from either Harry or Hermione, and sometimes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], but does not seem to entirely trust Ron.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], we see Crookshanks in the kitchen, playing with Butterbeer corks, and generally acting like a cat. Throughout the book, Crookshanks is an occasional presence, curled up on a chair, jumping into either Harry's or Hermione's lap, and generally behaving as a cat should.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

It is mentioned that Crookshanks accompanies Hermione to the Hogwarts Express when they leave The Burrow. Once again, Crookshanks seems to be acting like a cat, and having only a passing role in the story.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

We see Crookshanks at Hermione's feet when she, Ron, and Harry manage to sneak some time together in amidst the wedding preparations at The Burrow. Crookshanks, here, is behaving very much like a cat, simply lying, curled up, at Hermione's feet while she sorts books. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] bursts in on them, Crookshanks, bristling, dashes under the bed to hide.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione need to enter the tunnel at the base of the Whomping Willow, Ron wishes that they had Crookshanks with them to push the knot that will still the tree. In words strongly reminiscent of something Ron had said in the first book, Hermione says, &quot;''Are you a wizard, or what?''&quot; Ron, recollecting himself, uses the first charm he ever learned ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wingardium Leviosa|Wingardium Leviosa]]) to push a stick against the knot that stills the Willow.

== Strengths ==

Events in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' show that Crookshanks is far more intelligent than the average cat. We don't initially notice this, as all wizard's companion animals, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Trevor|Trevor]], Scabbers, and (later) Pigwidgeon, seem much more intelligent than their Muggle equivalents. While Scabbers' intelligence is explained when his true nature is revealed, Crookshanks' intelligence can only be inferred to be the product of his being a cross-breed with a Kneazle.

Being half-cat, Crookshanks is always armed, and is clearly not afraid to use his claws and teeth when he feels the need.

== Weaknesses ==

Crookshanks' ability to communicate, naturally, is limited by his being a cat.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Crookshanks is Hermione's cat; they are quite fond of each other. When Hermione first bought Crookshanks, the witch at the Magical Menagerie told her that he had been there for quite a while; the implication being that very few other witches or wizards were interested in him, or perhaps he in them. The author, describing the genesis of the character, says that he is based on a Muggle cat who would prowl around the sunbathers in a particular square, looking disdainful and refusing to be stroked. While she says that she only borrowed his appearance for Crookshanks, perhaps that character trait also crept in, at least in the beginning.

Crookshanks is perpetually trying to attack [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], who is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s pet rat. Initially he seems to be doing this because he simply doesn't trust Scabbers (he may be able to detect that Scabbers is not what he seems to be). Later, it seems he is trying to fetch Scabbers at the bidding of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who has recognized Scabbers as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] and wants to get him away from the protection afforded him by Hogwarts. Ron, of course, is trying to defend Scabbers from Crookshanks, and gets into the middle of the battles quite often; as such, at least in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], the two of them are quite often fighting each other, and this almost rabid dislike has left enough bad memories that, while Ron can respect Crookshanks and his abilities, they are never quite comfortable with each other.

With other people, Crookshanks is more neutral, accepting affection and being willing to play. He is quite classically cat-like both with Harry and with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], climbing into laps for a quick nap and playing with Butterbeer corks.

== Analysis ==

Crookshanks' apparent extreme intelligence, as displayed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], coupled with his flattened face, has led more than one reader to believe that he might be an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]], possibly even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]]. There is precedent in the series for an unregistered Animagus, believed dead, to have stayed in his animal guise for several years. However, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=7 the author has denied this]; in fact, she has stated, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=10 while discussing his origins], that Crookshanks is half [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Kneazle|Kneazle]].

Although this is in murky waters with the GMail terms of use, it is possible to use GMail as a filesystem (the filesystem sends mail containing the file in question to GMail to store), and ''GMailFs'' is one such implementation of this.
Also there is an extension for Firefox called &quot;GSpace&quot; that does the same thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Step I'''&lt;br /&gt;
First, create a square image, and fill it with the colour of the balloon. Next, use the text tool to add any writing. This should be centred, and take up no more than about one-third of the space in each dimension. Merge the text layer with the colour layer.

[[Image:Gimp-balloon1.png|200px|Text on flat colour]]

'''Step II'''&lt;br /&gt;
Use &quot;Map to Object&quot; (''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Filters &gt; Map &gt; Map Object'') to create a sphere. Ensure a transparent background is selected. By default, the sphere won't take up the whole of the image, so tweak this with the Orientation controls.

[[Image:Gimp-balloon2.png|200px|Map to Object]]

'''Step III'''&lt;br /&gt;
To get the shape of a balloon, use Curve Bend (''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Filters &gt; Distorts &gt; Curve Bend'').  Select to work on the lower curve, as a smooth. Add one control point in the lower half of the grid, centred horizontally.

'''Step IV'''&lt;br /&gt;
The resulting image won't fit the current size, so select ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Image &gt; Fit Canvas to Layers''.

__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
This book will cover the design and implementation of programmable logic devices (PLDs) using the Verilog, VHDL, and System C Hardware description languages. It is not meant to be a comprehensive reference to these languages, but more of a quick guide that covers the parts essential to developing effective digital designs. This book will also cover programming a variety of specific programmable devices, such as FPGA and CPLD devices. Contents intended to be covered are: Programming HDL, Concurrent programming and synthesis. A Previous knowledge of programming a high-level language is assumed. Knowledge of [[Semiconductors]] is helpful but not necessary. Previous experience or knowledge of [[Digital Circuits]] is must.

== What good is the multiplication property? ==

:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 \angle \phi_1)\cdot (M_2 \angle \phi_2) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{?}}{=}\ (M_1 \cdot M_2) \angle {(\phi_1+\phi_2)} ?\,&lt;/math&gt;


Doesn't that imply''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;M_1\cdot \cos(\omega t + \phi_1) \cdot M_2\cdot \cos(\omega t + \phi_2) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{?}}{=}\ M_1\cdot M_2\cdot \cos(\omega t + \phi_1+\phi_2) \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is not true.

== RMS vs Peak ==

I stumbled over this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M \angle \phi = M \cos (t\omega + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

As far as I understand this (I just started going through a power engineering text book), the right-hand side must be multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt; for the formula to be correct:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M \angle \phi = \sqrt 2 M \cos (t\omega + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

This is because the right-hand side shows the instantaneous equation, where M is the maximal value, and on the left-hand side M is the rms (root mean square) value, which is obtained by
dividing the maximal value by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;. Could anyone comment on this?

Would suggest adding the phasor definitions in Complex number and complex polar system.</text>

{{cleanup|page needs general work}}

'''FASM''' is an assembler for the IA-32 architecture. The name stands for &quot;[http://flatassembler.net/]flat assembler&quot;. FASM itself is written in assembly language and is also available on DOS, DexOS, Linux, Windows, and MenuetOS systems. It shatters the &quot;assembly is not portable at all&quot; myth. FASM has some features that are advanced for assembly languages, such as macros, structures, and &quot;virtual data&quot;. FASM contains bindings to the MSWindows GUI and OpenGL. 

==$FFFF 0xffff 0ffffh==

FASM supports all popular syntaxes of hex numbers.

==@@ @f @b==

Anonymous labels are supported.
@@ represents a anonymous label and you can use any number of anonymous label.
@b represents the backward anonymous label whereas @f represents forward anonymous label
Example:

 @@: inc eax
     push eax
     jmp @b     ; This will result in a stack fault sooner or later

==$==
$ describes current location. Useful for determining the size of a block of code or data. 
It is just like &quot;SIZEOF&quot; operator in MASM.
Example of use:

 mystring           db    &quot;This is my string&quot;, 0
 mystring.length    =     $-mystring

==Local Labels==
Local Labels, which begin with a . (a period) 

 globallabel:
 
 .locallabelone:
 
 .locallabeltwo:
 
 globallabel2:
 
 .locallabelone:
 
 .locallabeltwo:

You can reference local labels from their global label. For example:

 globallabel.locallabelone

==Macros==
Macros in FASM are described in a C-like manner and are created like this:

 macro (name) (parameters) {
   macro code.
 }

For example, the following could be used to overload the ''mov'' instruction to accept three parameters in FASM:

    macro mov op1,op2,op3
     {
      if op3 eq
        mov   op1,op2
      else
        mov   op1,op2
        mov   op2,op3
      end if
     }

if op3 eq means &quot;If the 3rd parameter (op3) equals nothing, or blank&quot; then do a normal mov operation. Else, do the 3 way move operation.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 6. Ecology of Invasive Species&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----

Everyone may not accept what a particular ecologist or group of ecologists deem as &quot;the way things work&quot;.  Ecology is a relatively young and complex science.  As a result, some ecological concepts are based largely on conceptualizing rather than experimentation. It is not easy to test many ecological hypotheses, because it is nearly impossible to control all variables in nature and to replicate nature in controlled settings. The subject or science of &quot;invasive species&quot; involves the basics of ecological thought and has considerable import to global species diversity. However, this is a  subject entangled with controversy.[[File: Kudzu on trees in Atlanta, Georgia.jpg|thumb|right|Kudzu, a Japanese vine species invasive in the southeast United States, growing in Atlanta, Georgia]] According to Shea Katriona et al. (2002){{ref|Katriona 2002}}, the Earth’s ecosystems are being majorly impacted by biological invasions. She suggests that the invasions can be studied by multiple viewpoints including,'''(1)''' the characteristics of the invaders,'''(2)''' the characteristics of the invaded communities,'''(3)''' resources available, and '''(4)''' natural enemies. Katriona used the community ecology theory by linking these viewpoints and by applying recent niche concepts with the communities in which they invade, which provides a predictive framework for invasion ecology. The framework presented here, however, shows how core issues of invasion ecology can be introduced into communities and lead to better understanding of the effects of invasion on earth's ecosystems.

==Species status and terminology==
[[Image:Mosquitofish.jpg|thumb|right|The mosquito fish can have both detrimental and beneficial effects.]]
Even for biologists, establishing the '''''distributional status''''' of a species in a particular location is not always straight-forward.  Questions often arise as to what exactly makes a species native as opposed to non-native, because some non-native species have no known negative impacts (Woods and Moriarty, 2001){{note|woods}}. In fact, sometimes the same species can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. For example, the mosquito fish (''Gambusia affinis'')has been widely introduced around the world because of its suppression of larval mosquitoes, but also has negative impacts on native species of insects, fishes, and amphibians (Colautti and MacIsaac, 2004){{note|colautti}}.  Also, natural biological invasions, generally considered range expansions, and introductions involving human activities are important and could be considered a normal ecological process (Vermeij, 2005){{note|vermeij}}. 

Non-native and native species may be sometimes considered invasive, with invasions often following human-induced landscape changes. The subsequent &quot;damage&quot; to existing ecosystems is simply a value judgment(Foster and Sandberg 2004){{note|foster}}. For example, various status classifications exist based solely on the location or the discipline that a biologist is working in (Helmreich, 2005). As a result, many important terms relevant to invasion biology, such as &quot;invasive&quot;, &quot;weed&quot;, or &quot;transient&quot;, include qualities that are &quot;open to subjective interpretation&quot; (Colautti and MacIsaac, 2004){{note|colautti}}. Accordingly, attempts to redefine commonly used terms in invasion ecology have been difficult because many authors and biologists are partial to a favorite definition (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004){{note|colautti}}.  Also, the status and identification of any species as an invader, a weed, or an exotic are &quot;conditioned by cultural and political circumstances&quot; (Robbins 2005){{note|robbins}}

The large number and current complexity of terms used in invasion ecology makes interpretation of the literature challenging and often intimidating. &quot;Exotic&quot;, &quot;alien&quot;, &quot;transplanted&quot;, &quot;introduced&quot;, &quot;nonindigenous&quot;, and &quot;invasive&quot; are all words that have been used to describe plants and animals that have been moved beyond their native ranges by humans (Williams and Meffe 2005){{note|williams}}. &quot;Foreign&quot;, &quot;injurious&quot;, &quot;aquatic nuisance&quot;, &quot;pest&quot;, and &quot;non-native&quot;, are also used as descriptive terms, each with a particular implication.  Even the use of what seem to be simple, basic terms to articulate ecological concepts &quot;can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts&quot; (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004){{note|colautti}}. 

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Introduced species|Introduced species]] (&lt;small&gt;You need follow links only as necessary to clarify terms&lt;/small&gt;)
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Invasive species|Invasive species]] (&lt;small&gt;You need follow links only as necessary to clarify terms&lt;/small&gt;)

Table 9-1 illustrates the relationships among the most common terms describing species status. Setting aside the obvious difficulty that it is not always certain whether a species is truly native or not native to a particular location (requiring evidence of its presence prior to arrival of humans at that location), the greatest area of controversy involves the division of introduced species into '''invasive''' and '''non-invasive''' (&quot;all others&quot; in Table 9-1)because &quot;harm&quot; can be a subjective term based on individual judgement.  Although there is a tendency to view &quot;harm&quot; or &quot;pest&quot; largely in economic terms, here we need to focus on the concept in an ecological sense.

Invasive species are considered a &quot;significant component of global change&quot; as they cause both ecological and genetic changes in the communities that they invade (Sakai et al. 2001){{note|sakai}}. In fact, the number of species that are transferred from one biogeographical area to another each day is thought to be very large. Also, while the geographic trends and prevalence of these invasive species are not easily predicted, islands tend to contain the largest proportion. On average, though, most countries accommodate about 20% of invasive species in their vegetation. On a global scale, it is estimated that invasive species have come to occupy about 3% of the Earth's total ice-free surface over the last 500 years (Mooney and Cleland 2001){{note|mooney}}.

== Invasive Theories ==

The concept and implications of invasive species and invasion are explained by several ideas, including: '''(1)The Biotic Resistance Hypothesis''' and '''(2) The Invasive Meltdown Theory.''' 

===Biotic Resistance Hypothesis===

The '''Biotic Resistance Hypothesis''' states that species-rich communities are more resistant to invasion because these types of communities are able to use the resources/nutrients more effectively/efficiently than communities with low species-richness.[[Image:A cotton-tailed rabbit surrounded by invasive garlic mustard, mugwort, and burdock.jpg|thumb|right|The native cottontail rabbit among non-native plants like the garlic mustard, mugwort, and burdock]]

Species diversity, a term related to species richness, is also important to the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis.  Species diversity has two components- (1) '''Species richness''' represented by ''s''- which is the number of species in a '''community''' which is an assemblage of populations, and (2) '''Species eveness''' represented by ''e''- which is the number of individuals of each species in a community.

There are several factors as to why invaders succeed: '''(1)''' they are highly competitive and which may allow them to reproduce more rapidly '''(2)''' proximity to the community is a crucial factor dealing with invasion and is divided into two parts- (a) abundance of the invader and (b) distance from the community that is being invaded upon, '''(3)''' dispersal rate of invaders to new habitat (there may be new migration paths that become available), and '''(4)''' degree of disturbance.

===Invasive Meltdown Theory===
[[Image:Soo_Locks-Sault-Ste_Marie.png|thumb|right|Aerial picture of the Soo Locks between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, USA]]
The '''Invasive Meltdown Theory''' states that as species are added to an ecosystem, each one representing a potential disturbance, the native system is perturbed in such a way that the system reaches a threshold, at which point it cannot resist any further and invasions occur exponentially. Every individual invader is a threat, but it is their collective impact that can cause the greatest damage to a habitat. This phenomenon is termed '''invasional cartels''', and creates the conditions for a meltdown.  

One illustration of the meltdown hypothesis is the invasion of the great lakes by zebra mussels. The lakes, once incredibly murky, became crystal clear after 15 years of filtering action by the mussels that were brought in on cargo ships from the Black Sea. While the result was desirable, the mussels caused the natural defenses of the lake to be out of flux and the lakes a very easy target for invasion of non-native species. When the amount of species invading the lake are greater than the environment can support, a collapse or meltdown of the entire environment results.

[[Image:Male Ring-necked Pheasant at Deer Park, WA.jpg|thumb|left|A male Ring-Necked Pheasant at Deer Park, WA.]]
The counterargument to the meltdown theory involves naturalized species. A naturalized species is one that has become established without any major impact to the environment. Mitchell argues that many naturalized species get a &quot;bad name&quot; from the invasive species that cause a great deal of trouble, such as the zebra mussels mentioned above.{{ref|Mitchell2003}} A good example of a naturalized species is the Ring Necked Phesant. Intended to be a colony of game birds, it was brought to the mid-west where it flourished without disturbing the native biota. It co-exists with native game birds like partridge and grouse. 

Invasive species do not necessarily always have negative effects. For example, in North Dakota, one invasive species is being used to battle another. Leafy spurge is a weed that grows rampant throughout North Dakota and inhibits all other plant life where it grows. The solution to this has been to bring in another non-native species, the flea beetle which feeds on leafy spurge alone. Notably, it has no recorded negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, although it is technically an invasive species, it is being used to keep the North Dakota prairie ecosystem in tact.{{ref|Nelson1999}}[[Image:Aphthona flava flea beetle cropped.jpg|thumb|right|An Aphthona flava flea beetle is shown here feeding on leafy spurge.]]

==Effects of Invasion==
Invasive species have the capability of drastically changing ecosystems, and meanwhile can also affect the human economy.  Agriculture, forestry, recreation, and disease are just some examples of issues that can be positively or negatively influenced by invasive species.  Sometimes the [[Wikepedia.en|invasive species|invasive species]] can be beneficial, and sometimes humans face the nuisance of a troublesome invader.  

With the expanding global economy, increasing trade volume and international trade agreements influencing trade worldwide, the risks of &quot;alien&quot; invasions are increasing. The high disturbance of industrial areas increases the disturbances of natural habitats and allow for invasive specicies to establish. In the last three decades in China, the increasing biological invasions run hand in hand with the increase in economic development (Wen Lin et al. 2007){{ref|Lin2007}}. In the last three decades China has had a significantly expanded economically with global trade and has consequently been affected by invasive species. 

Economic and human factors have both inderect and direct factors which influence the transportation and redistribution of [[Wikepedia.en|invasive species|invasive species]]. The increase in global trade by land air and sea has intensified the redistribution of invasive species from places that would normally be isolated. The study of ecological factors on the influence of invasive species are vary rarely studied, and may lead to improving the understanding, predictions, and management of invasive species.     

At times, import of an [[Wikepedia.en|invasive species|invasive species]]is desired for economical benefit, but that species is potentially harmful to another ecological or economical aspect.  Much effort is being put into accurately designing risk assessment technologies to determine the net economic benefit of incorporating a nonnative species to an environment. {{ref||Keller}} Keller ''et al.'' (2007) analyzed an Australian plant quarantine program (in which plants were used to make ornaments) to develop such a risk assessment program over a wide range of variables.  They took into account long-term invasive effects over 10-500 years, and their results indicated that the benefits outweighed the costs in this case.  The equation that was developed is: E&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;=((1-''a'')&lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt;''A''+''a''&lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt;(1-''A''))V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;-''a''&lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt;(1-''A'')V&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;-''D'', where &lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt; is the number of new species,V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the benefit of a single species, ''a'' is the rate of invasion, V&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; is the economic loss caused by an invasive species,''A'' is a proportional accuracy,''D''is the cost of administering the risk assessment preparation and execution, and E&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the resulting annual net benefit. This equation seems very straightforward and has accurate and even possibly underestimated results for net benefit.  However, the terms can be hard to determine, and in the case studied in this project, the annual cost of risk assessment analysis was estimated to be $300,000.  This is accounted for, however, by the term ''D'', and is thus incorporated into the equation.  [[Image:Aedes albopictus cdc.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Aedes albopictus'', also known as the Asian tiger mosquito,has invaded many countries including the U.S. in the last two decades.  It is a common carrier of diseases, including the West Nile virus.]]Such risk assessments are important to the balance of economic and ecological success for a case in which incorporation of an invasive species would be necessary.

Invasive pests can kill plants and hamper agriculture, but sometimes can affect the health of animals and even humans.  For example, the West Nile virus was never introduced to the Western Hemisphere until 1999, when mosquitos that carried the disease were somehow transferred across the Atlantic Ocean.  Mosquitos are the most prominent insect vectors of disease, and Juliano and Lounibos (2005){{ref|Juliano}} used this quality to study the dyanamics of invasive species.  The introduction, spread, and impacts of an introduced species can be fairly accurately measured in terms of spread of an associated disease.  This particular study focused on the ''Aedes albopictus'' mosquito.  This species was observed under varying conditions, and the effects of competition and predation were measured to determine whether they could slow or prevent invasion.  Studies such as this can determine what types of environments (including both biotic and abiotic factors)are susceptible to invasion.  This particular project emphasizes that full understanding of such a process must include introduction, spread, and long-term impact of the invasive species.  If a study only monitors the current conditions, important dynamics of the system may be overlooked.

== Summarization ==
Although there exists many terms describing what is usually called species '''status''' for a particular location, most terms are not especially controversial and largely reflect that different disciplines (e.g., agriculture, botany, ornithology, entomology) have developed preferred terminologies for describing essentially the same things.

===What is a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)?===

A Programmable Logic Controller, or PLC, is more or less a small computer with a built-in operating system (OS). This OS is highly specialized to handle incoming events in real time, i.e. at the time of their occurrence.

The PLC has input lines where sensors are connected to notify upon events (e.g. temperature above/below a certain level, liquid level reached, etc.), and output lines to signal any reaction to the incoming events (e.g. start an engine, open/close a valve, etc.).

The system is user programmable. It uses a language called &quot;Relay Ladder&quot; or RLL (Relay Ladder Logic). The name of this language implies that the control logic of the earlier days, which was built from relays, is being simulated.

===The PLC's purpose in life===

The PLC is primarily used to control machinery.  A program is written for the PLC which turns on and off outputs based on input conditions and the internal program. In this aspect, a PLC is similar to a computer. However, a PLC is designed to be programmed once, and run repeatedly as needed. In fact, a crafty programmer could use a PLC to control not only simple devices such as a garage door opener, but their whole house, including switching lights on and off at certain times, monitoring a custom built security system, etc. 

Most commonly, a PLC is found inside of a machine in an industrial environment. A PLC can run an automatic machine for years with little human intervention. They are designed to withstand most harsh environments.

===History  of PLCs===

When the first electronic machine controls were designed, they used relays to control the machine logic (i.e. press &quot;Start&quot; to start the machine and press &quot;Stop&quot; to stop the machine).  A basic machine might need a wall covered in relays to control all of its functions.  There are a few limitations to this type of control.

* Relays fail.
* The delay when the relay turns on/off.
* There is an entire wall of relays to design/wire/troubleshoot.

A PLC overcomes these limitations, it is a machine controlled operation.

===Recent developments===

PLCs are becoming more and more intelligent. In recent years PLCs have been integrated into electrical communications(Computer network|networks)i.e., all the PLCs in an industrial environment have been plugged into a network which is usually hierarchically organized. The PLCs are then supervised by a control centre. There exist many proprietary types of networks. One type which is widely known is SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition).

== Basic Concepts ==

===How the PLC operates===

The PLC is a purpose-built machine control computer designed to read digital and analog inputs from various sensors, execute a user defined logic program, and write the resulting digital and analog output values to various output elements like hydraulic and pneumatic actuators, indication lamps, solenoid coils, etc.
====Scan cycle====

Exact details vary between manufacturers, but most PLCs follow a 'scan-cycle'format.

; Overhead : Overhead includes testing I/O module integrity, verifying the user program logic hasn't changed, that the computer itself hasn't locked up (via a watchdog timer), and any necessary communications. Communications may include traffic over the PLC programmer port, remote I/O racks, and other external devices such as HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces).

; Input scan : A 'snapshot' of the digital and analog values present at the input cards is saved to an input memory table.

; Logic execution : The user program is scanned element by element, then rung by rung until the end of the program, and resulting values written to an output memory table.

; Output scan : Values from the resulting output memory table are written to the output modules.

Once the output scan is complete the process repeats itself until the PLC is powered down.

The time it takes to complete a scan cycle is, appropriately enough, the &quot;scan cycle time&quot;, and ranges from hundreds of milliseconds (on older PLCs, and/or PLCs with very complex programs) to only a few milliseconds on newer PLCs, and/or PLCs executing short, simple code.

== Basic instructions ==
Be aware that specific nomenclature and operational details vary widely between PLC manufacturers, and often implementation details evolve from generation to generation.

Often the hardest part, especially for an inexperienced PLC programmer, is practicing the mental ju-jitsu necessary to keep the nomenclature straight from manufacturer to manufacturer. 

; Positive Logic (most PLCs follow this convention)
: True = logic 1 = input energized.
: False = logic 0 = input NOT energized.

; Negative Logic
: True = logic 0 = input NOT energized
: False = logic 1 = input energized. 

; Normally Open
: (XIC) - eXamine If Closed.
: This instruction is true (logic 1) when the hardware input (or internal relay equivalent) is energized.

; Normally Closed
: (XIO) - eXamine If Open.
: This instruction is true (logic 1) when the hardware input (or internal relay equivalent) is NOT energized.

; Output Enable
: (OTE) - OuTput Enable. 
: This instruction mimics the action of a conventional relay coil.

; On Timer
: (TON) - Timer ON.
: Generally, ON timers begin timing when the input (enable) line goes true, and reset if the enable line goes false before setpoint has been reached. If enabled until setpoint is reached then the timer output goes true, and stays true until the input (enable) line goes false.

; Off Timer
: (TOF) - Timer OFF.
: Generally, OFF timers begin timing on a true-to-false transition, and continue timing as long as the preceding logic remains false. When the accumulated time equals setpoint the TOF output goes on, and stays on until the rung goes true.

; Retentive Timer
: (RTO) - Retentive Timer On.
: This type of timer does NOT reset the accumulated time when the input condition goes false.
Rather, it keeps the last accumulated time in memory, and (if/when the input goes true again) continues timing from that point. In the Allen-Bradley construction, this instruction goes true once setpoint (preset) time has been reached, and stays true until a RES (RESet) instruction is made true to clear it. 

; Latching Relays
: (OTL) - OuTput Latch.
: (OTU) - OuTput Unlatch.

Generally, the unlatch operator takes precedence. That is, if the unlatch instruction is true then the relay output is false even though the latch instruction may also be true. 
In Allen-Bradley ladder logic, latch and unlatch relays are separate operators. 

However, other ladder dialects opt for a single operator modeled after RS (Reset-Set) flip-flop IC chip logic.

;Jump to Subroutine
: (JSR) - Jump to SubRoutine
:For jumping from one rung to another the JSR (Jump to Subroutine) command is used.

PLC is a great invention in the industrial environment.

'''Patents''' are temporary monopolies granted to inventors by the government, in exchange for public disclosure of how the invention works. They are one of the basic forms of '''intellectual property'''.  A patent is a property right.  Essentially, a patent gives the holder the right to exclude others from, among other things, using, selling, and making the claimed invention. 

This text outlines patent law as it is applied in the United States.

==Introduction==
===History of patent law===

The idea of patents dates back to Aristotle, but the earliest patent system was implemented in Venice in 1474. England issued its first patents under Elizabeth I and established a patent system in the '''Statute of Monopolies of 1624''', the country's first antitrust law as well as its first patent law (barring all monopolies except over disclosed inventions).

Colonial governments in British North America issued patents as early as 1641, but the separate patent systems in each state led to problems as the colonies became better interconnected. The best-known of these problems was a conflict over the steamship patent in the late 1700s. These issues led the Constitutional Convention to add a clause to the Constitution permitting Congress to enact a national patent regime.

The '''Patent Act of 1790''' created a very simple structure for granting patents, consisting of a three-member panel led by the Secretary of State (at that time, Thomas Jefferson). In 1836, the law was revised to provide for a system of '''patent examiners''', similar to that which is used today. Today's patent law mostly dates to the '''Patent Act of 1952'''.

In 1982, Congress created the '''Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit''' (CAFC) to hear patent appeals from across the country. One of the purposes for the Federal Circuit was to bring patent doctrine under the watch of a specialist court. Under the Federal Circuit, patents have strengthened, and more inventors have filed to take advantage of this stronger patent protection.

===Parts of a patent===

The key legal component of a patent is the '''claims''', which set the legal scope of the patent.  The claims are found at the very end of a printed U.S. patent.  These claims are supported by the rest of the patent, generally described as the specification.  The patent is also required to have an abstract, providing a summary of the ''claimed'' invention in non-legal language. 

====Claims====

The '''claims''' are the most important component of a patent. The claims are what define the scope of the patent—which devices/compositions/processes its monopoly will cover, and which devices/compositions/processes are outside the monopoly.    Infringement cases always revolve around the claims, not the specification, although the specification can be used to clarify the meaning of terms appearing in the claims.  Despite any language in the specification to the contrary, (such as “The invention is ...“ or &quot;The invention includes ...“), only the claims determine the scope of the monopoly right.   

Some claims may include one or more '''means plus function''' elements, which define that element by the desired result of the element and will encompass well-known or later-discovered substitutions that perform that function.  A &quot;means for attaching part A to part B&quot; could include various well-known types fasteners, such as nails, screws, bolts, glue, etc. and any equivalent means discovered after the filing date of the patent application.  For instance, a &quot;means for attaching part A to part B&quot; element in a patent issued before the invention of velcro may cover the claimed device using velcro as a fastener.  A claim cannot be composed entirely of &quot;means plus function&quot; elements.  

Unless defined otherwise in the specification, all terms of the claims must be construed according to their common usage in the field of the invention at the time the patent application was filed.

====Specification====

From a researcher's perspective, the '''specification''' preceding the claims is the most interesting part of a patent. It shows how the invention works and how it is made and used.

The chief legal requirements for the specification is that it must &quot;describe&quot; the claimed invention in sufficient detail to &quot;teach others how to make and use the invention&quot;.  These are referred to as the '''written description''' and '''enablement''' requirements, respectively.  The written description and enablement must match the breadth of the claims.  If a claim includes devices/compositions/processes which are not described or are not enabled by the specification, that claim is invalid.   It is not necessary for the specification to teach anything that is already well-known in the field of the invention, the written description and enablement requirements are judged assuming the reader of the patent to be a person having ordinary skill in the field.

The written description requirement is often considered to have an evidentiary purpose: it shows exactly what the inventor has discovered. In some cases, an insufficient written description can show that inventors are not due the full breadth of the claims. A famous example is Sawyer and Man's patent on the light bulb, in which the description discussed various filaments made of paper and wood, none of which were particularly superior for use in light bulbs. When Sawyer and Man tried to use their patent against Thomas Edison, his lawyers had it invalidated because its claims, covering all fibrous materials, were much broader than the materials Sawyer and Man had actually outlined in the description. ''The Incandescent Lamp Patent'', 159 U.S. 465 (1895).

Additionally, the description must disclose the '''best mode''' for carrying out the invention, as known by the inventors at the time the patent application is filed. The idea is that a person cannot gain the monopoly of a general patent while keeping secret their best embodiment of the invention. In ''Bayer AG v. Schein Pharmaceuticals'', 301 F.3d 1306 (2002), the Federal Circuit established a two-prong test for finding best mode violations:

# Did the inventor have a best mode of practicing the invention at the time they filed for the patent? If they didn't know of, or believe in, a best mode at that time, then there is no best mode violation.
# Is the disclosure in the patent specification adequate to enable a person having ordinary skill in the art to practice the best mode of the invention?

The specification may (but is not required to) include a &quot;background section&quot;, which is used to describe the state of the art before the arrival of the instant invention and often describes the challenges or problems with the prior art that the instant invention seeks to solve.

===Types of patent===

====Utility patents====

Most patents are '''utility patents''', so called because they cover &quot;useful&quot; processes and products. This text focuses on utility patents.

A utility patent can cover a physical '''product''' (e.g. a chemical compound), or it can cover a '''process''' for using a product (e.g. a method for creating a chemical compound). The scope of these concepts has changed over time. For example:

*'''Artificially-created organisms''' were not patentable as products until the Supreme Court's decision in ''Diamond v. Chakrabarty'', 447 U.S. 303 (1980), which held that a genetically-engineered bacterium was a &quot;nonnaturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter&quot; entitled to product protection.
*'''Business methods''' were not patentable until the Federal Circuit's decision in ''State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group'', 149 F.3d 1368 (1998), holding that a patentable process must accomplish &quot;a useful, concrete and tangible result&quot;.

A utility patent is in effect from the date the patent issues until twenty years from the date the application for patent was filed, so long as periodic maintenance fees are paid.

====Design patents====

'''Design patents''' are awarded to original designs for articles of manufacture. Like utility patents, design patents require novelty and nonobviousness. There is no utility requirement, but there are two other criteria for design patents. First, they must have '''ornamentality'''&amp;mdash;they must be &quot;the product of aesthetic skill and artistic conception.&quot; Design patents must also be '''not primarily functional'''. If the design is primarily functional, it should be the subject of a utility patent, not a design patent.

Design patents last for fourteen years.

====Plant patents====

'''Plant patents''' can be granted for any distinct and new variety of asexually-reproducing plant. Overall, plant patents are not as strong as utility patents in terms of protection.

Plant patents last twenty years from the date of application.

===Patent procedure===

Two terms often used to describe the procurement of a patent are '''preparation''' and '''prosecution'''.  '''Preparation''' refers to the actual drafting of the patent application, whereas '''prosecution''' refers to the negotiation process with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to obtain a patent.  Collectively, many practitioners refer to this process as '''prep. and pros.''' or simply, prosecution for short.  The duration of prosecution varies greatly. The average successful prosecution takes about three years from start to finish, but exceptional prosecution cases can be completed within one year or drag on for more than a decade. Much prosecution delay is due to backlogs in the Patent Office caused by too many applications and not enough qualified examiners.  Partly because of this backlog, in many art units an examiner's goals require averaging no more than 18 hours to perform the entire prosecution of each application.  Nevertheless, in art units like software, backlogs have been known to extend to 5 years.  Where delay is demonstrably due to patent office personel not meeting their timetables for responding to applicants, the term of the patent can be extended by the period of delay.  

====Filing====

The process starts when an '''application''' is filed with the Patent Office. The application contains the components which will form the final patent&amp;mdash;the '''specification''' (summary and description) and the '''claims''' (the &quot;new&quot; portions of the invention, which will be protected by the patent). The application must be signed under oath and accompanied by a filing fee.

If an inventor is not ready to file a full utility application, they can file a '''provisional application'''. The provisional application mainly serves to establish a priority date for the invention, a concept discussed later. After filing a provisional application, the inventor has twelve months to file their utilty application, claiming the earlier priority date of the provisional application.

An inventor can file for a patent on their own, but most inventors enlist the help of a person who has passed the '''Patent Bar Examination'''. If this person has a law degree, they are known as a '''patent attorney'''. Trained scientists and engineers can also take the examination: they have the title of '''patent agent'''. The only practical difference, besides educational background, is that patent attorneys are also qualified lawyers and (if admitted to a state bar) can take patent infringement cases to court.

====Inside the Patent Office====

The Patent Office is divided into eight '''Technology Centers''', each of which deals with a specific area of technology:

* Technology Center 1600: biotechnology and organic chemistry
* Technology Center 1700: chemical and materials engineering
* Technology Center 2100: computer architecture software and information security 
* Technology Center 2600: communications
* Technology Center 2800: semiconductors, electrical and optical systems and components
* Technology Center 2900: designs 
* Technology Center 3600: transportation, e-commerce, construction, agriculture
* Technology Center 3700: mechanical engineering, manufacturing and products
* Technology Center 3900: reexaminations

Each center is divided into several '''examining groups''', and each examining group is divided into several '''art units'''. Some groups are highly specialized to deal with fields that deal with many patent applications (Electronic Commerce). Other groups are more diverse (e.g. Aeronautics, Agriculture, Fishing, Trapping, Vermin Destroying, Plant and Animal Husbandry, Weaponry, Nuclear Systems, and Licensing and Review&amp;mdash;a single examining group).

The art units are staffed by '''patent examiners''' who perform the actual examination of the application, usually after a waiting period of about a year. The examiner reviews each claim separately.

If the examiner considers a claim unpatentable, because of prior art or for other substantive reasons, the examiner issues an &quot;office action&quot; with a '''rejection''' of the claim. The applicant can either '''acquiesce''' (agree) to the rejection by deleting the claim from the application, or '''traverse''' (contest) the rejection.  Traversal can involve arguing against the rejection on scientific and/or legal grounds or amending the claim or submitting a new claim to overcome the rejection.  If the examiner considers the traversal and finds it unpersuasive, he will issue the rejection again in a &quot;final office action&quot;.  Although applicants can respond to the &quot;final office action&quot;, the examiner is not compelled to continue prosecution of the application beyond considering applications after-final response.  

If the claim is unpatentable for merely formal reasons, the examiner issues an '''objection'''. This often happens when more than one invention is claimed in a single application: in such cases, the examiner issues a &quot;restriction requirement&quot; and the inventor must divide their claims into separate applications, which are then processed on their own.

Should the applicant and the examiner reach an impasse (often demonstrated by a final office action), the applicant can file an appeal to the '''Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences''', an administrative tribunal within the Patent Office.  Alternatively, applicants may respond to a final office action by filing a continuation application, a fee, and a response to the final office action; the examiner must then issue a new office action, completing the circle of patent prosecution.  

Once all rejections of the claims or objections to the claims or the specification are overcome, the examiner issues a &quot;Notice of Allowance&quot; and a patent will be granted, if an issue fee is paid.

====Publication====

Eighteen months after its priority date, the patent application is published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  The print format of these publications appears very similar to an issued U.S. patent and published applications are often mistaken for issued patents.  The publications say &quot;United States Patent Application Publication&quot; in line 12 and have a number in the upper right corner in the format US YYYY/XXXXXXX or US YYYY/XXXXXXX A1, where YYYY is the year of publication.  Issued U.S. patents are labeled &quot;United States Patent&quot; in line 12 and are numbered US X,XXX,XXX, or lately US X,XXX,XXX B2.  Published patent applications ''are not patents and do not have the effect of patents'', they are simply a public record of the application.

===Contesting a patent===

Once a patent is granted, it can be contested in a number of ways.  One way is to produce the patented device, and then argue the patent's validity when a suit for infringement is brought.

A person may also request a '''reexamination''' of a patent by the Patent Office.  Historically, the patent office only considered prior art (e.g., documents) that were not considered in the initial examination, that is, on the face of the patent.  However, recent revisions to PTO regulations enable the PTO to consider previously considered art so long as a substantial new question of patentability is raised. 

Note that two types of reexamination exist- ex parte reexamination and inter partes reexamination.  In ex parte reexamination, a 3rd party requestor's involvement is curtailed after filing the request for reexamination.  In the case of inter partes reexamination, the requester is allowed a degree of participation- but note that estopped provisions may apply. 

Finally, a person can bring suit against the patentee in federal court for a '''declaratory judgment''' of the patent's invalidity.  As federal courts can only consider &quot;cases and controversies&quot; under article III of the constitution, a defendant seeking a declaratory judgment must demonstrate reasonable apprehension...typically in the form of threatening communications from the patentee.

==Patentability==

As described above, utility patents can be granted for '''products''' or '''processes'''. They cannot be granted for ideas; they must pertain to the application of an idea. That application must meet the basic requirements of '''utility''', '''novelty''', and '''nonobviousness'''.

===Utility [35 U.S.C. § 101]===
To be patentable, an invention must be &quot;useful.&quot; This requirement is known in patent law as '''utility'''. There are three &quot;types&quot; of utility that appear in precedent: together, they form the notion of &quot;utility&quot; as it is applied by the Patent Office.

'''General utility''' is the notion that a patentable invention must &quot;do something.&quot; It must have a useful function of some kind. In practice, it is not difficult to find a function for an invention: an invention can be purely entertaining and still be useful.

'''Specific utility''' refers to the ability of the invention to perform its function. It is the most commonly invoked form of utility. The specific utility doctrine is used to invalidate inventions such as perpetual motion machines, which may have a formal function but which are highly unlikely to fulfill that function.

'''Moral utility''' is a theory that an invention designed for an immoral purpose should not be patentable. It has not been invoked to invalidate patents in recent years, leading many to conclude that it is a dead doctrine. Some examples of moral utility:

*'''Gambling devices'''. The doctrine was used to invalidate many gambling machine patents in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A number of other patents were invalidated simply because they ''could'' be used for gambling—inventions like coin return devices and horse racing games. However, by the 1970s, gambling machines were routinely receiving patents despite the moral utility arguments.
*'''Misleading devices'''. One well-known early example was a patent for seamless stockings with fake seams: at the time (the 1920s), stockings with seams were widely viewed to be higher-quality than seamless stockings, so the fake seams were seen as an attempt to defraud consumers, and the patent was rejected. This line of jurisprudence ended in 1999, when the Federal Circuit upheld a patent for the Juicy Whip machine. The Juicy Whip is a lemonade dispenser which circulates an inert yellow liquid inside a visible tank while dispensing actual lemonade from a hidden tank below the counter: the Federal Circuit said that deceptiveness should not affect the utility of an invention.
*'''Medicines of questionable safety.''' Today, the Patent Office leaves such issues to the judgment of the FDA, and does not deny drug patents on the basis that the drug is unsafe.

===Novelty [35 U.S.C. § 102]===

35 U.S.C. § 102 governs all of the conditions for novelty.  In particular, § 102(a)-(g) govern the myriad of conditions that must be met for an invention to be novel.  The two key novelty provisions, explained below, are set out in § 102(a) and § 102(b).

====Novelty as to Invention Date====

&quot;A person shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for a patent.&quot; 35 U.S.C. § 102(a).

'''Novelty''' is the requirement that an invention be different from everything that has been published, known or marketed before.

The following definitions apply when discussing novelty and its related issues of statutory bar and priority:

*Knowledge or use by others must be in public. Personal or experimental use does not count, but giving or selling the invention to any third party usually counts as public knowledge or use, unless the third party is expressly bound to secrecy.
*Description in a printed publication occurs when the publication is made available to at least one member of the general public before the invention date of the patentee. 

====Novelty as to Filing Date - The Statutory Bar====

&quot;A person shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States.&quot; 35 U.S.C. § 102(b).

'''Statutory bar''' is similar to novelty, but not the same. Novelty can only be destroyed by others because it is based on the date of invention. Statutory bar is based on the date of filing. The doctrine essentially prevents inventors from waiting too long to request a patent. Once an inventor patents, publishes, publicizes or sells their invention, they have only one year to file for a U.S. patent, or else they lose their right to it.

So when a magazine is sent to subscribers or a dissertation is shelved in a library, the one-year clock begins for any inventions described therein.

Another way to conceptualize statutory bar is as priority of application, while novelty is priority of invention.  That is, § 102(a) is evaluated with respect to the patentee's invention date whereas § 102(b) is evaluated with respect to patentee's filing date

====Experimental use====

'''Experimental use''' is an exception to what is considered '''public use''' for determination of whether an invention is novel or not.  An inventor can use their invention in public for experimental purposes without that use counting as &quot;public use,&quot; so long as the use is a ''bona fide'' effort to bring the invention to perfection or ensure that it will answer its designated purpose. The best known example of this exception is found in ''City of Elizabeth v. Pavement Company'', 97 U.S. 126 (1877), where an inventor tested an experimental pavement on a public street for several years. This use was held to be &quot;experimental use&quot; and novelty was not affected.

====Priority====

In the United States, a patentee must be the '''first to invent'''. This is different from many other countries where the patent is given to the '''first to file'''. To be the first to invent, the inventor must generally be:

# the first person to reduce the invention to practice
# without abandoning the invention.

There is one exception. If someone ''conceives'' the invention first but is not the first to reduce it to practice, they receive priority ''if'' they were diligent in reducing the invention to practice.

&quot;Reduction to practice&quot; is the earliest date where the inventor can prove that they produced or applied the product or process successfully. Filing for a patent is considered to be the legal equivalent of reducing to practice if no earlier date can be proven.

Occasionally, a fight will break out in the patent office to determine who was the '''first to invent''' among patentees who claim the same invention.  This fight is called an '''interference'''.  35 U.S.C. § 102(g).

===Nonobviousness===

&quot;A patent may not be obtained... if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.&quot; 35 U.S.C. § 103.

'''Nonobviousness''' adds an additional inquiry to novelty: is the invention new ''enough?'' The standard inquiry to determine nonobviousness is:

# Would the prior art suggest to those of ordinary skill in the art that they should make the claimed device or carry out the claimed process?
# Would the prior art have revealed that those of ordinary skill would have a reasonable expectation of success in doing so?

To reach this conclusion, the factfinder must examine:

# The scope and content of prior art
# The differences between the claimed invention and the prior art
# The level of ordinary skill in the art
# &quot;Objective evidence of non-obviousness&quot;&amp;mdash;commercial success, long-felt unsolved need, failure of others, copying, and unexpected results.

The case of KSR v. Teleflex, 550 U.S. 398, 127 S. Ct. 1727 (2007), raised the threshold considerably as to what is considered nonobvious.  Now, applicants must meet a higher bar to show patentability of their inventions.

==Infringement==
===Literal infringement===

Literal infringement is found when a person makes, uses, sells, offers for sale or imports an invention described in the claims of someone else's patent. The invention must contain every element of at least one claim in order to infringe the patent: if it fails to meet any part of the claim, it does not infringe that claim.

===Infringement by equivalents===

Even if the invention does not meet the literal criteria of a claim, it can infringe that claim by '''equivalents'''. To do so, it must have the &quot;substantial equivalent&quot; of every limitation or element of the claim.  The general test for whether an element in an accused infringing device is an equivalent of a recited claim element is whether the element satifies the triple-identity test.  In short, the triple-identity test requires that the equivalent element perform the recited claim element in the same way, to perform the same function, to achieve the same result.

The doctrine of equivalents has certain limits. That is, the doctrine of equivalents cannot be used to expand a claim to an extent that would have made the claim invalid. It cannot, for instance, broaden the claim to include prior art.  Further, the doctrine of '''prosecution history estoppel''' prohibits the recapture of claim scope that was given up during prosecution.  That is, if the patentee gave up claim scope during the negociation process with a USPTO examiner to overcome prior art rejections, the patentee cannot regain this scope later on during litigation by claiming equivalency under the doctrine of equivalents.

One difficult area for equivalents doctrine is improvements in technology. Claims are sometimes interpreted to include new technological advances that do not literally fall within their scope. For example, the patent for a light beam-assisted pipe-laying tool was held to cover laser-assisted tools as well in ''Laser Alignment v. Woodruff &amp; Sons'', 491 F.2d 866 (7th Cir. 1974). But other patents have not received protection under equivalents doctrine based on an '''entirety of the technology''' argument. A Texas Instruments patent on handheld calculators was not extended to cover models with MOS transistors and LCD readouts, on the grounds that &quot;all of the claimed functions are performed in the accused devices by subsequently developed or improved means.&quot; ''Tex. Instruments v. U.S. Intl. Trade Commn.'', 805 F.2d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1986).

===Contributory infringement===

&quot;Whoever offers to sell or sells within the United States or imports into the United States a component of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or composition, or a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.&quot; 35 U.S.C. § 271(c).

Unlike direct infringement, contributory infringement requires knowledge of the patent's existence. 

A related concept is '''inducement'''. &quot;Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.&quot; 35 U.S.C. § 271(b). Inducement can be found in a variety of activities: telling someone to violate a patent, selling parts to builders of infringing devices, and so on.

===Defenses===
====Noninfringement====

Obviously, one defense to infringment is simply that the defendant products or processes do not infringe the plaintiff's patents.

====Invalidity====

The defense of invalidity argues that the patent should not have been issued as a patent in the first place because the invention is not novel or is obvious.  One example of patent invalidity would be where the defendant can show a printed publication that completely describes the invention before the invention date of the patentee.  This defense is usually more difficult to prove than noninfringement, because the patentee is given a presumption of validity on the patent once it issues.  Therefore, to invalidate a patent, a defendant must show patent invalidity by '''clear and convincing evidence''', a much harder standard to overcome than the usual '''preponderance of the evidence''' or '''more likely than not''' standard.

====Inequitable conduct====

If a patent is obtained through '''inequitable conduct''' or '''fraud on the patent office''', it may be rendered unenforceable (but not invalid). Patent applications that contain blatant falsehoods or omissions (e.g. concealing prior art known to the inventor) can lead to the entire patent being rendered unenforceable.

====Patent misuse====

'''Patent misuse''' refers to the use of a patent to illegally stifle competition: it is closely tied to antitrust law. The doctrine was first applied in ''Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.'', 243 U.S. 502 (1917), where manufacturers licensed a film projector patent under the condition that the projectors must be licensed to end users so that they could only be used with films covered by the manufacturers' patent. A finding of patent misuse renders the entire patent unenforceable until the misuse is purged.

Generally, patent misuse prohibits the misuse of a patent through prolonging the duration of the patent beyond its expiration and tying the products not covered by the a patent's claims to the patent.  For example, requiring a licensee of a patent to accept a contract duration for royalty payments over a 25 year term when only 10 years remain on a patent's term would be prohibited extension of the patent beyond its expiration.  An example of tying misuse would be requiring licensees to sell certain accessories with a patented product and requiring licensees to pay royalties on the accessories that are not non-covered by the patent's claims.

===Remedies for infringement===
====Injunctions [35 U.S.C. § 283]====

Following a complaint for infringement, a court can issue a '''preliminary injunction''' to stop the accused infringing action. The Federal Circuit has enunciated several factors that should be considered to decide whether a preliminary injunction should issue:

# Reasonable probability of eventual success in the litigation
# Complainant will be irreparably injured if relief is not granted
# Possibility of harm to others from the grant or denial of the injunction (optional)
# Public interest militating in favor of or against injunction (optional)

If the complainant prevails at trial, a '''permanent injunction''' against the infringement is almost always issued.

====Damages [35 U.S.C. § 284]====

Damages for patent infringement are generally '''lost profits''', which are based on (1) demand for the product; (2) presence or absence of non-infringing substitutes; (3) the patent holder's manufacturing or marketing capacity to exploit demand; and (4) and the amount of profit the patent holder would have made. &lt;I&gt;Panduit Corp. v. Stahlin Bros. Fibre Works&lt;/I&gt;, 575 F.2d 1152, 1156 (6th Cir. 1978).

::Demand for the patented product can usually be presumed from infringement itself. The fact that there were buyers who wanted the product and willing to pay the infringer’s price proves demand.

::The absence of noninfringing alternatives assures loss causation because, in the absence of infringing products, the demand could only be satisfied by the patentee's products. Courts tend to avoid speculative damage awards; therefore the patentee must show a reasonable likelihood that without the infringement it would have made the infringer’s sales. One factor is whether the alternatives proposed by the defendant compete in the same market for the same customers as the patented device. The alleged alternative must also not sell at a disproportionately higher price than the patented device. Finally, the availability of non-infringing alternatives may not preclude all recovery if, in a multi vendor marketplace, the patentee can show a reasonable market share with modest assumptions.

::The patentee must also show that it had, or could have obtained the manufacturing and marketing capability to make all the sales in question. It can satisfy this factor by reliance not only on its own manufacturing capability, but also by evidence of the potential for licensing and contracting for the manufacture.

::Finally, the amount of profits must be calculated using an incremental income approach that excludes the patentee’s fixed costs.
:::Lost Profits = Lost Revenues – Incremental Costs
:::Lost Revenues = the number of additional sales that the patentee would have made without the infringement, multiplied by the plaintiff’s historical (pre-infringement) prices
:::Incremental Costs = the number of additional sales that the patentee would have made without the infringement, multiplied by the variable cost per unit

:A patent owner can also potentially recover lost profits on lost sales of ''unpatented'' products (or products covered by patents other than the one in question) that compete with the infringing device, so long as the patentee can establish loss causation. &lt;I&gt;Rite-Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co.&lt;/I&gt;, 56 F.3d 1538, 1545(1995).

:The patentee may also seek to recover damages for the lost profits he would have made on ''accessory items'' that typically are purchased with the patented item. For these ''tag-along'' or ''convoyed'' sales, the ''Rite-Hite'' court held that those damages may also be recoverable. For such recovery, however, all of the components (patented item and the tag-along items) must work as a functional unit.  If the tag-along items and the patented item can function as stand-alone products, then this type of damages may not be recoverable

:As part of '''lost profits''', the patentee may seek damages for '''price erosion''' in the patent holder's selling prices which is caused by the alleged infringement by creating competing supply of products or services. As with lost damages, the patentee seeking price erosion damages must prove causation, i.e. but for the infringement, it would have sold the products at a higher price. The patentee may fail if the accuser can show that the price erosion was due to factors other that the presence of the infringer in the marketplace, such as changing consumer preferences or an influx of imported products.

If lost profits cannot be proven, a '''reasonable royalty''' analysis can be substituted, in which damages are based on the amount a manufacturer would pay on the market for a license to produce the patented article. § 284 provides that the reasonable royalty is the minimum or floor below which the damages assessment cannot go. In analyzing how much is reasonable, courts may ask what the royalties would have been in a hypothetical negotiated license at the time of first infringement. The following factors are generally considered: (1) other competitors; (2) number of licenses; (3) future business and profit the patentee would lose by licensing to a competitor (cannibalization); and (4) how central the patent is to what is being marketed. Alternatively, courts may use the analytical approach and take the infringer’s net profit margin, leave it an “industry standard” profit and give the rest back to the patentee as reasonable royalty.

§ 284 also provides for '''enhanced damages''' up to three times ('''treble damages''') in exceptional cases. The standard for enhanced damages is willful infringement demonstrated by egregious conduct based on facts and circumstances, i.e. deliberate copying. Although a good faith belief of non-infringement, such as an opinion letter from outside counsel may shield a defendant from enhanced damages, the defendant may still be liable for actual damages discussed above.

In addition to § 284 damages, a defendant, under § 285, may have to pay '''attorney fees''' if defendant (generally through its attorneys) commits litigation misconduct that is exceptionally bad, such as tampering with evidence, frivolous lawsuit or defenses. Attorney fees award amount usually bears some relation to the extent of the misconduct in question.

==Exploitation of Patents==
Because patents are a property right, they may be owned or transferred to another much like any other property right.

To transfer ownership of a patent, one &quot;assigns&quot; the patent to another.

A patent may also be licensed. A license provides permission for another party to engage in conduct that would otherwise be infringing.

'''Trademarks''' are distinguishing devices used by businesses to distinguish their goods and services from those produced by others. They are a basic form of '''intellectual property'''.

This text outlines trademark law as it applies in the United States.

==Introduction==
===History of trademark law===

Although trademarks are the oldest form of intellectual property and have been protected at common law for decades, they were the last to be protected by a federal statute in the US, and infringement cases were very rare until the late 19th century.

The first trademark statute, enacted in 1870, was struck down by the Supreme Court in ''The Trade-Mark Cases'', 100 U.S. 82 (1879), for exceeding the powers granted by the patent and copyright clause of the Constitution. Congress responded with the '''Trademark Act of 1881''', which was based on its Commerce Clause powers.

The current federal trademark statute is the '''Lanham Act of 1946''', codified in Title 15 of the United States Code.

===&amp;reg; or &amp;trade; or &amp;#x2120;?===

The Lanham Act establishes a procedure for federal '''registration''' of trademarks. If a trademark meets certain qualifications, it can be listed on the '''Principal Register''', which affords it many benefits. Other trademarks can be listed on the '''Supplemental Register''', which exists to allow trademarks not otherwise registrable in the United States to be registered from foreign countries that require home-country registration first, and to allow registration for descriptive marks not distinctive enough to qualify for the Principal Register. Registration is not mandatory to receive trademark protection, but federal trademarks on the Principal Register receive significantly stronger protection than unregistered trademarks. Federal registration is not mandatory to receive trademark protection, but a mark owner seeking to enforce trademarks in US federal court needs either a federal registration or a violation of the Lanham Act's specific sections on '''false advertising''' or '''unfair competition'''. 

Federal registration is limited to trademarks and service marks being used by the mark owner in '''interstate commerce'''. Among other criteria, federal registered trademarks may not be &quot;immoral, deceptive or scandalous,&quot; or &quot;disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, institutions, beliefs or national symbols.&quot; They may not be &quot;merely descriptive,&quot; &quot;deceptively misdescriptive,&quot; &quot;primarily geographically misdescriptive,&quot; &quot;primarily merely a surname,&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; without proof of secondary meaning. See 15 U.S.C. § 1052.

In addition to federal registration, each of the fifty US states has its own system of trademark registration. If a trademark meets the state's qualifications, it can be listed on the state's registry of trademarks. State registration is not mandatory to receive trademark protection or to use a state's court system to enforce trademark rights. The US federal and state trademark registration systems co-exist side-by-side. It is possible for a state-registered trademark, or a common law unregistered trademark, to have rights superior to a trademark with a valid federal registration, due to an earlier date of adoption combined with actual and continuous use.

Only trademarks on the Principal Register and the Supplemental Register can be marked with the &amp;reg; symbol to denote their higher level of protection. Any trademark, including unregistered trademarks or trademarks on the Principal or Supplemental Register, can be marked with the &amp;trade; or &amp;#x2120; (service mark) symbol. These symbols exist to place third parties on notice that they may infringe the trademark by using it without authorization.

==Types of protected mark==

Trademark law protects '''marks'''. Marks can be words, names, symbols or devices. They come in several classes:

===Trademark===

Strictly speaking, a '''trademark''' is a mark that distinguishes one person's goods from others'. In practice, the word &quot;trademark&quot; is often used to refer to any class of mark that is protected under trademark law.

===Service mark===

A '''service mark''' is similar to a trademark, except that it is used to distinguish one person's services from others'. Service marks are registrable in the same manner as trademarks and are denoted by the &amp;reg; symbol once they are registered on the Principal or Supplemental Registers. If they are not registered, they often carry an SM symbol.

===Trade name===

A '''trade name''' is a mark used to identify a business, as opposed to a good or service. The Lanham Act does not allow trade names to be registered unless they also function as trademarks or service marks by identifying the source of a good or service. However, many states allow trade names to be registered and protected under state law.

===Certification mark===

A '''certification mark''' is a mark used to certify a good in some way, regardless of its specific source. Seals of approval (e.g. the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval) and marks of origin (e.g. Roquefort cheese) are examples of certification marks. A certification mark is held by an organization and is protected under trademark law so long as the holder establishes a standard for awarding the mark and polices that standard effectively.

===Collective mark===

A '''collective mark''' is a mark held by a group for the use of its members. Examples include union stamps and franchise marks. Collective marks are treated like regular trademarks and service marks under the Lanham Act.

===Trade dress and product configuration===

'''Trade dress''' refers to the distinctive packaging of a product. One example of trade dress is the decor of a restaurant chain. Trade dress is protected if it is inherently distinctive.

'''Product configuration''' refers to the distinctive design and shape of a product. The best-known example is the glass Coca-Cola bottle. A product configuration must have '''secondary meaning''' to be protected, regardless of whether it is inherently distinctive or not. Secondary meaning means that the appearance of the product should indicate its source to a consumer.

Both trade dress and product configuration can be registered as trademarks, but they are more often protected without registration as a &quot;false designation of origin&quot; under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). They pose special problems in trademark law because of their non-verbal nature. Words are easy to protect: more abstract designs are not.

==Trademarkability==
===Distinctiveness===

Marks in the form of words can be classified as either '''arbitrary''', '''fanciful''', '''suggestive''', '''descriptive''' or '''generic'''. The nature of the mark determines the extent to which it is protected by law.

====Arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive marks====

A &quot;fanciful&quot; mark has no meaning other than its meaning as a trademark. Examples include Xerox copiers, Lego bricks and Verizon phones. &quot;Arbitrary&quot; marks have a separate meaning, but that meaning has nothing to do with their use as a trademark. Examples include Apple computers, Diesel jeans and Shell gasoline. &quot;Suggestive&quot; marks suggest a characteristic of a good or service without actually describing that characteristic. Examples include Coppertone sunblock, Earthlink internet service and jetBlue airline service.

Arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive marks receive highly similar treatment under the law. They are the strongest types of mark in that their holders do not need to prove a secondary meaning in order to protect the mark. Because there is no reason to associate Apple with computers, outside of the popularity of computers made by Apple Computer, third parties have few legitimate reasons to use the name &quot;Apple&quot; on their computers.

====Descriptive marks====

A &quot;descriptive&quot; mark is one that identifies a characteristic of the article or service it marks. Examples include American Airlines (a '''geographic mark''') and Dell Computer (a '''surname mark'''). Descriptive marks cannot be registered without proof that the mark has a secondary meaning in the eye of the consumer public.

Even if a descriptive mark has a secondary meaning, its descriptive nature makes it possible to avoid trademark infringement liability through a '''fair use''' defense. A person could, for instance, use &quot;American Airlines&quot; in a commercial context to refer to airlines from America, so long as they were not using the term in its trademark sense.

====Generic marks====

Generic marks, like &quot;laptop computer,&quot; ''cannot'' receive trademark protection even if they have a secondary meaning. The rule against generic trademarks is particularly important for holders of famous marks, because their marks may lose protection if they become common nouns or adjectives in the public eye. Formerly-trademarked words like &quot;aspirin&quot; and &quot;cellophane&quot; have lost their protection due to '''genericide'''. Genericide is discussed in detail in the Defenses section.

====Non-verbal marks====

A mark need not be a word or phrase. Besides trade dress and product configuration, discussed above, trademarks can also be found in sounds (e.g. the NBC chimes), colors, fragrances, and other distinctive features of a product. The most important criteria in determining their trademarkability is secondary meaning (whether the feature denotes origin to consumers) and whether the feature is '''functional'''. Functional features are not trademarkable: they must be protected under patent law if they are to be protected at all.

===Priority===

Generally speaking, the owner of a mark is the person who is first to use that mark in commerce. This is known as the '''race to the marketplace''' test. For unregistered marks, protection only extends to the areas where marked products are sold or advertised, where their reputation is established, or where the owner is reasonably expected to reach in the normal expansion of their business. Registered marks automatically receive nationwide protection regardless of where they are used.

If two people use the same mark in the same region, the right to use the mark will be given to the first person to use the mark in that region. If one of the marks is registered, the unregistered mark will only prevail if it was in use before the application for the registered mark was filed, and the unregistered mark will only prevail in the area(s) where it was in use.

==Infringement==
===Confusion===

Confusion is one of the main grounds for a trademark infringement claim. It can take many forms, but the basic inquiry generally involves the same questions:

# How strong is the mark being defended?
# How similar are the products in question?
# How similar are the marks in question?
# Have consumers actually been confused?
# Which marketing channels have been used?
# How likely is the consumer to exercise care when purchasing the products in question?
# What was the defendant's intent in selecting the mark?
# How likely are the product lines to expand?

See ''AMF v. Sleekcraft Boats'', 599 F.2d 341 (9th Cir. 1979). Different circuit courts use slightly different tests in determining likelihood of confusion.

Infringement by confusion can involve:

*'''Confusion between related products'''. If one product is offered under a mark similar or identical to another, and the products would be confused by the buying public if sold under the same mark, trademark infringement can be found. Examples from actual infringement cases include Slickcraft and Sleekcraft boats, Bonamine and Dramamine medications, Pledge and Promise cleaners, and Duron and Durox paints. 
*'''Confusion as to source'''. Confusion can also be found when the same or similar mark is applied to different types of goods. One early case, involving Borden milk and Borden ice cream, was deemed to be non-infringing in 1912; in more recent years, such cases have routinely led to findings of infringement.
*'''Confusion as to sponsorship'''. Even where consumers are unlikely to be confused as to source, they may be confused as to sponsorship. Team logo merchandise is a common example; consumers may expect that they are supporting the New York Yankees by purchasing a Yankees cap.
*'''Initial interest confusion'''. Sometimes, famous marks are used to lure consumers to different businesses. &quot;Cybersquatting&quot; by registering a well-known trademark as a domain name is one well-known example. Another is the use of meta tags to fool search engines: a little-known adult Web site may attempt to attract visitors by showing up in web searches for more well-known adult entertainment franchises. Both activities can be considered trademark infringement by confusion.
*'''Post-sale confusion'''. Post-sale confusion is often used to find infringement in counterfeit goods, such as fake watches and handbags. While the purchaser is likely to understand that they are buying a counterfeit product, the aim is to confuse others into thinking the product comes from a different source.
*'''Reverse confusion'''. Although confusion cases generally involve a little-known business using a well-known mark, confusion can also be found when a well-known business uses a little-known mark.

===Dilution===

Trademark infringement can also be found in the absence of any confusion at all. Many trademarks are deemed to have a distinctive quality, and any third-party use that diminishes this distinctiveness is considered to be '''dilution''', which is an independent cause of action from traditional infringement. Traditional types of distinction include '''blurring''', in which the diluter lessens the ability of the mark to uniquely identify one source of goods or services, and '''tarnishment''', in which the diluter associates the mark with scandalous or obscene material, thus attacking the good character of the mark or its owner.

The textbook case of dilution is ''Eastman Photographic Materials v. Kodak Cycle'', 15 R.P.C. 105 (Eng. 1898), in which the maker of Kodak cameras brought suit against a company producing Kodak bicycles. There was little chance of cameras being confused with bicycles: the risk was removing the Kodak name's association with cameras.

The '''Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995''' added a dilution statute to the Lanham Act. Dilution can be found whenever a &quot;famous mark&quot; is used by another, &quot;if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark.&quot; 15 U.S.C. 1125(c). However, a recent law has made significant changes to the Federal dilution statute. [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h683enr.txt.pdf]

===Contributory infringement===

Trademark law has a contributory infringement doctrine similar to those under [[US Patent Law#Contributory infringement|patent law]] and [[US Copyright Law#Contributory and vicarious infringement|copyright law]]. Unlike its sister doctrines, however, contributory infringement of trademarks is not a very well-developed doctrine. It has come up in a few contexts, including cybersquatting liability and liability for landlords whose tenants sell counterfeit goods.

===Defenses to infringement===

====Genericide====

Many trademarks have been invalidated because they have lapsed from fanciful, arbitrary, suggestive or descriptive status to generic status. '''Genericide''' is a defense to trademark infringement: the use of a trademark that has become generic over time is not infringement. Examples include:

* aspirin; ''Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co.'', 272 F. 505 (S.D.N.Y. 1921).
* cellophane; ''DuPont Cellophane Co. v. Waxed Products Co.'', 85 F.2d 75 (2d Cir. 1936).
* shredded wheat; ''Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.'', 305 U.S. 111 (1938).
* thermos; ''King-Seeley Thermos Co. v. Aladdin Industries'', 321 F.2d 577 (2d Cir. 1973).
* Murphy bed; ''Murphy Bed Door Co. v. Interior Sleep Systems'', 874 F.2d 95 (2d Cir. 1989).
* Pilates; ''Pilates, Inc. v. Current Concepts, Inc.'', 120 F.Supp 2d 286 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).
* Pilates Studio; ''Pilates Method Alliance, Inc. v. Pilates, Inc.'', Opposition No. 91154584 (TTAB 2004).

Many companies, notably Xerox, Jeep and Lego, have active campaigns to avoid the genericide of their trademarks: they insist that their marks be used as adjectives, not nouns, so as to avoid their trademarks becoming common terms for copying machines and interlocking blocks respectively. Xerox regularly engages in corrective advertising. In the late 1980's, Jeep after being acquired by Chrysler convinced the automobile industry to adopt the term SUV for 4-wheel drive vehicles, and has since engaged in a continuous advertising that &quot;There is only one Jeep&quot; to reinforce the JEEP brand.

====Functionality====

The original ''Trade-Mark Cases'' invalidated Congress's first trademark statute on the grounds that trademark authority could not be based on the patent and copyright clause of the Constitution. There is still a sharp divide between patent and trademark law, illustrated by the doctrine that functional marks cannot be protected as trademarks. As stated above, '''functionality''' is most common when defending claims for infringement of trade dress and product configuration.

====Abandonment====

Under the Lanham Act as amended in 1994, a mark is deemed &quot;abandoned&quot; &quot;when its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use.&quot; Nonuse for three consecutive years is considered prima facie evidence of abandonment. 15 U.S.C. § 1127.

Some famous trademarks have been preserved through minor use by other companies. US Airways, for instance, preserves the trademarks of well-known but defunct Piedmont Airlines and PSA by operating some of its commuter flights under those names, and Chevron maintains the Standard Oil trademark by operating a small number of its filling stations under the Standard name.

====Non-trademark use====

Use of a mark is only infringing if the mark is used ''as'' a mark. For instance, mentioning a mark in an article is generally not infringement. Using a mark as the basis of a song is generally not infringement (&quot;Barbie Girl&quot;; see ''Mattel v. MCA Records'', 296 F.3d 894 (9th Cir. 2002)). Likewise, mentioning a mark in the title of a work, as in ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree'' or ''The Devil Wears Prada'', is generally not infringement. However, using ''Star Trek'' in the title of an unauthorized book about Star Trek would likely infringe the mark, since the mark is used on other books authorized by its holder.

===Remedies===
====Injunction====

Injunctions are a standard remedy for trademark infringement. The usual injunction is to halt production and sale of infringing goods and services.

In some cases, the court might also award an injunction for '''corrective advertising''', which forces the defendant to pay for an amount of advertising necessary to reverse the damage to the plaintiff's mark.

====Damages====

Under 15 U.S.C. § 1117, a court may award damages for trademark infringement reflecting some combination of the following factors.  Trebled damages are available for damage amounts derived from defendant's profits, actual damages plaintiff sustained, and cost of bringing the lawsuit.

:# defendant's profits (15 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1))
:# damages sustained by the plaintiff (15 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(2))
:# cost of bringing the lawsuit (may include attorney's fees) (15 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(3))
:# prejudgment interest (15 U.S.C. § 1117(b))
:# statutory damages (15 U.S.C. § 1117(d)

'''Defendant's Profits:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Plaintiff is required only to prove the amount of defendant's sales. The burden then shifts to defendant to prove up its costs and expenses to be deducted from the total sales amount to give the amount of defendant's profits. If the court finds the recovery amount based on defendant's profits is inadequate or excessive, the court may enter judgment a sum it believes is just in light of the &quot;circumstances of the case.&quot; 

'''Damages Sustained by Plaintiff:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Plaintiff must prove up its actual damages. The court bases its determination of damages on the actual amount of damages plaintiff's has proven or any sum above that amount but not more than  three times above the actual damage amount.

'''Costs of the Action:'''&lt;br /&gt;
The court may also award reasonable attorney's fees to the winning party but only in exceptional circumstances.

'''Trebling of Damages:'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the case of a counterfeit mark or designation (as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 1116(d)), non-statutory damage amounts are to be trebled unless the court finds &quot;extenuating circumstances.&quot;  Note that Congress intended for courts to award trebled damages in most cases.&lt;br /&gt;
Specifically, the Lanham Act says where plaintiff has proven any violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)(a) or 36 U.S.C. § 220506, a court shall enter judgment for three times such profits or damages, whichever amount is greater, together with a reasonable attorney’s fee, if the violation consists of:
:(1) intentionally using a mark or designation, knowing such mark or designation is a counterfeit mark (as defined in 15 U.S.C. §1116 (d))), in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services; or&lt;br /&gt;
:(2) providing goods or services necessary to the commission of a violation specified in paragraph (1), with the intent that the recipient of the goods or services would put the goods or services to use in committing the violation.

'''Prejudgment Interest:'''&lt;br /&gt;
The court may also award interest beginning from the date of the service of the plaintiff’s pleadings setting forth the claim for such entry of judgment and ending on the date such entry is made, or for such shorter time as the court considers appropriate. (''See'' 26 U.S.C. §6621 (a)(2) for method of determining interest rate).

'''Statutory Damages:'''&lt;br /&gt;
15 U.S.C. § 1117(c) provides a plaintiff the option of electing (before final judgment) recovery of statutory damages for any such use.  The statutory damages are based upon the &quot;willfulness&quot; of the counterfeit:

:(1) if the court finds the use of the counterfeit mark was not willful, the statutory damages will be not less than $1,000 or more than $200,000 per counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court considers just; or&lt;br /&gt;
:(2) if the court finds that the use of the counterfeit mark was willful, not more than $2,000,000 per counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court considers just.

This statutory amount is in lieu of and not in addition to profits or actual damages; and is not subject to trebling under 15 U.S.C. § 1117(b).

====Criminal counterfeiting====

Knowingly copying another's trademark is considered '''counterfeiting''' and is a felony punishable by fines and imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 2320.

      <comment>Changed the description for the behavior of cron when /etc/cron.allow and  /etc/cron.deny files are missing on different Linux distributions</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Scheduling with Cron ==

Cron is an automated scheduler in UNIX/Linux Systems, which executes jobs (scripts) which are scheduled by system, root, or individual users. Information of schedules is contained within crontab file (which is different and individual for each user). When the cron daemon starts, it searches for crontab files, which are user named account names in /var/cron/tabs directory. Cron daemon wakes up every minute and checks for any jobs scheduled to be executed in crontab files. Every time cron daemon wakes up to check crontab files, it also checks /etc/crontab file for any modifications in time stamp of the file, which it keeps track and records. When you simply 'touch' /etc/crontab file, cron daemon will catch it and ultimately stop executing scheduled jobs in crontabs - this is how to stop cron daemon. In order to have cron daemon continue running scheduled jobs, you need to restart it (bounce it).

===Controlling access with 'cron.allow' and 'cron.deny'===

* Access will be granted when user is listed in file /etc/cron.allow
* Otherwise, access will be denied if username  is found in /etc/cron.deny
* If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to have access, or all users will have access. 
:* For standard Debian systems (including Ubuntu), all users will be granted access when neither file exists.
:* For Fedora systems, only the super user will be granted access when neither file exists. 



===Four places to submit a cron job===

# The /var/spool/cron/username file: each individual user (indicated by username) controls his or her own separate file
# The /etc/crontab file: This is '''system crontab''' file. Only root has permission to modify this file.
# The /etc/cron.d directory. Each file placed in this directory has the same format as the /etc/crontab. Only root has permission to create or modify the files in this directory. 
# The /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly, and /etc/cron.monthly directories
#* Each file in these directories is a shell script that runs at the times specified in the /etc/crontab file (by default at one minute after the hour, at 4:02 a.m. every day, Sunday at 4:22 a.m., and 4:42 a.m. on the first day of the month, respectively )
#* Only root has permission to create or modify the files in these directories.

=== Crontab format ===

 * * * * * command to be executed
 - - - - -
 | | | | |
 | | | | ----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)
 | | | ------- month (1 - 12)
 | | --------- day of month (1 - 31)
 | ----------- hour (0 - 23)
  ------------ min (0 - 59)

# An asterisk (*) in any field indicates all possible values for that field.
# Lists of values, ranges of values, and increments can be used. Examples:
#* Lists: Days could be represented as the '''list Mon,Wed,Fri'''.
#* Range: Hours can be specified as '''range 9–5'''
#* Increment: '''0–31/3in''' the third field to represent every third day of the month
#* '''*/5''' denotes every five minutes
# Any variable can be specified to fine−tune the environment in which the job will run. Example:
#* '''MAILTO=otheruser''' variable enable to send email to user other than the one who submitted the cron job

=== Commands ===

# '''crontab −l''' : list the current contents of your own personal crontab file
# '''crontab −r''' : remove all crontab entries
# '''crontab −e''' : edit crontab file
# '''ps -e |grep cron''' : Displays status of cron daemon if running.
# '''/usr/sbin/cron &amp;''' : Starts users cron daemon.

Formal or informal, '''Spinach Artichoke Dip''' is a great appetizer at any party. It is quick and easy taking very little time to prepare. The dip may be served with a variety or crackers, breads, or chips. 

==Ingredients==
* 16 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (450g) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
* 3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (180ml) heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (use half milk, if desired) 
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (80ml) grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] 
*1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (60ml) [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic powder]] 
* 16 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (450g) frozen cut leaf [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]], thawed and well drained 
* 1 can quartered [[Cookbook:artichoke|artichoke hearts]], rinsed and well drained 
*2/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (160ml) shredded [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack cheese]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] prepared (240ml) [[Cookbook:salsa|salsa]] 
* Crackers or [[Cookbook:Tortilla Chip|tortilla chips]], for serving

==Procedure==
#In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, process the cream cheese, cream, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder until smooth and creamy. Add the spinach and process until thoroughly mixed. Add the artichokes and process just until coarsely chopped.
#Turn the mixture into a 3 1/2-quart electric slow cooker; smooth the top.
#Cover and cook on the high heat setting 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours, until hot in the center. Sprinkle the top evenly with the Jack cheese and spoon the salsa in a ring around the inside edges of the slow cooker. Cover and continue heating on high 15 minutes longer, or until the cheese is melted. Reduce the heat to the low setting and serve warm with crackers or tortilla chips for dipping. Refrigerate any leftovers.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Best served if hot but may also be served chilled. 
*If served in a bread bowl, pieces may be broken off and used as dipping tools for further enjoyment. 
*Other condiments that go great with this dip include sides of salsa, guacamole, or sour cream. 
*This is great appetizer for vegetarians and vegan cream cheese may be substituted if need be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General idea ==

Assume you have observed absolute frequencies &lt;math&gt;o_i&lt;/math&gt; and expected absolute frequencies &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; under the Null hypothesis of your test then it holds

&lt;math&gt;V = \sum_i \frac{(o_i-e_i)^2}{e_i} \approx \chi^2_f .&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; might denote a simple index running from &lt;math&gt;1,...,I&lt;/math&gt; or even a multiindex &lt;math&gt;(i_1,...,i_p)&lt;/math&gt; running from &lt;math&gt;(1,...,1)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(I_1,...,I_p)&lt;/math&gt;.

The test statistics &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is approximately &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; distributed, if

# for all absolute expected frequencies &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;e_i \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; and
# for at least 80% of the absolute expected frequencies &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;e_i \geq 5&lt;/math&gt;.

Note: In different books you might find different approximation conditions, please feel free to add further ones.

The degrees of freedom can be computed by the numbers of absolute observed frequencies which can be chosen freely. We know that the sum of absolute expected frequencies is

&lt;math&gt; \sum_i o_i = n &lt;/math&gt;

which means that the maximum number of degrees of freedom is &lt;math&gt;I-1&lt;/math&gt;. We might have to subtract from the number of degrees of freedom the number of parameters we need to estimate from the sample, since this implies further relationships between the observed frequencies.

== Derivation of the distribution of the test statistic ==

Following  Boero, Smith and Wallis (2002) we need knowledge about multivariate statistics to understand the derivation.

The random variable &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; describing the absolute observed frequencies &lt;math&gt;(o_1, ..., o_k)&lt;/math&gt; in a sample has a multinomial distribution &lt;math&gt;O \sim M(n;p_1,...,p_k)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the number of observations in the sample, &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; the unknown true probabilities. With certain approximation conditions (central limit theorem) it holds that

&lt;math&gt;O \sim M(n; p_1,...,p_k) \approx N_k(\mu;\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt; 

with &lt;math&gt;N_k&lt;/math&gt; the multivariate &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; dimensional normal distribution, &lt;math&gt;\mu = (np_1,...,np_k)&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma = (\sigma_{ij})_{i,j=1,...,k} = \begin{cases} -np_ip_j, &amp; \mbox{if } i\neq j \\  np_i(1-p_i) &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.

The covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; has only rank &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;p_1+...+p_k = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

If we considered the generalized inverse &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^-&lt;/math&gt; then it holds that

&lt;math&gt;(O-\mu)^T \Sigma^- (O-\mu) = \sum_i \frac{(o_i-e_i)^2}{e_i} \sim \chi^2_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

distributed (for a proof see Pringle and Rayner, 1971).

Since the multinomial distribution is approximately multivariate normal distributed, the term is

&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \frac{(o_i-e_i)^2}{e_i} \approx \chi^2_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

distributed. If further relations between the observed probabilities are there then the rank of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; will decrease further.

A common situation is that parameters on which the expected probabilities depend needs to be estimated from the observed data. As said above, usually is stated that the degrees of freedom for the chi square distribution is &lt;math&gt;k-1-r&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the number of estimated parameters.
In case of parameter estimation with the maximum-likelihood method this is only true if the estimator is efficient (Chernoff and Lehmann, 1954). In general it holds that degrees of freedom are somewhere between &lt;math&gt;k-1-r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==

The most famous examples will be handled in detail at further sections: &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test for independence, &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test for homogeneity and &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test for distributions.

The &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test can be used to generate &quot;quick and dirty&quot; test, e.g.

&lt;math&gt;H_0:&lt;/math&gt; The random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is symmetrically distributed versus

&lt;math&gt;H_1:&lt;/math&gt; the random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not symmetrically distributed.

We know that in case of a symmetrical distribution the arithmetic mean &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; and median should be nearly the same. So a simple way to test this hypothesis would be to count how many observations  are less than the mean (&lt;math&gt;n_-&lt;/math&gt;)and how many observations are larger than the arithmetic mean (&lt;math&gt;n_+&lt;/math&gt;). If mean and median are the same than 50% of the observation should smaller than the mean and 50% should be larger than the mean. It holds

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{(n_- - n/2)^2}{n/2} + \frac{(n_+ - n/2)^2}{n/2} \approx \chi^2_1&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Connecting to the Internet using BSNL Prepaid GPRS''' ==

BSNL has come out with the option of GPRS over the prepaid connection. But difficulties were faced by many to connect to the Internet. Even the settings that were downloaded from BSNL site failed the phone to connect to the Internet. The following is the actual working settings on a [http://www.nokiausa.com/A4410642 Nokia3650] phone so that it would connect through GPRS.
 
Steps to be followed to browse Internet over GPRS using a BSNL South India Prepaid Connection: 
 
* Message “GPRSPRE” (SMS) &lt;''without quotes''&gt; to 53733. 
* After sometime (may take up to 48 hrs) a message would be received saying that GPRS has been activated for the phone.  
* Press the menu button of your phone; go to Tools '''-&gt;''' Settings '''-&gt;''' Connection '''-&gt;''' Access Points.  
* Click on Options. Select New Access Point '''-&gt;''' Use Default Settings 
* Give the following values: 
   - Connection Name               -&gt; '''BSNL GPRS''' 
   - Data Bearer                   -&gt; '''GPRS''' 
   - Access Point Name             -&gt; '''bsnlnet''' 
   - User Name                     -&gt; 
   - Prompt Password               -&gt; '''No''' 
   - Password                      -&gt; 
   - Authentication                -&gt; '''Normal''' 
   - Gateway IP Address            -&gt; 
   - Homepage                      -&gt; '''http://bsnl.co.in/''' 
   - Connection Security           -&gt; '''On''' 
   - Session Mode                  -&gt; '''Permanent''' 
 
* Press Back.  A new access point is created now.
* Now using the default browser that came with the phone or with the custom browser installed later Internet could be accessed over the GPRS.
* If the default browser is used, open it and click on Options, go to settings and select the default access point as BSNL GPRS. Modify the remaining options if needed.  
* Now this browser can be used to browse the Internet.
 
----

'''Using a phone with in built modem one can browse the Internet using their computer.''' 
 
The following steps should be followed to use a computer and connect to the Internet using the BSNL GPRS connection on the phone. The following settings are for a Windows XP computer.
 
* Connect the bluetooth dongle to a USB port of the computer and install any drivers if required. 
* Pair your phone and the PC over bluetooth. (For exact details of how to pair the PC and your phone, please refer to the user manual that came with the PC and the phone.) 
* Once pairing is over the computer would recognize the phone as a modem over bluetooth connection also and will start the services required for it over a particular COM port.  
* Now Open System Properties (Win Key + Pause/Break is the easiest way to do this). Click on Hardware tab and then on Device Manager button.  
* This will open a window where all the hardware on your PC is listed. Click the ‘+’ to expand the Modems and select the “Standard Modem over Bluetooth link #''x''”  
* Double click on it. The Properties window for this modem willopen. Click on Advanced tab. In the Extra Initialization Commands textbox fill – '''“AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;bsnlsouth&quot;”''' &lt;''without quotes''&gt;.Without this string the computer will not connect to the Internet, but it will throw a PPP Link error. Please note that the “bsnlsouth” mentioned above is the access point name in your GPRS connection settings of your phone. (or gprssouth.cellone.in)
* Click OK, close the Device Manager. * Go to Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections. Click File '''-&gt;''' New Connection. In the New Connection Wizard that comes up, follow these steps:  
 
   - Click Next  
   - Select Connect to the Internet and click Next. 
   - Select Set up my connection manually and click Next. 
   - Select Connect using a dial-up modem and click Next.  
   - Enter “BSNL GPRS” in the ISP Name text box and click Next.  
   - Enter “*99#” in the Phone Number text box and click Next.  
   - Chose the connection availability as per your discretion and click Next.  
   - Leave User name and password blank. Uncheck the check boxes if needed and click Next.  
   - Tick the check box to have a short cut on your desktop and click Finish.  
 
* Switch on the bluetooth radio of the phone. 
* Now double click on this connection’s icon and click on dial. It will dial and connect the computer to the internet!!! 
 
These procedures and settings help the BSNL subscriber to connect to the Internet over GPRS using a BSNL South India prepaid account. The above procedure works equally well for Post paid subscribers and for connection to PC/ laptop with USB cable.Specially useful for heavy users who have subscribed to BSNL post paid unlimited GPRS usage.

I used the same settings on a '''Sony Ericsson Z550i''' and it gets connected without much difficulty.

Also works with '''Samsung E-840''' using the access point 'gprssouth.cellone.in'.

Another easier way of setting up your mobile for '''BSNL GPRS''' connection is given below

1. Goto the link http://ap.bsnl.co.in/mmsgprs/Portal%20link%20documents/Manual-Device+Settings.doc

2. Click on the  Automatic GPRS/WAP/MMS Mobile Handset configuration  

3. Enter your phone number

4. You will get a sms on the mobile with a password

5. Now enter the system message on the web

6. Select the phone and model

Settings will be made automatically done on your mobile.

this works fine with GPRS south

This works with BSNL New Anant Plan in Kerala Sount with Nokia N70

      <comment>/* 1.  Using the Subtraction module */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two ways to generate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subtraction_angiography Digital Subtraction Angiography] images with OsiriX (v1.7), once an XA image sequence has been stored in its database (an example sequence can be found at http://homepage.mac.com/kieranmaher/Anonymized.zip):

== 1.  Using the Subtraction module ==

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:subModInactive.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

Display the image sequence in the 2D Viewer and activate the subtraction module (use Format | Customize Toolbar... if this module is not displayed in the toolbar of the 2D Viewer).

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=0 cellspacing=8 cellpadding=2
| [[Image:maskImage.jpg]]
| [[Image:liveImageB.jpg]]
|- 
| &lt;center&gt;Mask Image (1)&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;Live Image (9)&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The image number used for the mask image is displayed – the first image of the sequence is the default mask.  Browse through the sequence and adjust the WL/WW as needed.  Click on the ‘current’ button to select another mask image.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=0 cellspacing=8 cellpadding=2
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:subModMask1.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:subModMask9.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:maskMinusLive.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:liveMinusMask.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| &lt;center&gt;(1) - (9)&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;(9) - (1)&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Use the up/down arrows to shift the relative position of the mask and live images in single pixel increments in both horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) dimensions, if needed.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:pixelShift.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

Note than finer shifts than whole pixels are a feature yet to be implemented in OsiriX.

Use the Thick Slab module, in the MinIP mode to (effectively) integrate a number of live images so as to generate a vascular trace.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=0 cellspacing=8 cellpadding=2
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:thickSlabMod.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:vascTrace.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| &lt;center&gt;(1) - (5+6+7+.....+15)&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Notes:

Pixel values displayed for subtracted images refer (incorrectly) to unsubtracted images – presumably because the subtracted image is generated in display memory only.

A plug-in is available from http://homepage.mac.com/kieranmaher/LogTransformplugin.zip (for purists) to take the Log Transform of an image sequence prior to running the subtraction process.

== 2. Using the Fusion module ==

Open an image sequence in the 2D Viewer, and open the same sequence for a second time, so that the image sequence is displayed in two separate windows.  Turn off synchronization by selecting 2D Viewer | Stack Syncronize | Off.  Drag the icon of one window and drop it onto the image in the second window to call up the fusion functions and click the Subtraction button:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:fusionMod.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

Pixel values displayed for subtracted images refer (correctly) to subtracted images with this option, although pixel shifting is not available.  The Thick Slab module can be used to (effectively) integrate both mask images (before subtraction) and live images (before and following subtraction) so as to improve image SNR and to generate a vascular trace.

Afrikaans uses the same alphabet as English. Notable differences include ''diacritics'' on the letters (like ê), while certain letters, such as c, exist but are infrequently used.

You'll soon find Afrikaans has a very ''phonetic'' (phonemic) spelling; that is, unlike in English, French or even its parent language Dutch, Afrikaans words are almost always spelled the way they sound.

This chart uses IPA - the international phonetic alphabet to show the exact Afrikaans pronunciation. You can read more about it [[wikipedia:IPA|here]]. The English words are only an approximate guide. Afrikaans pronunciation can be a bit tricky for English speakers because the language has quite a few sounds that don't exist in English. The best way to learn is to listen to native Afrikaans speakers. You can listen to streaming Afrikaans radio [http://www.rsg.co.za/ here] and hear Afrikaans sound recordings at [http://www.openlanguages.net/afrikaans/ this site].

:*Background information to the [[Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine]] wikibook:

::I was introduced to this subject in 1972 by Jim Malone, PhD while studying at the [[w:Dublin Institute of Technology|College of Technology, Kevin St]], Dublin, Ireland.  I was doing the third year of a diploma course in applied physics. Some years later I was lecturing in the same course and adapted Jim's notes for my lectures.  I was also working at this time as a physicist in nuclear medicine at the nearby [http://indigo.ie/~arhc/arhchx.html Meath Hospital].  I further adapted the notes for lectures within a physics degree course at Kevin Street. And later still for a medical radiations degree course at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMIT RMIT], Melbourne, Australia.  As such the notes benefitted considerably on the basis of questions from students as well as comments from clinical and academic colleagues.  By 1997 I was using the notes on a visiting professorship at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_University Kuwait University].  Whilst there I was inspired out of boredom to formalise the notes into a textbook.  I subsequently developed the book into a set of webpages which lay dormant on a cd-rom for five years or more. Until mid-2006, when I uploaded them to wikibooks.....

:*Background information to the [[Basic Physics of Digital Radiography]] wikibook:

::I started giving lectures in this subject area whilst working in Melbourne in the late 1980s, although I'd been doing research using digital radiography for some years previously, and these lectures still continue to this day (2013) at the [http://www.unimelb.edu.au University of Melbourne].  The concept for the wikibook arose out of this experience as an attempt to reformulate and modernise topic presentation.  The material draws heavily from Heggie JCP, Liddell NA &amp; Maher KP, 2001, [http://homepage.mac.com/kieranmaher/ait/ Applied Imaging Technology], 4th Edition and from discussions with colleagues at [http://www.svhm.org.au St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne].  The wikibook could be extended to include mammography and MDCT physics in the future.

I'm interested in learning about the WikiBooks phenomenon by engaging with it and exploring its potential for the continuous evolution of instructional resources.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dashes''' (&quot;—&quot;, &quot;–&quot;) are used to mark an interruption within a sentence, while '''hyphens''' (&quot;-&quot;) are used to join two parts of a compound word, or to indicate that a word has been split at the end of a line. A dash is approximately as long as two hyphens.

==Dash==
Dashes are minus-shaped characters used to mark an interruption within a sentence.  They are used in much the same way as parentheses.

There are two kinds of dashes: ''em dashes'' looking like &quot;—&quot;, and shorter ''en dashes'' looking like &quot;–&quot;. It is usual to either use em dashes without spacing, or en dashes with spacing, but not em dashes with spacing, as shown in the following two examples:
: Example: Three unlikely companions—a canary, an eagle, and a parrot—flew by my window in an odd flock.
: Example: Three unlikely companions – a canary, an eagle, and a parrot – flew by my window in an odd flock.

In most word processors, there is a keystroke combination that will produce an em-dash:
* Windows: em-dash: Alt-0151.
* Windows: en-dash: Alt-0150.
* Mac: em-dash: shift-option-dash.

==Hyphen==
A hyphen joins two parts of a compound word. 
: Example: governor-elect, twenty-five, half-baked.  
Hyphens can also be used to make compound words more understandable.  Consider these words:
* Man-eating dog
* Man eating dog

The first example describes a particular type of dog (man-eating). The second example, alas, suggests that a man is eating a dog.

Or consider the case of the flaming-red pickup truck, as opposed to its more alarming cousin, the flaming red pickup truck.

In general, if the first of two adjectives is describing the second, and not the noun following, you should use a hyphen: deep-blue water, good-tasting hamburger, happy-faced child.

==Width Difference==
The em dash is roughly as wide as two hyphens. In the days of typewriters, it was actually written as two hyphens. An en dash is shorter than em dash while wider than a hyphen.
&lt;noinclude&gt;
==Bibliography==

* [[W:Hyphen]]

Drug use is a threat to physical and mental health. Many of the drugs discussed here are addictive and being caught using or selling them often carries severe criminal penalties. 

==Drug==
[[File:Pyschoactive_Drugs.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A collection of psychoactive drugs.]]
So what exactly is a &quot;drug&quot;? 

A drug is any substance - natural or artificial - that changes the normal functioning of the body. This can vary between minor drugs that relieve common illness and symptoms, to drugs that block all sensory input to the brain.

So what separates your typical cough medicine from powerful deliriants? You may be surprised to know that it could be nothing! Several over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are just as powerful as even the most dangerous drugs if taken in the wrong dosages. 

For example, several OTC pain relievers contain [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Codeine|codeine]], which is an opiate. It is usually synthesized from [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Morphine|morphine]], as is [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Heroin|heroin]]. Common cough and cold relief medications contain [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/DXM|Dextromethorphan hydrobromide]], more commonly known as DXM. At recommended doses it reduces the cough reflex. At higher does it is an extremely powerful psychoactive. 

[[Wikipedia:Acetaminophen|Acetaminophen]], on the other hand, is one of the most widely used medications for pain and fever relief. Also known as Paracetamol and APAP, it is sold under the brand names Tylenol and Anacin . It's commonly mixed with DXM and [[/Codeine|Codeine]] in several OTC medications. Even acetaminophen, which is frequently seen as harmless by the public can be very dangerous in high doses.  Similarly, some preparations of DXM, such as [[Wikipedia:Coricidin|Coricidin Cold and Cough]], contain [[Wikipedia:chlorphenamine maleate|chlorphenamine maleate]], an [[Wikipedia:antihistamine|antihistamine]], which is deadly in high doses. Abuse of the cough syrup Coricidin have lead to overdose and death.  No drug, including OTC medicines, should be take beyond the recommended dosages without first consulting a physician.

These examples, starts to show how even abuse of common or &quot;every day&quot; drugs which many people believe to be harmless can cause serious damage. There is no &quot;safe&quot; drug, just because it is legal and sold without a prescription doesn't mean it can be taken at any dosage safely.

== Don't ==

Drugs such as those touched on in this book may be readily available and, in some social settings, accepted or encouraged.There is always the option to say no.  Many drugs are highly addictive and because of this, experimenting ''frequently'' leads to addiction. Drug use ''is'' generally considered dangerous and in many cases leads to death or severe harm. 

The safest way to not shoot yourself in the head, is to neither load the gun nor pull the trigger. The safest way to avoid bad repercussions from drug use is to not to use drugs. 

One always has a choice.

==Uncontrolled==
Many illicit drugs are illegal, and as such there is no government regulations controlling purity.  Drugs purchased on the black market (or &quot;the steet&quot;) may be mixed (or &quot;cut&quot;) with other substances to increase profits. These substances themselves can often be deadly.  Therefore, it is not possible to know what you are taking when you illegally purchase drugs.  Often people feel comfortable with &quot;their dealer&quot; and trust them to sell &quot;clean&quot; drugs.  Unfortunately a dealer's source can and often does change.  The large number of hands that an illegal substance may pass though make it impossible to know precisely what is being sold.

== What to do when things get out of hand ==
Here are some steps that can be taken if you or someone else has taken drugs and you feel that things have &quot;gotten out of hand&quot;.  You can:
* Contact your local poison control center.
* Go the nearest hospital emergency room.
* Get an ambulance.

In any of the above cases it is very important to tell the medical profession ''exactly what you are taking''.  People are often injured more seriously by not being upfront with their doctors because they wish to avoid other consequences. 

If possible take a sample of what you were using with you to the hospital. Also make sure they know what quantity and what method you used to ingest the substance. 

Before you use any drugs, always think of the consequences to yourself, your family and friends and society. Why should society pay for your emergency treatments in hospital?

==Why do people use drugs?==

Most people use drugs simply for the enjoyment of the high. Because of this they open themselves to fall victim to addiction.

==Drug Classifications==
All psychoactive drugs fall into three classes: [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Hallucinogens|Hallucinogens]], [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Stimulants|Stimulants]], or [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Depressants|Depressants]]. Some drugs fall into only one class, while others fall into a combination of classes. There is a debated fourth class of drugs called Anti-Psychotics. 

'''Entheogen''' is a fairly modern term, referring to a psychoactive substance used for religious purposes. Substances that fall under this category: [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Marijuana|cannabis]], tobacco, psilocybin mushrooms, [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Salvia|salvia divinorum]], ayahuasca, and many others.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">An idiom is a sort of template or generic method of expressing an
idea.  In the same way that idioms in a human language make life
easier for the both speaker and listener good idioms in computer
programming make life easier for the programmer.  Naturally what is
idiomatic in one language might not be in another.

It is not necessary that there exist a physical template, an idiom can
exist in your head and be so familiar that when faced with a problem
that can be solved by application of an idiom you begin to type the
code almost without noticing what you are doing.

Another word often used for ideas like this is ''pattern''.  However
the word ''pattern'' has become so formalised and so strongly
associated with object orientation that I feel the more generic word
idiom is better also it is the word generally associated with the
first major example that I will show.

An idiom can be language specific, library specific, domain specific,
or any combination of the three.  For instance if you are writing a
program that deals with lists of things you might borrow some of the
list processing idioms of Lisp even though Visual Basic Classic has no
native list processing functions at all.  By creating functions that
manipulate lists rather than inlining the code to do it you will make
your code more meaningful to someone reading it.

It is a commonplace that programmers feel ever so slightly godlike
because they are in total control of their programs.  I think that
programmers would be better off emulating Shakespeare instead: when
the English language of his day wasn't up to saying what he wanted he
had no hesitation in extending both its stylistic range and its
vocabulary.

==Resource Acquisition Is Initialization - RAII==

The name of this idiom makes it sound like a very complicated idea but in fact it is very simple and fits Visual Basic Classic very well.  This idiom is a solution to problems such as setting and clearing busy flags, controlling access to files, setting the mouse icon and so on.

The basic idea is to use the constructor of an object to obtain or query a lock on some resource and to use the destructor to release that lock.  In a language like Visual Basic which has deterministic finalization this produces very succinct code. 

Let's take the mouse as an example.  

===Example: Mouse Busy Icon===

It is very common in Windows programs to set the mouse icon to indicate that the program is busy and the the user must wait.  A problem arises when you have lots of different pieces of code that can take a long time and lots of different code paths that invoke them.  If the caller doesn't know that the process will be time consuming it won't know that the icon must be changed so we put code in the long running routine to change the mouse pointer.  This works fine until we try to combine two or more such routines: which one gets to cancel the busy icon?

One common solution is to regard the mouse as a resource and control access to it with a pair of routines that maintain a count.  One routine increments the count when the routine sets the busy icon and the other decrements and clears the icon when the count goes to zero.  This works well until an exception occurs, then a routine might exit early and the routine that decrements the counter won't be called.  Of course you could put another call in the error handler but that causes extra maintenance.

A better solution is to make use of the automatic termination events built in to Visual Basic.  The basic idea is still to use a count but instead of guarding the count with a routine you guard it with an object.

Each procedure that wants to indicate that it is time consuming by showing the mouse busy icon should wrap its code in a with statement that creates a cMouseBusy instance by calling NewMouseBusy.  When the routine finishes the cMouseBusy instance will be disposed of automatically, its Terminate event handler will be executed and the reference count will be reduced by one.

Because the program might have many forms open we must take account of the form when we set the busy icon because the MousePointer property belongs to a form not the application

So that we know which form's mouse pointer to change we must keep a separate count for each different client

====Exercises====
*Compile the example code and check that it works.  
*Extend the code to allow for more than one type of busy icon.  For instance an icon with a pointer that indicates that the user interface is still live and one without a pointer that indicates that the user must wait.
*Create a test program to demonstrate the new features.

====Code====

Just add this line as the first line of every function that should show the busy cursor:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim oMousebusy As cMouseBusy: Set oMousebusy = NewMouseBusy(Client)&lt;/source&gt;
  
or enclose the busy section in:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  with NewMouseBusy(Client)
    ...
  End With
&lt;/source&gt;

''Client'' is anything that has a mouseicon property

=====cMouseBusy=====
Objects of this class acquire the mouse busy status when created by a constructor called ''NewMouseBusy''.  They release it when they are terminated.  

The busy status is simply a counter that is incremented each time a new cMouseBusy object is created and decremented when such an object is destroyed.  If the counter increments to one then the mouse busy icon is set on the client object, when the counter decrements to zero the normal icon is set.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  VERSION 1.0 CLASS
  BEGIN
    MultiUse = -1  'True
    Persistable = 0  'NotPersistable
    DataBindingBehavior = 0  'vbNone
    DataSourceBehavior  = 0  'vbNone
    MTSTransactionMode  = 0  'NotAnMTSObject
  END
  Attribute VB_Name = &quot;cMouseBusy&quot;
  Attribute VB_GlobalNameSpace = False
  Attribute VB_Creatable = True
  Attribute VB_PredeclaredId = False
  Attribute VB_Exposed = False
 
  Option Explicit
  
  Private moClient As Object  
  
  Friend Sub Initialize(ByRef roClient As Object)
    Set moClient = roClient
    If IncrefCount(roClient) = 1 Then
      roClient.MousePointer = vbHourglass
    End If
  End Sub
   
  Private Sub Class_Terminate()
    If DecRefCount(moClient) = 0 Then
      moClient.MousePointer = vbDefault
    End If
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

=====modMouseBusy.bas=====
This module provide the constructor for cMouseBusy.  This gives us the ability to pass arguments to the object when it is created.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Attribute VB_Name = &quot;modMouseBusy&quot;
  
  Option Explicit
  
  Private moReferenceCount As Dictionary
  
  Public Function NewMouseBusy(ByRef roClient As Object) As cMouseBusy
    If moReferenceCount is Nothing then
      Set moReferenceCount = New Dictionary
    End If
    Set NewMouseBusy = New cMouseBusy
    NewMouseBusy.Initialize roClient
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember that Visual Basic is single threaded and that the User Interface will not update until all code stops executing unless you call DoEvents so do this to make sure that the change to the mouse icon is visible.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    DoEvents
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

This function increments the count for the given object and returns the new count.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Function IncrefCount(ByRef roClient As Object) As Long
    Dim lRefCount As Long
    IncrefCount = 1 + moReferenceCount(roClient)
    moReferenceCount(roClient) = IncrefCount
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

This function decrements the count and returns the new count.  Note that if the count goes to zero then the entry is removed from the list; this must be done because the ''keys'' are objects and they will not terminate if we do not release the reference.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Function DecRefCount(ByRef roClient As Object) As Long
    DecRefCount = moReferenceCount(roClient) - 1
    If DecRefCount = 0 Then
      moReferenceCount.Remove roClient
    Else
      moReferenceCount(roClient) = DecRefCount
    End If
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;
  
=====frmTestMouseBusy=====

==U.S. Environmental Protection Agency==

===Drinking Water State Revolving Fund===
&quot;The DWSRF was established by the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Amendments to provide (low or no-interest) loans to publicly and privately owned public water systems for infrastructure improvements needed to protect public health and ensure compliance with the SDWA.  As of June 30, 2002, the DWSRF had provided 2,500 loans for $5.1 billion to water systems for eligible projects.&quot; [http://www.epa.gov/owm/water-efficiency/wef_final.pdf]
Eligible projects include:
*enhancing water system management and performance
*preventing contamination problems
*source water protection
*water efficiency activities and programs

===Clean Water State Revolving Fund===
The CWSRF program was established under the U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1987 to provide loans for point source (§212), nonpoint source (§319), and estuary (§320) projects.  As of June 30, 2002, the CWSRF program had privided 12,500 loans for $42.4 billion for water quality protection projects. The CWSRF funds approximately $3 to $4 billion in water quality projects each year. Water efficiency and reuse activities and projects may be considered point sources if they are developed as a component of a (publicly owned) wastewater treatment works (§212 project).&quot; [http://www.epa.gov/owm/water-efficiency/wef_final.pdf]

===Restoration Credits===
Under the U.S. Clean Water Act provisions for wetlands protection (section 404), owners of proposed projects which will cause unavoidable wetlands damage must provide for mitigation of that damage as a condition for receiving a 404b permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  One mitigation method is for the project owner to restore sufficient ecological function to compensate for the unavoidable damage to be caused by his proposed project.  Or the project owner may buy &quot;ecological credits&quot; from someone else who has already restored ecological function, such as by removing an existing dam, as described in news article about removal of the Lowell Dam on Little River in North Carolina.[http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/383318.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== DSP Templates ==

I have created the following 2 templates for use in this book: 

*[[Template:DSP Page]]
*[[Template:DSP Stub]]
*[[:Category:Digital Signal Processing]]
*[[:Category:DSP Stubs]]

--{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:56, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

== Follow-Up Books ==

I have already started outlines for 2 books that will be logical follow-ups to this book:

*[[User:Whiteknight/Digital Media Processing]]
*[[User:Whiteknight/VLSI System Design]]

Questions and comments about these outlines are welcome and encouraged. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:52, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

== RFC: Making examples matlab/octave compatible ==

It looks like the examples in this wikibook thus far are done using a proprietary syntax, ie. &quot;X[n] = [ 4 5 6&amp; 7 8 9 ]&quot;.  What I'd like to propose is replacing these samples with expressions that will run correctly in Octave/Matlab, using the LCD common syntax of these two tools.

On one hand, this is somewhat restrictive, in the sense that all vectors must be enumerated by strictly positive integers.  On the other hand, I think it will increase the utility of this book to enable the student to &quot;follow along&quot; in matlab or octave.

Thoughts?

:DSP mathematical theory requires the use of data sets with negative positions, so we can't use pure matlab syntax. Also, DSP texts use a very similar syntax to the one i've used so far, except the &quot;&amp;&quot; symbol is usually replaced by an arrow, a dot, or an underscore (depending on the text). I think that we need to keep things as close to an accepted textbook standard notation as possible I do plan on adding Matlab/Octave sample code and examples in most chapters though, so we can work on creating and adding them. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:11, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

* I think maybe it should be the other way round. Merge the otehr one into this Wikibook as the other one seems only a subsection. --[[User:Kyriakos|Kyriakos]] 19:02, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

==Not much==
I understand there is not much here right now. I am currently trying to outline this book and am gathering research. It may seem slow at times but i promise more will come. If anyone wants to add to this that would be greatly appreciated.

== Duplication ==

Under the Wikibook Mythology, there is already a section on Egyptian Mythology.  Maybe these should be integrated?

Chapter 2.  [[Georgia Water/Policy|Water Policy]]
:2.3. [[Georgia Water/Laws|Georgia Water Law]] __FORCETOC__

===Summary of the Act===
&quot;This legislation created the Coastal Marshlands Protection Committee which grants, denies, revokes, and amends all permits provided for by the Act and details the process to handle grievances of a party in relation to any rules or regulations adopted by the Board of Natural Resources. 
The Act outlines the powers and duties of the DNR and the Board of Natural Resources as to coastal marshlands.&lt;br/&gt;
Marshlands may not be filled, drained, dredged, or otherwise altered without a permit from the committee. The Act indicates the process for obtaining a permit and explains the points reviewed by the committee prior to issuing or denying a permit. It authorizes the inspection of marshlands by officers and conservation rangers of the DNR to verify compliance with the rules, regulations, and permits, and enforcement in the case of noncompliance.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf]

Chapter 2.  [[Georgia Water/Policy|Water Policy]]
:2.3. [[Georgia Water/Laws|Georgia Water Law]] __FORCETOC__

===Summary of the Act===
&quot;This Georgia law provides significant property tax reductions to qualified landowners who conserve
environmentally sensitive lands for ten years. Environmentally sensitive areas include habitats with
endangered species, wetlands, floodplains, stream corridors, undeveloped barrier islands, steep slopes and wildlife habitat larger than ten acres.

This program can build landowner awareness of and appreciation for conservation needs and incentives, which in turn can lead to a commitment to more permanent land conservation (e.g., a conservation easement in perpetuity). Unfortunately, rules promulgated under this law make it difficult for landowners to have their lands designated and assessed as “environmentally sensitive lands”. The rules should be modified to make it easier for landowners to take advantage of the tax incentives afforded to those who are willing to protect such lands for ten years.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf]

Chapter 2.  [[Georgia Water/Policy|Water Policy]]
:2.3. [[Georgia Water/Laws|Georgia Water Law]] __FORCETOC__

===Summary of the Act===
&quot;The Georgia Environmental Policy Act (GEPA) requires that all State agencies and activities prepare an Environmental Impact Report as part of the decision-making process for all activities that may have an impact on the environment.  Alternatives to the proposed project or activity must be considered as part of the report. &lt;br/&gt;
The Act states that any proposed governmental action which may “significantly adversely
affect the quality of the environment”, including the state’s air, water, land, plants, and animals, requires an Environmental Effects Report. As outlined in the Act, an Environmental Effects Report describes the environmental impact and any adverse environmental effects of the action, alternative actions, mitigation measures proposed to avoid or minimize impact, and other effects of the action. &lt;br/&gt;
The government agency responsible for the action authors the report and provides it to the director of the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) in the DNR. A notice that the report has been prepared is to be published in the legal organ of each county in which the action is to take place, which may lead to a public hearing regarding the action. The Act requires the director of the EPD to issue guidelines to assist government agencies in the preparation of environmental effects reports.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Definition of this section is available at [http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/pdf/AQA-5511-6511-W-SP-07.PDF], page 16.  This text will be expanded shortly 

==What is Hardware and Software?==

At the highest level, a computer system is composed of hardware and software components. Hardware consists of all the physical devices. All the programs (code) that run on the computer system form the software part. The hardware and software are tightly coupled and they complement each other. Hardware is useless without software and software requires hardware to carry out computations.

==Different Types of Software==

===System Software===

System software is anything that is an essential part of the computer system; or in other words a software is the artificial intelligence which dictate the rules of operation within its systems.

====Operating system software====

An operating system is the low-level software that acts as an interface between the user and the hardware. The OS provides a &quot;virtual machine&quot; where the user is safe to execute their applications and program code.

[[Image:os_stack.png]]

Common operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux derivatives.

====Utility programs====

Utility software helps manage and tune the computer hardware, OS or application software. It usually performs a single task or small range of tasks. Good examples include:

*'''Archive''': utilities take a file or collection of files and output a single file or stream.
*'''Disk defragmenters''': reorganise file structure so that all file fragments are contiguous on the disk. Modern filesystems, such as those used by Mac OS X and GNU/Linux, do not need explicit defragmenting.
*'''Encryption''': utilities use a specific algorithm to encrypt/decrypt the contents of a file or stream using an encryption key.
*'''Virus scanners''': scan for malicious computer program code in files and storage devices.

====Library programs====

A collection of subprograms used to develop software and hardware compatibilities. Libraries contain &quot;helper&quot; code and data for other programs to use in a modular way; they are usually not executable and exist purely to provide services to other programs.

====Compilers, assemblers and interpreters====

A '''compiler''' is a computer program that '''translates code''' written in a high level language to a lower level language, e.g. assembly language or machine language. The most common reason for translating source code is to create an executable program (converting from a high level language into machine language).

''Advantages of using a compiler''
* Source code cannot be stolen/copied
* Tends to be faster than interpreting source code
* Produces an executable file, and therefore the program can be run without need of the source code
''Disadvantages of using a compiler''
* Object code needs to be produced before a final executable file
* The source code must be 100% correct for the executable file to be produced

An '''assembler''' translates assembly language into machine language. Assembly language consists of mnemonics for machine opcodes so assemblers perform a ''1:1 translation'' from mnemonic to a direct instruction. Conversely, one instruction in a high level language will translate to one or more instructions at machine level.

''Advantages of using an assembler''
* Assembly code is often very efficient (and therefore fast) because it is a low level language
* It is fairly easy to understand due to the use of English-like mnemonics
''Disadvantages of using an assembler''
* Lots of assembly code is needed to do relatively simple tasks, and complex programs require lots of programming time
* Assembly tends to be optimised for the hardware it's designed for, meaning it is often incompatible with different hardware

An '''interpreter''' program executes other programs directly, running through program code and executing it ''line-by-line''. This is slower than running compiled code but it can take less time to interpret program code than to compile in then run it &amp;mdash; this is very useful when prototyping and testing code.

''Advantages of using an interpreter''
* Useful for prototyping software and testing basic program logic
* Easy to find errors in source code because the translation will stop when an error is encountered
''Disadvantages of using an interpreter''
* Source code is required for the program to be executed
* Interpreters are generally slower than compiled programs due to the per-line translation method

===Application Software===

Application software is designed for the user to allow them to solve a task.  These may include Word processors, spreadsheets and database packages.  (NOTE: do not use brand names in the exam, unless asked to, it is better to use the type of software instead, e.g. &lt;s&gt;Excel&lt;/s&gt; Spreadsheet package)

====General purpose====

General purpose application software is designed to solve a wide range of tasks, for example:

*Word processor
*Spreadsheet package
*Presentation package

====Special purpose====

Special purpose application software performs a specific task or set of tasks, for example:

*Media player
*Accounting
*Vector drawing

====Bespoke====

Bespoke application software has been written specifically for the needs of a user or company. It is &quot;tailored&quot; to their exact requirements. Some examples might be:

*Air traffic control
*Factory robot
*Tourist kiosk
*etc.

==Introduction to how computers store data==

Computers can't understand colours, words and sounds like humans. Even if you use digital cameras and voice recognition, a computer has to translate these inputs into the only language it does understand, that is the language of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;. This is called &lt;b&gt;binary&lt;/b&gt;.

Binary is different from our own decimal numbering system. Instead of having 10 different values like decimals: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 (this can also be referred to as denary or base 10), binary (or base 2) only has 2 values: &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. A &lt;b&gt;bi&lt;/b&gt;nary digi&lt;b&gt;t&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;bit&lt;/b&gt; as it is more commonly known, can either be set to 0 (off) or 1 (on).

By combining many bits together, we create what are known as &quot;bit patterns&quot;. Inside the computer, all data is transmitted and manipulated in bit patterns. Apart from individual bits, the two other most important bit patterns are:

*'''Byte''': This is a quantity of bits that computers tend to use as the smallest sequence of bits to store data, e.g. 10110110. This is &lt;b&gt;eight bits wide&lt;/b&gt; on most types of computer, but can vary on more obscure machines.
*'''Word''': This is sometimes called a 'manipulation unit'. It is a set length of bits that varies between types of computers, but is usually 32 or 64 bits long in most modern computers.

*'''Program''': A program is a set of instructions that are processed by the computer to do a specific operation. This could be anything, from adding two numbers and outputting the result, to the complex instructions in the program of a computer game.
*'''Data''': Data (the singular is datum) are raw numbers that have no meaning by themselves. Data could be stored about parts of a video clip, an image, a sound, text or a number.

==What parts make up a computer?==

These components are found in virtually every computer:

*'''Processor''': The 'brain' of the computer. It executes instructions sequentially and processes data. The processor is usually divided up into the '''Arithmetic and Logic Unit''' ('''ALU'''), and the '''Control Unit'''. The ALU carries out logical evaluations (for example comparisons), and mathematical expressions (such as addition and subtraction). The Control Unit carries out the functions that organise instructions and co-ordinates all the data and instructions, similar to traffic lights controlling the flow of cars. The processor is also called a '''Central Processing Unit''' ('''CPU''').
*'''Clock''': A piece of hardware used to keep the processor (and some other integrated circuits) in time by generating an oscillating signal with a steady frequency.
*'''Main Memory''': This is temporary storage that stores data currently being worked on. It is accessible to the processor directly, without going through any input/output channels. It does, however, need to connect to the processor via the data, address, and control buses. When power is lost, all data stored in main memory is lost, therefore meaning it is '''volatile'''. Main memory is also known as '''Immediate Access Storage''' ('''IAS''').
*'''Address Bus''': A collection of wires between the processor and main memory used to communicate the physical location (address) of data in main memory.
*'''Data Bus''': A collection of wires between the processor and all internal devices, and is used to send and receive both data and instructions.
*'''Control Bus''': A collection of wires between the processor and devices used to send commands and get status signals from the devices. For example, it could show whether the computer was reading or writing to memory.
*'''I/O Port''': An interface and physical connector that allows peripherals, such as a keyboard, mouse or monitor, to communicate with the 'heart' of the computer system &amp;mdash; the processor and main memory. I/O stands for '''Input/Output'''.
*'''Secondary Storage''': This is computer memory that is not directly accessible to the processor but uses the I/O channels. It is for storing data not in active use and preserves data even without power, meaning it is '''non-volatile'''.

&lt;b&gt;diagram is needed here&lt;/b&gt;

==How to run programs==

All programs are stored as a series of bit patterns ready to be executed (or &quot;run&quot;) by the processor. All modern computer systems use the &quot;stored program concept&quot;. This is where program instructions are loaded into main memory for the '''fetch and execute cycle'''.

The stored program concept basically states that both instructions and data to be operated on can be loaded into memory at the same time, as opposed to having the instructions pre-programmed into the hardware, and then passing this hardware the data to be processed.

The fetch-execute cycle is the retrieval of data and instructions from main memory through the data bus, and then executing the data or instructions using the processor.

An example of these ideas working together would be when a computer system was required to add two numbers together. A program that adds numbers is loaded into main memory. Then each instruction of the program is fetched and executed one after the other by the processor, along with any data required (in this case the numbers to be added). The processor stores the current instruction in a special register and uses its Arithmetic and Logic Unit to process the instruction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What country did they live in?==
[[Image:Celts in Europe.png|This map shows areas once inhabited by ancient Celts (light green), the areas that remain Celtic-speaking today (dark green), and the boundaries of the six commonly-recognized 'Celtic nations' (intermediate green).|right|thumb|200px]]
In around 400 BC, the Celts ranged from [[Wikijunior:Europe/United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Ireland|Ireland]] all the way across Europe to northern Turkey.  Today, Celtic people live in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and Northern Ireland in the [[Wikijunior:Europe/United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], Brittany in [[Wikijunior:Europe/France|France]], the Isle of Man and the [[Wikijunior:Europe/Ireland|Republic of Ireland]].  Other Celtic people live in countries where their ancestors moved to.

==What did they look like?==
Men wore a loose fitting tunic down to the knees and trousers called Bracae. Women wore long, loose fitting dresses. They made their clothes from linen woven from the flax that Celtic farmers grew. They were very concerned about their appearance and used dye from berries to colour their clothes. Both men and women also wore great cloaks when travelling, women used a decorative brooch to fasten their cloak at the neck. These cloaks were very heavy and often used as sleeping bags for the men when they were away hunting. The Celts used lime to bleach their hair, preferring light hair and both men and women wore their hair long.

==What did their buildings look like?==
Most Iron Age Celts in Britain lived in '''roundhouses'''; circular houses of wood or stone with thatched straw roofs shaped like a cone. Most roundhouses were made up of wooden posts, with the walls made out of &quot;'''''wattle and daub.'''''&quot; Wattle and daub consists of wooden sticks (wattles), covered with a mixed mud and clay plaster (daub). 

In Scotland most roundhouses were built of stone rather than wood, yet retained the cone-shaped thatched roof. This type of roundhouse is called the '''Atlantic roundhouse.'''

Celtic houses in mainland Europe were rectangular.

The Celts in Ireland built many forts and settlements, the most popular design was the ringfort. Inside a ringfort wooden, circular houses were built using wattle and daub.

Celts also built fortified defensive structures, which can still be seen today, especially in the highlands and isles of Scotland, as well as Ireland.

==What did they eat?==
Celts ate like most other Europeans, subsisting mostly on grains supplemented by meats, fruits, and vegetables. Exactly what they ate varied by area, and Celts grew local crops. Scottish highlanders were famous for supposedly subsisting almost entirely on '''oats''', though this was not entirely true. However, oats remain the favorite grain of Scotland, and Scottish cuisine is full of them. '''Potatoes''' serve this role in Ireland, although they were not introduced until after Columbus reached the New World.

The Celts in Ireland farmed the land and reared cattle and sheep. In the spring, they would get milk, butter and cheese from the cattle, killing them later in the year for meat. Cattle were not only a means of food for Celts, the Celts wealth was measured in the amount of cattle they owned. One ancient Irish tale tells of Queen Maedhb (May-ev) and another rival king, and their battle over the Táin Bó Chuaille (a bull). This doesn't just show the importance of cattle in Celtic society, but also the fact that they thoroughly accepted the idea of women as leaders, unlike other societies of that time.

The most famous example of food of any Celtic people is probably the Scottish '''haggis'''. Many people aren't quite clear on what a haggis is, and one survey conducted in the United States found that over half of the people they surveyed thought that the haggis was a small rodent native to Scotland.  In reality, a haggis usually consists of a sheep's 'pluck' (heart, liver, windpipe and lungs), minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, which is traditionally boiled in the animal's stomach for about an hour.

==What did they wear?==
[[Image:Torque gaulois en bronze.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A bronze torque, a neckband worn by Gauls.]][[Image:Gaul_warrior_Mondragon_2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Relief statue of a Gaulish woman. She wears loose robes, an armband (probably bronze), and carries a sword.]] Celts took a great interest in their clothes when they could afford to do so. Many more modern Celts had colourful designs woven into their clothes called '''tartan''', still shown in Scottish Kilts and Trews today. 

Celts also had a great fondness for jewellery, and both men and women wore quite a bit, when they could afford it.

Finally, many warrior Celts wore their weapons (swords, more often than not) as normal attire. This became very complex during the late Middle Ages with Scottish highlanders, who were sometimes seen with a broadsword at their waist, dirk (long knife) on their belt, one or more pistols also attached to their belt, a long hunting rifle, and a small dagger in their sock, called a Sgian Dubh (Gaelic for ''&quot;Black Dagger&quot;'').

==What did their writing look like?==
Celts didn't have a very high opinion of the written word. Instead, they recorded their history and culture in an '''oral tradition;''' that is, they recorded their past by telling stories. Early examples of Gaelic Celtic writing have been recovered in Europe, based on the Phoenician alphabet.

In Ireland, a different alphabet was used, primarily in Gaelic Celtic languages like [[Wikijunior:Languages/Irish|Irish]], [[Wikijunior:Languages/Manx Gaelic|Manx]], and Scottish Gaelic. This alphabet was called '''Ogham''', sometimes referred to as the ''&quot;Celtic Tree Alphabet.&quot;'' It developed as a way for Irish monks to write in stone.  

[[Image:Ogham airenach.png|frame|center|An example of Ogham from the Book of Ballymote.]]

After Christianity was spread throughout the Gaelic world, Ogham fell into disuse, in favor of the Latin alphabet (largely because Christian writings were all in the Latin alphabet).

==What did they believe?==
Celts were '''polytheists;''' they believed in many gods and goddesses (deities). Unlike many other civilisations, different groups of Celts worshipped various deities, although there were some patterns. '''Beira''' was the name that Celts gave to Mother Earth, and some of them believed her to be the mother of all their deities. 

Most Celts believed in an afterlife, we know this because archaeologists have found many grave goods within their burial tombs (Dolmens, Cairns). Many, though not all, Celts worshipped in sacred groves.

==Are some of them famous even today?==
[[Image:Boudiccastatue.jpg|A statue of Boudicca near Westminster Pier, London|right|thumb|200px]][[Image:Robert Burns.jpg|Robert Burns|left|thumb|150px]]
Yes! Today, the British Isles (along with Ireland) are probably regarded to be Celtic more than any other area in the world. No one is quite sure who lived there before them, and they were certainly well-established by the time the Romans came there in AD 43. After 20 years of Roman rule, the chieftain of the Icenii tribe, Prasutagus, died. Though by tradition, his wife '''Boudicca''' would have assumed leadership of the tribe, the Romans took Icenii land, brutally humiliating Boudicca and her two daughters. This enraged the Icenii people, and Boudicca raised an army to fight the Romans and liberate Britain. She gained support of many other Celtic tribes, and almost succeeded in toppling the Roman Empire in Britain. She is revered as a national hero in Britain.

The world-renowned Scottish poet, Robert Burns, was a Celt.

Many famous Celts are alive today. The famous Scottish actor, Sean Connery, is proud of his Celtic heritage.

==What is left of them today?==
Celts are alive and thriving today! Much of the population of Europe are seen as descendants of the Celts, and the nations of Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany and Isle of Man are considered to be made up of primarily Celtic peoples. As well, the Celtic '''diaspora''', the descendants of Celts around the world, is vast, being spread greatly through the British Empire. In particular, Novia Scotia, Canada, is a hotbed of modern Gaelic Celtic culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is this the proper place to talk about the book? I thought this would be interesting... 
http://www.ctmu.net/  .  I think the real problem is the myth of 'seperate objectness' and the myth of 'outside' vs 'inside'.  Objects are not ultimately seperate, only distinct, i.e. reality is one surface with distinctions we perceive as 'seperate'.  So there is no &quot;outside&quot; or &quot;inside&quot;, it is continuous, with distinctions that appear discrete and disconnected.  Like bumps or waves in a unified surface.  But the are actually all connected in the ultimate sense.  That would do away with any 'problems', each piece of reality = self-excited circuit/self-detecting-self-processing-ring, and it would explain evolution as well.--Zack Bran

:Hi, I have just had a look at your paper.  I found it interesting. I think you clearly identified the regression arguments with the postulate of the universe as a 3D manifold with an independent time dimension. A few thoughts phrased as questions: 
:Can we have states without topologies and are space and time simply terms for degrees of freedom in a topology? Given that the world is at least 3+1D, are you sure that mind is not an nD state at one end of your information channels rather than the transforms/languages that relate the ends? Have you considered the duality inherent in nD projective geometry (cf Steiner)?  Have you considered manifolds of signature +++-, +++--, ++++- etc where the negative signature gives a projective geometry? Recursion is a feature of successions of 3D classical manifolds (where time is separate) but is recursion always necessary in higher dimensional manifolds with mixed signatures (in complex manifolds events can be projected and at a point)?

::: (Zack again) I am not the author of CTMU.   I have been working on my own ideas and I disagree with some point's of the CTMU.  Specifically that our reality is 'self-contained', in that the universe of change is the 'real' universe, i.e. that is all there is. I've been studying fractals and fractal recursion, and my current conjecture is that our universe is a fractal subdivision of a larger entity.  I have been developing my own ideas but the are far from complete, you are welcome to contact me though, if interested.  Just leave a message here, and tell me where I can leave a post in your talkback (post a link to where you want me to post so then you can just click and post).  Part of the new ideas I've been working on is partially related to the half-finished (i.e. that's my judgment) ideas of G. Spencer http://www.lawsofform.org/  there is also a discussion group here http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lawsofform/ and also http://www.boundarymath.org/

I have a problem with the characterization of the hard problem given at the beginning: ''&quot;A state is an arrangement of things in space over a period of time.&quot;'' This is implying that a ''conscious state'' is an arrangement of things in space over a period of time. That is, this ''assumes'' physicalism.

In fact, the way this page is written, it betrays a misunderstanding of the Hard Problem, and what the Hard Problem side calls &quot;consciousness.&quot;

The Dennett crowd projects that when we (Lanier, Chalmers, myself) talk about consciousness, that we are talking about something that can make decisions, and performs processing with some sort of ontology living within the mind. Soft (like a fuzzy neural network,) or delineated (like a computer,) however.

This is not actually our claim. We are saying that there is a visage, an appearance, an experience, and that it is this visage that is epiphenomenal. Unnecessary. That there is an explanatory gap ''there.''

It needs to be perfectly clear: Any functional explanation ''isn't it.'' If you say, &quot;Oh, but the brain rotates shapes ''this way,''&quot; or if you say, &quot;But associative reasoning works ''this way,''&quot; then you haven't done a thing to explain the epiphenomenal experience. You may as well be talking about the motions of cars outside of the body.

Not only &quot;''conscious experience is not required for a nineteenth century model of the behaviour of organisms''&quot;, but conscious experience is not even required for a ''20th'' or ''21st'' century model of the behavior of the organism.

The brain is just as external to the experience as the motions of cars. And the experience is just as epiphenomenal to the mechanics of the thinking in the brain, as it is epiphenomenal to the motion of the car. The car could move just perfectly fine without anybody experiencing it, and the brain could think, talk, and reason (even about consciousness) just fine, without experience.

It's entirely within bounds to say: &quot;consciousness comes from the motions of the brain.&quot; But the epiphenomalism of consciousness is still there, regardless, hangling off as an unnecessary dangler. Poke a body with a brain in it, and it should go &quot;ouch,&quot; the brain should start working out strategies for telling a person to bug off, a face should scoul, and the reputation systems held in mind should update and the chemistry and neural patterning of emotions should turn to anger, ''but'' -- there's no need for anything to actually experience it.

Dennett argued in &quot;The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies,&quot; saying (paraphrased,) &quot;Could you ''really'' believe in zombies? I find that hard to believe.&quot; But this is an argument from incredulity. The explanatory gap is still present, Dennett's incredulity does not close it.

[[User:LionKimbro|LionKimbro]]

Excellent point and a regrettable oversight in the text. I have put in a paragraph in the module pointing to your discussion as a temporary measure. That said, I do not see 'the hard problem' as Chalmers' possession, it also refers to observations by a large number of philosophers from Leibniz gazing at a brain made from cogs and wheels onwards. But the lack of mention of the impetus behind property dualism is a black hole in the current book! [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:12, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

I have extended the introduction to explain the objective of the section in more depth.  The objective of the section is to show that information about the physical state of the world is incomplete and subject to revision. That there are deep, unresolved problems in physics, especially about the nature of time, space and matter that impinge directly on the problem of consciousness. Some arguments for dualism, such as epiphenomenalism, are actually aspects of problems in science that are awaiting explanation. I am also going to add the missing section on dualism in the previous module. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:59, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The Java Programming Wikibook is a shared effort in amassing a comprehensive guide of the complete Java platform &amp;mdash; from programming advice and tutorials for the desktop computer to programming on mobile phones. The information presented in this book has been conceptualised with the combined efforts of various [[Java Programming/Authors &amp; Contributors|contributors]], and anonymous editors.

The primary purpose of this book is to teach the Java programming language to an audience of beginners, but its progressive layout of tutorials increasing in complexity, it can be just as helpful for intermediate and experienced programmers. Thus, this book is meant to be used as:
* a collection of tutorials building upon one another in a progressive manner;
* a guidebook for efficient programming with the Java programming language; and,
* a comprehensive manual resource for the advanced programmer.

This book is intended to be used in conjunction with various other online resources, such as:
* the [http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/overview-summary.html Java platform API documentation];
* the [http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/index.html official Java website]; and,
* active Java communities online, such as [http://home.java.net Java.net] and [http://www.javaranch.com JavaRanch], etc.

==Who should read this book?==
Every thing you would need to know to write computer programs would be explained in this book. By the time you finish reading, you will find yourself proficient enough to tackle just about anything in Java and programs written using it. This book serves as the first few stepping stones of many you would need to cross the unfriendly waters of computer programming. We have put a lot of emphasis in structuring this book in a way that lets you start programming from scratch, with Java as your preferred language of choice. This book is designed for you if any one of the following is true.

* You are relatively new to programming and have heard how easy it is to learn Java.
* You had some [[w:BASIC|BASIC]] or [[w:Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] in school, and have a grasp of basic programming and logic.
* You already know and have been introduced to programming in earlier versions of Java.
* You are an experienced developer and know how to program in other languages like [[w:C++|C++]], [[w:Visual Basic|Visual Basic]], [[w:Python (programming language)|Python]], [[w:Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], etc.
* You've heard that Java is great for web applications and web services programming.

Although this book is generally meant to be for programmers who are beginning to learn programming; it can be highly beneficial for intermediate and advanced programmers who may have missed out on some vital information. By the end of this book, you would be able to solve any complicated problem and tackle it using the best of your learned skills in Java. Once you finish, you are also encouraged to take upon ambitious programming projects of your own as you certainly would be able to do that as well.

This book assumes that the reader has no prior knowledge of programming in Java, or for that matter, any object-oriented programming language. The book makes it easier to understand development methodology as one reads through the book with practical examples and exercises at the end of each topic and module. Although, if you are a complete beginner, we would suggest that you move slowly through this book and practice each exercise at your pace.

== How to use this book ==

This book as a reference book of the Java language and its related technologies. Its goal is to give a complete picture of Java and its technologies.  While the book can be read from the beginning to end, it is also designed to have individual sections that can be read independently.  To help find information quickly, navigation boxes are given in the online version for access to individual topics.

This book is divided to sections. Pages are grouped together into section topics. To make this book expandable in the future via the addition of new sections, the sections navigation-wide are independent from each other. Each section can be considered as a mini book by itself. Pages that belong to the same topic can be navigated by the links on the right hand side.

== How can you participate ==
Content is constantly being updated and enhanced in this book as is the nature of wiki-based content. This book is therefore in a constant state of evolution. Any Wikibooks users can participate in helping this book to a better standard as both a reader, or a contributor.
===As a reader===

[[Organic Chemistry/Dienes/Conjugation|&lt;&lt; Conjugation ]] | [[Organic Chemistry/Aromatics|Next Chapter: Aromatics ]] 
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

=== Common Reactions of Conjugated Dienes ===
Conjugated dienes have enhanced stability as compared to molecules without conjugated double bonds due to resonance.  In general, this makes them slightly less reactive than other types of alkenes in general and dienes specifically.  However, many reactions proceed through high-energy cation or radical intermediates; in these cases the resonance stabilization of the intermediate allyl species makes conjugated dienes more reactive than non-conjugated dienes or simple alkenes.

== Hydrobromination: ==
Adds a Bromine and a Hydrogen to a conjugated Diene.

'''Example''':

&lt;code&gt;Butadiene + HBr--&gt; 3-bromobutene (Low Temperature) + 1-bromobut-2-ene (High Temperature) + 1-bromobutene (Not Observed)&lt;/code&gt;

'''Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control of Reaction''':
*At low temperature the reaction is under KINETIC CONTROL: the 3-bromobutene is formed faster because it has a lower transition state free energy, as the intermediate cation is more stable at the secondary carbon. 
*At high temperature the reaction is under THERMODYNAMIC CONTROL: the 3-bromobutene still forms more quickly, but the reaction has enough energy to reverse, and the more stable product (1-bromobut-2-ene) is formed.

== Diels-Alder Reaction ==
One of the most important of all diene reactions is the Diels-Alder Reaction, in which a conjugated diene reacts with an dienophile to form a cyclohexene.


'''Requirements''':
The diene must be able to access the s-cis conformation for the reaction to take place.


'''DIENEOPHILES''' - A species which likes to attack Dienes
 
- A Dienophile must contain a double or triple bond.  Typically, an electron withdrawing group is conjugated to the dienophile to make it electron-poor (nitriles, ketones, and esters are common electron withdrawing groups).  Because the reaction is highly stereospecific, the configuration of the dieneophile will determine the relative stereochemistry of the cyclohexene product.

The Diels-Alder reaction occurs most effectively with an electron-poor dieneophile and an electron-rich diene ('normal demand'). 'Inverse demand' Diels-Alder reactions can also be carried out, in which the dienophile is electron-rich and the diene electron-poor.

* Equation of Trajectory: &lt;math&gt;y = x \tan \theta - \frac {g x^2}{2 V^2 \cos ^2 \theta} &lt;/math&gt;

===Work, Energy and Power===
* Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE): &lt;math&gt;E_p = m g h\,&lt;/math&gt;
* Kinetic Energy (KE): &lt;math&gt; E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 &lt;/math&gt;
* Work done by a force: &lt;math&gt; W = F d\cos \alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;
* Power of a moving force: &lt;math&gt; P = Fv \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Collisions===
* Newton's Experimental Law: Separation speed &lt;math&gt; = e \times &lt;/math&gt; Approach speed
* It follows that the coefficient of restitution, &lt;math&gt;e =\frac{v_2-v_1}{u_1-u_2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Centripetal motion===
*Using &lt;math&gt;F=ma\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a=r\omega^2\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;, F=m\omega^2r\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{v^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;v=r\omega\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page uses information from the KDE Website. Please read the information there too. [http://www.kde.org kde.org]

== Installation the Easy Way ==

KDE comes in almost every version of Linux - the easiest way to install it is to select it as your desktop when you install Linux on your computer - you will normally be presented with a menu during installation where you can pick your desktop. Just pick KDE: easy! Some distros such as [[w:Kubuntu|Kubuntu]] ship with KDE out of the box.

How to install KDE after that will depend on which [[w:Linux distribution|Linux distribution]] you are using.

== KDE Packages ==
KDE is big, so it is split into several packages, which are listed below. KDE requires the three packages kdelibs, kdebase and aRts; and the rest are optional. However, you'll probably want most or all of these other packages because they contain useful applications. In fact, I recommend you install all of them.

==Installation==
If it is not included by default with your distro, your distro's package system may have KDE available in their repository. Check your distribution's documentation if in doubt.

=== Installing KDE on Debian and Ubuntu ===

KDE can be installed in [[w:Debian|Debian]] and [[w:Ubuntu (Linux distribution)|Ubuntu]] using [[w:apt-get|apt-get]]. For Ubuntu, this will change Ubuntu into [[w:Kubuntu|Kubuntu]]. Apt-get installs all the correct packages from the Internet or from your Debian CD - see the apt-get manual pages for details.
*Back up your data (not required, but suggested).
&lt;!--
* Quit your desktop. This is not always required, but this is a good idea - programs may start acting funny. You can normally quit your desktop by changing your runlevel. At the very least, close any applications which are running on the desktop.

I have NEVER heard of this happening.  It's just installing KDE, not running it.  I'll keep this here in case im wrong, but I'm not...
--&gt;
* Log in as root (super-user), or use sudo if you are in the sudoers list.
* Update your package information to the latest versions:
 apt-get update
* Debian users should install the kde [[w:metapackage|metapackage]] as well as the K Display Manager:
 apt-get install kde kdm
* Ubuntu users should install the kubuntu-desktop metapackage which includes KDE and the K Display Manager:
 apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
:Note: pay attention to any packages that are marked for removal before you continue. If you want to check, use the --dry-run option with this command.
&lt;!-- Removed: This is not an apt-get tutorial, just KDE installation --&gt;
* Now go to [[#Starting KDE|Starting KDE]]

=== Avoiding apt-get ===

* Synaptic can be used to control apt-get through a gui.  This can be easier if you plan to install more than KDE or prefer not to work with a terminal.

* It is also possible to download the .deb packages from the [http://packages.debian.org/stable/kde/kde Debian website] and install them using [[w:dpkg|dpkg]], in a method similar to the .rpm installation below. If you do this, you should make sure you have '''all''' the packages you need - including any dependencies you don't already have.  This method should only be used if you are unable to use apt-get.

== Installing KDE Using .RPM Files ==

If you use a version of Linux which uses .rpm to install programs, you can install KDM using rpm files.

* Download all the .rpm files you want, and save them into a new folder.
* Download and read the INSTALL and README files.
*Back up your data (not required, but suggested)
*Quit your desktop. This is not always required, but this is a good idea. You can normally quit your desktop by changing your runlevel.
*Log in as root (super-user).
* Use &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to enter the directory you saved the .rpm files to
* To install, use the command
 rpm -ivh *.rpm
* Now go to [[#Starting KDE|Starting KDE]]

== Installation from the Source Code ==

This type of installation is fairly tricky. You will need the correct version of Qt and some other libraries installed before you start. See the KDE website for details.

The [http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/Historic/Konstruct Konstruct] tool simplifies this by doing many of the tasks, such as downloading and properly extracting packages, configuring and building them.

== Starting KDE ==

If you are on a desktop or have [[w:xserver|xserver]] running already, quit it. To start KDE, type
 xinit /usr/bin/startkde
which will start kde on a new xserver. If this doesn't work, try
 startx

To start KDE each time (you probably want this) you'll need to edit your startup files. If you use KDM or XDM to log in, edit '''.xsession''', otherwise edit .xinitrc or .Xclients.
* Backup your current startup file.
* Remove the lines in the startup file which start up your previous desktop program
* Replace these with &lt;code&gt;startkde&lt;/code&gt; (if it can't find the X-Server, add &lt;code&gt;startx&lt;/code&gt; above &lt;code&gt;startkde&lt;/code&gt;).
* Restart your computer.

Guess you convinced me to. XD  I also haven't played for a while... not since I unlocked all the komas from the main game mode.  I still haven't gotten a few of the &quot;play for x number of battles&quot; ones. D:

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the Mechanics 4 module of the [[A-level Mathematics]] book. This module assumes that you are familiar with the [[../C1/]], [[../C2/]], [[../C3/]], [[../C4/]], [[../M1/]], [[../M2/]] and [[../M3/]] modules. Please post all questions to [[A-level Mathematics/Discussion]].

== Contents ==
# [[/Relative Motion]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/Centre of Mass (Second Level)/]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/Moment of Inertia/]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}

# [[/Simple Harmonic Motion (Second Level)/]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}

==Formulae==
By the end of this module you will be expected to have learnt the following formulae:

===Relative Velocity===
* &lt;math&gt;{}_P\!V_Q + {}_Q\!V_R = {}_P\!V_R&lt;/math&gt;
===Angular Motion===
For constant angular acceleration:
:* &lt;math&gt; \omega _1 = \omega _0 + \alpha t \,&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \theta = \omega _0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \theta = \frac{1}{2}(\omega _0 + \omega _1)t&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \omega _1^2 = \omega _0^2 + 2\alpha\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \theta = \omega _1 t - \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2&lt;/math&gt;
* Angular momentum: &lt;math&gt; I\omega\,&lt;/math&gt;
* Kinetic energy: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}I\omega ^2&lt;/math&gt;
* Equation of motion: &lt;math&gt; C = I \ddot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
* Work done by a constant couple: &lt;math&gt; W = C\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose of DNS==
 1. Resolve hostname into IP addresses (Forward lookup)
 2. Resolve IP address into hostname (Reverse lookup)
 3. Allow machines to be logically grouped by name 'domains'
 4. Provide email routing information

==Important Information==

 1. Domain names are separated by dots with topmost element on right.
 2. Each element could be 63 character long.
 3. The entire element could be 255 character long.
 4. letters, numbers or dashes may be used in an element.
 5. Hostname map to IP addresses in a '''many-to-many''' relationship
 6. Distributed management

==Zones and Domains==

 1. A domain is complete sub-tree of the hierarchical namespace
 2. A zone is a part of the domain managed by a particular server. 
    Subdomains are different than zones. 
    A zone may include all subdomains in a domain or may delegate authority for some subdomain as separate zones on other name servers.
    A zone represents the scope of administration for which one body is responsible

==Master/Slave  Primary/Secondary DNS/Name Servers==

 1. Master DNS server is also called Primary DNS Server
 2. Contains master copy of a data for a zone
 3. Slave DNS server is also called Secondary DNS server
 4. Slave provides backup to master server
 5. Slave maintain synchronization with his master server
 6. Both Master and Slave contain authoritative data.
 7. Slave can get its data from other slave server
 8. Ther is only one Master server per zone

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often the solution of statistical problems and/or methods involve the use of tools from numerical mathematics. An example might be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood Maximum-Likelihood estimation] of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\Theta}&lt;/math&gt;which involves the maximization of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood Likelihood function] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\Theta} = \max_\theta\,\, L(\theta | x_1, ..., x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

The maximization here requires the use of optimization routines. Other numerical methods and their application in statistics are described in this section.

'''Contents of this section:'''
* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Basic Linear Algebra and Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization|Basic Linear Algebra and Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization]] 
This section is dedicated to the ''Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization'' which occurs frequently in the solution of statistical problems. Additionally some results of algebra theory which are necessary to understand the ''Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization'' are provided. The ''Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization'' is an algorithm which generates from a set of linear dependent vectors a new set of linear independent vectors which span the same space. Computation based on linear independent vectors is simpler than computation based on linear dependent vectors.
* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Optimization|Unconstrained Optimization]] 
Numerical Optimization occurs in all kind of problem - a prominent example being the Maximum-Likelihood estimation as described above. Hence this section describes one important class of optimization algorithms, namely the so-called ''Gradient Methods''. After describing the theory and developing an intuition about the general procedure, three specific algorithms (the ''Method of Steepest Descent'', the ''Newtonian Method'', the class of ''Variable Metric Methods'') are described in more detail. Especially we provide an (graphical) evaluation of the performance of these three algorithms for specific criterion functions (the Himmelblau function and the Rosenbrock function). Furthermore we come back to Maximum-Likelihood estimation and give a concrete example how to tackle this problem with the methods developed in this section.
* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Quantile Regression|Quantile Regression]] 
In ''OLS'', one has the primary goal of determining the conditional mean of random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, given some explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;E[Y|x_i]&lt;/math&gt;. ''Quantile Regression'' goes beyond this and enables us to pose such a question at any quantile of the conditional distribution function. It thereby focuses on the interrelationship between a dependent variable and its explanatory variables for a given quantile.
* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Numerical Comparison of Statistical Software|Numerical Comparison of Statistical Software]] 
Statistical calculations require an extra accuracy and are open to some errors such as truncation or cancellation error etc. These errors occur due to binary representation and finite precision and may cause inaccurate results. In this work we are going to discuss the accuracy of the statistical software, different tests and methods available for measuring the accuracy and the comparison of different packages.

* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Numerics in Excel|Numerics in Excel]] 
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of MS Excel in terms of statistical procedures and to conclude whether the MS Excel should be used for (statistical) scientific purposes or not.  The evaluation is made for MS Excel versions 97, 2000, XP and 2003.

* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Random Number Generation|Random Number Generation]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Basically, all the sections found here can be also found in a linear algebra book. However, the Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization is used in statistical algorithm and in the solution of statistical problems. Therefore, we briefly jump into the linear algebra theory which is necessary to understand Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization.

The following subsections also contain examples. It is very important for further understanding that the concepts presented here are not only valid for typical vectors as tuple of real numbers, but also functions that can be considered vectors.

== Fields ==

=== Definition ===

A set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with two operations &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on its elements is called a ''field'' (or short &lt;math&gt;(R,+,*)&lt;/math&gt;), if the following conditions hold:

# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha+\beta \in R&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha+\beta = \beta+\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (commutativity)
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta,\gamma \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha+(\beta+\gamma) = (\alpha+\beta)+\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
# It exist a unique element &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, called ''zero'', such that for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha+0 = \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in R&lt;/math&gt; a unique element &lt;math&gt;-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, such that holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha+ (-\alpha) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*\beta \in R&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*\beta = \beta*\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (commutativity)
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta,\gamma \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*(\beta*\gamma) = (\alpha*\beta)*\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
# It exist a unique element &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, called ''one'', such that for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*1 = \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
# For all non-zero &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in R&lt;/math&gt; a unique element &lt;math&gt;\alpha^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, such that holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha * \alpha^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta,\gamma \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*(\beta+\gamma) = \alpha*\beta+\alpha*\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (distributivity)

The elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are also called ''scalars''.

=== Examples ===

It can easily be proven that real numbers with the well known addition and multiplication &lt;math&gt;(IR, +, *)&lt;/math&gt; are a field. The same holds for complex numbers with the addition and multiplication. Actually, there are not many more sets with two operations which fulfill all of these conditions. 

For statistics, only the real and complex numbers with the addition and multiplication are important.

== Vector spaces ==

=== Definition ===

A set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; with two operations &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on its elements is called a ''vector space over R'', if the following conditions hold: 

# For all &lt;math&gt;x, y\in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;x+y \in V&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;x+y = y+x&lt;/math&gt; (commutativity)
# For all &lt;math&gt;x, y, z \in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
# It exist a unique element &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{O}&lt;/math&gt;, called ''origin'', such that for all &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;x+\mathbb{O} = x&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt; exists a unique element &lt;math&gt;-v&lt;/math&gt;, such that holds &lt;math&gt;x+ (-x) = \mathbb{O}&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*x \in V&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*(\beta*x) = (\alpha*\beta)*x&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
# For all &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;1*x = x&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in R&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;x, y\in V&lt;/math&gt;holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*(x+y) = \alpha*x+\alpha*y&lt;/math&gt; (distributivity wrt. vector addition)
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt;holds &lt;math&gt;(\alpha+\beta)*x = \alpha*x+\beta*x&lt;/math&gt; (distributivity wrt. scalar addition)

Note that we used the same symbols &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; for different operations in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The elements of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are also called ''vectors''.

'''Examples:'''

# The set &lt;math&gt;IR^p&lt;/math&gt; with the real-valued vectors &lt;math&gt;(x_1,...,x_p)&lt;/math&gt; with elementwise addition &lt;math&gt;x+y=(x_1+y_1,...,x_p+y_p)&lt;/math&gt; and the elementwise multiplication &lt;math&gt;\alpha*x = (\alpha x_1,...,\alpha x_p)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space over &lt;math&gt;IR&lt;/math&gt;.
# The set of polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + ... + b_p x^p&lt;/math&gt;, with usual addition and multiplication is a vector space over &lt;math&gt;IR&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Linear combinations ===

A vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a linear combination of vectors &lt;math&gt;x_1,...x_n&lt;/math&gt;, if 

&lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i x_i&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \in R&lt;/math&gt;. 

'''Examples:'''

* &lt;math&gt;(1,2,3)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0),\,(0,1,0), \,(0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;(1,2,3)=1*(1,0,0)+2*(0,1,0)+3*(0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1+2*x+3*x^2&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;1+x+x^2,\, x+x^2,\, x^2&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;1+2*x+3*x^2=1*(1+x+x^2)+1*(x+x^2)+1*(x^2)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Basis of a vector space ===

A set of vectors &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''basis'' of the vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, if

1.   for each vector &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt; exist scalars &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n \in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x = \sum_i \alpha_i x_i&lt;/math&gt; 
2.   there is no subset of &lt;math&gt;\{ x_1, ..., x_n \}&lt;/math&gt; such that 1. is fulfilled.

Note, that a vector space can have several bases.

'''Examples:'''

* Each vector &lt;math&gt;(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3) \in IR^3&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1 * (1,0,0) + \alpha_2 *(0,1,0) + \alpha_3 * (0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore is &lt;math&gt;\{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) \}&lt;/math&gt; a basis of &lt;math&gt;IR^3&lt;/math&gt;.
* Each polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be written as linear combination of &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, x, x^2, ..., x^p\}&lt;/math&gt; and therefore forms a basis for this vector space.

Actually, for both examples we would have to prove condition 2., but it is clear that it holds.

=== Dimension of a vector space ===

A ''dimension'' of a vector space is the number of vectors which are necessary for a basis. A vector space has infinitely many number of basis, but the dimension is uniquely determined. Note that the vector space may have a dimension of infinity, e.g. consider the space of continuous functions.

'''Examples:'''

* The dimension of &lt;math&gt;IR^3&lt;/math&gt; is three, the dimension of &lt;math&gt;IR^p&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; . 

* The dimension of the polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;p+1&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Scalar products ===

A mapping &lt;math&gt;&lt;.,.&gt;: V\times V \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''scalar product'' if the following holds for all &lt;math&gt;x,x_1,x_2,y,y_1,y_2 \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \in R&lt;/math&gt; :

# &lt;math&gt;&lt;\alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2, y&gt; = \alpha_1 &lt;x_1,y&gt; + \alpha_2 &lt;x_2, y&gt;&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;&lt;x, \alpha_1 y_1 + \alpha_2 y_2&gt; = \alpha_1 &lt;x,y_1&gt; + \alpha_2 &lt;x, y_2&gt;&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt; = \overline{&lt;y,x&gt;}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha + \imath \beta} = \alpha - \imath \beta&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,x&gt; \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; &lt;x,x&gt;=0 \Leftrightarrow x = \mathbb{O}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Examples:'''

* The typical scalar product in &lt;math&gt;IR^p&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt; = \sum_i x_i y_i&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;&lt;f,g&gt; = \int_a^b f(x)*g(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar product on the vector space of polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Norm ===

A ''norm'' of a vector is a mapping &lt;math&gt;\|.\|: V \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;, if holds

# &lt;math&gt;\| x \| \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\| x \| =0 \Leftrightarrow x=\mathbb{O}&lt;/math&gt; (positive definiteness)
# &lt;math&gt;\| \alpha v \|= \mid \alpha \mid \| x \|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in R&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\| x+y \| \leq \| x \| + \| y \|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,y\in V&lt;/math&gt; (triangle inequality)

'''Examples:'''

* The &lt;math&gt;L_q&lt;/math&gt; norm of a vector in &lt;math&gt;IR^p&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_q = \sqrt[q]{\sum_{i=1}^p x_i^q}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Each scalar product generates a norm by &lt;math&gt;\|x\| = \sqrt{&lt;x,x&gt;}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \sqrt{\int_a^b f^2(x) dx}&lt;/math&gt; is a norm for the polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Orthogonality ===

Two vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are ''orthogonal'' to each other if &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt;=0&lt;/math&gt;. In &lt;math&gt;IR^p&lt;/math&gt; it holds that the cosine of the angle between two vectors can expressed as

&lt;math&gt;\cos(\angle(x,y)) = \frac{&lt;x,y&gt;}{\|x\|\|y\|}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the angle between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is ninety degree (orthogonal) then the cosine is zero and it follows that &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt;=0&lt;/math&gt;.

A set of vectors &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_p&lt;/math&gt; is called ''orthonormal'', if

&lt;math&gt;&lt;x_i,x_j&gt; = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \mbox{ if } i\neq j \\ 1 &amp; \mbox{ if } i=j \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.

If we consider a basis &lt;math&gt;e_1,..., e_p&lt;/math&gt; of a vector space then we would like to have a orthonormal basis. Why ?

Since we have a basis, each vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed by &lt;math&gt;x=\alpha_1 e_1 + ... +\alpha_p e_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=\beta_1 e_1 + ... +\beta_p e_p&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the scalar product of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; reduces to

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt;\ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= &lt;\alpha_1 e_1 + ... +\alpha_p e_p, \beta_1 e_1 + ... +\beta_p e_p&gt;\ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{i=1}^p \sum_{j=1}^p \alpha_i \beta_j &lt;e_i, e_j&gt;&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; =  \sum_{i=1}^p  \alpha_i \beta_i &lt;e_i, e_i&gt; &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = \alpha_1 \beta_1 + ... + \alpha_p \beta_p.\ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Consequently, the computation of a scalar product is reduced to simple multiplication and addition if the coefficients are known. 
Remember that for our polynomials we would have to solve an integral!

== Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization ==

=== Algorithm ===

The aim of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is to find for a set of vectors &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_p&lt;/math&gt; an equivalent set of ''orthonormal'' vectors &lt;math&gt;o_1,...,o_p&lt;/math&gt; such that any vector which can be expressed as linear combination of &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_p&lt;/math&gt; can also be expressed as linear  combination of &lt;math&gt;o_1,...,o_p&lt;/math&gt;:

1. Set &lt;math&gt;b_1 = x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;o_1 = b_1 / \|b_1\|&lt;/math&gt;

2. For each &lt;math&gt;i&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; set &lt;math&gt;b_i = x_i - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \frac{&lt;x_i, b_j&gt;}{&lt;b_j,b_j&gt;} b_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;o_i = b_i / \|b_i\|&lt;/math&gt;, in each step the vector &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is projected on &lt;math&gt;b_j&lt;/math&gt; and the result is subtracted from &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Vector2.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

=== Example ===

Consider the polynomials of degree two in the interval&lt;math&gt;[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt; with the scalar product &lt;math&gt;&lt;f,g&gt; = \int_{-1}^1 f(x) g(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; and the norm &lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \sqrt{&lt;f,f&gt;}&lt;/math&gt;. We know that &lt;math&gt;f_1(x)=1, f_2(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_3(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; are a basis for this vector space. Let us now construct an orthonormal basis:

Step 1a: &lt;math&gt;b_1(x) = f_1(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Step 1b: &lt;math&gt;o_1(x) = \frac{b_1(x)}{\|b_1(x)\|} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{&lt;b_1(x), b_1(x)&gt;}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\int_{-1}^1 1 dx}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2a: &lt;math&gt;b_2(x) = f_2(x) - \frac{&lt;f_2(x),b_1(x)&gt;}{&lt;b_1(x),b_1(x)&gt;} b_1(x) = x - \frac{\int_{-1}^1 x\ 1 dx}{2} 1 = x - \frac{0}{2} 1 = x&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2b: &lt;math&gt;o_2(x) = \frac{b_2(x)}{\|b_2(x)\|} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{&lt;b_2(x), b_2(x)&gt;}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{\int_{-1}^1 x^2 dx}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{2/3}} = x\sqrt{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3a: &lt;math&gt;b_3(x) = f_3(x) - \frac{&lt;f_3(x),b_1(x)&gt;}{&lt;b_1(x),b_1(x)&gt;} b_1(x) - \frac{&lt;f_3(x),b_2(x)&gt;}{&lt;b_2(x),b_2(x)&gt;} b_2(x) = x^2 - \frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^2 1\  dx}{2} 1 - \frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^2 x\ dx}{2/3} x = x^2 - \frac{2/3}{2} 1 - \frac{0}{2/3} x = x^2 - 1/3 &lt;/math&gt;

Step 3b: &lt;math&gt;o_3(x) = \frac{b_3(x)}{\|b_3(x)\|} = \frac{x^2-1/3}{\sqrt{&lt;b_3(x), b_3(x)&gt;}} = \frac{x^2-1/3}{\sqrt{\int_{-1}^1 (x^2-1/3)^2 dx}} = \frac{x^2-1/3}{\sqrt{\int_{-1}^1 x^4 - 2/3 x^2 + 1/9\ dx}} = \frac{x^2-1/3}{\sqrt{8/45}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{8}} (3x^2-1)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be proven that &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2}, x\sqrt{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{5}{8}} (3x^2-1)&lt;/math&gt; form a orthonormal basis with the above scalarproduct and norm.

=== Numerical instability ===

Consider the vectors &lt;math&gt;x_1 = (1,\epsilon, 0, 0), x_2 = (1,0,\epsilon,0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_3 = (1,0,0,\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is so small that computing &lt;math&gt;1+\epsilon = 1&lt;/math&gt; holds on a computer (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon). Let compute a orthonormal basis for this vectors in &lt;math&gt;IR^4&lt;/math&gt; with the standard scalar product &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt;=x_1y_1+x_2y_2+x_3y_3+x_4y_4&lt;/math&gt; and the norm &lt;math&gt;\|x\| = \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Step 1a. &lt;math&gt;b_1 = x_1 = (1,\epsilon,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 1b. &lt;math&gt;o_1 = \frac{b_1}{\|b_1\|} = \frac{b_1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon^2}} = b_1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1+\epsilon^2=1&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2a. &lt;math&gt;b_2 = x_2 - \frac{&lt;x_2,b_1&gt;}{&lt;b_1,b_1&gt;} b_1 = (1,0,\epsilon,0) - \frac{1}{1+\epsilon^2} (1,\epsilon,0,0) = (0,-\epsilon,\epsilon,0)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2b. &lt;math&gt;o_2 = \frac{b_2}{\|b_2\|} = \frac{b_2}{\sqrt{2\epsilon^2}} = (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},0)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3a. &lt;math&gt;b_3 = x_3 -  \frac{&lt;x_3,b_1&gt;}{&lt;b_1,b_1&gt;} b_1 - \frac{&lt;x_3,b_2&gt;}{&lt;b_2,b_2&gt;} b_2 = (1,0,0,\epsilon) - \frac{1}{1+\epsilon^2} (1,\epsilon,0,0) - \frac{0}{2\epsilon^2} (0,-\epsilon,\epsilon,0) = (0, -\epsilon, 0,\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3b. &lt;math&gt;o_3 = \frac{b_3}{\|b_3\|} = \frac{b_3}{\sqrt{2\epsilon^2}} = (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})&lt;/math&gt;

It obvious that for the vectors

- &lt;math&gt;o_1 = (1, \epsilon, 0, 0)\ &lt;/math&gt;

- &lt;math&gt;o_2 = (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},0)&lt;/math&gt;

- &lt;math&gt;o_3 = (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})&lt;/math&gt;

the scalarproduct &lt;math&gt;&lt;o_2,o_3&gt; = 1/2 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. All other pairs are also not zero, but they are multiplied with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; such that we get a result near zero.

=== Modified Gram-Schmidt ===

To solve the problem a modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm is used:

# Set &lt;math&gt;b_i = x_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;
# for each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; compute
##  &lt;math&gt;o_i = \frac{b_i}{\|b_i\|}&lt;/math&gt;
## for each &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;i+1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; compute &lt;math&gt;b_j = b_j - &lt;b_j, o_i&gt; o_i\ &lt;/math&gt;

The difference is that we compute first our new &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; and subtract it from all other &lt;math&gt;b_j&lt;/math&gt;. We apply the wrongly computed vector to all vectors instead of computing each &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; separately.

=== Example (recomputed) ===

Step 1. &lt;math&gt;b_1 = (1,\epsilon,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_2 = (1,0,\epsilon,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_3 = (1,0,0,\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2a. &lt;math&gt;o_1 = \frac{b_1}{\|b_1\|} = \frac{b_1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon^2}} = b_1 = (1,\epsilon,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1+\epsilon^2=1&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2b. &lt;math&gt;b_2 = b_2 - &lt;b_2, o_1&gt; o_1 = (1,0,\epsilon,0) - (1,\epsilon,0,0) = (0, -\epsilon, \epsilon, 0)\ &lt;/math&gt;

Step 2c. &lt;math&gt;b_3 = b_3 - &lt;b_3, o_1&gt; o_1 = (1,0,0,\epsilon) - (1,\epsilon,0,0) = (0, -\epsilon, 0, \epsilon)\ &lt;/math&gt;

Step 3a. &lt;math&gt;o_2 = \frac{b_2}{\|b_2\|} = \frac{b_2}{\sqrt{2\epsilon^2}} =  (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3b. &lt;math&gt;b_3 = b_3 - &lt;b_3, o_2&gt; o_2 = (0, -\epsilon, 0, \epsilon) - \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{2}}  (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0) = (0, -\epsilon/2, -\epsilon/2, \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 4a. &lt;math&gt;o_3 = \frac{b_3}{\|b_3\|} = \frac{b_3}{\sqrt{3/2\epsilon^2}} =  (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}})&lt;/math&gt;

We can easily verify that &lt;math&gt;&lt;o_2,o_3&gt; = 0&lt;/math&gt;.


== Application ==

=== Exploratory Project Pursuit ===

In the analysis of high-dimensional data we usually analyze projections of the data. The approach results from the Theorem of Cramer-Wold that states that the multidimensional distribution is fixed if we know all one-dimensional projections. Another theorem states that most (one-dimensional) projections of multivariate data are looking normal, even if the multivariate distribution of the data is highly non-normal.

Therefore in Exploratory Projection Pursuit we jugde the interestingness of a projection by comparison with a (standard) normal distribution. If we assume that the one-dimensional data &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are standard normal distributed then after the transformation &lt;math&gt;z=2\Phi^{-1}(x)-1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution then &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly distributed in the interval &lt;math&gt;[-1;1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the interesting can measured by &lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 (f(z)-1/2)^2 dx&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; a density estimated from the data. If the density &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; in the interval &lt;math&gt;[-1;1]&lt;/math&gt; then the integral becomes zero and we have found that our projected data are normally distributed. An value larger than zero indicates a deviation from the normal distribution of the projected data and hopefully an interesting distribution.

=== Expansion with orthonormal polynomials ===

Let &lt;math&gt;L_i(z)&lt;/math&gt; a set of orthonormal polynomials with the scalar product &lt;math&gt;&lt;f,g&gt;=\int_{-1}^1 f(z)g(z) dz&lt;/math&gt; and the norm &lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \sqrt{&lt;f,f&gt;}&lt;/math&gt;. What can we derive about a densities &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; in the interval &lt;math&gt;[-1;1]&lt;/math&gt; ?

If &lt;math&gt;f(z)=\sum_{i=0}^I a_i L_i(z)&lt;/math&gt; for some maximal degree &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; then it holds

&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 f(z) L_j(z) dz = \int_{-1}^1 \sum_{i=0}^I a_i L_i(z) L_j(z) dz = a_j \int_{-1}^1 L_j(z) L_j(z) dz = a_j&lt;/math&gt;

We can also write &lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 f(z) L_j(z) dz = E(L_j(z))&lt;/math&gt; or empirically we get an estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}_j = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n L_j(z_k)&lt;/math&gt;.

We describe the term &lt;math&gt;1/2 = \sum_{i=1}^I b_i L_i(z)&lt;/math&gt; and get for our integral

&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 (f(z)-1/2)^2 dz = \int_{-1}^1 \left(\sum_{i=0}^I (a_i-b_i) L_i(z)\right)^2 dz  = \sum_{i,j=0}^I \int_{-1}^1 (a_i-b_i)(a_j-b_j) L_i(z) L_j(z) dz = \sum_{i=0}^I (a_i-b_i)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

So using a orthonormal function set allows us to reduce the integral to a summation of coefficient which can be estimated from the data by plugging &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}_j&lt;/math&gt; in the formula above. The coefficients &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; can be precomputed in advance.

=== Normalized Legendre polynomials ===

The only problem left is to find the set of orthonormal polynomials &lt;math&gt;L_i(z)&lt;/math&gt; upto degree &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. We know that &lt;math&gt;1, x, x^2, ..., x^I&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for this space. We have to apply the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to find the orthonormal polynomials. This has been started in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Statistics:Numerical_Methods/Basic_Linear_Algebra_and_Gram-Schmidt_Orthogonalization#Example first example].

The resulting polynomials are called normalized Legendre polynomials. Up to a sacling factor the normalized Legendre polynomials are identical to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials Legendre polynomials]. The Legendre polynomials have a recursive expression of the form

&lt;math&gt;L_i(z) = \frac{(2i-1) L_{i-1}(z) - (i-1) L_{i-2}(z)}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

So computing our integral reduces to computing &lt;math&gt;L_0(z_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_1(z_k)&lt;/math&gt; and using the recursive relationship to compute the &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}_j&lt;/math&gt;'s. Please note that the recursion can be numerically unstable!

      <comment>class=&quot;wikitable&quot; for {{prettytable}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Struts provides a library of [[JSP]] tags for use in constructing an application. 

== Common Features ==

All Struts tags are designed to accept common attributes, and share a common method of interacting with the environment. These attributes all refer to keyed beans stored in the page, request, session, or application objects using the &lt;code&gt;setAttribute()&lt;/code&gt; function of each. The four most common features are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Attribute
! Attribute Name
|-
| Name
| The key to find the bean under.
|-
| Scope
| The Scope attribute identifies the context to find the key in. If the scope is undefined, every available context will be searched in the order of page, request, session, and then application.
|-
| id
| The name of the scripting value that is created in the page context by this tag.
|-
| Property
| Specifies the [[Java Programming/Java Beans|Java Bean]] property to be placed in the page context. If this is not specified, the bean itself will be placed in the page context.
|}

All of these attributes, where they apply, are used in similar ways in order to simplify the interface.

=== Nested References ===

The struts tag library also provides the ability to call deeper than just what's been added to the available contexts. For instance, to access the bean b within the bean a, you would set the name attribute to &quot;a&quot; and the property attribute to &quot;b&quot;. However, if b had a property containing another bean (c) that you wished to access, the property attribute could be set to &quot;b.c&quot;. 

Additionally, indexed references can be used. If a an array of b, item two of the array could be referenced using a property value of &quot;b[2]&quot;.

In summary:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! In Struts Tags
! Expressed in java
|-
| &lt;code&gt; &lt; ... name=&quot;a&quot; property=&quot;b&quot; &gt; &lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;context.getAttribute(&quot;a&quot;).getB()&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt; &lt; ... name=&quot;a&quot; property=&quot;b.c&quot; &gt; &lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;context.getAttribute(&quot;a&quot;).getB().getC()&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt; &lt; ... name=&quot;a&quot; property=&quot;b[2]&quot; &gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;context.getAttribute(&quot;a&quot;).getB(2)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt; &lt; ... name=&quot;puppy&quot; property=&quot;cat.rabbit[8]&quot; &gt; &lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;context.getAttribute(&quot;puppy&quot;).getCat().getRabbit(8)&lt;/code&gt;
|}

== Bean tags ==

These tags all relate to [[Java Programming/Java Beans|Java Beans]]. They are used to create and access objects that use the JavaBeans standard. Because the design of Struts is intended to decouple logic and presentation, these tags are unable to modify beans.

== Html tags ==

These tags create HTML entities. They are used to avoid the use of scriptlets for tasks like prepopulating forms or determining the targets of links.

Á== Logic tags ==

These tags are used for control flow within the document. If constructions, iteration, and page redirects are incuded in this namespace.

== Nesting tags ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975'''
O.C.G.A. 12-7-1. [http://www.gaepd.org/Files_PDF/rules/rules_exist/ocga12-7-1.pdf text] and [[Georgia Water/Policy/Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act/OCGA Sections|Code sections]]

==Summary of the Act==
&quot;This Georgia law '''regulates land-disturbing activity''', which is defined as &quot;any activity which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into state water or onto lands within the state, including, but not limited to, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, and filling of land but not including agricultural practices as described in paragraph (5) of Code Section [http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-7-17 12-7-17].&quot; &lt;br/&gt;
A number of activities are '''exempted from regulation''' under this act, including: 
*surface mining and granite quarrying (they are covered under other laws); 
*minor activities (home gardens, landscaping, etc.); 
*agricultural operations; 
*projects conducted under NRCS supervision; 
*DOT projects; and 
*public water system reservoirs. &lt;br/&gt;
Partial exemptions apply to 
*forestry land management practices, 
*activities of utility companies, 
*state road and tollway authorities, and 
*any projects involving less than one acre of disturbed area.

The Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division (EPD) is responsible for enforcing the law.  EPD may delegate duties to '''local issuing authorities'''. In order to be certified as a local issuing authority, a local government must have local ordinances for land disturbing activities, the ability to enforce such ordinances, and qualified personnel to monitor and enforce permits. 

Applicants for '''land disturbing permits''' must demonstrate that they have erosion and sedimentation control plans that meet |Best Management Practices established for the particular application.

The law also mandates stream buffer protection; for most streams, a 25 foot buffer is required, but for trout streams a 50 foot buffer must be maintained. An exemption to this buffer requirement was added to allow stream crossing for water and sewer lines, however there are specific guidelines to be followed in order to protect these streams.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf], [http://www.gaepd.org/Files_PDF/Water/buffer_implementation.pdf]

==Act Amendments in 2003==
In 2003, the Act was amended by [http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2003_04/fulltext/hb285.htm HB 285], which requires a mandatory certification program for individuals involved in land disturbing activities [http://www.sos.state.ga.us/plb/landscape/erosion_sediment_control_act.htm]
*[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-7-19 12-7-19(a).]  After December 31, 2006, all persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements
*[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-7-20 12-7-20.] Creates a Stakeholder Advisory Board to oversee the education and training program.
*[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-7-21 12-7-21(a).] Creates a study panel to recommend erosion controls and turbidity standards, by July 2006.
*[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-7-22 12-7-22.] Calls for an electronic filing and reporting system.
*[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-5-23 12-5-23(5)(B).] Sets up a fee system ($80 per acre land disturbed) administered by Georgia EPD.

==Legislative history==

I was comfortable doing the MLA portion of in-text citations and works cited example, but I am unfamiliar working with APA.  Does anyone want to take it?  ShellyT-P 14Dec2005

Chapter 2.  [[Georgia Water/Policy|Water Policy]]
:2.3. [[Georgia Water/Laws|Georgia Water Law]] __FORCETOC__
'''Game and Fish Code (O.C.G.A. 27-1-1)'''&lt;br/&gt;

===Summary of the Act===
&quot;This legislation provides the '''ownership of''', jurisdiction over, and control of all wildlife to be vested in the State of Georgia. The section declares that custody of all wildlife in the State is vested with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources for management and regulation.

The Wildlife Resources Division is the principal State agency vested with statutory authority for the protection, management and conservation of terrestrial wildlife and fresh water wildlife resources, including fish, game, nongame, and endangered species.  All licensing of recreational and commercial fish and wildlife activities, excluding shellfish, is performed by the Wildlife Resources Division.

The Coastal Resources Division issues shellfish permits, regulates marine fisheries activities including the opening and closing of the commercial shrimp harvesting season, areas of shrimp harvest, regulates marine species size and creel limits, and enforces the National Shellfish Sanitation Program.

The Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources has directed that there will be cooperation and coordination between the Divisions of the Department in the administration of their respective responsibilities.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf]

'''Georgia Coastal Management Act (O.C.G.A. 12-5-320)'''&lt;br/&gt;
===Summary of the Act===
&quot;The Coastal Management Act provides enabling authority for the State to prepare and administer a coastal management program. The Act does not establish new regulations or laws; it is designed to establish procedural requirements for the Department of Natural Resources to develop and implement a program for the sustainable development and protection of coastal resources. It establishes the Department of Natural Resources as the State agency to receive and disburse federal grant monies.  It establishes the Governor as the approving authority of the program and as the person that must submit the program to the federal government for approval under the federal Coastal Zone Management Act.  It requires other State agencies to cooperate with the Coastal Resources Division when exercising their activities within the coastal area.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:JavaServer Pages|JavaServer Pages]] is a technology for inserting dynamic content into a [[HTML Programming|HTML]] or [[XML]] page using a Java servlet container. In other word, instead of sending HTML pages to web clients that are always the same for every one, you can send HTML pages that can be different for each client and each time they recieve it (using database data for instance). To explain it, let's have a simple HTML page on a web server. The data flow is simple. To put it simple, the client requests a HTML page by sending the page URL and the server returns the given HTML page:

{|cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto; padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px; padding-left:2px; padding-right:2px; spacing-top:0px; spacing-bottom:0px; spacing-left:2px; spacing-right:2px;&quot;
|style=&quot;border: solid 1px grey; text-align: center;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Client
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border: solid 1px grey; text-align: center;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Server
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey;&quot;|&amp;nbsp;

|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey;&quot;|&amp;nbsp;

|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey; text-align: center;&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot;|URL
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot;|[[Image:Arrow right.svg|50px|center]]
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border: solid 1px grey; text-align: center;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Retrieve&lt;br/&gt;the&lt;br/&gt;file
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot;|[[Image:HTML.svg|20px|center]]
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot;|[[Image:Arrow left.svg|50px|center]]
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: solid 1px grey&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: dashed 1px grey&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|style=&quot;border-left: dashed 1px grey&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|}

Here are the HTML file and the display on the client:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; vertical-align:top;&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;| The HTML page
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;| The display
|-
|&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;The current time&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
|&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;The current time&lt;/span&gt;
|}

The returned page is always the same. Now we want to display the current time. To do so, we add a servlet container to the web server. The HTML page will no longer exist on the server. When the page will be requested by a client, a Java class will generate the HTML page and the HTML page will be sent to the client. This Java class is called a ''servlet'':

{|cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto; padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px; padding-left:2px; padding-right:2px; spacing-top:0px; spacing-bottom:0px; spacing-left:2px; spacing-right:2px;&quot;

Now the page is dynamic but the servlet is hard to code and to read. So we will use a ''JavaServer Page'' (JSP). A JSP is written like a HTML page. It has the file extension &lt;code&gt;.jsp&lt;/code&gt; for HTML page and the file extension &lt;code&gt;.jspx&lt;/code&gt; for an XML markup page. In addition to the HTML syntax, it has embedded ''scriptlets'' and ''jsp tags''. A scriptlet is a portion of Java code. The servlet container generates a servlet from the JSP and the servlet will be used to generate HTML pages or XML content. The HTML markups will remains as it is. The embedded scriptlets are inserted into the code of the servlet. The jsp tags are transformed into Java code. So let's use a JSP:

Actually, the servlet is generated by the JSP only for the first request call. The same servlet is reused after then. It is generated again when the JSP will change. Now we have a JSP, that generates a servlet, that generates a HTML page, that will be displayed to the client:

| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;| The servlet

== Scripting elements ==
There are'' three'' basic kinds of scripting elements that allow java code to be inserted directly into the JSP.
* A '''''declaration''''' tag places a variable definition inside the body of the java servlet class. Static data members may be defined as well. Also inner classes can be defined here.
 &lt;%! int serverInstanceVariable = 1; %&gt;
Declaration tags also allow methods to be defined.
 &lt;%!
    /**
     * Converts the Object into a string or if
     * the Object is null, it returns the empty string.
     */
    public String toStringOrBlank(Object obj) {
        if (obj != null) {
            return obj.toString();
        }
        return &quot;&quot;;
    }
 %&gt;
* A '''''scriptlet''''' tag places all of the statements contained within it, inside the &lt;code&gt;_jspService()&lt;/code&gt; method of the java servlet class.
 &lt;% int localStackBasedVariable = 1;
 out.println(localStackBasedVariable); %&gt;
* An '''''expression''''' tag places an expression to be evaluated inside the java servlet class. Expressions should not be terminated with a semi-colon.
 &lt;%= &quot;expanded inline data &quot; + 1 %&gt;
* A '''''comment''''' tag does nothing. It is ignored. It lets you document the file. It is different from a HTML comment as a HTML comment (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) will appear in the generated HTML file.
 &lt;%-- This is my first JSP. --%&gt;

== Directives ==
JSP directives are added at the top of a JSP page. These directives control how the JSP compiler generates the servlet. The following directives are available:

; include : The include directive informs the JSP compiler to include a complete file into the current file. It is as if the contents of the included file were pasted directly into the original file. This functionality is similar to the one provided by the C preprocessor. Included files generally have the extension &quot;jspf&quot; (for JSP '''Fragment'''):
 &lt;%@ include file=&quot;somefile.jspf&quot; %&gt; &lt;!-- Leave this include extension as 'jspf' to match the JSP fragment convention --&gt;

; page : The page directive has several attributes:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; || Results in a Java &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; statement being inserted into the resulting file.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;contentType&lt;/code&gt; || Specifies the content that is generated. This should be used if HTML is not used or if the character set is not the default character set.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;errorPage&lt;/code&gt; || Indicates the address of the page that should be shown if an exception occurs while processing the HTTP request.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;isErrorPage&lt;/code&gt; || If set to true, it indicates that this is the error page. Default value is ''false''.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;isThreadSafe&lt;/code&gt; || True if the resulting servlet must be thread safe.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;autoFlush&lt;/code&gt; || To autoflush the contents. A value of true, the default, indicates that the buffer should be flushed when it is full. A value of false, rarely used, indicates that an exception should be thrown when the buffer overflows. A value of false is illegal when also using buffer=&quot;none&quot;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;session&lt;/code&gt; || To maintain session. A value of true (the default) indicates that the predefined variable session (of type &lt;code&gt;HttpSession&lt;/code&gt;) should be bound to the existing session if one exists, otherwise a new session should be created and bound to it. A value of false indicates that no sessions will be used, and attempts to access the variable session will result in errors at the time the JSP page is translated into a servlet.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; || To set Buffer Size. The default is 8k and it is advisable that you increase it.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;isELIgnored&lt;/code&gt; || Defines whether [[#Expression Language|Expression Language]] (EL) expressions are ignored when the JSP is translated.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;language&lt;/code&gt; || Defines the scripting language used in scriptlets, expressions and declarations. Right now, the only possible value is &quot;java&quot;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; || Defines the superclass of the class this JSP will become. Don't use this unless you &lt;u&gt;really&lt;/u&gt; know what you're doing &amp;mdash; it overrides the class hierarchy provided by the Container.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; || Defines a String that gets put into the translated page, just so that you can get it using the generated servlet's inherited &lt;code&gt;getServletInfo()&lt;/code&gt; method.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;pageEncoding&lt;/code&gt; || Defines the character encoding for the JSP. The default is &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; (unless the contentType attribute already defines a character encoding, or the page uses XML document syntax).
|}

 &lt;%@ page import=&quot;java.util.*&quot; %&gt; &lt;%-- example import --%&gt;
 &lt;%@ page contentType=&quot;text/html&quot; %&gt; &lt;%-- example contentType --%&gt;
 &lt;%@ page isErrorPage=&quot;false&quot; %&gt; &lt;%-- example for non error page --%&gt;
 &lt;%@ page isThreadSafe=&quot;true&quot; %&gt; &lt;%-- example for a thread safe JSP --%&gt;
 &lt;%@ page session=&quot;true&quot; %&gt; &lt;%-- example for using session binding --%&gt;
 &lt;%@ page autoFlush=&quot;true&quot; %&gt; &lt;%-- example for setting autoFlush --%&gt;
 &lt;%@ page buffer=&quot;20kb&quot; %&gt; &lt;%-- example for setting Buffer Size --%&gt;
: '''Note:''' Only the &quot;import&quot; page directive can be used multiple times in the same JSP.
; taglib : The taglib directive indicates that a [[#JSP tag libraries|JSP tag library]] is to be used. The directive requires a prefix (much like a namespace in C++) and the URI for the tag library description.
 &lt;%@ taglib prefix=&quot;myprefix&quot; uri=&quot;taglib/mytag.tld&quot; %&gt;

=== Example ===
Regardless of whether the JSP compiler generates Java source code for a servlet or emits the byte code directly, it is helpful to understand how the JSP compiler transforms the page into a Java servlet. For example, consider the following input JSP and its resulting generated Java Servlet.

{| style=&quot;width: 100%; vertical-align:top;&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;| Input JSP
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;| Resulting servlet
|-
|&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;%@ page errorPage=&quot;myerror.jsp&quot; %&gt;
&lt;%@ page import=&quot;com.foo.bar&quot; %&gt;
 
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;%! int serverInstanceVariable = 1;%&gt;
 
  &lt;% int localStackBasedVariable = 1; %&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;%-- This will be ignored. --%&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;%= toStringOrBlank( &quot;expanded inline data &quot; + 1 ) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

== Implicit objects ==
We have seen that we can declare objects in a scriplet that we can use further. There are also already declared objects that can be used by the programmer. They are called ''implicit object'':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; || The [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/jsp/JspWriter.html JspWriter] used to write the data to the response stream.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; || The servlet itself.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;pageContext&lt;/code&gt; || A [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/jsp/PageContext.html PageContext] instance that contains data associated with the whole page. A given HTML page may be passed among multiple JSPs.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; || The [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html HttpServletRequest] object that provides HTTP request information.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;response&lt;/code&gt; || The [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html HttpServletResponse] object that can be used to send data back to the client.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;session&lt;/code&gt; || The [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html HttpSession] object that can be used to track information about a user from one request to another.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; || Provides servlet configuration data.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;application&lt;/code&gt; || Data shared by all JSPs and servlets in the application.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;exception&lt;/code&gt; || Exceptions not caught by application code.
|}

== JSP actions ==
JSP actions are XML tags that invoke built-in web server functionality. They are executed at runtime. Some are standard and some are custom (which are developed by Java developers). The following are the standard ones.

==== jsp:include ====
Like the include directive, this tag includes a specified jsp into the returned HTML page but it works differently. The Java servlet temporarily hands the request and response off to the specified JavaServer Page. Control will then return to the current JSP, once the other JSP has finished. Using this, JSP code will be shared between multiple other JSPs, rather than duplicated.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;jsp:include page=&quot;mycommon.jsp&quot; &gt;
      &lt;jsp:param name=&quot;extraparam&quot; value=&quot;myvalue&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/jsp:include&gt;
    name:&lt;%=request.getParameter(&quot;extraparam&quot;)%&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== jsp:param ====
Can be used inside a &lt;code&gt;jsp:include&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jsp:forward&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;jsp:params&lt;/code&gt; block. Specifies a parameter that will be added to the request's current parameters.

==== jsp:forward ====
Used to hand off the request and response to another JSP or servlet. Control will never return to the current JSP.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;jsp:forward page=&quot;subpage.jsp&quot; &gt;
  &lt;jsp:param name=&quot;forwardedFrom&quot; value=&quot;this.jsp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/jsp:forward&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
In this forwarding example, the request is forwarded to &lt;code&gt;subpage.jsp&lt;/code&gt;.

==== jsp:plugin ====
Older versions of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer used different tags to embed an applet. This action generates the browser specific tag needed to include an applet. The plugin example illustrates an HTML uniform way of embedding applets in a web page. Before the advent of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;OBJECT&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, there was no common way of embedding applets.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;jsp:plugin type=applet height=&quot;100%&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
   archive=&quot;myjarfile.jar, myotherjar.jar&quot;
   codebase=&quot;/applets&quot;
   code=&quot;com.foo.MyApplet&quot; &gt;
   &lt;jsp:params&gt;
     &lt;jsp:param name=&quot;enableDebug&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/jsp:params&gt;
   &lt;jsp:fallback&gt;
     Your browser does not support applets.
   &lt;/jsp:fallback&gt;
&lt;/jsp:plugin&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Currently, the &lt;code&gt;jsp:plugin&lt;/code&gt; tag does not allow for dynamically called applets. For example, &lt;code&gt;jsp:params&lt;/code&gt; cannot be used with a charting applet that requires the data points to be passed in as parameters unless the number of data points is constant. You cannot, for example, loop through a ResultSet to create the &lt;code&gt;jsp:param&lt;/code&gt; tags. Each &lt;code&gt;jsp:param&lt;/code&gt; tag must be hand-coded.

==== jsp:fallback ====
The content to show if the browser does not support applets.

==== jsp:getProperty ====
Gets a property from the specified JavaBean.

== JSP tag libraries ==
In addition to the pre-defined JSP actions, developers may add their own custom ''actions'' using the JSP Tag Extension API. Developers write a Java class that implements one of the Tag interfaces and provide a tag library XML description file that specifies the tags and the java classes that implement the tags.

Consider the following JSP.

 &lt;%@ taglib uri=&quot;mytaglib.tld&quot; prefix=&quot;myprefix&quot; %&gt;
 …
 &lt;myprefix:myaction&gt; &lt;%-- The start tag --%&gt;
 …
 &lt;/myprefix:myaction&gt; &lt;%-- The end tag --%&gt;
 …

The JSP compiler will load the mytaglib.tld XML file:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;xml&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;6, 7&quot;&gt;
&lt;taglib&gt;
  &lt;tlib-version&gt;1.0&lt;/tlib-version&gt;
  &lt;jsp-version&gt;2.0&lt;/jsp-version&gt;
  &lt;short-name&gt;My taglib&lt;/short-name&gt;
  &lt;tag&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;myaction&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;tag-class&gt;org.wikibooks.en.MyActionTag&lt;/tag-class&gt;
    &lt;body-content&gt;empty&lt;/body-content&gt;
  &lt;/tag&gt;
&lt;/taglib&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The JSP compiler will see that the tag &lt;code&gt;myaction&lt;/code&gt; is implemented by the java class &lt;code&gt;MyActionTag&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;8, 11&quot;&gt;
public class MyActionTag extends TagSupport {
   public MyActionTag() { … }

     // Releases all instance variables.
   public void release() { … }

   // Called for the start tag
   public int doStartTag() { … }

   // Called at the end tag
   public int doEndTag() { … }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first time the tag is used in the file, it will create an instance of &lt;code&gt;MyActionTag&lt;/code&gt;. Then (and each additional time that the tag is used), it will invoke the method &lt;code&gt;doStartTag()&lt;/code&gt; when it encounters the starting tag. It looks at the result of the start tag, and determines how to process the body of the tag. The body is the text between the start tag and the end tag. The &lt;code&gt;doStartTag()&lt;/code&gt; method may return one of the following:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;SKIP_BODY&lt;/code&gt; || The body between the tag is not processed.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; || Evaluate the body of the tag.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;EVAL_BODY_TAG&lt;/code&gt; || Evaluate the body of the tag and push the result onto stream (stored in the body content property of the tag).
|}

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Todo|Add Body Tag description.}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
'''Note:''' If tag extends the &lt;code&gt;BodyTagSupport&lt;/code&gt; class, the method &lt;code&gt;doAfterBody()&lt;/code&gt; will be called when the body has been processed just prior to calling the &lt;code&gt;doEndTag()&lt;/code&gt;. This method is used to implement looping constructs.

When it encounters the end tag, it invokes the &lt;code&gt;doEndTag()&lt;/code&gt; method. The method may return one of two values:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;EVAL_PAGE&lt;/code&gt; || This indicates that the rest of the JSP file should be processed.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;SKIP_PAGE&lt;/code&gt; || This indicates that no further processing should be done. Control leaves the JSP page. This is what is used for the forwarding action.
|}

If you want to iterate the body a few times, your java class (tag handler) must implement the &lt;code&gt;IterationTag&lt;/code&gt; interface. It returns &lt;code&gt;EVAL_BODY_AGAIN&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; which means to invoke the body again.

=== JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) ===
The JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) is a component of the Java EE Web application development platform. It extends the JSP specification by adding a tag library of JSP tags for common tasks, such as XML data processing, conditional execution, loops and internationalization.

=== Struts Tag Library ===
The [[Java Programming/Struts|Struts]] project includes the [[Java Programming/Struts/Struts Tag Library|Struts Tag Library]], the bulk of which is useful independently of the Struts architecture.

== Internationalization ==
Internationalization in JSP is accomplished the same way as in a normal Java application, that is by using resource bundles.

== Expression Language ==
The Expression Language (EL) is a faster/easier way to display parameter values. It is available since JSP 2.0 . For instance, it allows developers to create Velocity-style templates:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot; lines=&quot;LINES&quot;&gt;
Hello, ${param.visitor}
&lt;/source&gt;
Same as
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot; lines=&quot;LINES&quot;&gt;
Hello, &lt;%=request.getParameter(&quot;visitor&quot;)%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

It also offers a clearer way to navigate nested beans. Consider some beans:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
class Person {
   String name;
   // Person nests an organization bean.
   Organization organization;

   public String getName() { return this.name; }
   public Organization getOrganization() { return this.organization; }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
class Organization {
   String name;
   public String getName() { return this.name; }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Then, if an instance of Person was to be placed onto a request attribute under the name &quot;person&quot;, the JSP would have:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
 Hello, ${person.name}, of company ${person.organization.name}
&lt;/source&gt;

Same as.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
 Hello,
&lt;% Person p = (Person) request.getAttribute(&quot;person&quot;);
   if (p != null) {
       out.print(p.getName());
   }
%&gt;, of company
&lt;% if ((p != null) &amp;&amp; (p.getOrganization() != null)) {
       out.print(p.getOrganization().getName());
   }
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== JSP Technology in the Java EE 5 Platform ==
The focus of Java EE 5 has been ease of development by making use of Java language annotations that were introduced by J2SE 5.0. JSP 2.1 supports this goal by defining annotations for dependency injection on JSP tag handlers and context listeners.

Another key concern of the Java EE 5 specification has been the alignment of its webtier technologies, namely JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaServer Faces (JSF), and JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL).

The outcome of this alignment effort has been the Unified Expression Language (EL), which integrates the expression languages defined by JSP 2.0 and JSF 1.1.

The main key additions to the Unified EL that came out of the alignment work have been: A pluggable API for resolving variable references into Java objects and for resolving the properties applied to these Java objects, Support for deferred expressions, which may be evaluated by a tag handler when needed, unlike their regular expression counterparts, which get evaluated immediately when a page is executed and rendered, and Support for lvalue expression, which appear on the left hand side of an assignment operation. When used as an lvalue, an EL expression represents a reference to a data structure, for example: a [[Java Programming/JavaBeans|JavaBeans]] property, that is assigned some user input. The Unified EL is defined in its own specification document, which is delivered along with the JSP 2.1 specification.

Thanks to the Unified EL, JSTL tags, such as the JSTL iteration tags, can be used with JSF components in an intuitive way.

JSP 2.1 leverages the Servlet 2.5 specification for its web semantics.

=== Model-view-controller paradigm ===
[[File:JSP Model 2.svg|thumb|300px|The JSP Model 2 architecture.]]
A model-view-controller pattern can be used with the JSP files in order to split the presentation from request processing and computer data storage. Either regular servlets or separate JSP files are used to process the request. After the request processing has finished, control is passed to a JSP used only for creating the output. There are several platforms based on Model-view-controller pattern for web tiers (such as Barracuda, Apache Struts, Stripes, and the Spring MVC framework).

=== Environment ===
Both the Java Server (J2EE specification) and the page scripts and/or extended customised programming added operate by (in the runtime context of being loaded programs used) a special pre-installed base program called a Virtual Machine that integrates with the host Operating System, this type being the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Because either, ''both a Compiler-JVM set (called an SDK or JDK)'' or ''the lone JVM (called a JRE, Java Runtime Environment)'' is made for most computer platform OSs and the compiled programs for the JVM are compiled into special Java Byte code files for the JVM the Byte-code files (compiled Java program .class files) can be effectively transferred between platforms with no requirement to be recompiled excepting versioning compatibility, or special circumstance. The source code for these J2EE servlet or J2EE JSP programs is ''almost always supplied with J2EE JSP material and J2EE Web Applications because the server must call the compiler when loading them''. These small extension programs (custom tags, servlets, beans, page scripting) are variable and likely to be updated or changed either shortly before runtime or intermittently but particularly when sending JSP page requests themselves, ''  &lt;u&gt;it requires the JSP server to have access&lt;/u&gt; to a Java compiler (SDK or JDK) and the required source code (not simply the JVM JRE and byte code class files)'' to successfully exploit the method of serving.

JSP syntax has two basic forms, ''scriptlet'' and ''markup'' though fundamentally the page is either HTML or XML markup. Scriptlet tagging (called Scriptlet Elements)'' (delimited) blocks of code'' with the markup are not effectively markup and allows any java server relevant API (e.g. the servers running binaries themselves or database connections API or java mail API) or more specialist JSP API language code to be embedded in an HTML or XML page provided the correct declarations in the JSP file and file extension of the page are used. Scriptlet blocks do not require to be completed in the block itself only the last line of the block itself being completed ''syntactically correctly as a statement'' is required, it ''can be completed in a later block''. This system of split inline coding sections is called ''step over scripting'' because it can wrap around the static markup ''by stepping over it''. At runtime (during a client request) the code is compiled and evaluated, but compilation of the code generally only occurs when a change to the code of the file occurs. The JSP syntax adds additional XML-like tags, called JSP actions, to be used to invoke built-in functionality. Additionally, the technology allows for the creation of JSP tag libraries that act as extensions to the standard HTML or XML tags. JVM operated Tag libraries provide a platform independent way of extending the capabilities of a Web server. Note that not all company makes of Java servers are J2EE specification compliant.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;A Glossary of Terms Related to Basic Ecology&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;

'''Biological control or biocontrol:''' 1. In general, the control of the numbers of one organism as a result of natural predation by another or others.  Specifically, the human use of natural predators for the control of pests or weeds.  Also applied to the introduction of large numbers of sterilized males of the pest species, whose matings result in the laying of infertile eggs (Allaby, 1998).  2. The release of one species to control another (Carlton, 2001).  3.  The management of weeds using introduced herbivores (often insects) as biological control agents (Booth et al., 2003). 4. Control method involving a biological control agent that is a natural enemy of a target pest (Heutte and Bella, 2003).

'''Biological diversity or biodiversity:''' Used to describe species richness, ecosystem complexity, and genetic variation (Allaby 1998). 

'''Bioregion:''' A biological subdivision of the earth’s surface delineated by the flora and fauna of the region (Allaby 1998).

'''Biota:'''  The plants and animals of a specific region or period, or the total aggregation of organisms in the biosphere (Allaby 1998).
 
'''Community:''' Any grouping of populations of different organisms that live together in a particular environment (Allaby 1998). 

'''Disturbance:''' An event or change in the environment that alters the composition and successional status of a biological community and may deflect succession onto a new trajectory, such as a forest fire or hurricane, glaciation, agriculture, and urbanization (Art 1993). 

'''Ecosystem:'''  A discrete unit, or community of organisms and their physical environment (living and non-living parts), that interact to form a stable system (Allaby 1998). 

'''Endemic:''' A species or taxonomic group that is restricted to a particular geographic areas because of such factors as isolation or response to soil or climatic conditions; this species is said to be endemic to the place (Allaby 1998) and would be native. 

'''Exotic species:''' This term is commonly used in publications and literature, and is similar to the terms alien species, foreign species, introduced species, non indigenous species, and non native species (Heutte and Bella 2003).  Other definitions include: 1. An introduced, non native species, or a species that is the result of direct or indirect, deliberate or accidental introduction of the species by humans, and for which introduction permitted the species to cross a natural barrier to dispersal (Noss and Cooperrider 1994).  2.  In North America, often refers to those species not present in a bioregion before the entry of Europeans in the 16th century, or present in later parts of that region and later introduced to an ecosystem by human-mediated mechanisms (Cohen and Carlton 1988).  

'''Fauna:''' The animal life of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998)

'''Fitness:''' Survival and reproduction ability of an individual 

'''Flora:''' Plant or bacterial life forms of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). 

'''Habitat:''' 1. The place, including physical and biotic conditions, where a plant or an animal usually occurs (Allaby 1998). 2. The physical conditions that surround a species, or species population, or assemblage of species, or community (Clements and Shelford, 1939).  

'''Indigenous:''' A species that occurs naturally in an area; a synonym for native species (Allaby 1998), although see &quot;endemic&quot;.

'''Native range:''' The ecosystem that a species inhabits (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Native species:'''  1. A synonym for indigenous species 2. A species that occurs naturally in an area, and has not been introduced by humans either intentionally or unintentionally (Allaby 2005).  3.  In North America, a species established before the year 500 (Jeschke and Strayer 2005)

'''Naturalized species:''' 1. A species that was originally introduced from a different country, a different bioregion, or a different geographical area, but now behaves like a native species in that it maintains itself without further human intervention and now grows and reproduces in native communities (Allaby 1998).  2. A non native species that forms self-sustaining populations but is not necessarily an invasive species (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Niche:''' the role the species plays in the functioning of the ecosystem: the &quot;functional status of an organism in its community&quot; (Charles Elton, in Odum, 1959).

'''Population:''' A group of potentially inter-breeding individuals of the same species found in the same place at the same time (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Ruderal species:''' A plant associated with human dwellings, construction, or agriculture, that usually colonizes disturbed or waste ground.  Ruderals are often weeds which have high demands for nutrients and are intolerant of competition.  See also native weed or invasive native (Allaby 1998).  

'''Species: ''' A group of organisms formally recognized as distinct from other groups; the taxon rank in the hierarchy of biological classification below that of genus; the basic unit of biological classification, usually defined by the reproductive isolation of the group from all other groups of organisms (Allaby 1998). 

'''Weed:'''  1. A plant in the wrong place, being one that occurs opportunistically on land or in water that has been disturbed by human activities (see also ''ruderal species'' and ''native weed'' or ''invasive native''), or on cultivated land, where it competes for nutrients, water, sunlight, or other resources with cultivated plants such as food crops.  Under different circumstances the weed plant itself may be cultivated for beneficial purposes (Allaby, 1998).  2. A native or introduced species that has a perceived negative ecological or economic effect on agricultural or natural ecosystems (Booth et al., 2003).  3.  A plant growing in an area where it is not wanted (Royer and Dickinson, 1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objectives and Risks ==

The Elephant and Horse Attack (commonly known as the “EH Attack” or “E+H Attack”) is a very popular system and is seen much more frequently than the [[Arimaa/Elephant_and_Camel_Attacks |Elephant and Camel Attack]] due to the high risks involved with the latter.  The important distinction is that the attacker’s Camel remains safe during an Elephant and Horse Attack and can be used to counterbalance the defender’s Camel.  In the Elephant and Camel Attack, by contrast, the defender’s Camel becomes quite powerful if the attacking Camel is taken hostage and the cost for abandoning the hostage is more severe for the attacker.  The Elephant and Horse Attack is currently very effective against the best computer programs but there is not yet a consensus in the Arimaa community as to whether the E+H Attack is the best system to use against a strong human defender.

'''''Note: For simplicity, many examples below will assume that the Gold player is attacking the c6 trap.  Naturally, the same theories can apply equally to attacks on all 4 traps.'''''

Reasons to use the Elephant and Horse Attack:

* to trap enemy pieces when the enemy Elephant is too far away, or unable, to defend the trap
* to create a wall with two strong pieces so that a Rabbit may be advanced along the outside
* to distract the enemy Elephant from the opposite wing
* to encourage a Horse hostage in order to decentralize the enemy Elephant
* to encourage a Horse hostage in order to attempt an [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Blockade |Elephant blockade]]
* to encourage a Horse hostage with the intention of [[Arimaa/Multi-Piece_Swarming_Attacks |swarming]] the trap with small pieces and releasing the attacking Elephant

Summary of risks (assuming Gold attacks the c6 trap):
* the Horse may be taken hostage
* the Horse may be framed – this is a major disadvantage if the attacking Elephant is pinned to the c5, b6 or c7 square
* the opposing player may be able to begin an attack on the trap just vacated by the Horse and/or Elephant

== Ideal Placement of Pieces ==

The attacker should employ the Elephant and Horse attack against a trap that does not have a defending Camel.  It is often disastrous if the Horse is taken hostage by the Camel and the attacking Elephant becomes decentralized during a rescue operation.  

When attacking an enemy trap, a very effective plan is to place the Horse on b6 and the Elephant on d6.  The advantages are:
* if the enemy Elephant cannot reach c5, it is usually difficult for the defender to place a piece on c5, making it problematic to defend the trap – even if a defender can reach c5 it may still be in danger of being pushed towards the c3 trap
* if the Horse is taken hostage it will be safe from the f6 trap
* if the Horse is framed, the Elephant is ideally placed on d6 – it can be quite disadvantageous for the attacker if the Gold Elephant is pinned to c5, b6 or c7
* the Horse cannot become forked on the d6 square while the Elephant is standing there!
* the Horse is located as far as possible from the enemy Elephant and Camel while still maintaining a convenient escape route along the ‘a’ or ‘b’ file – this becomes especially important if the Gold Elephant ever moves away from the c6 trap
* the Horse can effectively assist an advancing Rabbit on the ‘a’ file
* if the Gold Horse occupies b6, then the Silver Horse is denied its ideal defensive square 
* the defensive position becomes highly cramped

If there is a Silver Rabbit on d8, it is usually a good idea to pull it to d7 with the Elephant:
* it will become an obstacle for a Silver Camel that is located behind the f6 trap
* the Rabbit may be captured after Gold controls the c6 trap
* a Silver defender is removed from the back rank for the benefit of any advanced Gold Rabbits

The attacking Horse can also occupy the c7 square rather than the b6 square in order to capture an enemy piece on c8, just as a Camel often does during an Elephant and Camel Attack.  However, this is sometimes dangerous for the attacking Horse and some players prefer to simply leave the Horse at b6.  The major problem is that during an Elephant and Horse Attack on c6, the enemy Camel often lurks at a nearby square, such as f7.  And that Camel would love nothing more than to hold the Horse hostage behind the c6 trap in order to either paralyze the Elephant, or lure it behind the trap.  Before the Gold Horse is moved to c7, it is prudent to ensure that the Silver Elephant cannot create any threats that will distract the Gold Elephant from the c6 trap.

If the defender has many pieces near the trap, it may be necessary to advance a third attacker in order to quickly seize control of the trap.  If possible, the third attacker should be a Dog, or weaker, so that the other Horse and the Camel can be used defensively.

== Defensive Systems and Counter-Attacks ==

There are a few simple and effective prophylactic measures that the defender can use to prevent or delay the Elephant and Horse Attack.  By placing defending Horses on the outside of both traps (on the ‘b’ and ‘g’ files), the enemy will need to devote some extra moves to first pull the Horse away from the square, then occupy it with the attacking Horse.  The defending Elephant will usually arrive on the scene long before the attacker can accomplish his/her objectives.  A second possibility is to guard the trap with both a Camel and a Horse – of course, the opposing player may simply attack the other trap in that case!  A third preventative measure commonly used is to threaten an Elephant and Horse Attack on the same wing.  For example, if Horses are defending traps at b3 and b6 and then Gold Elephant moves to the b5 square, the Silver Elephant can simply move to the b4 square and neither player will successfully carry out the Elephant and Horse Attack – not yet.

If the prophylactic measures fail, and the opposing player does carry out an Elephant and Horse Attack there are several defensive options:
* occupy the c5 square with the Elephant in order to neutralize the attack
* take the Horse hostage with the Elephant – current Arimaa theory considers this to be a dubious decision
* use the Camel, possibly with supporting pieces, to counter-attack on the opposite wing – there is a risk involved because the Gold Elephant may decide to abandon the Horse in order to pursue the Silver Camel
* launch an Elephant and Horse Attack on the same wing – if both armies can maintain 2 defenders on the traps then a curious, but temporary, stalemate sometimes occurs
* launch an Elephant and Horse Attack on the opposite wing – this is much riskier than an attack on the same wing because mutual attrition followed by a Rabbit race on opposite wings becomes a distinct possibility
* create a distraction for the Gold Elephant so that the c6 trap will be abandoned

Another tactic that the defender can use with the Silver Elephant on c5, Silver Horse on b7 and Gold Horse on b6 is to pull the attacking Horse down to b5 (returning the Elephant to c5) and then move the defending horse onto b6.  From the d6 square, the Gold Elephant cannot assist the Gold Horse in returning to b6.  Similarly, if there was a defending piece on c7, the Silver Elephant could pull the Gold Horse to c6 and then occupy b6 with the Silver Horse.  This would force the Gold Horse to escape through the c7 square (if possible) in order to avoid being framed.

== Ideas for Setup ==

An Elephant and Horse Attack can be commenced with the first moves of the game, and for this reason nearly all players setup either Horses or the Camel on the b2, g2, b7 and g7 squares.  The Horses on these files have the dual purpose of threatening, and defending against, an Elephant and Horse Attack.  A balanced distribution of forces is essential for defending against an attack; if one home trap is defended with 2 Horses and a Camel, the opposing player is likely to attack the opposite trap.

Most players like to assign their Camels in a defensive role during the opening of the game.  For those players, the Camel is an ideal defender against the Elephant and Horse Attack and is often setup in the middle or behind a trap and, more importantly, the Camel’s mobility should be maintained during the game so that it can easily move from one home trap to the other.  Players that do not use the Camel defensively against the Elephant and Horse Attack may setup with it located on the ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘g’ or ‘h’ file for possible offensive action.

Dogs and Cats are very often setup behind the home traps.  They are very effective in those positions but they will require three supporting pieces to maintain a Horse frame on the trap.  Another possibility is to setup Dogs and Cats on a2, a7, h2, or h7 for the job of unfreezing the trap defenders that are attacked by the enemy Elephant on the ‘b’ and ‘g’ files.  This is sometimes preferable to advancing Rabbits for the same purpose.

At the current time, most players like to setup four Rabbits on the ‘a’ and ‘h’ files and no Rabbits on the ‘d’ and ‘e’ files.  There are several ideas behind this setup related to this chapter:
* Rabbits in the middle of the home territory may become obstacles for defensive pieces that desire to move between traps, especially on the 2nd and 3rd ranks
* if the enemy Elephant attempts to pull a stronger piece from the 'b' or 'g' file then the 2nd rank 'a' or 'h' file Rabbit can be advanced to unfreeze the stronger piece with one fewer step than a 1st rank ‘a’ or ‘h’ file Rabbit
* Rabbits can be advanced on the perimeter more safely than in the middle
* outside, 2nd rank Rabbits are one step closer towards participating in an Elephant blockade on the ‘b’ file
* Rabbits advanced up the middle of the board may be exploited by the enemy to blockade the friendly Elephant in the 6th rank middle
* players that prefer to generate goal threats on the outside, rather than the middle of the board, like to stack extra Rabbits on the 'a' and 'h' files

Against an opponent that enjoys using the Elephant and Horse Attack, it is not recommended to place Rabbits behind a home trap on c2, f2, c7 or f7.  They are awkward and vulnerable defenders against the E+H Attack.

== If Both Camels Have Been Trapped ==

If each player traps the enemy Camel plus one Horse, the strategic situation will be identical to the one that arises after all four Horses are trapped and the Camels remain on the board (because the relative strengths and distribution of pieces are equivalent).  Therefore, if each side has no Camel and one Horse, the Elephant and Horse Attack contains all of the risks that would be associated with an Elephant and Camel Attack with four pieces removed from the board.  As such, both players should consider alternative strategies that do not expose the second strongest remaining piece to a hostage situation.

== If Attacker’s Camel Has Been Trapped ==

If the attacker has already lost the Camel (hopefully some compensatory enemy piece(s) were captured), then the Elephant and Horse Attack is usually a strategic mistake.  It involves all of the same risks that were discussed in the Elephant and Camel Attack chapter due to the power of the unopposed enemy Camel; only in exceptional circumstances would the attack be beneficial.

A player that has lost the Camel but gained smaller piece(s) as compensation should instead consider strategies that involve goal threats, blockades, obtaining a Camel hostage, or creating an open tactical game in which the enemy Camel cannot effectively participate.

== If Defender’s Camel Has Been Trapped ==

If the opposing player has already lost the Camel in exchange for a couple of weaker pieces, there are differences of opinion amongst Arimaa experts about whether the side with the Camel should use the Lone Elephant Attack or the Elephant and Horse Attack.  The ideal strategy can vary considerably from one situation to the next, so both players will need to rely upon judgement and experience rather than relying upon rules carved in stone.

:Aaaaah... after reading the comment in the talk page for game manuals, I can see how there was some confusion. In case you don't see the message there, I will repeat it here. The &quot;Good luck!&quot; was not sarcastic. It is included in the official {{tl|welcome}} template. I just noticed your name a lot and thought I'd welcome you to the Wikibooks community. I do not make any judgements on ''what'' you edit. I am sorry if there was any confusion. Just keep upo the good work, my friend. Cheers. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:38, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::LOL, I'm sorry LV, I honestly thought that there was the standard Wikibooks welcome, and one line later you added a personal &quot;Good luck.&quot;  I didn't expect a welcome template to actually be signed by another user.  And so I thought I was erasing a lot of default text and leaving only a personal message.  Thank you for the clarification.  Now that I understand it, I'll leave it there in the spirit of good will that it was intended. 01:54, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

Just saying I've added a responce to your comment on the [[Wikibooks_talk:Game_manual_guidelines]] page. So did Lord Voldemort. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:58, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:Got it, thank you very much for your support.  I guess I'll keep plugging away at the project while the issue is resolved.  I am trying to keep it very legitimate, and making sure that every important link is connected, as well as adding the proper references back and forth between WP and WB.

== VFD ==

In response to some of your comments on [[WB:VFD]] I have copied some text from Wikipedia:
* [[w:Wikipedia:Assume good faith|Assume good faith]]. Wikibooks has worked remarkably well so far based on a policy of nearly complete freedom to edit. People come here to collaborate and write good articles.
* Treat others as you would have them treat you.
* Be polite, please! 
**People can't see you or know for sure your mood. Irony isn't always obvious, and blunt, raw text can easily appear rude. Be careful of the words you choose &amp;mdash; what you intended might not be what others think
* Argue facts, not personalities.
* Be [[w:Wikipedia:Civility|civil]].
* Although it's understandably difficult in a heated argument, if the other party is not as civil as you'd like them to be, make sure to be '''more''' civil than him or her, not less.
** That way at least you're not spiralling down to open conflict and name-calling by your own accord, you're actively doing something about it: taking a hit and refraining from hitting back -- everybody appreciates that (or at least they should).
** However, don't hesitate to let the other party know that you're not comfortable with their tone in a neutral way -- otherwise they might think you're too dense to understand their &quot;subtlety&quot;, and you'll involuntarily encourage them (e.g. &quot;I know you've been sarcastic above, but I don't think that's helping us resolve the issue. However, I don't think your argument stands because...&quot;).
* Be prepared to apologize. 
* Forgive and forget.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pharaohs ==
Pharaohs were kings in ancient Egypt, considered by their subjects to be divine. The word &quot;Pharaoh&quot; literally means &quot;great house&quot;. This term refers to both the royal household in which the king dwelled and also the veneration and wonder the people held for the position. They were the most important people in the country of Egypt.  The Pharaoh's word was never questioned as he had supreme authority, represented by the crook and flail. Many gifts were given to him in his honor. It was common for a Pharaoh to marry his sibling to &quot;preserve the divinity within the blood line.&quot; Yet at the same time the Pharaohs had multiple wives, so the heir did not always come from the sibling-wife.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Safe Install (Xandros Networks)==
The recommended way of installing new software is to use a program called Xandros Networks, an application that installs, removes and updates software.
Xandros Networks can be launched from the desktop and the Launch menu.

===Common Applications===
From the menu on the left, select &quot;New Applications&quot;.  You will see a list of common software packages offered and tested by Xandros which are not found on your computer. To install any of these, simply click on the &quot;Install Now&quot; to the right of the software description.

===All Available Supported Applications===
Expanding the &quot;New Applications&quot; on the left reveals the software categories for all available supported software from Xandros Networks.  Selecting a category will reveal the software packages in that category.  To install one of these packages, selected the desired software package and click &quot;Install&quot;. 

===Searching for Software===
If you don't know the category or the name of the software you want to install, you can search for it.  Enter the name or type of software you want in the text box in the top-right corner of the window and click the &quot;Search&quot; button.

==Easy Install (Autopackage)==
Autopackage is a simple way to install software on a wide variety of Linux distributions.

To install your first software from Autopackage:
#Go to the [http://autopackage.org/downloads.html Autopackage Downloads site].
#Download the software package you want to install and save it on your computer.
#Go to the folder where you saved the software package.
#Click on the package with your right mouse button.
#Click on the Properties menu item.
#Select the Permissions tab.
#Check the top-most &quot;Exec&quot; checkbox.
#Click OK.
#Open the software package.

This is a one-time process.  After your first package software package from Autopackage has been installed, installing further software packages is as easy as downloading the file and double-clicking it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Warning: These instructions are for installing Linux software that will playback WMA-encoded media files, and the bundle noted also includes numerous codecs that are of questionable and legally uncertain status.'''

Xandros natively supports several multimedia formats, like the popular MP3 format, but not all of them, such as the WMA format. This guide will give you support for these other formats.

#Open Xandros Networks
#Open the Edit menu and select &quot;Set Application Sources...&quot;
#Click on the &quot;Add...&quot; button
#Add the following line exactly as it is shown:
#*deb&lt;nowiki&gt; ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/&lt;/nowiki&gt; sarge main 
#Click the &quot;OK&quot; button.
#Click the &quot;OK&quot; button.
#By using the search function in the top-right corner, find and install a package called &quot;w32codecs&quot;.
#And by searching for &quot;libdvdcss&quot;, you can play encoded DVDs.

May you please register though? It helps a lot in terms of tracking changes, and other stuff. Its free, easy , and has advantages :) Also, I would be able to email you without knowing your email address (supposedly, but I can't seem to figure out how to use that feature)

: Oh, and in &quot;forums&quot;, to reply to a post, put a : in front of your text. Anyway, I've tried to get more people onboard, but no one seems to want to help. GFAQs people just want to vandalize :-/ Sleepywood people would rather create their own guides. But I'll get what i want eventually :) When the guide is big enough, people will start joining in.

: There has been some controversy on Game Guides on Wikibooks; however, they have seemed to revolve around the idea that Game Guides generally look like **** on Wikibooks. Look at the [[Starcraft]] Wikibook for example. Anyway, I'd like to help clean up the Maple Guide a bit, and if you don't want to, that is fine as well :) Other little things that may help... you can program new code into Wikibooks through &quot;templates&quot;. I've programmed a few in myself, so go on and use them. If you can't figure out how to use them, all you gotta do is put a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ then the template name and then }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

: I hope you help out more often as well :) Takes a bit of load off of me, and I'm sure it makes the guide better --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:30, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

:: I found an [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Maple_Story/MageGuide&amp;diff=309847&amp;oldid=308614 edit] on your mage guide dealing with your name... I'm not sure if this was by You or not, so I reverted it. Change it back with while logged in if you want to, and I'll stop reverting it.

::: Aight, cool. Remember, anyone can edit what you put up on a wiki, so some people like to screw up names and stuff. I try to keep an eye out for that kind of stuff... but it is hard to tell if it was you or someone else who wanted to screw up your name.

::: As for templates... they are kinda complex to make and use... A tutorial on one is [[Help:Template | here]], in the [[Help:Editing | Editing]] guide. The basics are simple though... As you can see on this page, there is the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template (click the edit bar). Templates can get &quot;parameters&quot; to change some of their text, so realy each template is used differently. The templates I've been making are listed on the [[Talk:Maple_Story#Templates|MapleStory talk]] page, and I've been trying to document them... still kinda hard to use/explain. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 12:38, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

== Brace for impact on MapleStory guide==
I'm going to Sleepywood to ask for help on the guide... but just as an FYI, generally 1 or 2 malicious people will come in and try to demolish the guide (if from GFAQS, about 5 of them will come :-/ ). If I'm not on for whatever reason, just know that you can go back to an old &quot;file&quot; in ~4 clicks.
# Click on the &quot;history&quot; on the top of the screen
# click on the date of the last good edit
# click on the edit button
# Click save page

This will save an old version as the &quot;main&quot; page, and thus, undoing whatever the other guys have done. You can go back on *any* history file. Every edit is saved as an edit, and can be undone in this way. (much much easier than combing through the article again). By clicking &quot;last&quot; and &quot;current&quot;, you can see the differences between the last version, and the current version. Pretty easy stuff, but I can see where someone could get confused.

Just know, whatever they do with mouse actions and so forth, you (or anyone) can undo in 4 clicks of a button :) (plus the possibility of being banned from editing, more on that later) Admins , can do it in 1 click, and [[User:Derbeth]] generally gets the obvious vandalisms in an instant (they got a little program that scans all edits).

Of course, only do that when it is obviously a vandal. If they are posting misinformation (aka, they are n00bs who think too much of themselves) then move it into an FAQ section or something. (Like what I've done in the [[Maple_Story/BowmanGuide/Skills#Anti-Builds | Bowmen Anti-Builds]] section. ) If you aren't sure, post it up and the admin will talk to you. They are generally nice about those kinds of things :)

In the case of trying to find who the vandal is, just click on the &quot;last&quot; on the history file. You will see what he edited.

If it is too much, you can ask for Admins to ban a specific IP address or username on the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism_in_progress | Vandalism in Progress]] page.

Also, the admins have an idea of [[Wikibooks:Assume_good_faith]]. Basically, use common sense here. Dont ask someone to be banned because they are doing a newbie test (usually they are in the form of &quot;omfg, are you sure i can edit here?&quot;). But if they do it more than a few times... go ahead and ask them :) --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 13:00, 16 December 2005 (UTC)


== Origonal Research ==
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Maple_Story/ThiefGuide#Endure_or_Booster.3F

Hmm, is this your own opinion or is this agreed by most Sins? Sleepywood guys don't seem to agree that high Endure is better than high Booster. Then again, I'm not a thief so blah.

: Well, I went ahead and tried to make Booster sound better, but still, look it over... I really dont know what I'm talking bout here anyway :) --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:25, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

I hope you don't mind :) Of course, if you do, you can always remove it. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 06:47, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

== Graphics ==
I didn't do the bowman graphics, though I am alright at doing graphics IMO. (enough to understand what looks good) :-) Yeah, I'll do them, my email is prtiglao@gmail.com. Tell me when you send them. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 21:47, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

== brilliant ==

whoever wrote this document is a genius. My sincere thanks to you. IT will defenetely change the way i think. May God bless you.


==Recommendations for gender changes,etc.==
I think that the issue of making it gender neutral would defeat the purpose for having the article. It is after all, according to the title, &quot;a guide for getting a girl (for guys)..&quot; That being said, I think that to resolve the issue that there could be similar guides such as attracting women (for women) etc. The problem of removing gender, etc for a dating guide is that it would dramatically weaken the article and make it not much value for anyone, male or female trying to meet a woman. For example, straight men and lesbians almost certainly will have different takes on how to attract a woman, or even, which women they are more likely to try to meet.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The sample essay is one of my own works, I hope it works for this page, Stephanie Wolf

== strengthening argument example ==

I've shortened/simplified sentences throughout argument section for easy clarity.  But I'm curious about the example.  The ToDo mentions to strengthen the example.  Can we rewrite the sample argument given by Stephanie Wolf?  Or should we create a new argumentative example?  And if we would rewrite her example, how should we make note that this is her example, but has since been reworked since first posting?  Karl Klint

I think it's okay to rewrite the essay as you see fit. There's already a disclaimer about how the essay has been changed. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 15:10, 3 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''3 types of services'''

==Service started by init==
 1. Configured in /etc/inittab
 2. Typically non-TCP/IP services,
         e.g. dial-in Modems, X windows system, serial ports
 3. Provide respawn capability
 '''4. Changes to inittab can be activated with init q'''

==Services launched by System V startup scripts==

 1. Process are started by System V init script method
 2. Program Name often end in 'd'
 3. Script takes start, stop, restart etc. arguments
 4. two ways to start services
        a. /etc/init.d/ldp start
        b. service ldp start
 5. To start service automatically in a runlevel, we need a start and kill symbolic link in appropriate run level '''/etc/rc.d/rc[0-6].d'''
 
==Service launched by xinetd==

1. unlike inetd xinetd does not require that the services in its configuration file be listed in /etc/services

2. It can do access control on all services based on:
   a. address of remote host
   b. time of access
   c. name of remote host
   d. domain name of remote host

3. It can prevent denial-of-access attacks by

 a. placing limits on the number of servers for each service (avoids process table overflows)
 b. placing an upper bound on the number of processes it will fork
 c. placing limits on the size of log files it creates
 d. placing limits on the number of connection a single host can initiate
 e. place limits on the rate of incoming connections
 f. discontinue services if the load exceeds specified limit

===Controlling access with 'hosts.allow' and 'hosts.deny' ===

'''ACCESS CONTROL FILES'''
 The access control software consults two files. The search stops at the first match:
 1· Access will be granted when a (daemon,client) pair matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.allow file.
 2· Otherwise, access will be denied when a (daemon,client) pair matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.deny file.
 3· Otherwise, access will be granted.
 A  Non-existing  access  control  file is treated as if it were an empty file. 
    Thus, access control can be turned off by providing no access control files.

=='chkconfig' to manager services==

'''Dones not modify current state of System V services'''

'''Changes to services managed my xinetd comes into effict immediatly'''

'''Can also manage xinetd services'''

'''Usage Example'''
 1.  chkconfig --list                                     :lists all services in all runlevels
 2.  chkconfig &lt;service&gt; list                             :lists &lt;service&gt; on/off status in all runlevels
 2.  chkconfig &lt;service&gt; on                               :enables service in runlevel 2,3,4 , and 5
 3.  chkconfig &lt;service&gt; off                              :disables service in runlevel 2,3,4 , and 5
 4.  chkconfig &lt;service&gt; add                              :ensures either a kill or start symbolic link is setup for every runlevel
 5.  chkconfig &lt;service&gt; del                              :removes service from chkconfig management
 6.  chkconfig --level &lt;levels&gt; &lt;service&gt; &lt;on|off|reset&gt;  :turn service on/off in specified levels

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page about DbC focuses on Design by Contract more closely
than its [[w:Design by contract|cousin]]. The reason is that
Eiffel's DbC (and that of very few other languages) provide close integration of
''complete'' DbC with all aspects of the respective language, ''and'' the respective language's
definitions.

__TOC__

== Designing by Contract ==

»Not without my abstract data types.«

First, Design by Contract applies to modules, to the routines in the
modules, to loops in subroutines, and between statements.  Exceptions
are involved, too. That is to say, you cannot have partial
contracts. Contracts involve the whole module at every level of
refinement.

If you set up a module(!) contract, the contract's clauses
apply to an entire module throughout its entire life time.
If you use a module that has a contract, you are obliged
to obey its visible rules.

There are two views of a module, the client's view, and
the supplier's view.  When you write a subroutine, and the subroutine
calls other subroutines contained in some module, then your subroutine
becomes a client of the module. The client sees two parts
of the module's contract:

# the module's invariants and
# the preconditions and the postconditions of the module's subroutines.

The module itself is considered a supplier from the clients point
of view, it supplies subroutines.
The supplier sees more of the module and adds some internal contract clauses,
so to speak. The supplier will have to provide, that is, write

# the module's invariants,
# the preconditions and the postconditions of the module's subroutines,
# loop invariants and loop variants,
# check instructions
# consistent exception handling

All of these are assertions, or, in the case of exceptions, consistent with assertions.

Check the presence of supporting facilities per language here: [[w:Design by contract]].

=== Assertions ===

The purpose of an assertion is twofold: First, it states expected values of (computed) variables and their relations. Second, it facilitates testing that the variables do have the values stated and that the relations are indeed true.  Being part of a program, assertions can be used as run-time checks of variables and their relations. But at the same time, assertions allow reasoning about the program before it is run. You use assertions for showing that a module, subroutine, loop, etc. is correct. 

Each assertion is a Boolean expression, and is either '''True''' or '''False'''.
Example:

 &lt;math&gt;s = 0&lt;/math&gt; '''or else''' &lt;math&gt;g(s) = 2 * t&lt;/math&gt;

There are two relations in the example involving two variables, some values are computed.
The two equality tests are either '''True''' or '''False''', and are connected by '''or else''',
a Boolean operator.

Taken to the module level, assertions can express requirements that a client must satisfy
when calling the module's subroutine. The requirements are stated as preconditions of
a subroutine, that is, assertions involving the subroutine's formal arguments and possibly other features of the module.
In return, a subroutine's postcondition describes what the subroutine will have to offer as a result.
Again, the postcondition is expressed using an assertion involving the subroutine's results and
possibly other features of the module. A typical subroutine description, ''part'' of the module's ''contract''
might look like this:

   pop
         {{Ada/--| remove the topmost item}}
      '''require'''
         has_items: '''not''' is_empty
      '''ensure'''
         one_less: count = '''old''' count - 1

The subroutine &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; takes no argument, and it doesn't return anything.
However, it modifies the module, a stack. Therefore the pre- and postconditions
are assertions that refer to other features of the module, &lt;code&gt;is_empty&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;. Useful names are attached to the assertions for reference.

To complete the contract, another assertion is added at the module level,
the module invariant. The relations of the module invariant inform the client
about the state of the module by saying what is guaranteed between each call of a subroutine
of the module. Example:

  '''invariant'''
     sensible_count: count &gt;= 0

Contract ''violations'' are assertions that evaluate to '''False'''.
Typically, when the program does not live up to its assertions, an exception is raised, because the program is obviously wrong.
The situation is then handled using the exception mechanisms of the language, bridled by the rules that Design by Contract requires.


Extensive program analysis based on assertions can in some cases be performed at compile time.
This amounts in a mechanical proof that certain checks are not necessary.
The checks can then be omitted from the compiled program. See [[w:SPARK programming language]].

----
:'''If an assertion is false, there is a bug in the program!'''
----

The reason is that the program does not produce the results that it must produce
according to the assertions. Here is a list of the possible assertions in Design by Contract
('''C''' means visible to clients (outside the module),
'''S''' means visible to supplier (inside the module)):

; Module Invariants (C, S): Module invariants assert what is true after initialisation of the module. They also assert the same truths before and after any execution of one of its subprograms.
; Preconditions (C, S): A precondition of a subprogram states what must be true before calling the subprogram. Usually, it expresses relations of (computed) module variables and subprogram parameters. Only if the precondition is true can the subprogram execute in order to fulfil its postcondition. 
; Postconditions (C, S): Postconditions state what will be true about (computed) variables and relations when the subprogram has finished successfully.
; (Loop variants) (S): A loop variant is an expression (of type Natural) whose value decreases towards zero on each iteration of the loop. Typically one of the variables of the loop is used to express this property. The loop variant guarantees ''termination''.
; Loop invariants (S): A loop invariant expresses a relation that is true when the loop is entered, or entered once more. The relation will name variables of interest to the loop.
; Checks (S): When a statement has executed, it will likely have changed the value of one or more variables by assignment. A check expresses the programmer's expectation of the relation between these variables after the assignment.

Preconditions P and postconditions Q of a subprogram &lt;tt&gt;S&lt;/tt&gt; frame
the subprogram in the sense of a [[w:Hoare_logic|Hoare triple]]:
&lt;center&gt;
{at least P} S {guarantees Q},
&lt;/center&gt;
''provided'' the module invariant is True before and after
the call! Notice this last requirement. The module must be in a known good state,
because the preconditions and the postconditions may refer to the module's state.

==== Design by contract is not input checking ====

By implication, the rule from above about false assertions means that
assertions are not to be used as replacements for input
validation. When you can't trust your input, use
means provided by your language in a conditional, like the
{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Valid}} attribute in Ada.
For example, calling
Sqrt{{Ada/delimiter|(}}x{{Ada/delimiter|)}} where
x = {{Ada/operator|-}}1{{Ada/delimiter|.}}23
is a bug in using &lt;tt&gt;Sqrt&lt;/tt&gt;, a violation of the contract.
The caller has failed to test x before sending it to
the math routine.

==== Assertions can't replace conditionals ====

Can you pass all kinds of numbers to &lt;tt&gt;Sqrt&lt;/tt&gt; and just prepare to
handle the exception raised when the precondition of &lt;tt&gt;Sqrt&lt;/tt&gt;
evaluates to false? In other words, can you deliberately ignore the
contract? The answer is no, for at least two reasons.

# If a module has been shown to be correct, assertion checking might have been turned off for this module, expecting that clients will fulfil their part of the contract. A contract violation by the caller could then go unnoticed and might produce a vastly erroneous computation.
# If the called subprogram is not &lt;tt&gt;Sqrt&lt;/tt&gt; but controls the speed of a train, you can't just pass invalid input until it doesn't happen to make the speed-control subprogram fail with an exception. Worse, see 1.

=== Example: A Stack ===

(This example is given in very minimal Ada notation, knowing that language support
for DbC is pretty good, in particular in Ada 2005, but limited.
Imagining '''require''', '''ensure''', and '''invariant''' in place of
the comments marked &lt;tt&gt;pre&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;post&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;inv&lt;/tt&gt;
will render the following closer to the Eiffel original. Use the facilities
that your language provides for expressing assertions and exception
handling.)

The exclamation points (`&lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;') below are only a notational device.
They stand for the facilities available with the respective languages.
Their meaning is only informative of the contract.

 {{Ada/keyword|generic}}
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Item {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|private}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | any definite type that permits assignment}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|package}} Stack {{Ada/keyword|is}}
 
    {{Ada/-- | last in first out storage, initially empty}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} is_empty {{Ada/keyword|return}} Boolean{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | is there an element on the stack?}}
    {{Ada/-- | ! post: result &amp;#61; (count &amp;#61; 0)}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} count {{Ada/keyword|return}} Natural{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | number of items currently on the stack}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} top {{Ada/keyword|return}} Item{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | the topmost item}}
    {{Ada/-- | ! pre: not is_empty}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} push{{Ada/delimiter|(}}x{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Item{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/--| add `x` on top of the stack}}
    {{Ada/--| ! post: count &amp;#61; old count + 1}}
    {{Ada/--| ! post: not is_empty}}
    {{Ada/--| ! post: top &amp;#61; x}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} pop{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | remove the topmost item}}
    {{Ada/-- | ! pre: not is_empty}}
    {{Ada/-- | ! post: count &amp;#61; old count - 1}}
 
 
    {{Ada/-- | ! inv: count &gt;&amp;#61; 0}}
    {{Ada/-- | ! inv: (count &amp;#61; 0) &amp;#61; is_empty}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Stack{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
Notice that up to this point, there is no executable statement in the
module. It's just a package specification with contractual pre- and
postconditions, and a module invariant.  Yet the module's contract is
complete as far as clients of this module are concerned.

The function &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; states as precondition that there
must be an element on the stack, otherwise it cannot succeed.
To express this, it refers to another function of the same
module, &lt;code&gt;is_empty&lt;/code&gt;.
Note that the module invariant does allow an empty stack.
The function &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; has neither precondition nor postcondition,
but is mentioned in a module invariant. This means that clients can still
expect that &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; returns a value &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt;

Now if
is_empty {{Ada/operator|1==}} False
then by
count {{Ada/operator|1=&gt;=}} 0,
count {{Ada/operator|1= &gt;}} 0
must be true because
{{Ada/keyword|not}} is_empty
if and only if
count {{Ada/operator|1=/=}} 0.

----
:'''A software component is correct in the sense of these contracts if you finally prove it, using the assertions and rules from the language definition.'''
----

The internal view of the module, in this case a package body,
shows how assertions can be placed in an program.
It is important to understand that {{Ada/keyword|pragma}} assert
in Ada, '''require''' in Eiffel, etc. are tightly integrated
with the languages' exception handling mechanisms. This is
unlike what you might be guessing if you know C's assert.
(The implementation of the example stack is actually based on Ada.Containers,
similar to how Eiffel's STACK classes are usually implemented. It could also be based on
[[http://www.digitalmars.com/d/dbc.html D]]'s
[[http://www.digitalmars.com/d/arrays.html arrays]], or whatever language you choose.)

 {{Ada/keyword|pragma}} Assertion_Policy{{Ada/delimiter|(}}Check{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   ...
    s{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Vector{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   ...
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} top {{Ada/keyword|return}} Item {{Ada/keyword|is}}
    {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
       {{Ada/keyword|pragma}} assert{{Ada/delimiter|(}}{{Ada/keyword|not}} is_empty{{Ada/delimiter|,}} &quot;stack is empty&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
       {{Ada/keyword|return}} s{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Last_Element{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|end}} top{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
Think about the effects of turning assertion checking
on or off. Assertions express a contract, they do not
handle invalid input.

=== Exceptions and Contracts ===

What if a precondition is true, but some statement from
the executing subprogram raises an exception?
Chances are that the postcondition can no longer be
established by the subprogram. It will fail. However,
what about the state of the module?

The first answer to the question about the state of the module
is given by this rule:

----
:'''When an exception is allowed to propagate from the subprogram, the module invariant must first be established.'''
----

The second answer can be different, depending on the language.
The Eiffel way, for reference, is to retry the routine in case
of an exception:
If the exception is handled, and the subprogram should
retry to fulfil its postcondition, then both its
precondition, and the module invariant must first be established.
(Otherwise the system cannot act like invoking the routine again
without violating the contract.)

Ada, like some other languages, has nested blocks, so
exception handling could start from a block's preconditions.
Hence if you manage to restore the block's preconditions,
you can retry the block. A block may be nested inside a loop,
for example. Then your handler will have to assign
values to variables satisfying the necessary preconditions
of a loop execution.

=== Inheritance ===

TBD

In brief, the preconditions of overridden methods are or-ed,
the post-conditions are and-ed.

For modules built around derived types, it must be possible to
substitute an object of a derived type for an object of the parent
type such that a dispatching call can still rely on the parent's
contract. Likewise, the postconditions of the feature that gets
actually called must imply the postconditions of the parents'
features.

==== A Flaw ====

Given an OO parent type T, together with one of its methods,

  {{Ada/keyword|type}} T {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|tagged}} {{Ada/keyword|private}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
  {{Ada/keyword|function}} foo{{Ada/delimiter|(}}x{{Ada/delimiter|:}} T{{Ada/delimiter|;}} n{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Count{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} Natural{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
  {{Ada/-- |! pre: n &gt;&amp;#61; 42}}

and a type derived from T, called D, with the method overridden,

  {{Ada/keyword|type}} D {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|new}} T {{Ada/keyword|with}} {{Ada/keyword|private}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
  
  {{Ada/keyword|overriding}}
  {{Ada/keyword|function}} foo{{Ada/delimiter|(}}x{{Ada/delimiter|:}} D{{Ada/delimiter|;}} n{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Count{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} Natural{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
  {{Ada/-- |! pre: n &gt;&amp;#61; 66}}

imagine a reference to an OO variable of some type
in the T hierarchy. Then

  {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
      x{{Ada/delimiter|:}} {{Ada/keyword|access}} T{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Class}} {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/keyword|new}} D{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
  {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
      x{{Ada/delimiter|.}}foo{{Ada/delimiter|(}}42{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
  {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Who is to blame?

=== Concurrency ===

TBD

One new (to the discussion so far) problem introduced by concurrent execution is this:
Suppose

# a module's routines should do their work on behalf of more than one caller at a time,
# an &amp;ldquo;instance&amp;rdquo; of some routine may be interrupted by another &amp;ldquo;instance&amp;rdquo;

Then for example what was true about the module state when the first call was initiated
might no longer be true after executing the second call has changed the state
of the module. This extends to pre/postcondition checks:
Since the assertions of the routines will likely refer to
their module's state (and to anything visible in general), they can become inconsistent.

A first attempt at a solution is to make the precondition check, the execution
of a routine, and the postcondition check sequential and exclusive.
That is, as long as a caller is served by the routine, other calls to the
routine are made pending until the routine has finished.

But in addition, since the routine's assertions are about ''module'' state,
any service of the module called by any other caller should be put on hold.

interfaces).

== welcome ==

Hello and welcome to Wikibooks. Have you read [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]? Pages you're creating are not linked (every book should be placed in a [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves|bookshelf]]. Every book should also have proper chapter names, as it is written in the naming policy.

If you have any questions, leave me a message. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:53, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

: I think you contribute useful material, the problem is that our visitors should be able to find them. I suggest you put your pages as chapters of [[Guide to UNIX]] (you can consult [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] who planned this book where to put your work). You could also gather your pages into a new book, but I don't think we need two books on the same subject. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:02, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

== subpages ==

I moved the subpages from your user page into your user namespace. If you have any questions, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:47, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: prominance → prominence, warrents → warrants, intepreted → interpreted,  tv →  TV, Unfortunatly → Unfortunately using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The collection of the numerical data is a VERY important aspect of statistics - any mistakes made or bias introduced during collection will be reflected in the analysis and the conclusions subsequently made based upon the data. If the data is not collected properly then at best the analysis will be a waste of time and at worst mislead with serious consequences.


If you collect data about TV-viewing by making a rapid door-to-door survay in your area then you are '''NOT''' obtaining information about the viewing habits in your neighbourhood, you are obtaining information about the viewing habits from the people in your neighbourhood ''who were in, answered the door and answered your questions''.

&lt;h3&gt; Interpretation of statistics &lt;/h3&gt;
One of the first things that students of statistics must recognise is that the results extracted from numbers can be interpreted wrongly, or by (abused) selection deliberately distorted. To avoid errors, it is essential that the statistician:
a) Be extremely careful in selecting informaiton to avoid [[biased]] results.
b) Make only those deductions as are strictly logical.
c) Beware of &quot;third party&quot; sources of correlation.

&lt;h3&gt; Biased sources &lt;/h3&gt;
One of the problems facing a statistician is that the sources of information may be biased. A statistician must always ask questions such as:
a) ''Who'' says this?
b) ''Why'' does he say it?
c) ''What does he/she stand to gain'' from saying it?
d) ''How&quot; does he/she ''know''?
e) Could he/she be ''lying''? Or ''guessing''?
f) Is there ''another explanation''?

== Populations ==
We call the group of people (or items) about which we want to obtain information the ''population''. Defining the population is sometimes tricky, and sometimes the full extent of the population may not be known - for example the number of people with un-diagnosed AIDS is inherently unknown.

== Samples ==
If the population is relatively small and easily surveyed we may examine every item in the population. However usually the population is either too big or too expensive or too inaccessible to survey every item, and so you may have to be satisfied with examining only a part, or ''sample'' of the total population.

=== Sample frame ===
A list of the entire population from which items can be selected to form a sample is called a sample frame.

=== Costs, accuracy and samples ===
Although it may appear better to survey the whole population than rely on a small sample, this is often not so. Firstly it may be expensive, with the costs exceeding the value of the results.
Sometimes sampling only a fraction of the population can result in improved accuracy because very careful attention can be given to a small sample that time limits or the availability of skilled surveyors will not allow for a whole population survey.

== Methods of collection ==
Collection of statistical data is generally achieved by one of (or a combination of) the following methods:
a) Direct measurement
b) Interviewing
c) Abstration of data from published statistics
d) Indirect questionnaire 
f) Solicitation

=== Direct observation ===
This is usually the best method, as it reduces the chance of incorrect data and you have control over the quality of the data being recorded, it is also one of the most expensive. In some cases it is not possible - you cannot observe where people would go on holiday if they had unlimited money.

=== Interviewing ===
Interviews can be an effective technique, but only if considerable care is taken in how the questions are framed and the answers collated. 
The results from interviews can also be misleading because the responder may (a) mis-understand the question, (b) have forgotten some of the information, (c) lie in an attempt to provide the ''right'' answer, (d) lie to hide the truth. 
Different standards in how interviewers record the results can also produce distortion. If the questioner asks &quot;did you watch XYZ on TV last night - yes or no&quot; and gets the response &quot;part of it&quot;, is this a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot;?

=== Abstraction of data from published statistics ===
Data that has been collected by or directly for an investigation is ''primary data'', and the investigator should be fully aware of the conditions and limitations of that data.
Data that is extracted from information that was collected by another investigation is ''secondary data'', and usually the investigator is not fully aware of the conditions and limitations of that data, however often this may be the only practical source of data (e.g. variations in coal production over the past 100 years).
The inherent limits on the investigators knowledge of the data mean that whenever use is to be made of data from published sources, that consideration is given as the purpose of the original data collection - and in particular would that purpose mean that there may be bias if you use the data for your investigation.

=== Indirect questionnaire ===
The indirect questionnaire is typified by the postal questionnaire - it arrives unsolicited, is expected to be completed and then returned by post, although the modern version may also arrive electronically. This is usually the least satisfactory method of data collection for the simple reason that only a few such questionnaires are ever returned (15% would be good), and those that are returned may show strong bias, since the return is done only by those who have a sufficiently strong interest in the subject or by those with an intent to mislead.
There is an exception in most countries - and that is the statutory Census where force of law applies to its completion, although the census authorities still need to use checking interviews to verify the data.

=== Solicitation ===
Solicitation is typified by the &quot;suggestions box&quot;, by the &quot;complaints box&quot;. Data collected is almost worthless. Unfortunately it is a method that is being widely used by some parts of the media in its modern form &quot;SMS this number ...&quot;, with the &quot;results&quot; then given high prominence. This method only produces data from those with sufficiently strong views to be bothered with the time/expense of completing the responses.

== Design of questionnaires ==
Whenever information is sought from people, it is essential that the questions are carefully constructed. The questions should:
a) Be simple to understand.
b) Be unambiguous.
c) Limit the possible responses (tick the pre-printed answer).
d) Be concise and short.
e) Be relevant to the respondent.
f) Align with the goal(s), objective(s)and purpose of the study.
g) Be meaningful to the respondent.
h) Have a clear focus
i) Not suggest the desired answer.
j) Be arranged in a logical sequence.

== Methods of sampling ==

=== Bias revisited ===
When we take a sample from a population, it is generally not advisable to take just the easiest items - we are seeking information about the whole population, and must therefore take our data from across the whole population without allowing any particular set from the population to have undue influence than it really warrants. Unfortunately it is not just suspected or known sources of undue influence that must be avoided, we must also beware of ''unsuspected'' sources of bias.

=== Random samples ===
The possibility of taking a sample with ''unsuspected'' bias may be reduced by taking a random sample. A random sample is a sample that has been selected in such a way that every item in the population has an equal chance of being selected.

Random samples are NOT perfect samples - a random sample (especially if small) is not necessarily a good cross section of the population. A random sample of people living in the UK could result in a sample of people that all live in London. A random sample does NOT guarantee a sample free from bias, it simply guarantees that the ''method of selection is free from bias''.

=== Quota sampling ===
If the population can be divided into different groups then it may be practical to set a quota for each of those different groups, and then randomly select within the groups.

=== Multi-stage sampling ===
Divide the population into groups and then randomly select a number of these groups for the next stage. Each of the selected groups is divided into sub-groups and a number of these sub-groups is randomly selected for the next stage. This process is repeated until the size of the sub-groups is sufficiently small.
This process is commonly used for limiting the travel involved with surveys, with each of the groupings representing different geographical areas.

=== Systematic sampling ===
This is a simple method - if you want a 10% sample of the size of bolts from a production line, then take every 10th bolt produced. This method is commonly used on a production line.

If there is something systematic in the way the production line works that means that there is a periodicity in the bolt manufacture every 10th bolt (the machinest knows that it will be tested), then the result will be biased. 

=== Stratified sampling ===
This is a refinement on quota sampling. If the relative size of each of the different population groups is known then it is possible to set the size of the quota for each of the population groups. If this process is performed well, then the results from stratified sampling usually show less bias than pure random sampling.

=== Convenience Sampling ===
Ths is NOT a scientific/statistical method of sampling but is unfortunately used by companies. Convenience sampling is selecting items based on how easy it is to get a response. For example standing outside a specific grocery store collecting data and then making general judgements on shopping habits. THIS is not true judgements and are biased. You did not collect data about the general shopping habits of the population, you collected data on shoppers who visited that specific store during those specific hours and who took the time to full in your questionnaire. IT is important to know these limitations.

=== Reporting methods used ===
Whatever method has been used to collect your data, it is essential that you document the method, and describe the limitations on that data. If you are using secondary data (i.e. data in a published source) then it is essential that the source of the data is fully documented. Only by taking the care to describe your data sources can the results from, and limitations of, your analysis be understood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you wish to be formally listed as an author of Serial Data Communications, please sign your name below.

According to the United States Code for registering a copyrighted work, you must include your nationality (what country you claim citizenship in) and the country you are currently residing in, if different.  It is also suggested by the U.S. Copyright office to include the year you were born, for identification purposes.  They also ask for the year of death, and if you know of a Wikibookian who has passed away, this would also be useful.  How exactly we are going to collect this information for users and contributors of this Wikibooks is totally unknown, and is going to be an interesting little ride.  Please add comments [[Talk:Serial Programming:List of Authors|in the discussion page]] if you have any reservations about giving this information out.  This is moving into new territory here, so we don't know exactly what is going to be required or if new policies should or ought to be developed.

Keep in mind, this information is needed only if you want to be credited formally as the author of this Wikibook and have your information correctly cited in any formal registration procedure for this Wikibook.  Efforts to get this information put into the general user record of MediaWiki have met with huge resistance even on a voluntary basis, so this is the only forum for you to even put this sort of information out to the public.  This information may also be needed for enforcement of copyright laws in the unfortunate situation where somebody copies this Wikibook contrary to the terms of the GFDL.  An attempt to contact you would then be done to see if you would be willing to enforce your copyright for this Wikibook.

Anonymous authors include those who made edits without logging in as a user.  While edits of this nature are appreciated, there is no way we can give attribution to any specific person unless they have created an account here.

      <text xml:space="preserve"> NOTE: Sorry for the long file, dependencies are unknown at the moment.
 The clean up takes a bit longer than expected, but the file should already a lot shorter than it was in December 2005.
 I've kept most directory names. If you know BIE, please contribute by removing files BIE 6.0.4 do not need to function,
 or reinsert files I've deleted that are needed.

This is a reference for the main article on [[Business Integration Engine]], BIE version 6.0.4. Here you can find the names and paths to all files shipped with GNU/Linux archive file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hydroboration/oxidation is a two-step reaction that converts alkenes into alcohols with anti-Markovnikov regiochemistry.

First, borane, BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is allowed to react with the alkene. The boron atom will generally react with the less substituted carbon, and it will also donate a proton to the other carbon across the double bond. If there is an excess of the alkene, a trialkylborane will be formed.  That is, one molecule of borane can react with up to three molecules of the alkane if necessary.  Tetrahydrofuran, a cyclic ether, is usually used as a solvent for this first step in the reaction because it can form a complex with the borane that gives the boron atom a complete octet (boron only has 6 valence electrons when it is in pure borane, which makes it highly unstable.)

Now, we have a trialkylborane, which may be fine if that is what one is trying to synthesize, but most chemists are more interested in converting this borane intermediate into 3 alcohol molecules.  The way this is done is to react the trialkylborane with hydrogen peroxide in a basic, aqueous solution. This causes the borane intermediate to be converted into three molecules of an alcohol. B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is also produced, but is probably ignored by most chemists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{rfd-survived}}

The &quot;how to avoid&quot; tips are confusing and not really helpful.  Keep a bent over stance? When? All the time? When fighting someone? Similarly if one is caught in a headlock, doesn't this imply that the aggressor was applying the element of surprise and/or their superior strength to thwart the somewhat obvious &quot;duck out from under their arms&quot; escape?

The escape technique shown could be improved as well.  In the first and third panels the victim is shown with their right arm hanging limply to the side.  It would be much better to use this arm to protect the face from punches.  Secondly the movement of twisting the body to place the shoulder in front of the aggressor is unneccessary and impractical if the aggressor has an especially tight or strong grip.  A better way to proceed is to reach around the back and grab the inside of the aggressor's left elbow with the left hand.  Alternative grips are grabbing the clothing on the back if the aggressor's elbow is not available due to the punching action described above, or if the aggressor is shirtless, reaching up to cup the underside of the left shoulder or reaching around the waist.

Third point of contention: in step three the aggressor is shown splaying his right arm open for apparently no reason.  In reality if an aggressor is serious he will often hold the head grip even after both combatants have landed on the ground.  This article should go on to explain how to properly escape from such a situation.

: The how to avoid the headlock tips are good. Protecting the face is a good tip to add. The images shown could be improved and perhaps replaced with drawings. I disagree with the body twist being uneccessary and impractical, this move is particulary effective vs a bigger, stronger attacker. Its a Ju-jitzu move and in reality I've used it a few times. Maybe the best thing to do is find someone who knows more about Ju-jitzu so it could be categorized properly. If you know more ways just add them, I'll call this the Ju-jitzu way till I learn more. [[User:Chrismo|Chrismo]] 02:50, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

Another point to remember is that when your arm is in front of the aggressors torso try to elbow them in the stomach. I have used this to good effect and it left me on my feet and the aggressor bent over. This is a desirable position to be in as you have the opportunity to run or if need be to strike again.


This page needs more general guidelines to defending against a headlock. (And btw, &quot;How to Defend Against the Headlock&quot; would probably be better than &quot;How To Escape the Headlock&quot; since it encompasses avoiding the headlock in addition to escaping from it, but perhaps I'm being too picky.) Specifically, I was taught in kenpo karate to 1.) be aware of your environment so that you don't end up in headlocks, and 2.) if you're in a headlock, you tuck your chin, regain your posture by stepping forwards and staying low (almost like you're kneeling), and counterstriking fast, at the moment you land if possible (counter-striking being anything from a punch or an elbow to a very effective pinch to the opponent's inner thigh.) I think general guidelines like these would work in more situations than specific movements like the one in the photographs.

In addition, I have an issue with &quot;Keep a stance that is more bent over than straight up.&quot; It's always best to keep better posture than your opponent when fighting, and you can't do that by bending over while your opponent's standing up. I don't doubt it'd make it harder for him to get a headlock on you, but it'd make it easier for him to punch you in the ribs, grab you and pull you in a direction you don't expect, etc. [[User:66.189.116.168|66.189.116.168]] 04:53, 3 September 2006 (UTC) John S.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}
{{Prerequisite|Digital Circuits}}
{{Reading level|Advanced}}

This book serves as an introduction to the field of microprocessor design and implementation. It is intended for students in computer science or computer or electrical engineering who are in the third or fourth years of an undergraduate degree. While the focus of this book will be on Microprocessors, many of the concepts will apply to other ASIC design tasks as well.

The reader should have prior knowledge in [[Digital Circuits]] and possibly some background in [[Semiconductors]] although it isn't strictly necessary. The reader also should know at least one [[Subject:Assembly languages|Assembly Language]]. Knowledge of higher-level languages such as [[C Programming|C]] or [[C++]] may be useful as well, but are not required. Sections about soft-core design will require prior knowledge of [[Programmable Logic]], and a prior knowledge of at least one HDL.

{{merge to | Using Wikibooks/Print versions and PDFs }}

[[Image:Exquisite-print_printer.png|64px|right]]

The aim of Wikibooks is to create useful books. Sometimes people want to print a book. This is not easy because books at Wikibooks are divided into chapters on separate pages. However, anyone knowing how to use templates can easily create a print version of a book by automatically including all contents of a book onto a single page. Furthermore, with all content of a book on a single page, it is easier to create a PDF version of this book. This can be done automatically, for example using [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] or the &quot;Print to file&quot; feature of your browser (either to a pdf or PostScript file &amp;mdash; the ps is easily converted to pdf later).

Not every book needs a print version &amp;mdash; lots of books here are useful only online. But if you feel one might need to get a book printed &amp;mdash; '''be bold''' and create it. See '''[[:Category:Books with print version]]''' for a list of books that already have a single page version for continuous reading. Many of these may also be available as PDF Files.

== How to create print version ==
Generally, it is a good solution to learn from examples. See [[Python Programming/Print version]] and read these quick guidelines.

=== Preparing a book ===
No navigational templates used in a book should be printed. Check this using the &quot;Print preview&quot; function of your browser. To prevent a block of text from being printed, cover it with &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. Use &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;notice&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;notice metadata&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; for cleanup templates like {{tlx|stub}}, {{tlx|cleanup}}; or &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; ... &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Similarly, if you want some content to be displayed only in the print version but not at normal reading, use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; ... &lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Note that text inside this tag won't be visible in the page preview during editing, so you may want to copy it to [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]], edit it there and copy it back.

=== Creating separate page for print version ===
In brief:
# Create the page &lt;!--''Book:Print version'' or --&gt;''Book/Print version'' (for a book called ''Book'') and link to it from the TOC
# Insert the {{tlx|print version notice|Book|Book/Print_version}} template to the top of the book's Print version page.
# Copy the TOC as an ordered list
# Insert every chapter like a template, preceded by the chapter's title. Remember to include a chapter with the list of authors.
#: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; = Chapter name = &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
#: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; {{:Book/Chapter name}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

'''Do not cut-and-paste any text from a book to its print version (except TOC).'''

=== Linking from the book ===
{{Print version}}

Make a visible link to the print version from the book's cover or table of contents. You can simply insert the {{tl|print version}} template in the page ''Book'' if the page of the printed version is ''Book/Print version'' to create a box like the one shown. If you make your own links, it's a good practice to have a direct link to the edit page for the print version. Then people who want to change something in the print version won't have to wait until the whole book is loaded to click the &quot;edit&quot; button.
Some books have multiple printable versions; link to each of them from the book's table of contents -- see [[Help:Local manuals of style#Print versions]].

=== Lengthy print versions ===
Sometimes print versions become too lengthy&amp;mdash;in such cases, you should divide it into parts: ''Book/Print version/Part 1'', ''Book/Print version/Part 2''.

=== Copyright problems ===
Using [[w:fair use|fair use]] images in a book may mean that it can't be printed in many countries that don't have a ''fair use'' copyright law, and even in countries that do, books printed with fair use images may have restrictions placed upon them.  For example, there may be restrictions upon commercial sale of the book (for profit or not).  Because of this, '''always avoid fair use images''' if possible and try to replace them by free ones (you might try to search [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]). 

If you have to include fair use images, consider excluding them from print versions of the book. For example, you can exclude images with the &lt;tt&gt;noprint&lt;/tt&gt; markup as explained above.

Note that many &quot;free&quot; images require an attribution to their authors. In online wikibooks this requirement is fulfilled by the link from each image to its description page. In printed books, however, you have to add an explicit attribution for these images. In fact, it's a good practice to include an attribution for all images.

== Use of printed books ==
You can freely use, copy and sell printed Wikibooks. You don't have to get authors' agreements or share profit with them (see [[Wikibooks:Copyrights#Use in hardcopy|details]]).  Remember that Wikibooks has copyrighted content, and the copyright is owned by the contributors, not the Wikimedia Foundation. You can freely copy and use this copyrighted content because the authors have already given you permission to use it under the terms of the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]] and [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]].  Please read that license carefully if you plan on distributing Wikibooks content for the terms of use.  

If you want to have the content available under different terms, you have to contact all of the contributors to the Wikibook for permission, which may present some problems if you can't get ahold of some of them.  A very few Wikibooks are also available under a dual-licensing arrangement subject to different terms as well.  This should be clearly marked and noted on the front page of the Wikibook.

== PDF versions ==
===Simple rudimentary pdf ===
It's easy to create a rudimentary PDF file from a print version. You can use freely available software like [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] or [[w:PDFCreator|PDFCreator]], and proprietary software such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat.

Unfortunately the &quot;print versions&quot; do not contain proper pagination. Pagination, paginated tables of contents and indexes are added by editing the print version with a word processor and creating a PDF File.

===Pdf with pagination ===
Steps:
* Use your web browser to open and save the print version to your own computer as &quot;web page complete&quot; 
* use the HTML-compatible word processor of your choice to open the html file, convert html to a format the word processor, and add paginate the book. 
** In Microsoft Word, this can done by
*** opening the saved HTML file
*** saving it to a word file
*** adding table of content by selecting ''Insert &gt; Field &gt; Index and Tables &gt; TOC'' or ''Preferences-&gt; Table of contents'' for Word 2012 or later. 
*** adding page numbers to the footer
*** save it to a pdf file

The word-processed document can then be converted to PDF using [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] or [[w:PDFCreator|PDFCreator]].

:'''Tips''': cut the book into numerous small HTML files using 'Wordpad' as a text editor if it will not convert to your word processor format. This allows you to locate offending sections etc. Small books can be copied to the clipboard and then pasted into your word processor. (see Talk for more tips).

Also a ready to publish &quot;print version&quot; takes as much effort as creating the book in the first place. There is an entire field out there, including Typesetting and Desktop Publishing, that deals with the subject. And there are dedicated programs like Adobe InDesign, Scribus, and LaTeX/TeX that are specifically made for the task of typesetting. Microsoft Word is suitable for the task, but anyone who plans on doing it in the long term will appreciate the advanced features like kerning, ligatures, word stretching and automatic quality justification algorithms that these programs offer. For example, LaTeX automatically generates Table of Contents and Indices for you.

=== MediaWiki to LaTeX ===
More than 60 % of books with PDF version currently available on the English Wikibooks have been a PDF version created with [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf MediaWiki to LaTeX]. Thanks to [[LaTeX]] the quality is comparable to professionally printed books.

===Upload and Link the pdf files ===
PDF files can be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons just like images. But remember: don't link to PDF like this: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:File.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. This causes the ''entire'' PDF to be downloaded when loading the page. Use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:File:File.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; this will link to the PDF's description page &amp;mdash; or &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Media:File.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; for a direct download link. Remember to tag the file as GFDL and include the edition number in the comment. Also remember not to use a simple URL link to download the PDF, because the PDF will be shown in [[Special:Unusedimages|unused images list]]. Instead, use Media: link (for instance:  &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Media:Special_Relativity.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;). 

PDF files could previously be uploaded to Wikibooks but new files are now uploaded to Commons. If there is an existing PDF file in Wikibooks, this can be updated by the creator but not other users. If a different user wants to update a PDF file, the existing Wikibooks version will need to be deleted by an administrator for &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:File:file.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to point to the new version. Alternatively, the new PDF file can be given a different name.

A collection of a book's pages can be downloaded on-demand as a PDF file as well.  See [[Help:Collections]] for details.


To add a link to your wikibook page, insert 
&lt;pre&gt;
{{PDF version|pdf file name without .pdf|size kb, number pages|description}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
For example
&lt;pre&gt;
{{PDF version|Ada Programming|2,663 kb, 243 pages|Ada Programming}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Tips on PDF versions ===
Some lingo first of all. 12 points to a pica, 6 pica to an inch. Points usually measure vertical distance, pica usually measure horizontal distance. For example, the height of fonts are measured in points. Size 12 Roman font is about 12 points high. The width of columns are usually measured in pica.

* Golden Rule: Rules in layout and art ain't rules. If it looks good, then do it. Think of these as guidelines if you don't know where to start.
* Keep things consistent. Use templates in GUI based programs like Word or InDesign, or use macros in LaTeX to keep pages as a whole consistent. 
** Keep consistent spacing between lines. Usually 120% of the size of the font is used for paragraph reading. For example, size 12 font is spaced by ~14 points. Size 14 font would be spaced by ~16 points. Headlines, nameplates, and so forth don't follow this rule. Only body-text.
** When there is a picture, make sure the space between the words and the start of the picture is consistent. If it is inlined with the text, make sure all 3 or 4 sides of the picture are consistently spaced from the text. If the picture has its own space, say, centered with a caption, make sure the caption is consistently placed, along with the spaces away from the text above the picture as well as below.
* Don't do full justification unless it looks good! When you do full justification with an inadequate program, you easily can get &quot;rivers&quot; of whitespace that is distracting for the reader. Programs with better justification algorithms, like LaTeX or InDesign may still mess up if the columns are too narrow. The best solution is usually to change the wording of the paragraph, but switching to ragged right or increasing the column width helps as well.
* Hyphenation should only occur in full justification (both left side and right side lined up). Hyphenation in ragged right looks strange, and thoughts and words can get lost as the reader looks for the next line.
* Don't bold too many things. '''Bold''' can get '''in''' the '''way''' of your '''text''' in ''ways'' that ''softer'' italic ''emphasis'' doesn't. It is fine to bold headlines or other attention grabbers, but in the body text, try with soft italics first.
* If doing a complicated layout, try the 5 column layout (don't actually use 5 columns. Maybe merge the right 3, and merge the 2 left side columns for notes. Or merge 3 columns to inline a picture in the middle of the page), or the artists rule of 3 to create a layout.
* Know the difference between the hyphen, endash, and emdash. Emdash is the longest, and is used in as a punctuation mark. Endash is used as &quot;to&quot; between numbers. Hyphens are usually the shortest and connect words between lines and compound words.
* Finally: Read the PDF when you are done! Frequent trouble spots are tables, pictures, and the text around large headings. Keep an eye out for widows and orphans, or words on their own lines, or on the next page when a paragraph ends. Don't be afraid to change the words of a paragraph to fit the layout, in fact, it has to be done frequently.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Select the cell that the formula result is going to be displayed in. The formula can be constructed in the formula bar. Always need to put the ''='' sign before a formula. That is how Excel recognizes what you are entering as a formula. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Sign||Operation||Example
|-
| +||Addition||=A1+B1+C1+D1
|-
| -||Subtraction||=A1-A2
|-
|*||Multiplication||=C4*C5
|-
|/||Division||=C4/D4
|-
|(…)||Combination||=A1*(B1+C1)
|}

Click on the '''green checkmark''' to enter the formula, the '''red x''' to cancel the formula. 

==Autofill==
Autofill helps you fill in formulas quickly once you have constructed one in a cell. In order to Autofill, select the cell with the formula. Place your cursor so the small black cross appears in the lower right corner of the cell ('''+'''). Once that cursor is visible, simply drag your formula down the column (or across the row as the case may be). Autofill will change the cell references accordingly.  

''Note that cell references can also change automatically when you copy and paste a formula using the clipboard, unless you use an absolute cell reference (see below).''

E.g.: If the formula in A3 is &lt;tt&gt;=A1+A2&lt;/tt&gt;, when you drag that formula over to B3 then the formula becomes &lt;tt&gt;=B1+B2&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Cell References==
*''Relative Cell References'': cell references that change when the formula is autofilled into different cells, as in the example above.
*''Absolute Cell References:'' if you don't want a certain part of your cell reference to change when you copy the formula to a new cell, you need to put a $ in front of the row and/or column part of the reference (see example below).

E.g.: If the formula in A3 is &lt;tt&gt;=$A$1+A2&lt;/tt&gt;, when you drag that formula over to B3 the formula becomes &lt;tt&gt;=$A$1+B2&lt;/tt&gt;.

To quickly add the dollar symbols use the F4 key, which toggles four ways.  First press gives both row and column absolute, &lt;tt&gt;$A$1&lt;/tt&gt;, second press gives row absolute, &lt;tt&gt;A$1&lt;/tt&gt;, third press gives column absolute, &lt;tt&gt;$A1&lt;/tt&gt; and finally fourth press returns to fully relative, &lt;tt&gt;A1&lt;/tt&gt;.

==AutoSum==
The AutoSum button on the standard toolbar allows you to quickly insert the '''SUM''' function. Select the cell where you want to put the total and then click on the AutoSum button ( ). Excel will insert the '''SUM''' function and take a guess as to what cell range you’d like to sum. Check to make sure the cell range is correct, then press enter to accept the function.

==Functions==
[[Image:excel_formula.gif|right|The formula listed here is: (B4+25)/SUM(D5:F5) . B4 is a cell reference. 25 is a numeric constant. The slash is a division operator. SUM is a function. D5:F5 is a range reference.]]
Excel has created hundreds of functions that prevent you from having to write out complex or repetitive formulas yourself. The cells that you want to perform the function on are either listed, separated by commas, or included in a range of numbers, indicated by a colon in between the first number in the range and the last number in the range. 

Functions can be inserted by using the '''Insert''' menu, by clicking on the '''Paste Function''' icon on the Standard toolbar, or by typing &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; in the formula bar and choosing the function from the drop down list on the left. 

Functions can also be 'nested'; that is, inserted into larger functions, by using the appropriate amount of brackets.  
&lt;tt&gt;=AVERAGE(SUM(B2:F2), SUM(B3:F3)) &lt;/tt&gt;

==The Function Wizard==
You can quickly generate valid functions using the function wizard.  To open it, click the function wizard button in the formula toolbar ( ). It provides a description of the function you select (in this case '''AVERAGE'''), a space for you to enter in the range or numbers (in Number1) and previews the Formula Result. You can select a range from your sheet rather than typing it in manually by clicking on the little button with the red arrow to the right of the Value box.

[[Image:excel_average.gif|center|frame|The function wizard allows you to build custom functions to suit your specialized needs. It also offers many built in functions which you can utilize.]]

==AutoCalculate==
Excel will automatically perform calculation on a set of cells that you select and display the results on the status bar. The default calculation is the SUM function, but you can change the calculation by right-clicking (Win) or '''Command + clicking''' (Mac) on the '''AutoCalculate '''result.

You state:
:it no longer naturally overflows with abundant resources, 
I think that this is a questionable statement.
and:
:and a population of six billion can only be sustained using the products of modern technology.
This is simply untrue.  The bulk of the world's six billion ihabitants ''is'' sustained without modern technology.  Only the less than a billion who inhabit North America and Europe are so dependent and even that is arguable.  Please don't take it that I disagree with the general point that I think you are making, that we live on a planet that is under increasing population pressure and that the eco-system is becoming more and more fragile.  However facile statements that cannot be backed up by hard facts simply play into the hands of the very extremists you hope to discourage.  Take a look at BP's world report on enrgy production and consumption, use the applet to chart all the world's primary energy equivalent consumption and the uncheck North America and Europe so that you can see how small a proportion the rest of the world uses. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 20:31, 15 December 2005 (UTC)


Hello Kwhitefoot. I've looked for the references that I used but can't find them. (I'll blame moving and discarding, but maybe they will turn up sometime.)

I wrote this: “The world is not what it used to be—it no longer naturally overflows with abundant resources, and a population of six billion can only be sustained using the products of modern technology”

But, IMHO, this statement is true, regardless of what BP’s research finds.

1. Surely we have greatly reduced—not eliminated, but on the way—much of the world’s oil and coal stores, fish and numerous animal/insect species, rain-forests, and endangered much else with our pollutants, perhaps making some dangerous to consume.

2. And how many of the 6 billion could live if everyone sought what might be produced without fertilisers, machinery to grow and transport food, etc?

3. And would everyone live as the very poor do in China, Africa, India? Wouldn't the world's average lifestyle be reduced to that?

I not only think that modern technology sustains us, I think that it adds greatly to our mental outlook. It certainly gives me more opportunities to find a “better life.”  It means that I can live in a healthy environment, enjoy modern media, travel, and even think that the world might oneday become a “better place” for everyone.  Wouldn’t you agree?

However, maybe the world could sustain 6 billion people without modern technology. (But, if  everyone had the same standard of living, I would hate to live in such a place! How about you, would you like to live in such a place?)

[[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 20:50, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

: Hello Kwhitefoot.
: I haven't been able to find the original references, but Global Footprints was part of it. Here is their site:  http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/rio/focus/report/english/footprint/
: And here are some quotes:
: “Accepting 12 percent as the magic number for biodiversity preservation, one can calculate that from the approximately 2 hectares per capita of biologically productive area that exists on our planet, only 1.7 hectares per capita are available for human use.”  http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/rio/focus/report/english/footprint/benchmark.htm
: and, “Footprints are too large. Most countries presented in this report live on footprints larger than what their own ecosystems can support. On a global basis and even by conservative measures, humanity’s footprint has overshot global capacities by over 35 percent.”
: “Population versus consumption. The numbers show the impact of both consumption and population. Clearly, the high levels of consumption in industrialized countries take the biggest share of the planet’s bounty. But with ever larger populations it becomes progressively less likely that a reasonable quality of life can be secured for everybody. Particularly the rapidly growing populations will lose their prospects even faster.” from http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/rio/focus/report/english/footprint/numbers.htm

: It is more than energy use I was referring to. I know that this site is only one of many differing points of view. That’s one of the discussion points this book might raise, I guess. (But not one I anticipated!)  [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 14:29, 5 January 2006 (UTC)


== Linking Endnotes ==

When I started to read this module I found it annoying that I couldn't easily navigate to the end notes so as an example I have linked them to the endnote page.  You can see what I did by looking at the history and comparing the versions.  I think that the book needs to be 'wikified' if it is to be pleasant to read online.  It would be easier to read if each page had links to the next and previous pages as well as to the contents page.  Look at [Programming:Visual Basic Classic/Case Studies] or [Programming:Python Functions] for example. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 21:36, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

Yes, you are right. I am starting to do this--see Part One. I never seem to have enought time!!! [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 19:25, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

Oh! Now I see what you have done and I like that method. I'll make changes. David

== Why make universal if you have diversity ==
If the richness of today is diversity why make one universal religion? One might even argue that there is no universial way of life just alot point of vieuw's.

Also, making a universal religion implies that you will turn all religious texts into one book. If thats true, than that soundslike a collosal (impossible) work to me.

Maybe these 2 elements should be added to this chapter.


*But I think that I have done this. The last two paragraphs of this section state:

''&quot;Humanity needs, I think, a collective purpose. This would be in addition to our many individual and religious purposes. Under such a unified objective, individual moral behaviour not harmful to the collective good would properly remain individual choice, accruing concomitant rewards as believed to come before or after that individual’s death. However, the world’s collective guidance is a different matter. It should be obtained from a purpose positioned far beyond any one individual’s reach. This purpose should shine as a beacon to nations, guiding many generations. And its rewards should accrue to the living, not the dead, enriching the lives of all.''

''&quot;While no one should be expected to abandon their inherited or chosen religion, none should be prevented from adopting an additional universal purpose to guide their moral behaviour. No one should be asked to change what they have come to believe about themselves and their ultimate individual destiny, or to deny the god they worship. But an overarching universal purpose, used to guide humanity’s collective behaviour should also exist—something that clearly helps ensure our species’ and life’s well-being and continuance.&quot;''

And I have tried to present a rationale for doing this in several earlier sections. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 12:51, 14 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

==The Variable &quot;y&quot;==

I have also used the variable &quot;y&quot; to represent AD.  Such as in the GDP of the U.S. is &lt;br&gt;
y=c+i+g+x-m&lt;br&gt;
If someone else can validate this, perhaps we can add this as another alternative to the &quot;AE&quot; expression also noted.

      <comment>/* Which Assembler is Best? */ Fixed some grammar</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly Page}}

This page is going to serve as a basic FAQ for people who are new to assembly language programming.

== How Does the Computer Read/Understand Assembly? ==

The computer doesn't really &quot;read&quot; or &quot;understand&quot; anything ''per se'', since a computer has no awareness nor consciousness, but that's beside the point. The fact is that the computer cannot read the assembly language that you write. Your assembler will convert the assembly language into a form of binary information called &quot;machine code&quot; that your computer uses to perform its operations. If you don't assemble the code, it's complete gibberish to the computer.

That said, assembly is important because each assembly instruction usually relates to just a single machine code, and it is possible for &quot;mere mortals&quot; to do this task directly with nothing but a blank sheet of paper, a pencil, and an assembly instruction reference book.  Indeed, in the early days of computers this was a common task and even required in some instances &quot;hand assembling&quot; machine instructions for some basic computer programs.  A classical example of this was done by [[w:Steve Wozniak|Steve Wozniak]], when he hand assembled the entire Integer BASIC interpreter into 6502 machine code for use on his initial [[w:Apple I|Apple I]] computer. It should be noted, however, that such tasks done for commercially distributed software are so rare that they deserve special mention from that fact alone.  Very, very few programmers have actually done this for more than a few instructions, and even then only for a classroom assignment.

== Is it the Same On Windows/DOS/Linux? ==

The answers to this question are yes and no. The basic x86 machine code is dependent only on the processor. The x86 versions of Windows and Linux are obviously built on the x86 machine code. There are a few differences between Linux and Windows programming in x86 Assembly:

#On a Linux computer, the most popular assemblers are the GAS assembler, which uses the AT&amp;T syntax for writing code, and the Netwide Assembler, also known as NASM, which uses a syntax similar to MASM.
#On a Windows computer, the most popular assembler is MASM, which uses the Intel syntax.
#The available software interrupts, and their functions, are different on Windows and Linux.
#The available code libraries are different on Windows and Linux.

Using the same assembler, the basic assembly code written on each Operating System is basically the same, except you interact with Windows differently than you interact with Linux.

== Which Assembler is Best? ==

The short answer is that none of the assemblers is better than any other, it's a matter of personal preference.

The long answer is that different assemblers have different capabilities, drawbacks, etc. If you only know GAS syntax, then you will probably want to use GAS. If you know Intel syntax and are working on a Windows machine, you might want to use MASM. If you don't like some of the quirks or complexities of MASM and GAS, you might want to try FASM or NASM. We will cover the differences between the different assemblers in section 2.

== Do I Need to Know Assembly? ==

You don't ''need'' to know assembly for most computer tasks, but it can definitely be useful. Learning assembly is not about learning a new programming language. If you are going to start a new programming project (unless that project is a bootloader, a device driver, or a kernel), then you will probably want to avoid assembly like the plague. An exception to this could be if you absolutely need to squeeze the last bits of performance out of a congested inner loop and your compiler is producing suboptimal code. Keep in mind, though, that premature optimization is the root of all evil, although some computing-intense realtime tasks can only be optimized sufficiently if optimization techniques are understood and planned for from the start.

However, learning assembly gives you a particular insight into how your computer works on the inside. When you program in a higher-level language like C or Ada, all your code will eventually need to be converted into machine code instructions so your computer can execute them. Understanding the limits of exactly what the processor can do, at the most basic level, will also help when programming a higher-level language.

== How Should I Format my Code? ==

Most assemblers require that assembly code instructions each appear on their own line and are separated by a carriage return. Most assemblers also allow for whitespace to appear between instructions, operands, etc. Exactly how you format code is up to you, although there are some common ways:

One way keeps everything lined up:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
Label1:
mov ax, bx
add ax, bx
jmp Label3
Label2:
mov ax, cx
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way keeps all the labels in one column and all the instructions in another column:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
Label1: mov ax, bx
        add ax, bx
        jmp Label3
Label2: mov ax, cx
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way puts labels on their own lines and indents instructions slightly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
Label1:
   mov ax, bx
   add ax, bx
   jmp Label3
Label2:
   mov ax, cx
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Yet another way separates labels and instructions into separate columns AND keeps labels on their own lines:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
Label1:
        mov ax, bx
        add ax, bx
        jmp Label3
Label2:
        mov ax, cx
...
&lt;/source&gt;

So there are a million different ways to do it, but there are some general rules that assembly programmers generally follow:

#Make your labels obvious, so other programmers can see where they are.
#More structure (indents) will make your code easier to read.
#Use comments to explain what you are doing. The meaning of a piece of assembly code can often not be immediately clear.

== Comments ==

When writing code, it is very helpful to use some comments explaining what is going on. A comment is a section of regular text that the assembler ignores when turning the assembly code into the machine code. In assembly comments are usually denoted with a semicolon &quot;;&quot;, although GAS uses &quot;#&quot; for single line comments and &quot;/* ... */&quot; for multi-line comments.

Here is an example:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
Label1:
   mov ax, bx    ;move contents of bx into ax
   add ax, bx    ;add the contents of bx into ax
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Everything after the semicolon, on the same line, is ignored. Let's show another example:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
Label1:
   mov ax, bx
   ;mov cx, ax
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, the assembler never sees the second instruction &quot;mov cx, ax&quot;, because it ignores everything after the semicolon. When someone reads the code in the future they will find the comments and hopefully try to figure out what the programmer intended.

== HLA Comments ==

The [[X86 Assembly/HLA Syntax|HLA assembler]] also has the ability to write comments in C or [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code|C++ style]], but we can't use the semicolons. This is because in HLA, the semicolons are used at the end of every instruction:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
mov(ax, bx); //This is a C++ comment.
/*mov(cx, ax);  everything between the slash-stars is commented out. 
                This is a C comment*/
&lt;/source&gt;
[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions#Comments|C++ comments]] go all the way to the end of the line, but C comments go on for many lines from the &quot;/*&quot; all the way until the &quot;*/&quot;. For a better understanding of C and C++ comments in HLA, see [[Programming:C]] or the [[C++|C++ Wikibooks]].

I assume that you mean America when you say, ''the West''.  I suspect that most North Western Europeans abandoned such ideas long ago, especially the limitless expansion part. Misattribution of opinions weakens arguments.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 21:53, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Salviadivinorum-healthy.jpg|right|thumb|A salvia divinorum plant.]]

Salvia (Sage) is a common perennial herb that grows throughout the world. The plant grows to be several feet tall and has large light-green leaves. Salvia is a member of the mint family, and is considered a common garden plant. Most common forms of salvia can be found in plant nurseries. They are not hallucinogenic and will only give users a headache if smoked.

Diviner's Sage, Salvia Divinorum, is one of the hundreds of species of the Salvia genus. It is not native to any place - Although it is commonly grown in some parts of Mexico, and now grows wild in some parts of the Sierra Mazatec region.

==General==
Although some users take salvia recreationally at a very low dosage, it is not a &quot;party drug.&quot; Daniel Siebert, ethnobotanist and salvia advocate, remarks, &quot;...salvia is not 'fun' in the way that alcohol or cannabis can be. If you try to party with salvia, you will probably not have a good experience.&quot; He recommends that it be used for meditation, or other spiritual pursuits. [http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/438/salviabans.shtml]

The active chemical - Salvinorin A - is the strongest naturally occurring psychoactive known to date. It has been used by natives for thousands of years to seek divine spiritual insight. The internet brought the plants psychoactive qualities to attention. In recent years several countries have introduced legislation to make prepared forms of the plant illegal. It remains legal in most of North America because of the lack of media attention, and the very small abuse potential. (See legality section below.)

There is no known lethal dosage of Salvia Divinorum. However, '''it is very strongly recommended that a trip sitter be present'''. Because of its short-lasting effects (when smoked), users can take turns being a sitter.

'''Before setting forth to explore the potential of this substance, please read this entire page!'''

==Legality==
{{Wikipediapar||Legal status of Salvia divinorum}}
This substance is illegal in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Germany and Belgium.[http://www.sagewisdom.org/legalstatus.html] It is legal in many other countries, including Austria, France, the United States, except for Kansas, Delaware, Florida, Tennessee, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana[http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/mtcode/50/32/2/50-32-222], North Dakota, Dallas Fort Worth, and Oklahoma

==Methods of Ingestion==
[[File:Salvia_divinorum_drug.jpg|right|thumb|Dried salvia leaves.]]
Salvia can be ingested in several ways that produce varying effects. A large amount of leaves can be chewed thoroughly to produce light but long lasting effects. More common is to smoke prepared extracts where the Salvinorin A has been concentrated to several (Five to twenty-five times) the natural amount by weight. A butane torch is recommended to vaporize all of the salvinorin A, but a regular lighter is sufficient and will vaporize most of the salvinorin A, most users find a regular lighter to be sufficient, and the smoke resulting easier to keep in the lungs, due to the lower temperature.  Unlike some other substances such as marijuana and tobacco, the Salvinorin A doesn't become absorbed immediately, so the smoker must hold the smoke in the lungs for a short period if he or she wants to absorb all of the Salvinorin A, a generally accepted time frame to hold salvia smoke in is 20-40 seconds, or however long the smoker can hold in the smoke.

Generally salvia leaves and extracts are smoked using the same paraphernalia as [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Marijuana|Cannabis]]. Bongs are considered best because the water cools the smoke, the hits are bigger than any other widely used method of smoking, and makes it smoother, which makes the smoke easier to hold in which allows for optimum absorbtion of the salvinorin A.  In order to vaporize the most salvinorin A, the flame from the lighter must be held on the salvia for the duration of the inhalation, because salvinorin A burns at a higher temperature than the plant material, for this reason, butane lighters, although burn a little more of the active chemical, might be detrimental due to the risk of butane poisoning.  Glass pipes are also used and a &quot;second best&quot; to bongs, mainly due to the fact that that they allow the lighter to be held on the salvia for the duration of the hit.  Pipes are ineffective in that, due to a smaller chamber, less smoke is able to be absorbed for each hit, and the smoke is hotter and more harsh than with the bong method due to lack of water filtration.  It is a rule of thumb that in order to receive the same level of intoxication, one must smoke three hits of a pipe to every one hit from a bong. Cigarettes will work, but not to an extent where they are considered efficient, this is because it is not common practice nor is it practical to hold a flame a cigarette, by the method's very nature.  Some effects will come from smoking it in a cigarette, and there is a clear period where effects peak, but they will be much milder than the other methods of smoking, and is likely only to produce either very mild hallucinations or visual distortions, or none at all.  It is possible to have psychedelic substance induced '''closed eye visuals''' that can come as a fantasy (commonly referred to as a &quot;trip&quot;) when smoking a salvia cigarette, but it is not common except in those with a low tolerance to salvia.  It is also interesting to note that the peak of effects, although milder, is notably a few minutes longer than with other smoking methods, but this may be simply because the period where effects are in their peak starts before the smoker has finished his cigarette, and continue until the normal time has passed upon completion of the cigarette.  Salvia cigarettes are best when only raw dried leaves are used, as extracts are costly and seem to be less effective in cigarette form than the raw leaf.

Raw dried leaves can be smoked, but, except in users with low tolerance to Salvinorin A, the full effect will not be achieved unless large amounts of leaf are smoked. The smoke is a bit harsh, and unlike most other substances, Salvinorin A does not have a cumulative dosage effect - If the dosage is not completely consumed within one to two minutes, smoking further will do little to increase the effects.

Smoking salvia produces the most profound, but also the shortest lived effects.  The come on starts while the smoke is in the lungs, and can last any time from 10 seconds to a minute, this seems to vary on dose and user.  The come on feels like a rapid build of pressure and vibrations in the head and sometimes the body, and the speed of this pressure build can catch some users off guard, and send them off on a bad &quot;trip&quot;, it is important to prepare mentally for this before smoking salvia. The peak can last anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, depending on the users own response to the substance and the dosage.  Higher doses will typically yield longer peaks.  During the peak, a user who received a full strength dose can receive numerous powerful effects, including: Visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, hallucinations of touch, smell, and taste, visual distortion, disassociation, synaesthesia (seeing music, tasting colors), anesthetic effects, loss of memory (forgetting things like you took a substance or where you were before the trip began), introspective thinking, regression to childhood, ego death (which, contrary to some rumors, only lasts for the duration of the peak), becoming objects, the impression of seeing through walls, stimulation, intensely skewed sense of time, and a spiritual sensation of witnessing, being near, being watched by, or merging with a mysterious good or evil force greater than yourself.  All these potential effects are why some people find salvia to be too intense and do not choose to use it more than once.  The after effects are much gentler and consist basically of slowly and gently coming away from the peak back into sobriety.  The effects persist for about an hour, and consist of initial dizziness that quickly wears off, euphoria, stimulation, a mild head buzz, and some people report artistic inclinations, a feeling of being at one with nature, and headaches.  All after effects slowly and gradually wear off as the hour progresses, because of this, it is hard to know exactly when the effects wear off completely and when they become mild to the point of not even noticing the minimal effects you are still having.

Traditionally, the leaves are sublingually ingested.  The most common way for this to be done is what is called the quid method.  This entails of wrapping 6-20 fresh leaves together in a stick form, and slowly chewing on more and more of the quid, over the period of a half hour, eventually having the whole quid in your mouth, without swallowing it.  Swallowing salvia is ineffective since for all practical purposes, stomach acid breaks down Salvinorin A, and you would have to swallow enormous amounts in order to receive significant effects.  sublingual absorption produces milder effects than smoking, and requires much larger doses in order to match the intensity with smoking, but produces much longer lasting effects.  The come on period lasts 20-40 minutes and starts after 5, the peak lasts 40 minutes to an hour and a half, and the after effects last 3-6 hours.  Sublingual absorption is also said to have more of a euphoric effect both during and after the peak.  Extracts, although can be quite costly, can also be used this way in order to cut down on the amount of bitter plant material that has to be held in the mouth, doses for extracts can be 1.5-2 grams of 5x, .75-1 gram of 10x, .35-.5 grams of 20x, and so on.

==Effects==
Salvia is an extremely potent drug. Its effects are considered unsettling by some people, and as such, it is important to spend time preparing the setting of the use and your mindset before you use salvia. The first effects are what can be described as a building of pressure in the head, and sometimes of the body, this is sometimes accompanied by a sensation of vibration of the eyes.  This is known as the 'coming on' stage, and it can last anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute, and roughly 10-20 seconds after initial inhalation or last 20-40 minutes and start after 5 minutes if sublingually ingested.

The peak can last anywhere from 30 seconds (which is rare) to 15 minutes when smoked, and can last 40 minutes to an hour and a half when sublingually ingested, and can include the following profound effects: Visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, hallucinations of touch, smell, and taste, visual distortion, disassociation, synaesthesia (seeing music, tasting colors), anesthetic effects, loss of memory (forgetting things like you took a substance or where you were before the trip began), introspective thinking, regression to childhood, ego death (which, contrary to some rumors, only lasts for the duration of the peak), becoming objects, the impression of seeing through walls, stimulation, intensely skewed sense of time, and a spiritual sensation of witnessing, being near, being watched by, or merging with a mysterious good or evil force greater than yourself. Another effect that occurs in the peak is bouts of laughter.  These laughing fits are usually labeled as involuntary, but I have separated them from the other effects to submit that while they do seem to happen at random to the observer, as a user I will vouch that these laughing fits are almost always a response to the unusual images and scenes salvia hallucinations produce, and although they are knee jerk reactions, they are not what I would consider truly involuntary.  Depending on the mindset and setting going into the experience, salvia's peak can be a beautiful and fun experience, or a frightening and undesirable experience.  Salvia tends to be a psychotheraputic substance in that it can bring past traumas, repressed memories, or regrets to the surface.  These traumas, repressed memories, or regrets can manifest in very blatant, or very vague ways, and salvia may bring up issues of the past that you are not ready to deal with at this point in time, if there is anything like this in your past and you are not at a place where you can deal with it, salvia is not something you should use, even if in the ideal mindset and setting.  If you do not have such issues unresolved in your past, and you are in the correct mindset and setting, salvia may be used as a pleasant and powerful tool for exploring your consciousness, and developing a base of insight for you to refine at a later time.  In a partail-dose (a dose that is incapable of completely removing you from reality), salvia can be a great recreational psychedelic/stimulant.  Although not ideal for large parties, salvia may be smoked for fun by a small group of friends.  although it is important to remember that '''Salvia only works as a recreational drug in limited doses, and doses that produce a complete fantasy/trip effect would become unpleasant and potentially frightening in a recreational atmosphere, and those high doses are only good for personal exploration and insight!'''

The afterglow effect lasts for 30 minutes to an hour if smoked, and 3-6 hours if sublingually absorbed.  It starts as initial dizziness, which leads continuously tampering off euphoria, stimulation, visual distortion, a gentle head buzz. and sometimes random, short lived hallucinations (usually only in high doses)and some people report feeling connected with nature, artistic inclinations, and a headache.

==Other important facts==

*Although the raw herb 'Salvia divinorum' itself isn't especially potent, it's psychoactive constituent, salvinorin A, is very potent, reaching thresh hold effects at 200 micrograms (0.0002 grams)

*Salvia is non-toxic:  Although it is unknown what the overdose (LD50) of Salvinorin A is, it is known that there has never been a death attributable to Salvia or Salvinorin A, this is especially reassuring because most doses do not exceed 25 milligrams, though doses of 2 grams of salvinorin A have been recorded.
&gt;the closest thing to a death ever being attributed to Salvia divinorum is the death of Brett Chidester of Delaware, was depressed and was using salvia.  His parents claim that salvia was causing his depression, and point to the fact that he smoked salvia a few hours before he committed suicide as evidence of the link.  However, salvia has never been known to cause people to manifest depression, and has never been known to since.  It is far more likely that he was depressed prior to his use with salvia, and was attracted to it by the unsubstantiated claims that salvinorin A had promising anti-depressant effects that were going around at the time.  If salvia played any part, it may have played a sort of catalyst role in reinforcing his depression, as mindset greatly effects experiences with salvia, and if you go in to an experience depressed, it will probably focus on depressing things, however it is extremely unlikely that salvia placed any thought into Brett's mind that was not already present in some form, this is a classic (and unfortunately tragic) case of why it is always said not to do salvia if you have some sort of issue, although if gone unchecked like it had been for months, the end of Brett's tale would have probably gone unchanged if salvia hadn't been introduced.  Brett's parents got a law passed in Delaware making Salvia divinorum an illegal drug there based on her son's suicide, which is a shame that a substance can get banned because it had unsubstantiated connections to an event that, based on knoweledge of the substance, it didn't really have. 

*Salvia exhibits a reverse-tolerance effect - The effects of the substance become stronger with each use. It may take several uses before a user &quot;breaks-though&quot; into the full effects of the substance.

*If you experience no effects from smoking the substances, there are three explanations. The first is that you did not hold in the smoke long enough. The longer, the better. The second is that Salvia has no effects on you. 5-10% of the population will not be affected by Salvia at all. The third is that you did not hold the flame onto the foliage long enough and the active chemicals were not vaporized.

*Make sure you '''keep''' the flame on the salvia and inhale as much as possible with one hit. Salvinorin requires a lot of heat to vapourize, and if you don't supply it you are smoking plant.

*Most users report that any strength of extract over '20x' is uncomfortably too intense.

*Salvia extracts use a measurement of &quot;x's&quot; to label strength in comparison to the raw leaf starting material, the &quot;x&quot; in this system is meant to represent the multiplication &quot;times&quot; symbol in math, and it means literally how it reads, if it reads &quot;10x&quot; that means &quot;10 times [the raw leaf]&quot;
&gt;Raw salvia leaf is on average .25% salvinorin A, therefore on the standardized scale for extract, pure salvinorin A would be 400x
&gt;Raw Salvinorin A leaf can vary in potency based on many factors, this means that different companies have different strength starting material to produce salvia extract, as a result, one producer's 10x extract may be unbelievably strong while another's 50x may be shamefully weak, is is important to find a supplier whose extracts remain consistent than to play a guessing game with potency, also, it may be wise to order that companies raw leaf material and check it's potency yourself to know how strong to expect that conpany's extracts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Students, as you do know, the reason why heat exists is because it is merely just another form of energy. When you say, that you would rather avoid the heat, than get out of this universe! Without the existance of heat, many things would simply not be able to exist in the real world. Heat is what makes those brownies crisp. Heat is also what makes that ice melt.&quot;

Concepts:
-The 3 laws of thermodynamics.
-Entropy and enthalpy.

Problems
-the the stable temperature when combining hot and cold water.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Physical intuition is best defined as the prediction of movement in which we humans usually can predict from common experience. New methods to take away the common confusion that students are frustrated by is by taking this to mind: 

                              &quot;nature before math.&quot;

What this means is that students commonly are taught in the &quot;cook book approach.&quot; The difference is that you will engage yourself in an immersive, interactive way which makes you think about the relationships of the derived laws.

Learning just basic physical intuition we can reasonably and logically conclude if the movement of the physical system seems to be right. By using a combination of physical laws, physical intuition, and diagrams, most if not all problems of classical physics can be solved. Another helpful skill is &quot;physical perspectives&quot; which can be used to analyze what the answer should look like.

We will employ the &quot;more, less, and contrast&quot; method to compare various situations. 

In order to build up skills of such intuition, observe the following experiences.

==Steps to developing excellent physical intuition ==

-Consults the equation and recognize the types of units involved in it.
-From common experience, See what would typically occur.
 Common experiences include:
 Geometry (the shape of things)
 Sports and forces (how things are related to sports) 
-Connect the equation and common experience together to get a better understanding
of the subject.
-Contruct diagrams and &quot;deconstruct&quot; the aesthetic diagram into a physical diagram.
-Make sense of the reasonableness of the numbers.
-Make the final prediction of what will happen.

== Sports: ==
-Parabolic motion-the position of the ball.
-Tennis: Spin, speed, angle-the motion of the ball
-Vectors-the amount of force in certain direction to produce such motion
-Vibration of sports instruments.
-Football: the pass
-Skating:Conservation of motion
-Friction


==Food ==
-kinetic and potential energy.
-Sugars,Carbohydrates, and Fats.

==Transportation ==
-the relationship of mass and speed/energy.

it is generally known that usually more massive things tend to accelerate slower. the example is the difference between driving a loaded car and an unloaded car.

-the difference between a loaded car and a unloaded car
-drag forces: the relationship of volume and speed.
-closed and open windows in a transportation vehicle
-Positions in bicycle riding that promote better speed.
-Carnot engines and general efficiency
-elastic and inelastic collisions.

''concepts appear more complex than they should be.''

I agree that far too much stuff is taught in a way that makes it sound far more complicated than it really is. I do what I can to untangle overly complicated &quot;explanations&quot;.
I think you might enjoy reading some people who are even more militant about keeping things as simple as possible:
* http://amasci.com/ by Bill Beaty (I hear he's starting to edit Wikipedia, and that can only be a good thing.) In particular, http://amasci.com/amateur/physerm1.html .
* the book [[w:QED (book)|QED]] by [[w:Richard Feynman]]
* the people at the [http://wiki.43folders.com/ 43 folders wiki].

Thank you for making Wikibooks easier to understand.

in actuality, what type of physics book are you trying to overhaul? anyways i'm sure it won't be to hard just to categorize the physics page by level of understanding.

also, you may notice that their are many books which are in the &quot;construction phase&quot;

should you try to note what books that you think in general are best suited for a general area?

:I was referring to the Physics C (mechanics) book -- the last time I checked, all that existed was a sort of cheat-sheet of equations, but I have some interest in renovating it to provide explanation behind the concepts, laws and equations.

== Vista ==

When Windows Vista comes out, this book is going to need to be either extensively modified, or a number of additions are going to need to be made. Many parts of the API are expected to change, and the new Vista driver model implements user-mode drivers. Any suggestions on how to adapt to the changes? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Windows Programming|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:34, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

*I'm the guy mentioning Pelle's C under the Anonymous IP. Since I'm at the beginner stage in Windows Programming, I can't tell it's too relevant due to people's slow adoption of anything new. It's probably OK to just make a section or two, the way Hart's Windows System Programming book was updated to &quot;handle&quot; XP, 2003 and Win64. His 64-bit section goes more or less like: ''Current Status, Model, data types, API changes, migrating code and compiler issues.'' To tell the truth, I'm not happy OS's change so much and break compatibility. I'm a legacy guy who just patched windows 2000 machines for USA Daylight Savings this past weekends, and am darn proud :) --[[User:66.108.164.77|66.108.164.77]] 04:17, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

== UNICODE.... ==

I dont understant why unicode was removed from wikisource to be part of wikibooks/Windows Programming. Why &quot;windows programming&quot;? must i remake UNICODE table for other languages???? [[User:Sspecter|Sspecter]] 04:38, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:To the best of my knowledge it wasn't wanted on wikisource, and they were going to delete it. Instead of deleting the material, it was moved here to the [[Windows Programming]] book. There are two options:
:#Create a [[Unicode]] book, and link to that book from every other book that needs to discuss unicode in more detail
:#Add unicode material to every book that needs it. 
:Which ever you feel like doing is perfectly fine. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:32, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
::I would prefer much better to create a [[Unicode]] book. Can I move it? [[User:Sspecter|Sspecter]] 06:24, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
:::Go right ahead. If an editor doesn't like the change, he'll either take it to the talk page or revert it. But I think it'll be fine. :) Cheers, --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:29, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
The reason i want to change is that it was (for me) very hard to find this codes hidden between the mediawiki projects. Other people are having the same problem, proven by [[wikipedia:|the weird biggest article in wikipedia, about &quot;HTML decimal character references&quot;]] (wich is, in fact, a very ugly mistagged uncomplete unicode reference), voted 3 times for deletion and maintained. Check it out. [[User:Sspecter|Sspecter]] 06:37, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
:Hi. I tried to follow the link but it seems to have been removed. A second part is up, according to a search for '''decimal character references''' and is [[w:List_of_HTML_decimal_character_references%2C_Part_2|available via this link]]. I'm one guy (probably the ''only'' one besides Whiteknight but I don't know all my IP addresses) that recently added info to the [[Windows_Programming/Programming_Windows_with_OSS_Tools|OSS/Cygwin portion]] of this Wikibook. I should try and see if there's a unified ID for wikieverything accounts or create a new account for here.
:BTW, thanks, Whiteknight --this wikibook's first chapters are the glue that helped me fill gaps from books and web tutorials on Win32 for C++... &quot;Hello world&quot; teachers out there should spend more time defining what those new windows.h types and weird capitalized strings are about. I'll update the OSS section to add at least a mention to LCC-WIN32 and (non-open source?) Pelle's C, since they have GUI support that can substitute the need Visual Studio tools for simple projects. --[[User:198.83.125.201|198.83.125.201]] 00:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

== Assignments? ==

How about assignments to go along with the text?

: Personally, I usually ignore assignments.  How about examples that build a more complete application using many of the tasks discussed in the chapter?  For example, now that the reader's gone through the [[Windows Programming/Window Creation]] chapter and has read about menus, take them through building a simple program that invokes menus.

== Disappointed ==

I took a course on C programming in college, and since then have programmed recreationally in several languages. I'm only now starting to take interest in creating graphical programs, and I'm strongly disappointed in this Wikibook. I'm certain that if I already knew how to use the Win32 API this would make a fine reference, but as a teaching tool it falls short. If this is only intended for reference, could you include a warning stating so in the first paragraph? If this is intended to educate novices to GUI programming, I think significant rewriting is in order.

:In place of adding a warning why not contribute with the missing information :)  It is up for the book contributors to add or not the warning but placing it will be limiting the scope of the book and will make it very improbable that anyone will add or rewrite it to cover that subject.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:11, 22 February 2008 (UTC)

::First, because I am a beginner to the subject and cannot myself supply the imformation I believe this &quot;book&quot; needs. Second, because when non-established wiki users come and make significant changes to existing articles, Internet fights ensue.

== Windows programming in C++ for kids ==

Well I am giving this topic because I am a kid.And I have burning desire to program.I've found some useless books on C++ online that
teaches only console programming.Hell that Hello World console program.


include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() 

{        

        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World\n&quot;; 
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Press enter to continue...&quot;;
        cin.get();

}

I hate this program now.I am bored.But I like this book very much.So I
suggest that you create a usefull (not useless) books for kids like me.I am only 10 years old.But I know a little about programming.So,This is the reason

      <text xml:space="preserve">Who posted the information contained here so far?  I mean no offense since it does seem like a sincere and honest effort to accurately and concisely state the principles of law mentioned.  Still, I must say it seems EXTREMELY elementary.  It seems as though this is written by a 2L who learned out of an Emmanuel's outline and would not be able to argue the policies and principles behind the law and WHY a judge might chose to use a particular argument over another.

For instance, the parol evidence rule is not nearly so simple as it is stated here.  The Emmanuel's summary outline may make it that simple, but there are several well established exceptions to the parol evidence rule and none were mentioned here.  There are complex policy considerations that are behind the decision to allow oral testimony and the judge's personal philosophy about what role the courts should play and what role the judge herself should play will have a great influence on the decision.

I hope to make additions to this wikibook when I find the time, but I just wanted to point out for those who might consult this as a good source that things are far more complex than this makes it appear. ''unsigned comment by [[User:24.45.199.241|24.45.199.241]] at 04:44, 16 December 2005''

      <comment>Re-arrange everything, add a decent intro. Need to add an example musical stave notation.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Drum music is written down in one of two forms: as tablature, or in musical notation. The two forms are basically the same, and are fairly easily interchangable. The major difference is that in musical notation, rest symbols are used to denote timing, while in tabs, the spacing is used. In both, each individual instrument is written on own line, although sometimes multiple similar instruments, like cymbals, are written on the same line with different symbols. Most instruments can have multiple symbols denoting different ways to play them (for instance, on the hi-hat line, &quot;o&quot; commonly means open, which &quot;x&quot; means closed). 

Since Wikibooks doesn't support a musical stave feature, most lessons  in this book will be written in tabs. 

An example would be as follows
 HH|x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|
 Sn|----o-------o---|----o-------o---|
 BD|o-------o-------|o-------o-------|

The above is a basic 4/4 drum beat, with the bass on counts one and three, the snare on counts two and four, the hi-hat on counts one, two, three, and four, and a hi-hat accent on the &quot;and&quot; of count four.

== Instruments ==
Different tab authors use different symbols for notation. You just have to be careful to read the specs at the start. And if you're playing a song you know, listen!

The symbols commonly used in this book are as follows:
 Cymbal = X
 Closed hi-hat (HH) = x 
 Open hi-hat (HH) = o
 Tom 1 (T1) = o
 Snare (Sn) = o
 Tom 2 (T2) = o
 Tom 3 (T3) = o
 Bass Drum (BD) = o

There are many types of cymbal, common notation will include
 Crash (Cr) = X
 Ride (Rd) = ^

== Other notation ==

If there are letters like &quot;R&quot; or &quot;L&quot; below the tab it is to indicate which hand to use on the note above it.

== Timing ==


A good way to learn timing is to count as you play. For standard rock beats, you are playing 4 beats (quarter notes) per bar. You count on these notes. You may also be playing 8th notes in between, as in the first example. For 8ths, you usually count &quot;and&quot;. Here's the first example again, with counting:
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;
 HH|x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|
 Sn|----o-------o---|----o-------o---|
 BD|o-------o-------|o-------o-------|

You can also count 16ths in between the quarters and 8ths. You'd usually count this like &quot;one-ee-and-ah-two-ee-and-ah...&quot;, or &quot;1e&amp;a2e&amp;a3e&amp;a4e&amp;a&quot;. For some styles, you'll be playing 3/4, in which case you will only could to 3 in each bar: &quot;1 and 2 and 3 and 1...&quot;. For others, you'll be playing 4/4, but instead of playing 8ths, you'll play triplets (or 12ths). You can count 12ths like &quot;One and ah Two and ah Three and ah Four and ah&quot;, or &quot;1&amp;a2&amp;a3&amp;a4&amp;a&quot;.

You can play along with a metronome to keep good timing. Timing is an extremely key factor in playing drums. To help build speed, play each lesson at a comfortable tempo until you are become proficient, and then increase the speed of the metronome by an amount that is somewhat challenging. For endurance, play at a moderately slow tempo (for example, 16ths at 100bpm) for a set amount of time. Discipline is also a key factor. 

When learning beats, breaks down each part of the beat and plays it separately, for example playing only the hi-hat, then only the snare, then only the bass drum, and then bringing in another part, for example both hi-hat and snare, or hi-hat and bass drum, or only snare and bass drum, and then all the parts together.

== [[Ada Programming/All Chapters]] ==

I have tryied an ''All Chapters'' view like they have for C++ and Computer Science - however it does not work for our page layout :-(. And I am unshure if it is worth changing - there would be a lot of work involved for little gain. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:33, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

=== Can't view ===

I'm unable to view the page. Don't know whether is a problem of Wikibooks  or a problem with my connection. Nevertheless I can edit the page and have added 1st level titles to improve the TOC. At least in the Spanish Wikibook this tip was very useful ([[:es:Programación en Ada / Texto completo]]). Are there other layout problems? The page headers, the Lady image... Those ones might be corrected changing the template, if regarded necessary. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:47, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

=== Probably the &lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; ===

Main problem - I think - is the use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - I hope to rectify that with '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''. Also the page might just be to big - after adding the keywords it stoped working.

=== Works now ===

But only with less chapters and use of &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. You can quickly find out about any missing by looking for the first '''&quot;Contents [hide]&quot;''' - if there is more then one '''&quot;[hide]&quot;''' then there is more then one '''&lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' on the page.

I am a high school science teacher, though my background is in chemistry. I figured that this would be a good place to share the resources I have created. Any clues on how to integrate premade activities/labs and very short summary notes in to what is already here? I can certainly come up with good mneumonics on the topics I have taught. Let me know. Please. --[[User:Purpill|Purpill]] 22:19, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

Posted by Darren Baird (physics teacher with the TDSB), Toronto, ON, July 26, 2007...

I am concerned with a number of issues with this module. 

1. Much of the language is very awkward. In most cases this just slows down the read, but in some places, it obfuscates the meaning in a way which hinders understanding. If you claim to be a teacher posting material to help, then fix you spelling errors and straighten up your language. If you are not a native english speaker, I understand, so hard feelings... but the criticism stands... if you expect your students to gain clarity from your work, then your work should be clear!

2. Where are the promised diagrams?

You have some kernals of good ideas here, but they are typically half formed ideas... you don't explicitly express any ideas... you allude to them then immediately move on... this more resembles my teaching notebook (intended for my eyes only) than anything I would allow in front of my students.

I am concerned with my borderline students stumbling accross this, reading the nonsense and becoming increasingly frustrated because they can't understand what is written. They would then blame themselves instead of the poor writing.

I will give specific comments, then make the edit... (be a part of the solution)

suggestions for rewrite for your intro paragraph as:

This book, Physics for highschoolers, will educate high school students upon the concepts of 
&quot;in&quot; not &quot;upon&quot;

physics, and how they apply to a regular high school students life. Likewise, this book will be similar to Hewitts conceptual physics approach which associates hard concepts to very 
&quot;with&quot; not &quot;to&quot;

manageable ways to understand life. This wikibooks is situated for people who would like to 
&quot;wikibooks&quot; should not be pluralized, 
&quot;situated&quot; is not correct word choice... &quot;designed&quot; or &quot;written&quot;. Actually until everything is cleaned up, I would say... &quot;will be designed for...&quot;

understand the hard concepts by observing an easy to read style, helpful diagrams, and hopefully get a laugh when learning about the true things in life.
word choice... &quot;nature&quot; not &quot;true things in life&quot;

Once again... are you a native English speaker?

----

I would like to reiterate the concerns and criticisms of the above user. As a high school student, who is genuinely interested in becoming a physicist, I find this book very hard to read.

I don't agree with the amount of time spent on creating small, imaginative stories in order to explain a concept, or to introduce a subject. Evidently, I intrepret the need to relate science to something else, as an indication that you may not fully understand the actual material enough to explain it thoroughly.

This book essentially needs more work from my honest opinion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Design patterns are used where the same set of needs comes up over and over again. They are standard and well-tested approaches to designing models, and you can build up a library of patterns to make it easier to design professional solutions.

Please note that the names of the patterns below are not official names, because Excel has no generally accepted patterns, but they have been created for the purposes of this book. You may not find these names used anywhere else.

== Tabular pattern ==

The tabular pattern below is one all spreadsheet users are familiar with.

This is the simplest and most obvious way to build models, and it is used for most business spreadsheets. 

It has two main problems:

1. the formulae must be copied down correctly in each column – this is a common error

2. it can be hard to check formulae, when they are crammed into successive columns. There is little room for any explanation, users can only see one formula at a time (unless they turn on the formula view, and then you can't see the values), and users can only see a few columns at a time. This means that as a model gets more complex, this pattern can become very difficult to follow, and even unworkable.

== Block pattern ==

In more complex models, it may be difficult to fit everything into one sheet using the tabular pattern above. 

The model can be divided into sections such as tax, depreciation, revenue cashflows, etc., and each of these can be put into a separate &quot;block&quot;, usually on a separate sheet. The results are then consolidated in a summary sheet.

This is a pattern commonly used in large finance models, e.g. for toll roads, power stations, etc., where a large number of cashflows are projected forward in time, and where the model can be broken up into logical chunks. The models can get very big, e.g. 15 meg, with 3,000-4,000 unique formulae.

[[Image:Blocks.GIF]]

The advantage is that each sheet can be checked independently, and each sheet is on a particular topic. When a problem is complex, it helps if you can check it a piece at a time.
   
'''More on project financing'''

While this approach helps break up a complex problem into bite-size chunks, it is important to check the connections between the chunks and ensure they link up properly, as large models can become very confusing. You also need to design the model very carefully because it will be very difficult to rearrange later.


== Merge pattern ==

The following approach is a powerful alternative to the tabular pattern. It works well where you have to carry out a series of calculations for many rows of data.

You first build a calculation sheet based on a single record of data, 
* showing that data at the top of the sheet, 
* listing any assumptions you need (explaining as you go), and then 
* setting out the calculations down the sheet, as spread out as you like.

The result is that, given any [[one]] of the data records (i.e. rows), you can produce the correct results clearly and accurately for that single row.

This has obvious benefits in making the calculations much easier to check than when they are crammed into columns on a single row, next to the data. Of course, there is no free lunch, and the disadvantage is that you can only do one row at a time, which is clumsy.

The next step is to use a dozen lines of VBA code to load each data record in turn into this sheet, calculate, and export the results for each record into a separate row on an output sheet. You end up with an output sheet with a row of results for each data record.

There are several advantages to this:
* you use a single set of worksheet calculations for all records – there is no need to copy them down all the rows for each record
* the calculations are much easier to check than the tabular pattern, because you can spread them out across an entire sheet, and you can pull any data record in to look at it in detail
* all the business logic is in the worksheet, not in VBA, which simply automates the process
* the data and results sheets are completely separate from the calculations sheet, and they have no formulae that can be messed up - this separation is a very important design principle
* if you want to print individual results for each record (e.g. you want to send out letters to each person), VBA can print a specially formatted output sheet for each record as it loops through them all

This approach requires more skill to build than the tabular approach, but the code can be made generic, so it does not require any changes, removing the need for programming skills.

An example will demonstrate best: click on this 
[[Image:Calculate one at a time.xls]], 
(then when the image page comes up, right click the link to the XLS file and &quot;Save As&quot; to download it).


== VBA pattern ==

VBA can be used to read in the data and assumptions, carry out all the calculations, and then put the results back in the sheet.

This is a very powerful approach where there are large amounts of data, or where a worksheet would be very slow, because 
* VBA can process data extremely quickly, and 
* it can read from and write to data files, databases and websites,
* and it is very compact, because all its calculations are done in memory and are discarded once the results are put back in a sheet

The power comes at a significant price, because 
* VBA requires sound programming skills
* it can be difficult to adapt later if it needs to change
* it can be very difficult to check, although one solution is to produce a test worksheet with selected outputs to make it easier to see what is happening

Generally, VBA should be used for complex models involving a lot of data, like a simulation or a very large datafile.

Joey Newton recent got into trouble by his parents. His parents, knowing that Joey was a strong kid with 9 Newtons of force, placed a 1 Kg bowling ball to his foot to prevent him from running away. To make things worse, Johnny has a really strong &quot;anti-Escape&quot; fan that exerts 3n on his foot.

From the following Problem, Figure out the answer given the following concepts:

A. What is the Force? (chapter 1:Force)
B. What is the Acceleration? (chapter 2: Acceleration)
A. W = Mass X gravity (chapter 4: Energy)


B. What is the net force of the problem, assuming his leg is &quot;actually&quot; the bowling ball.


The doodle/Diagram:
Basically its there to visualize problems and see how the concepts and the picture is related. One of the best concepts in which can
be gained by drawing out the diagrams is a better understanding of the materials. Usually by drawing such diagrams, the math to it
can be vastly simplified.

To aid in solving a problem, always assign the numbers which are given with their respective value.

Keywords for solving physics problems
The general keywords that usually appear in problems in
&quot;the object starts at rest&quot; = The initual velocity (Vo) is 0
&quot;the object stops at rest&quot;  = The final velocity (Vf) is 0
&quot;goes faster&quot; =Add  &quot;goes slower&quot; = Subtract
Distance, Displacement, Movement = the change from the final distance from the starting position.
&quot;north&quot; &quot;South&quot; -They either want you to use the pythagorean theorem or use vector diagrams 
elongates, stretches = gets bigger

{{BookCat}}
Also, try to imagine the 'physical situation' as given in the problem. for ex, if in the problem it is given that the 'wheel is rolling without slpping' try to imagine it in your head, and then go about solving the problems. Especially in mechanics it helps a lot.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergefrom|Linux For Newbies/Command Line}}

== Introduction ==
The command line interface (CLI or terminal) may seem intimidating at first, but it's important to remember that the command line is really, truly your friend. An army of tools are at your disposal that can take what would be a tedious and lengthy job (like removing the last four characters from every line of a lengthy file) and turn it into a two minute job.

For every Linux distribution the command line prompt will look a little different. For example, on one system you might see your username, the '@' symbol, the machine name, your current directory and the prompt.

        user@linux ~/$ 

This is a very common prompt. You may also see your username, a space, the fully qualified domain name of the computer, the full path to your present working directory followed by the prompt. In the example above 'user' is the username and 'linux' is the name of the host(computer) you are logged on.

        user linux.box.com /home/user$ 

The prompt varies from system to system based on a number of things. For example, it may be the default configuration set by the creators of your particular Linux distribution. It could also have been configured by the person who administors the computer. Maybe you, yourself, configured how you wanted your prompt to look.

The way you configure the look of your command prompt depends on what shell you use and the shell is the piece that most people commonly refer to as &quot;the command line&quot; when, in reality, it is simply a piece of software that provides an interface to the services of a kernel. The distinction between a 'shell' and the 'command line' is simply that a '''shell''' refers to a ''specific piece of software'' (e.g BASH, Tch, ksh, etc) that provides a '''command line interface'''. Most modern Linux systems use BASH (Bourne Again SHell) as the default shell.

=== A Little History ===
The commands used at the command line may seem a little cryptic due to their tendency to be very short. This is because the roots of the Linux command line are from systems where a single letter entry could take a significant amount of time to travel from a terminal, to a central server and back to the terminal where it was printed onto a roll of paper. In those old systems, the shorter the input was, the better as it meant less time waiting to issue your command and receive output. The best thing you can do to remember what commands stand for is to find out what word the command is an abbreviation for. This can go a long way to remembering the command later.

== Some Useful Terminal Commands ==

==== Summary of Common Commands ====
* ls - This command '''l'''ist'''s''' the contents of your present working directory.
* pwd - Shows you what your '''p'''resent '''w'''orking '''d'''irectory is.
* cd - Lets you '''c'''hange '''d'''irectories.
* rm - '''R'''e'''m'''oves one or more files.
* rmdir - '''R'''e'''m'''ove an empty '''dir'''ectory.
* mkdir - '''M'''a'''k'''e a '''dir'''ectory.
* ps - Provides a list of currently running '''p'''rocesse'''s'''.
* cp - '''C'''o'''p'''y a file.
* mv - '''M'''o'''v'''e a file (this is also used to rename a file, &quot;moving&quot; it from one file name to another.)
* grep - The '''g'''lobal '''r'''egular '''e'''xpression '''p'''rint program lets you search through a file or output of another program.
* find - Find a file on the filesystem
* man - Displays the '''man'''ual for most commands (including 'man').

; TIP: For help about a command, try ''man &lt;command&gt;'' which will bring up the manual for it. Note that some commands are built into your shell and do not have a man page, use your interpreter internal command (should be ''help &lt;command&gt;'').

==== Using Common Commands ====
===== Using ls =====
        user@linux ~/$ ls
        Afilez  Report.doc  aFilea  finances.xls  myPic.jpg  report1.doc  vacation pictures

You may notice from the example, default output of 'ls' that the files are not in strict alphabetical order. This is because the output is sorted on the numeric ASCII value of each letter. Because upper case letters have a lower ASCII value than lowercase letters, the returned result will always be files starting with upper case letters first. For example, if we add the file AZTRIP to the directory we will get 'AZTRIP' as the file listed first followed by 'Afilez' because the ASCII value of 'Z' is numerically lower than the ASCII value of 'f'.

If the ASCII values of letters has you confused, the important thing to remember here is that uppercase letters trump lowercase letters and will appear first in listings. The result is that files are first sorted by case and sorted alphabetically second.

The default output of ls isn't as useful as it could be. For example, given the output in the example, we don't know what are files and what are directories. We can likely guess that &quot;Afilez&quot;, &quot;aFilea&quot; and &quot;vacation pictures&quot; are all directories as they don't have an extension after the file name. To confirm this, we can pass the 'l' parameter to 'ls' to get &quot;long listing format&quot; output.

        user@linux ~/$ ls -l
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 163328 Jul 24 11:42 AZTRIP
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  11264 Jul 24 11:42 Afilez
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  22528 Jul 24 11:43 Report.doc
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  24576 Jul 24 11:42 aFilea
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 300032 Jul 24 11:43 finances.xls
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  47104 Jul 24 11:41 myPic.jpg
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  17920 Jul 24 11:43 report1.doc
        drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d      0 Jul 24 11:24 vacation pictures

The first character in the output above indicates the file type; where a dash indicates a file and the letter 'd' indicates a directory. From this output we see that the only directory is &quot;vacation pictures&quot;

; NOTE: Most systems have an alias on the ls command to include the '--color' flag so that the command highlights different file types with different colors. Directories are commonly shown in blue. If the output of your 'ls' command is always the same color, try &quot;ls --color&quot;.

; TIP: Another common parameter (also known as an &quot;argument&quot;) to the ls command is 'a' which shows all files including any hidden files and folders that start with a period. Arguments may also be combined together in a single block of letters. For example, &quot;ls -l -a&quot; can also be expressed as &quot;ls -la&quot;.

===== Using cd =====
The cd command lets you navigate from directory to directory on your system. The first thing you may need to know when using the cd command is that, unlike windows, Linux does not use the concept of drive letters. Instead, everything is somewhere within the root directory, '/', including other disk drives.

There's a couple ways to use cd to navigate to the directory you want. These are known as &quot;full path&quot; and &quot;relative path&quot;.

Full path always begins with the root directory '/'. For example, if we're in our home directory '/home/user' and we want to navigate to the 'vacation pictures' directory, we would issue the following command.

        user@linux ~/$ cd /home/user/vacation\ pictures
        user@linux vacation pictures/$ 

You may note that our prompt changed a little to indicate the directory we're currently in. This will be the case on most systems, but as previously discussed, this depends on how your shell is configured. You may also note the backslash between &quot;vacation&quot; and &quot; pictures&quot;. This backslash is known as the &quot;escape character&quot; and tells the cd command that the space is part of the directory name. If we omitted the backslash, the cd command would error and tell us that it could not find the directory &quot;vacation&quot;. If you don't like typing backslash or have a directory name with many spaces in it, you can use quotation marks around the path.

Relative path can start a number of ways, but always describes how to get to a specific directory from the directory you're currently in. To do this, we need to know how to move to directories that immediately surround the directory. These directories are parent directories and sub-directories

A sub-directory is any directory that is contained within the directory we're currently. Given the output below of &quot;ls -l&quot;, we see that chicago, florida and &quot;new york&quot; are all sub-directories to the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; directory.

        user@linux vacation pictures/$ ls -l
        drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 0 Jul 24 12:44 chicago
        drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 0 Jul 24 12:44 florida
        drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 0 Jul 24 12:44 new york

A parent directory is the directory that contains the folder that we are in. This makes the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; folder the parent of the &quot;chicago&quot;, &quot;florida&quot; and &quot;new york&quot; directories.

To cd to a sub-directory, you can start the path name with &quot;./&quot; which indicates the directory we're already in, or you can immediately start with the name of the sub-directory. For example, both of the following commands will change you to the &quot;florida&quot; directory.

        user@linux vacation pictures/$ cd ./florida
        user@linux florida/$ 

        user@linux vacation pictures/$ cd florida
        user@linux florida/$ 

To cd to a parent directory, you always specify &quot;../&quot;. The following command will return us to the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; directory.

        user@linux florida/$ cd ../
        user@linux vacation pictures/$ 

If we are already in the &quot;chicago&quot; directory and want to cd to &quot;new york&quot;, we must first tell the system we want to go up one level to the parent directory and then to the &quot;new york&quot; directory. We can do this by saying &quot;cd ../&quot; and then &quot;cd new\ york&quot; or we can do it as one step using the command below.

        user@linux chicago/$ cd &quot;../new york&quot;
        user@linux new york/$ 

; NOTE: Notice how we used quotation marks around the path to cd to the &quot;new york&quot; directory. We could have, instead used the backslash before the space and omitted the quotes to get the same result.

Similar to &quot;./&quot; and &quot;../&quot;, there's also &quot;~/&quot; which indicates the home directory of the user we're logged in as. If we wanted to cd to the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; folder while in the &quot;/usr/lib&quot; directory, we could do this with any of the following commands.

        user@linux lib/$ cd ~/vacation\ pictures
        user@linux lib/$ cd &quot;/home/user/vacation pictures&quot;
        user@linux lib/$ cd ../../home/user/vacation\ pictures

; TIP: Using the cd command without specifying a directory will return you to your home directory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fundamental units==
===Most Common Units===
;Meters (Distance)
:Describes the space between two locations. Think of the length of a highway or the distance between two cities. The definition of the meter has changed in the last few years. The meter was originally defined as one ten millionth of the distance from one of the Earth's poles to the equator.  The meter is now defined as the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.

;Kilograms (Mass)
:Describes how much matter an object has. Think of the difference between a small female gymnast and large male football player. The two athletes' bodies move differently because of their difference in mass. The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram. 

;Seconds (Time)
:Describes the passage of time or aging of the universe.The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom. 

;Kelvin (Thermodynamic temperature)
:The kelvin is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.

;Mole (Amount of substance mole)
:1. The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon 12; its symbol is &quot;mol.&quot; 
:2. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or specified groups of such particles. 

;Ampere (Electric current)
:The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 x 10^-7 newton per meter of length. 

;Candela (Luminous intensity)
:The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 x 1012 hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.

=== Other Units ===
;Potential (V)
:Think about batteries (1.5v), and how you can potentially get a good trade

;Temperature (K)
:You won't usually see this, but otherwise think Fahrenheit when you think about the weather and think Celsius when you cook.

==Derived units==
;Force (N)
:The Newton is a product of Mass with Acceleration, representing a force. 
:1.0 N = 0.24 lbs of force, defining lbs using Earth's value of gravity

;Velocity (m/s)
:The motion of an object based on time, with a direction. Velocity is always specified with a direction, such as “12 miles per hour north”. 
:If the direction is not specified, it is called Speed.

;Acceleration (m/s^2)
:The rate at which an object is changing Velocity. 

;Momentum (kg m/s)
:The product of weight with speed. Note that heavy or fast objects have high momentums.

== Conversions ==
Though best learned in chemistry, conversion are simply ways in which you can represent a relative quantity.

Nano-10^-9
milli-10^-3
centi-10^-2
Kilo-10^3

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Linux GUIs ==
Desktop environments and window managers are not the same. A desktop environment includes all the software needed for a desktop, including a window manager, but a window manager only manages the windows and does not include any other software. Sometimes window managers provide extra features, such as a pager.

=== Desktop environments ===
;[http://www.gnome.org GNOME][[File:JauntyGUI.png|thumb|Ubuntu 9.04 uses the GNOME desktop environment]]
:GNOME (pronounced /ɡəˈnoʊm/) is a desktop environment composed entirely of free and open source software. It is an international project that includes creating software development frameworks, selecting application software for the desktop, and working on the programs which manage application launching, file handling, and window and task management.
:GNOME is part of the GNU Project and can be used with various Unix-like operating systems, most notably those built on top of the Linux kernel and the GNU userland, and as part of the Java Desktop System in Solaris.
:See [[Using GNOME]]
{{-}}
;[http://www.kde.org KDE][[File:KDE 4.png|thumb|The K Desktop Environment]]
:KDE (pronounced /ˌkeɪdiːˈiː/) is a free software project based around its flagship product, a cross-platform desktop environment designed to run on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X systems. The goal of the project is to provide basic desktop functions and applications for daily needs as well as tools and documentation for developers to write stand-alone applications for the system. In this regard, the KDE project serves as an umbrella project for many standalone applications and smaller projects that are based on KDE technology. KDE software is based on the Qt toolkit. The original GPL version of this toolkit only existed for the X11 platform, but with the release of Qt 4, GPL versions are available for all platforms. This allows KDE software based on Qt 4 to also be distributed to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.
:See [[Using KDE]]
{{-}}
;[http://www.xfce.org/ XFCE][[File:Xfce-4.2.2.png|thumb|The lightweight XFCE desktop environment]]
:Xfce (pronounced as four individual letters) is a free software desktop environment for Unix and other Unix-like platforms, such as Linux, Solaris and BSD. It aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually appealing and easy to use.
:The current version, 4.6, is modular and reusable. It consists of separately packaged components that together provide the full functionality of the desktop environment, but which can be selected in subsets to create the user's preferred personal working environment. Xfce is mainly used for its ability to run a modern desktop environment on relatively modest hardware.
:It is based on the GTK+ 2 toolkit (the same as GNOME). It uses the Xfwm window manager. Its configuration is entirely mouse-driven, and the configuration files are hidden from the casual user.
{{-}}
&lt;div class=&quot;messagebox&quot; style=&quot;clear:all;&quot;&gt;Note: Both GNOME and KDE use comparatively higher system resources than XFCE and Fluxbox. So if you are on a old PC (eg., Pentium 200 MHz, or have less than 128 MB RAM) you should seriously consider XFCE and Fluxbox over the heavyweights. Same apply if you find KDE or GNOME somehow slow on your high end workstation. IceWM, though minimalist, is fast, reliable, themable, and less resource intensive than the others.&lt;/div&gt;

=== Window managers ===
;[http://www.compiz.org/ Compiz][[File:Xgl window switching.png|thumb|Compiz uses compositing and transparency to achieve attractive and useful effect, like window-switching, shown here.]][[File:Fedora-Core-6-AIGLX.png|thumb|Compiz's famous rotating desktop cube.]]
:Compiz is one of the first compositing window managers for the X Window System that uses 3D graphics hardware to create fast compositing desktop effects for window management. The effects, such as a minimization effect and a cube workspace are implemented as loadable plugins. Because it conforms to the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual standard, Compiz can substitute for the default Metacity in GNOME or KWin in KDE.
:Compiz plugins include the famous cube effect (example to the right), Alt-Tab application-switching with live previews or icons, and a feature similar to Exposé.
{{-}}
;[http://www.enlightenment.org Enlightenment]
:Enlightenment, also known simply as E, is a stacking window manager for the X Window System which can be used alone or in conjunction with a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE. Enlightenment is often used as a substitute for a full desktop environment.
{{-}}
;[http://fluxbox.sf.net/ FLUXBOX][[File:Adesklets.jpg|thumb]][[File:Fluxbox.png|thumb]]
:Fluxbox is a stacking window manager for the X Window System with the aim to be lightweight. Its user interface has only a taskbar, a pop-up menu accessible by right-clicking on the desktop, and minimal support for graphical icons. All basic configurations are controlled by text files, including the construction of menus and the mapping of keybindings. Fluxbox has high compliance to the Extended Window Manager Hints specification.
:Fluxbox can show some eye candy: colors, gradients, borders, and several other basic appearance attributes can be specified. Recent versions support rounded corners and graphical elements.
:Because of its small memory footprint and quick loading time, Fluxbox is popular in many Live CDs such as Knoppix STD and GParted.
{{-}}
;[http://fvwm.org/ FVWM][[File:Fvwm wiki screen.png|thumb]]
:The F Virtual Window Manager is a virtual window manager for the X Window system. Originally a twm derivative, FVWM has evolved into a powerful and highly configurable environment for UNIX systems.
{{-}}
;[http://www.icewm.org/ IceWM][[File:Icewm1220.png|thumb]]
:IceWM is a stacking window manager for the X Window System graphical infrastructure. It is relatively lightweight in terms of memory and CPU usage, and comes with themes that allow it to imitate the GUI of Windows 95, OS/2, Motif, and other graphical user interfaces. IceWM is meant to excel in look and feel while being lightweight and customizable.
:IceWM can be configured from plain text files stored in a user's home directory, making it easy to customize and copy settings. IceWM has an optional, built-in taskbar with menu, tasks display, network and CPU meters, mail check and configurable clock. Official support for GNOME and KDE menus was previously available as a separate package. In recent IceWM versions, support for them is embedded. External graphical programs for editing configuration and menu exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''distribution''' is a type of Linux. Linux comes in a large number of distributions, some of which are designed for everyday use, and others designed with a specific task or device in mind. We'll discuss some of those differences below.

Most Linux distributions have a special type of CD, called a '''live CD'''. If you insert this CD and then restart your computer, the live CD will run Linux on the computer while avoiding changing anything on your computer as much as possible. For example it won't normally install any files on your PC, but run only from the CD. You can give the operating system a try to see if you like it without the risk of installing anything on your hard drive. You should remember that linux typically runs very fast - if the system seems slow, it is because it is running off your CD drive, not your hard drive.

==Choosing A Distro==
There are dozens of different Linux distributions. Here are some ways to help you narrow down the options to a short list.

;How do you intend to use the system?
:Desktop or server? This distinction is probably the most important. Distributions for the desktop will have a [[w:graphical user interface|graphical user interface]], while server distributions won't.
;Specific hardware requirements
:Try out a few LiveCDs of different distributions. Does it recognize and work properly with your hardware?
:If you intend to install Linux on a low-end specification computer, or you have other peculiar hardware compatibility problems or requirements, your choice might be influenced by this need. Most linux distributions should run fine on all but the lowest end of the spectrum.
;Application support
:Which applications or desktop environment are important to you?
:Does a given distribution install those programs by default or is it easy to install and integrate them with the rest or your system?
:Does the distribution have a good package management system, and suitable software repositories?
;Support
:What options will be available for getting support? Is commercial (paid) support available? Is there free community support? If the distribution has a small user base, you will have a harder time getting distribution-specific support, as compared to a more widely-used distribution.
;Desktop environment
:For desktop systems, you'll need to feel at home. Check out [[../Desktop environments]] for information on some common ones. GNOME and KDE are the two most popular.

Try a distro chooser, like http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/. Often several different distributions will meet all your requirements. Your final choice from the short list may be based on whim or personal taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
'''Welcome to the world of free and open source software!'''

Welcome to [[w:Linux|Linux]]! GNU/Linux is descended from the [[w:UNIX|UNIX]] operating system, but is [[w:open source|open source]] software, which means that you can view its source code and change it to suit your needs. Of course since this book is geared to those new to Linux, we stay away from very technical issues that are more suited to Linux veterans. This book is going to try to be geared toward the person who has heard about Linux and might be considering trying it out or perhaps the person who has already &quot;taken the plunge&quot; and is looking for more information or wondering where to start now that they have Linux installed. But first, a little history lesson.

The name &quot;Linux&quot; technically refers to an operating system &quot;kernel&quot;, a single but key component of a complete operating system. In everyday use, the term &quot;Linux&quot; is frequently used to refer to a complete operating system which consists of the kernel and some of the thousands of other programs required to make an operating system useful. Much of the important system software that is typically installed on a Linux system comes from [http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html The GNU Project], a project to build an operating system made entirely of free software. 

The first Linux kernel was created by [[w:Linus Torvalds|Linus Torvalds]]. It was first released on 5 Oct 1991. It was started as an x86-only, single-processor operating system, but grew to become one of the most ported pieces of software. Other parts of a complete GNU/Linux system come from other projects such as the GNU project, and are integrated into a complete GNU/Linux OS by your supplier. Usually your supplier will assign their own version number to the integrated whole.

The GNU Project is overseen by the [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]], founded by [[w:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]], who believes that the people should use the term &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; to refer to such an operating system, because so many of the required programs were in fact, written as part of the GNU Project.

      <comment>/* Starting Linux (Booting) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Starting Linux (Booting)==
When a computer is turned on, it normally begins the process of &quot;booting&quot; by reading software from the system's hard disk (or other [[w:non-volatile storage|non-volatile storage]] medium), and loading it into memory and then executing it. In this process the kernel is loaded and then various other system programs may be loaded.

A Linux system can be configured to boot up to one of several available &quot;run levels&quot;:
&lt;!--These don't apply to all distros - do we even need to talk about this now? runlevels are fairly advanced--&gt;
 0     Halt the system.
 1     Single-user mode (for special administration).
 2     Single User Mode with Networking
 3     Multi-User Mode - boot up in text mode
 4     Not yet Defined
 5     Multi-User Mode - boot up in X Windows
 6     Reboot.

===Debian===
The following quote from ''The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ'' explains how to add a custom procedure to a Debian or Debian based system boot:

''Suppose a system needs to execute script foo on start-up, or on entry to a particular (System V) runlevel. Then the system administrator should:

* ''Enter the script foo into the directory /etc/init.d/.''
* ''Run the Debian command update-rc.d with appropriate arguments, to set up links between the (command-line-specified) directories rc?.d and /etc/init.d/foo. Here, '?' is a number from 0 through 6 and corresponds to each of the System V runlevels.''
* ''Reboot the system.''

''The command update-rc.d will set up links between files in the directories rc?.d and the script in /etc/init.d/. Each link will begin with a 'S' or a 'K', followed by a number, followed by the name of the script. Scripts beginning with 'S' in /etc/rcN.d/ are executed when runlevel N is entered. Scripts beginning with a 'K' are executed when leaving runlevel N.''

* An integrating factor of &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x) &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;  e^{\int P(x)\, dx}&lt;/math&gt;
===Vectors===
* The vector equation of a plane through point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; with normal vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{a})\cdot\mathbf{n} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
===Complex Numbers===
If &lt;math&gt; z = e^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt; then:
:* &lt;math&gt; \cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}\left(z+\frac{1}{z}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2i}\left(z-\frac{1}{z}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Representation of data==

Data that is presented in a systematic manner is much easier to understand. Consequently the next step after data collection is to lay the information out in an orderly way - usually as a table.

A well constructed table must have a) A clear, comprehensive, explanatory title b) Be systematically formated c) Identify the source of the data d) All units of measurment must be clearly stated (sometimes in the headings of the columns or rows) e) The headings to all columns and rows must be unambiguous - if it would be too long, then use a short title PLUS a footnote.

Systematic formating is the hard bit. Here you must ask yourself what is the purpose of the table: a) To present the data collected in an orderly manner b) To show distinct patterns in the data c) To summarise the data In most cases, good layout is obtained by first asking what data must be presented adjacent to each other and then asking supplementary questions such as should totals be shown, should percentages or other derived statistics be shown, or would they just clutter up the table.

Permutation - The total number of ways of arranging ''r'' objects from ''n'', where order is important, e.g. choosing a school football team and positions, where anyone can play any position

Combination - The total number of ways of choosing ''r'' objects from ''n'', where order is not important, e.g. choosing three cards from a deck, so that you gain a 2, a 3 and a 4 '''in no particular order'''

Combinations - Use the button marked nCr on a calculator, or the formula
&lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}&lt;/math&gt;

Permutations - Use the button marked nPr on a calculator, or the formula
&lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}&lt;/math&gt;

(b) solve problems about selections, e.g. finding the number of ways in which a team of 3 men and
2 women can be selected from a group of 6 men and 5 women;
(c) solve problems about arrangements of objects in a line, including those involving
(i) repetition (e.g. the number of ways of arranging the letters of the word ‘NEEDLESS’),
(ii) restriction (e.g. the number of ways several people can stand in a line if 2 particular people
must — or must not — stand next to each other);
(d) evaluate probabilities in simple cases by means of enumeration of elementary events (e.g. for
the total score when two fair dice are thrown) or by calculation using permutations and
combinations;
(e) use addition and multiplication of probabilities, as appropriate, in simple cases;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{bicycles}}

'''Lights''' are an essential cycling accessory and any cyclist that intends to ride in dim lighting conditions, or poor weather such as fog or rain should not consider riding without lights.

==Why use lights?==

Although bikes sold for use on the roads are required to be supplied with reflectors, these really should not be relied on to keep you visible on the roads [http://sheldonbrown.com/reflectors.html]. Cyclists should be responsible for their own safety and acknowledge that not only are proper lights a common courtesy to other road users, they are one of the ways to promote your safety on the roads.
Darkness and bad weather can make cyclists almost invisible to other road users. A light may be the only thing that makes a driver or pedestrian realize that the faint shadow up ahead is actually a cyclist.

==Types of Lighting==

There is a wide selection of bicycle lights available, all with their own characteristics. It is definitely worth discussing your needs and cycling habits with the staff in the store you intend to buy your lights from.

There are generally three types of lighting used for bicycles, based around either Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), Halogen filament bulbs or High-Intensity Discharge (HID) bulbs. It is very rare to see lights based around other light sources, so unless they are expressly recommended by an expert they should be treated with caution when buying. 
Bicycle lights can also be powered by different means. The most common are ordinary batteries, rechargeable batteries, &quot;bottle&quot; dynamos and Hub dynamos.

==LED lighting systems==

LED lights are very popular amongst cyclists and have a number of excellent characteristics. They are lightweight, relatively cheap, bright, compact and reliable. They require very little maintenance- LEDs have a very long lifespan and don't need to be replaced like bulbs. LEDs are generally battery powered and give excellent battery life. Many LED lighting systems are also demountable; you can detach the lights and take them with you if you are going to leave your bike locked up in public. 

LED lights often come with the option of a variety of flashing modes, as well as a steady beam. While you are required by law to have lights attached to the frame that emit a steady beam, many cyclists also attach additional lights to their bike or clothing that are set to flash. Flashing lights tend to attract the attention of drivers and increase battery life although with LED there is little need to increase the battery life, especially if using rechargable batteries, and flashing lights can be distracting to other road users or cause you to be in more danger because it is more difficult to judge the distance of a flashing light.

One issue with LEDs is that they emit quite a narrow beam that appears weaker the further you move from the optimum viewing angle. All LED lights should have a light diffuser which will increase their effectiveness.

In 2014, modern high power white LEDs can be very bright, currently up to slightly over 1000 lumens from a single emitter and can completely replace older lighting systems under all conditions. 

===Halogen lighting systems===

Most cyclists find that LEDs do not provide a powerful enough beam to illuminate the road. This means that while they work very well as a tail light in all conditions and as a headlight in areas with street lighting they will not provide illumination of the way ahead like a car's headlights might. Cyclists that need to cycle down unlit roads often choose a Halogen light for their headlight. Halogen lights give a very bright beam for relatively low power consumption, although they are more power hungry than LED systems. They tend to be available with more power source options than LED lights, such as rechargeable batteries and dynamos. Because they use more batteries and produce more heat than LEDs, halogen lights also tend to be very slightly bigger and heavier than LEDs, the trade off being their superior performance for specialist use.

==Power Sources==

Bicycle lights are normally powered by either batteries or dynamos. The Key difference between batteries and dynamos is that, by using a dynamo you generate your own electricity to power the lights on your bike and by using batteries you get power from a disposable (and environmentally harmful) source. Both the lights and the generators for Dynamo systems are initially more expensive than battery powered lights, however this can be offset over the lifespan of the product by the fact that you are not paying to recharge or replace batteries. While most battery powered lights attach to the bike by a simple clip mechanism, meaning they can be removed to prevent theft, most dynamo lights have to remain clipped to the frame due to the wiring that connects them to the Dynamo.

==Battery power===

LED systems tend to run off battery power, as it provides a steady, constant, compact and lightweight source of power that suits the characteristics of LED systems. LEDs don't use battery power very quickly and are a very economical form of bicycle lighting. You can use your own rechargeable batteries but they tend not to come as standard



==Increasing your visibility==
Wear light coloured clothing and reflective or illuminated materials.
Make sure that the reflectors fitted to your bicycle are still attached. In the UK it is a legal requirement to have pedal reflectors and a rear reflector in addition to a white front light and a red rear light.
Many cyclists are struck by vehicles emerging from side streets so consider fitting additional reflectors that work from the sides. Reflectors are available that fit to the wheels or onto spokes.
Try to use lights that emit some light sideways as well as just forwards and backwards.
Use your lights in low visibility conditions, for example if it is raining heavily or foggy, or if you are cycling when the sun is low in the sky and could dazzle other road users.
Make sure that your lights are clean and that the batteries are in good condition.
If you do not have suitable lighting or are caught out by nightfall, walk your bike instead of riding home you are better of late than _the_ late.

==Tips==

Always check that the lights you buy are weatherproof. You will need them in the rain!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Current environmental science major at san diego state university, i have always loved the idea of doing physical experiments. Possibly, i want to become a physics teacher in the future that can make students realize that physics is relevant and that their are many opportunities in science that students can and should realize.


----


Noticing a trend that not as many students are pursuing sciences and engineering in general, i want to make them realize that regardless of what they may become, science can and should be applied to life in general.

e-mail: compatta(at)yahoo.com 


== My interests include: ==
#-physics
#-Cognitive learning models of physics (educational technology)
#-Integrating fun things with the ever complext curriculum in schools.
#-the general &quot;tricks&quot; that students can use to learn algebra and math in general easier  to understand. Citing methods from around the world to figure out math (such as the mehtod to multiply extremely large numbers). Make complext areas of calculus that typically have the &quot;academic brow&quot; which tends to make cocnepts more complex than they should be.
#-Making texts in general more interesting for students. Not merely the study as my english teacher always said, &quot;the study of dead white men's work.&quot;



----

My heroes include:
#-Hewitt, the person who conveyed that complex ideas can be represented in simple explanations and diagrams.
#-stallman, open source father.
#writer of &quot;algebra for gansters&quot;</text>

Is it worth having some pictures/videos of how to grip sticks/beat the drum, etc? It always helps me to see it being done.  What's your thought?  I could do some basic picture taking/recording and then upload that. [[User:Kayvan.walker|Kayvan.walker]] 16:04, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

This is cool, I'll try to add to this page too, I think there should also be a section on playing different styles [Gio] 12/03/09

== musical notation ==

Isn't that difficult, using something like musescore, and exporting to SVG. Can we do that too?</text>

   summary=[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3yusJNVslo video (Media Noche)]. Right-to-right, follower turns right, left, leader turns right, [[Rueda de Casino/Enchufa|Enchufa]] then [[Rueda de Casino/Dile Que No|Dile Que No]].|
   related=[[Rueda de Casino/En Loji|En Loji]], [[Rueda de Casino/Montaña|Montaña]]
}}
&lt;noinclude&gt;
From [[Rueda de Casino/Guapea|Guapea]], instead of pushing, the leader changes to a right-to-right hold, and turns the follower to her right, then an [[Rueda de Casino/Enchufa|Enchufa]], still right-to-right.

He then turns himself to the left, turning his back on the follower, changing hands behind his back, so that he has left-to-right.
He then does an [[Rueda de Casino/Enchufa|Enchufa]] and [[Rueda de Casino/Dile Que No|Dile Que No]].

Throughout the first two turns, the leader is moving clockwise around the follower.

Hand Signal: Raise the little finger of the right hand.

There are some variations:

* Some leaders will keep right-to-right throughout, taking their right arm above their head.
* Some leaders will reach to the middle with their right hand, after changing to left-to-right, and all push away from each other in the middle.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

      <comment>/* The 8086 Registers */ FLAGS</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Assembly Page}}

When using x86 assembly, it is important to consider the differences between architectures that are 16, 32, and 64 bits. This page will talk about some of the basic differences between architectures with different bit widths.

== The 8086 Registers ==

The 8086 registers are the following: AX, BX, CX, DX, BP, SP, DI, SI, CS, SS, ES, DS, IP and FLAGS. They are all 16 bits wide.

On any Windows-based system (except 64 bit versions), you can run a very handy program called &quot;debug.exe&quot; from a DOS shell, which is very useful for learning about 8086.

;AX, BX, CX, DX: These general purpose registers can also be addressed as 8-bit registers. So AX = AH (high 8-bit) and AL (low 8-bit).

The problem was this: how can a 20-bit address space be referred to by the 16-bit registers? To solve this problem, they came up with segment registers CS (Code Segment), DS (Data Segment), ES (Extra Segment), and SS (Stack Segment). To convert from 20-bit address, one would first divide it by 16 and place the quotient in the segment register and remainder in the offset register. This was represented as CS:IP (this means, CS is the segment and IP is the offset). Likewise, when an address is written SS:SP it means SS is the segment and SP is the offset.

=== Example ===

If CS = 0x258C and IP = 0x0012 (the &quot;0x&quot; prefix denotes hexadecimal notation), then CS:IP will point to a 20 bit address equivalent to &quot;CS * 16 + IP&quot; which will be = 0x258C * 0x10 + 0x0012 = 0x258C0 + 0x0012 = 0x258D2 (Remember: 16 decimal = 0x10). The 20-bit address is known as an absolute (or linear) address and the Segment:Offset representation (CS:IP) is known as a segmented address.

It is important to note that there is not a one-to-one mapping of physical addresses to segmented addresses; for any physical address, there is more than one possible segmented address.  For example: consider the segmented representations B000:8000 and B200:6000. Evaluated, they both map to physical address B8000 (B000:8000 = B000x10+8000 = B0000+8000 = B8000 and B200:6000 = B200x10+6000 = B2000+6000 = B8000). However, using an appropriate mapping scheme avoids this problem: such a map applies a linear transformation to the physical addresses to create precisely one segmented address for each.  To reverse the translation, the map [f(x)] is simply inverted.&lt;p&gt;

For example, if the segment portion is equal to the physical address divided by 0x10 and the offset is equal to the remainder, only one segmented address will be generated. (No offset will be greater than 0x0f.) Physical address B8000 maps to (B8000/10):(B8000%10) or B800:0. This segmented representation is given a special name: such addresses are said to be &quot;normalized Addresses&quot;.&lt;p&gt;

CS:IP (Code Segment: Instruction Pointer) represents the 20 bit address of the physical memory from where the next instruction for execution will be picked up. Likewise, SS:SP (Stack Segment: Stack Pointer) points to a 20 bit absolute address which will be treated as stack top (8086 uses this for pushing/popping values)

=== 32-bit registers === 

With the chips beginning to support a 32-bit data bus, the registers needed to be updated to support the larger registers. The names for the 32-bit registers are simply the 16-bit names with an 'E' prepended.

;EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX : These are the 32-bit versions of the registers shown above.

=== 64-bit registers ===
The names of the 64-bit registers are the same of those of the 16-bit registers, except beginning with an 'R'.

;RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI, RBP, RSP : These are the 64-bit versions of the registers shown above.

;R8~15 : These are new extra registers for 64-bit. They are counted as if the registers above are registers zero through seven, inclusively, rather than one through eight.

== The A20 Gate Saga ==

As was said earlier, the 8086 processor had 20 address lines (from A0 to A19), so the total memory addressable by it was 1 MB (or &quot;2 to the power 20&quot;). But since it had only 16 bit registers, they came up with segment:offset scheme or else using a single 16-bit register they couldn't have possibly accessed more than 64 KB (or 2 to the power 16) of memory. So this made it possible for a program to access the whole of 1 MB of memory.

But with this segmentation scheme also came a side effect. Not only could your code refer to the whole of 1 MB with this scheme, but actually a little more than that. Let's see how...

Let's keep in mind how we convert from a Segment:Offset representation to Linear 20 bit representation.

The conversion:

    Segment:Offset = Segment x 16 + Offset

Now to see the maximum amount of memory that can be addressed, let's fill in both Segment and Offset to their maximum values and then convert that value to its 20-bit absolute physical address.

So, max value for Segment = FFFF
and max value for Offset  = FFFF

Now, let's convert FFFF:FFFF into its 20-bit linear address, bearing in mind 16 is represented as 10 in hexadecimal :-

So we get, FFFF:FFFF = FFFF x 10h + FFFF = FFFF0 + FFFF = FFFF0 + (FFF0 + F) = FFFFF + FFF0 = 1 MB + FFF0 

*Note: '''FFFFF is hexadecimal and is equal to 1 MB''' (one megabyte) and '''FFF0 is equal to 64 KB minus 16 bytes.'''


'''Moral of the story:''' From Real mode a program can actually refer to (1 MB + 64 KB - 16) bytes of memory.

Notice the use of the word &quot;refer&quot; and not &quot;access&quot;. Program can refer to this much memory but whether it can access it or not is dependent on the number of address lines actually present. So with the 8086 this was definitely not possible because when programs made references to 1 MB plus memory, the address that was put on the address lines was actually more than 20-bits, and this resulted in wrapping around of the addresses.

For example, if a code is referring to 1 MB, this will get wrapped around and point to location 0 in memory, likewise 1 MB + 1 will wrap around to address 1 (or 0000:0001).

Now there were some super funky programmers around that time who manipulated this feature in their code, that the addresses get wrapped around and made their code a little faster and a fewer bytes shorter. Using this technique it was possible for them to access 32 KB of top memory area (that is 32 KB touching 1 MB boundary) and 32 KB memory of the bottom memory area, without actually reloading their segment registers!

Simple maths you see, if in Segment:Offset representation you make Segment constant, then since Offset is a 16-bit value therefore you can roam around in a 64 KB (or 2 to the power 16) area of memory. Now if you make your segment register point to 32 KB below the 1 MB mark you can access 32 KB upwards to touch 1 MB boundary and then 32 KB further which will ultimately get wrapped to the bottom most 32 KB.

Now these super funky programmers overlooked the fact that processors with more address lines would be created. (Note: Bill Gates has been attributed with saying, &quot;Who would need more than 640 KB memory?&quot;, these programmers were probably thinking similarly). In 1982, just 2 years after 8086, Intel released the 80286 processor with 24 address lines. Though it was theoretically backward compatible with legacy 8086 programs, since it also supported Real Mode, many 8086 programs did not function correctly because they depended on out-of-bounds addresses getting wrapped around to lower memory segments. So for the sake of compatibility IBM engineers routed the A20 address line (8086 had lines A0 - A19) through the Keyboard controller and provided a mechanism to enable/disable the A20 compatibility mode. Now if you are wondering why the keyboard controller, the answer is that it had an unused pin. Since the 80286 would have been marketed as having complete compatibility with the 8086 (that wasn't even yet out very long), upgraded customers would be furious if the 80286 was not bug-for-bug compatible such that code designed for the 8086 would operate just as well on the 80286, but faster.

== 32-Bit Addressing ==

32-bit addresses can cover memory up to 4 GB in size. This means that we don't need to use offset addresses in 32-bit processors. Instead, we use what is called the &quot;Flat addressing&quot; scheme, where the address in the register directly points to a physical memory location. The segment registers are used to define different segments, so that programs don't try to execute the stack section, and they don't try to perform stack operations on the data section accidentally.

- Edited page. The formal conversation named the speakers &quot;Herre Nilsen&quot; and &quot;Herre Klaaborg&quot;, which is not correct.

== Davs in formal conversation ==

I don't believe &quot;davs&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; ) is used formally – on the contrary it is a very informal greeting (but since spoken Danish is almost always very informal it doesn't actually matter very much). It is also falling out of use, and many young people would probably consider it archaic.</text>

:the book is certainly not finished.  Page numbers would be a good idea, but I am not sure if it is possible [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 00:34, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

== thanks ==

is this book finished now? thanks to all for writing, but a quick note; i dont know if it can be fixed, but when i go print preview some of the math on the bottom of the pages is cut off and won't show up properly on print-out, could this be because of use of mozilla or??

== Major sections and page breaks ==

I started adding page breaks between major sections so that when the printed version is previewed or printed, sections that are logically separate are physically separated.  The highest level sections (e.g. Precalculus, Limits, Differentiation, etc) I have on their own page.  It looks pretty sparse currently.  What I envision is a page with the name of the major section (maybe in an artful font), maybe a graphic illustrating something relevant to the section, and maybe a brief introduction to the topics covered in that section.  Unfortunately I don't have time to implement that currently.  Maybe someone who has more time can work on it, or maybe if I get time later I can come back and work on it.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 16:50, 21 May 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>In short, Haiku is an open-source re-creation of the operating system BeOS.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Haiku? ==

In short, Haiku is an open-source re-creation of the operating system BeOS. In 1990, a company called [[Wikipedia:Be Incorporated|Be Incorporated]] was found in California, USA, by ex-Apple employees [[Wikipedia:Jean-Louis Gassée|Jean-Louis Gassée]] and [[Wikipedia:Steve Sakoman|Steve Sakoman]]. Be, Inc. had a vision: to create a powerful, elegant, media-oriented, and friendly computer with a matching operating system. They did create one. The computer was called the [[Wikipedia:BeBox|BeBox]], and it and its operating system, the [[Wikipedia:BeOS|BeOS]], were first presented at [[Wikipedia:Agenda 95|Agenda 95]] in October, 1995. It made the audience go wild.

The BeBox was ahead of its time in many ways. In the middle of the 1990s, it was unheard of that a consumer PC would have more than one CPU. The BeBox had two CPU's; originally AT&amp;T Hobbits, and from 1995 onwards PowerPC. The operating system, BeOS, had pervasive multithreading, pre-emptive multitasking, 64-bit journalling, database-like filesystem, very low latency in audio and video tasks, and a clean, slick user interface. It was, in a word, an operating system you could almost fall in love with.

Sadly, as things go, Be had to quit hardware due to financial and hardware supply problems, and they ported BeOS to PowerPC in 1997 and later, in 1998, to Intel compatible systems. Although the operating system had many enthusiastic users and developers, it never gained a significant market share. Lack of applications was one thing, as BeOS was developed from scratch and had only partial POSIX compatibility. In 2000, Be released the BeOS version 5.0, called the Personal Edition, for free (as in freeware) on the Internet &amp;ndash; which undermined the sales of the Pro edition, increasing Be's financial difficulties. The company shifted its focus to Internet appliances, which eroded the credibility of BeOS as a viable alternative to Windows or Linux. Be, Inc. went bankrupt in 2001.

Be left a legacy: a free of charge version of the BeOS. Although the operating system's future looked bleak, many still wanted to use it daily. From that want rose several projects to re-implement the BeOS experience in open source. Haiku is one of them.

Haiku is Japanese and means a short poem of a certain type. Originally, when the project was started in late 2001, it was called OpenBeOS; later, it was renamed Haiku. Haiku poems are simple and elegant, and that is what the Haiku Operating System also strives to be. The goal of Haiku is to be source and binary compatible to BeOS 5.0, and then extend it further to new areas. Because of the modularity of BeOS and because a free of charge, usable version was available, it was not an impossible task to start recreating the operating system.

At the time of writing this introduction (Dec 2005), Haiku has advanced slowly but steadily. The first working, alpha version seems to be just around the corner.

== Purpose of this book ==

What you are reading now is the Unofficial Haiku Handbook &amp;ndash; a user manual. This book will guide you in installing and using Haiku, configuring it, installing software, connecting to other computers, playing media files, and managing your files efficiently. Although it is written more from the beginner's perspective, many old, advanced BeOS users will no doubt find useful hints. Haiku R1 is very similar to BeOS 5.0.

FIXME: Add description of chapters once the table of contents has been fixed.

== Differentiation is NOT in C1 ==

Sorry to all you guys that have put this here, but I have just checked the OCR syllabus, there is no mention of Differentiation at all.

It's deff in the Edexcel syllabus...

--
It's DEFINITELY in the OCR syllabus. We just did about 2 weeks of it and it's in my OCR book. [[Special:Contributions/82.20.215.203|82.20.215.203]] ([[User talk:82.20.215.203|talk]]) 17:37, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

== From Talk:A-level Mathematics/C2/Differentiation ==

Hi, I've just added quite a bit on differentiation.  It could probably do with some editing and probably re-writing.  This is my first real addition to wikibooks so sorry if it isn't that good ^^.
Anyway, there is still more that is required based...However it appears in C1 I believe, not C2, so perhaps someone could move this page unless I am mistaken.  I was also wondering...would it be possible to add multiple index pages so that this book could cover multiple syllabuses, since that basic differentiation is also what I did on AQA for P1 as I recall. Anyway, hope what I put is at least some use as a foundation, bye for now. [[User:Robb3h|Robb3h]] 19:10, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

No problems, im fairly new to wikibooks myself. I just checked my textbook and it appears in chapter 8 under a C2 tab, i had previously moved it from C1 to here. I thought the textbook I have covers all examining bodies. P1 is a mix of C1 and C2. The alternative index pages seem like a good idea, that only leaves the question of which index page will be the main one. [[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 13:45 29 July 2005

I'm in the second year of my OCR Maths A-level, and last year differentiation was definitely C1 (and still is, I hasten to add). I don't want to move anything without some consensus, but it would seem it should be under C1... [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 00:48, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

Differentiation definately under C1 - doing AS and covered it very recently. However I think there is more differentiation under C2 - perhaps a seperate topic for that.

:Take a look at my [[User_talk:Krackpipe#A-level_Mathematics|talk page]], this issue has been resolved, and differentiation is in fact in C1. I moved it by accident because I confused two different, but similarly named, specifications from the same examining group.--[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 19:49, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

== Related Rates ==

The solution to the moving ladder problem uses implicit differentiation (not covered until C4?) and seems too complicated for C1. I can't see a way to solve this problem using only C1 differentiation, so perhaps it should be changed/removed. [[User:Aleksev|Aleksev]] 18:18, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

This still needs  a LOT of work.  There is absolutly NO explanation of what exactly a derivative ''is''.  The module jumps right to the power rule, bypassing the basis of derivatives, which are really the '''limit of a secant line.'''  Pictures wouldn't hurt either.--[[User:Crucible Guardian|Crucible Guardian]] 21:09, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== A Suggestion ==

I am not familiar with A-Level Mathematics, so of course, I cannot do this myself.  However, it would be nice if a proof for the different rules was shown alongside the rules, unless they are postulates.  Which I assume they cannot be.

== bath tub example. ==

i think the bath tub example is probably a bad one. the maths is sound, but the example is confusing because a bath would never fill at such a rate. unless you have very odd plumbing the bath will almost certainly fill at a constant rate. something like the acceleration of a car makes much more sense and would be easier to understand.

Good Idea Fixed. [[User:Keytotime|Keytotime]] 18:09, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

== Differentiation IS in C1 ==

look at page 8 in the spec 
[http://www.ocr.org.uk/Data/publications/key_documents/AS_A_Level86696.pdf]



== Afraid not... ==
Look at the date on that spec. I'm doing C1 / 2 now and I know for a fact that C1 has been done and dusted for a month and only now are we doing Differentiation. It is in C2</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Once upon a time, their were two types of people. The people of toaster town and the people of Glove town.
Every so while, a person from each town would observe each others differences, perhaps wanting to move to
live a lifestyle which is good for them. People from toaster town observed that people in glove town typically &quot;had no energy.&quot; The people of the town were very slow moving and conservative. They tended to resist the advances in Toaster town because they thought &quot;Energy will destroy the very meaning of our life.&quot; Thus, they enacted the &quot;no moving electrons&quot; law and thus all the people in the town stayed at home, preferring to abundantly stare at the wall.

Similarly, the people from Glove town observed that people in Toaster town tended to have &quot;lots of energy.&quot; Being liberal, they embraced the concept of &quot;energy&quot; and typically have places called &quot;Energy bucks&quot; to give them energy to live their fast placed life. Everybody tended to walk very fast and seemed to work as delivery people, giving &quot;current&quot; to others and living their own happy lives.

&lt;math&gt;Ohms Law: R = E/I&lt;/math&gt;
*(higher) resistances, (Less) current
*(lower) resistances, (higher) current

Similarly, the people of both the towns are there to represent a key point in electrical circuits: Ohm Law. What basically Ohms law says is that if the resistance is higher, than the current will be lower. Conversely, if resistance is lower, than the current will be higher. As you you can see, there are generally two types (in actuality there are more, but for the sake of learning) Inductors and conductors. Inductors, as represented as &quot;glove&quot; town, tend to have very high resistances and don't tend to pass too much electrons from one point to another. Conductors, as represented as &quot;Toaster&quot; town, tend to have lower resistances and pass electrons of current easier easier.


Atomic Representation of Inductors.

(ex) Heavy metal Concerts: no passes

Inductors are basically molecular &quot;bouncers&quot; that don't tend to accept electrons from one point to another.

Atomic Represenation of COnductotors.

(ex)Heavy Metal Concerts: with passes

Conductors are like the young, rich, electrons that pass freely through the metal gates and thus enjoy the concert freely.

Just in case you didn't know:
Don't touch the inside of your computer without touching metal!!


The most apparent form of electricity for a majority of mankind has been this force called &quot;static electricity.&quot; As young children, we used have fun and rub our feet over the carpet and thus shock our friends which this intense shock (though, not enough to harm you). As you have grown older, likely you would have gotten this shock when touching your car door. Here is an experiment in which you want to consider.

FEET (hippy like conductors)
Try this experiment with no shoes and rub your feet across a carpeted area. Feel the shock!

Shoes (for conservative inductors)

Try this experiment with rubber boots. Now, rub your feet across the carpeted and feel....well nothing.

== Incredibly verbose, does not get to the point ==
I am new to Blender and this wall of text provides so much of a challenge to get past I cannot get past it. Really, a n00b does not need to know everything that is happening. Just show with just the text needed in incremental steps how the process is done. As it stands now it is more confusing than anything. I don't even know where to start from a reference point of view either.

== Can I write this chapter ==
Does anyone mind if I write this chapter? If not where can I put screen shots.
After watching the Video I had a better idea of how to do UV Mapping but I still had a hard time unwraping a simple box. I imagine that other noobs like me would have the same problem so I just wanted to write a small one that shows how to map a box.

:::Yes.  For technical reasons related to 'homogeneous coordinates' you need four numbers to describe a 3D vertex.  Hence, 3D graphics people use X,Y,Z and W for 3D coordinates.  In the early days of texture mapping, U and V were the logical choice because they are the immediately previous letters in the alphabet before W.  However, blender is a bit behind the times because with modern hardware you can have 3D textures - which means you need another letter (and with 'homogeneous texture coordinates', two more letters).  In modern shader languages (Cg, GLSL, HLSL) S,T,P and Q are used for texture coordinates (R is not used because it gets confused with the 'R' in RGBA.  Hence, the 'modern' nomenclature ought to be 'ST' or 'STP' mapping...but many engineers and almost all artists still talk about &quot;UV mapping&quot; out of habit.

And the author should keep in mind that noobs don't know how to do anything! &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:75.137.124.50|75.137.124.50]] ([[User talk:75.137.124.50|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/75.137.124.50|contribs]]) 14:30, 12 January 2008  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

: Even newbs should be able to read the instructions at the beginning of the tutorial.  It clearly says on the first or second page (the one that explains what all the abbreviations will be) that RMB is Right Mouse Button.  And DO try to read all the instructions before you go and complain.  [[User:HydraZulu|HydraZulu]] ([[User talk:HydraZulu|talk]]) 17:30, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

== no &quot;UV Face Select&quot; window mode? ==

I cannot find this window mode in Blender 2.46--[[User:5o|5o]] ([[User talk:5o|talk]]) 17:30, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

:Neither can I - but I think everything works OK if you leave the thing in Edit Mode.

:This entire WikiBook needs to be fixed up for more recent editions of blender.   The problem is that most newbies will be downloading the latest and greatest version - so it's hardly necessary to talk about the older versions of blender that are out there - but keeping up to date with the latest changes is vitally important because otherwise we noob's will continually hit roadblocks like this when trying to follow the instructions.

== Python script error? ==

When I try to save the unwrapped mesh by going to UVs -&gt; Scripts -&gt; Save UV Face Layout, I get a Python script error. Anyone know what this is about? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:157.127.124.14|157.127.124.14]] ([[User talk:157.127.124.14|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/157.127.124.14|contribs]]) 06:24, 2 October 2008  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

Blender 2.48a on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron): I get no response, erroneous or otherwise when using UVs -&gt; Scripts -&gt; Save UV Face Layout.  Instead I used the image provided, selected a hemisphere from the 3D view, then positioned the half of the unwrapped mesh in the UV Image Editor view over one of the image hemispheres, then repeated for the other.  I ended up with a passable blue marble.

== Unexpected ==
As a new user to Blender, I have been using 2.45 up until quite recently. Perhaps a mention of what to expect? From 2.45 to 2.48a. When you unwrap there is an active face, but if you are not expecting that active face to be missing in UV unwrap and appear to be missing in 3d view. It can be off putting for new people, as they think: &quot;What have I done wrong now?&quot;&lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:90.214.110.98|90.214.110.98]] ([[User talk:90.214.110.98|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/90.214.110.98|contribs]]) 18:39, 19 February 2009  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== UV sphere ==
Perhaps this tutorial would work better with a UV sphere instead. Just my two cents.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:70.115.234.192|70.115.234.192]] ([[User talk:70.115.234.192|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/70.115.234.192|contribs]]) 11:16, 24 February 2009  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== Rectangular UV Map ==
You can also use a normal rectangular pic of the earth and unwrap it. I started with a satellite image of the earth from maps.google.com, without labels. I opened it in the UV Image editor, and unwrapped. Then I took the two polygons and moved some of the pixels, pushing them into the center and into the corners to fill completely the rectangular picture. This wraps and renders quite nicely, with a bit of fiddling of the pixels, and happens to be better than the supplied images in this tutorial which are not complete halves of the earth, but approximately thirds, so are missing most of the southern hemisphere. You can also photoshop the rectangular image and remove the Google text so it doesn't show up on your rendered earth.

== Page Layout ==

With Blender 2.49b being standard and 2.5x nearing completion, shouldn't the &quot;2.49b&quot; section be moved to the top and renamed, followed by sections dealing with versions prior to the 2.49b release?

I agree. At the risk of complication and server space it might even be worthwhile to have two chapters addressing the same subject.  The first should have a title making it clear it is for versions before 2.45.  The other's title should explicitly say it is for version 2.49 (and later).  I have 2.49.  The video on UV mapping is very well presented and everything works logically with great facility.  Unfortunately, in my case, the commands no longer are in version 2.49.[[User:WindsorSpring|WindsorSpring]] ([[User talk:WindsorSpring|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/WindsorSpring|contribs]]) 15:20, 20 February 2011 (UTC)

== Should anything else be added to this? ==

Hi everyone,
I've just finished updating this page to the 2.6x series. Does anyone think more content should be added to this page? e.g a section for Blender's new box mapping feature/descriptions of the other unwrapping options?

Would be interested to hear your ideas...

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
The original browser of choice among Mac OS X users was Microsoft's Internet Explorer for Mac. However, after Internet Explorer rose to dominate the market, Microsoft grew complacent and stopped updating it. By 2002, Internet Explorer was no longer a modern browser, and Apple began work on its own web browser to replace it. 

In January of 2003, Apple's CEO Steve Jobs announced Safari, an all-new, Apple-designed web browser that was designed to replace Internet Explorer for Mac.

Since then, Safari has evolved into a browser to be reckoned with - with the greatest standards compliance of any browser (Mac or Windows), fast performance, and a crop of advanced features like tabbed browsing, RSS, and AutoFill. It's the third most popular browser in the world and the single most popular browser available for Mac OS X.


{{Info|'''NOTE:''' Just as this wikibook assumes moderate computer experience, this chapter assumes you're a proficient internet user. If none of these words mean anything to you, seek out a book on the web for beginners: link, form, account, inbox, address, and Google.}}

=The Safari Interface=
This section looks at Safari's interface and explains how to use it to browse the web. &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Safari is unique in that it actually has ''two'' toolbars (called the &quot;Address Bar&quot; and the &quot;Bookmarks Bar&quot;).&lt;/font&gt; Both can be toggled on and off independantly in the View menu. In addition, you can use the view menu to opt for a &quot;status bar&quot; to appear along the bottom of the window. This bar will display page loading progress and will tell you where links lead to if you roll your cursor over them.

Note that there's a third toolbar in Safari, called the &quot;Tab Bar&quot;. You'll use it only if you turn on tabbed browsing, which is discussed later on in this chapter.

==The Address Bar==
This brushed metal toolbar houses all of Safari's basic web browsing controls. Like most toolbars in Mac OS X, the Address Bar is totally customizable. The default, factory-fresh toolbar has the following buttons and fields on it:

*Back/Forward - These two conjoined buttons let you go back to the previous page you viewed, or reverse the action of pressing the back button and return to the page you went back from.
*Stop/Reload - These two Web Browsing mainstays have been combined into one button: when a page is loading, this button halts the page-loading process. When Safari isn't loading anything, the button '''re'''loads the current page, in case it changed since you last loaded it or didn't load properly the first time around.{{Info|'''NOTE:''' Many other browsers refer to the reload button as &quot;Refresh&quot;, so if a website tells you to refresh the page, reload instead.}}
*Add Bookmark - This essential button, marked with a plus sign, lets you add the page you're looking at to your bookmark collection. Bookmarks are covered later on in this sub-chapter, along with exactly how this button works.
*Address and Search - These two text fields are probably the most important items in the Address Bar, and browsing without them would be very difficult indeed. The Address Field lets you type a web address (aka &quot;URL&quot;), and one press of the Return key later, takes you directly to it. It even doubles as a progress bar, filling up with a blue color as a page loads. The Search field, which is pill-shaped and marked with a magnifying glass, lets you perform a Google Web search right from your Safari toolbar. Clicking the tiny arrow next to the magnifying glass lets you review searches you have previously made.{{Mac Trick Box|You can proportion the two text fields by dragging the small dot between them.}}{{Yellow_Warning|'''WARNING:''' Don't confuse the Address Bar and the Address Field! The Address Bar is the entire toolbar that the Address Field resides in, along with the other items described here.}}


If you want to, you can add other buttons to the toolbar to help improve your web-browsing experience. You know the toolbar customization drill: right-click the toolbar and choose &quot;Customize Toolbar&quot;.

The other buttons availible are:
*Home - Safari lets you set a &quot;Home Page&quot;, which is the first page you'll see when you open Safari. This button takes you there.

*AutoFill - AutoFill, a supremely useful Safari feature, is covered later on in this sub-chapter.

*Print - The print button does the same thing as the File &gt; Print command or the ⌘P keystroke: it opens the standard Mac OS X print box and offers to print a hard copy of a web page for you.

*Report Bug - These days, Safari's standards compliance is legendary. It was the first broswer ever to pass the &quot;Acid2&quot; test, a modern benchmark for browser compatibility. But back in the day, when Safari was still in beta (geek-speak for &quot;released for testing&quot;) and Apple was just learning the ropes, the Report Bug button let Safari users complain to Apple about websites that didn't work correctly. It still works today, in case you find a site that disagrees with Safari.

==The Bookmarks Bar==
The thin metal strip of words under the Address Bar is the Bookmarks Bar. It's discussed in the Bookmarks section of this sub-chapter.

=Browsing Around=
==Setting a Home Page==

==Downloading Files==
==Blocking Pop-Ups==
==Saving and eMailing==
==PDF Files==
==Spell Checking==
Safari, like most applications that use Apple's standard Programming API, has access to OS X's built-in spell check service. It can be used several ways. The first, and easiest to use way, is to have OS X check spelling as you type. This method can be activated by first clicking in any web page's entry field, then going to Edit &gt; Spelling then select 'Check Spelling as You Type.' This feature will then underline misspelled words in red and allow you to correct the word from its suggestions by Control-Clicking (Right-clicking with a two-button mouse) the word. If you know you spelled the word right you can have OS X add it to the spelling dictionary by selecting 'Learn Spelling' from the Control-Click menu. This setting may only be active for that session of Safari but once activated only the red underlining may go away on relaunch. Spelling options will still be a Control-Click/Right-click away and easily re-enabled.

Alternatively you can check the spelling of an entire text area by pressing ⌘; or by using the Edit&gt;Spelling&gt;Check Spelling menu command. If you only want to check one word using this method simply select the word you wish to check and then pressing ⌘; or use Edit&gt;Spelling&gt;Check Spelling. Preferences for how spelling is checked can be changed, including what dictionary to use, by using the Edit&gt;Spelling&gt;Spelling… menu command.

Note spell checking will not pick up Roman numerals. (try to spell check cdcdc ). Spell checking must also be enabled per application even though it is a shared program (so [[Mac OS X Tiger/Meet the Applications/TextEdit]], [[Mac OS X Tiger/Meet the Applications/Mail]], and others need their own enabling of spell check.

If a spelling error is added it is put in a file at '~/Library/Spelling/en' if the entry is in English. There is syntax in the file so be wary editing it.

=Bookmarks and History=
As you browse the web, you may find it convenient to keep certain web addresses handy for easy access. Safari includes many places to keep these stored addresses, called bookmarks.

The first place is the Bookmarks Bar. This brushed-metal strip directly below the Address Bar is something like a Dock for bookmarks: it keeps your ''very'' favorite websites within easy reach. To add a bookmark to this bar, navigate to the page you want to add. Click on the &quot;Add Bookmark&quot; button in the Address Bar, type a short name for the bookmark, and choose &quot;Bookmarks Bar&quot; from the pop-up menu. Then click &quot;OK&quot;. 

The bookmark now appears directly in the Bookmarks Bar. You can now visit the site you bookmarked simply by clicking the name that you chose.


{{Mac Trick Box|You can reorder bookmarks in the Bookmarks Bar by dragging them horizontally.}}


If the Bookmarks Bar fills up, an &gt;&gt; icon appears at the end. Clicking this shows a menu that contains all the bookmarks that didn't fit. However, this is hardly an ideal solution. For bookmarks that you use semi-frequently but do not want on your Bookmarks Bar, you can use the Bookmarks Menu instead.

This menu works just like the Bookmarks Bar. To add a page, navigate to the page you want to add, click on the &quot;Add Bookmark&quot; button, type a name, but this time choose &quot;Bookmarks Menu&quot; from the pop-up menu. Then click &quot;OK&quot;. The page now appears in the Bookmarks menu.

==Bookmarks Manager==
===Folders===
Once you start accumulating bookmarks, you'll want to organize them into folders. To do this, you'll use a part of Safari called the Bookmarks Manager. You can get to the Bookmarks Manager by clicking the little book icon in the left side of the Bookmarks Bar. The website you were viewing will be temporarily covered up by the Bookmarks Manager. This screen lets you organize your bookmarks and delete ones you don't want anymore.

The sidebar on the left contains collections of bookmarks. You'll notice that two of these collections are named Bookmarks Bar and Bookmarks Menu. These contain the bookmarks that appear in the Bookmarks Bar and Bookmarks Menu. Click one of these in the sidebar, and the contents pane to the right will display the bookmarks inside.

Let's say you want to add a folder inside the Bookmarks Menu collection. To do this, click the ''second plus button from the left'' at the bottom of the screen. The folder appears in the contents pane, ready to be named. Once you have finished typing a name, press the return key. You can then put the bookmarks inside the folder by dragging them onto the folder's icon. Folders like these are great for grouping websites with similar subjects; you could create a folder called &quot;Macintosh&quot; that contains all of your Mac-related websites. 

Folders appear in the Bookmarks Bar as pop-up menus, and in the Bookmarks Menu as sub-menus. 

If you want to delete a bookmark or folder of bookmarks, find it in the Bookmarks Manager, select it in the contents pane and pressing the delete key on your keyboard.

===Collections===
There are some other collections in the sidebar besides &quot;Bookmarks Bar&quot; and &quot;Bookmarks Manager&quot;. These contain bookmarks that appear in neither the Bookmarks Bar nor the Bookmarks Menu. You actually have to open the Bookmarks Manager and double-click on them when you want to access the site they point to. This is rather inconvenient, so these folders are for bookmarks that you use infrequently. 

You can create a collection with the '''plus button at the the far left'''. Apple gives you a bunch of these collections already stocked with bookmarks to help you discover some websites. But if you don't want them gunking up your sidebar, you can delete them by clicking on their name and pressing the delete key on your keyboard.

{{Mac Trick Box|You can do a Spotlight search for your bookmarks with the search field at the bottom of the Bookmarks Manager.}}

===History===
=Tabbed Browsing=
==Basics==
Tabbed Browsing is a productivity feature in Safari that lets you view multiple web pages in the same window. It vastly streamlines the browsing experience, and it's a great idea to learn how to use it.

The first thing you have to do is turn Tabbed Browsing on. To do this, you'll need to visit Safari Preferences. Just like every other application, Safari's preferences can found in the application menu, or can be accessed by pressing ⌘-comma.  Once you're inside Safari Preferences, click on &quot;Tabs&quot;. The pane that appears contains three checkboxes. The top one is the one you're looking for; the master switch that turns on Tabbed Browsing. However, don't expect anything magical to happen when you check the box. You can now close Safari Preferences.

The magic happens when you create a tab. To do this, press ⌘T. A few things happen. First of all, the third toolbar mentioned at the beginning of this sub-chapter magically appears below the Bookmarks Bar. This is called the Tab Bar. You'll notice it contains two tabs. Try clicking them and watch what happens. One of the tabs contains the web page you were just viewing; the other one is the one you just created, which is blank.

Each tab is now a totally separate entity. You can browse the web in one tab, then click on the other and find it totally undisturbed. If you're in the middle of editing a Wikibook and want to quickly check on Mac news, you can create a second tab for the Mac news site, browse around a bit, and then go right back to your Wikibook editing. Depending on how you browse the web, you might find it convenient to open three, four, or even ten tabs at the same time.

You can close any tab by clicking on the little &quot;X&quot; button inside it.

==Tips and Tricks==
A few tabbed browsing pointers:
*You can opt to have the tab bar displayed even with only one site open by checking &quot;Always show tab bar&quot; in the Tabs pane of Safari Preferences.
*You can still open multiple windows when tabbed browsing is turned on. Each window can have a different set of tabs inside.
*The keyboard shortcuts used for tabbed browsing change depending on settings. Check the Tabs pane of Safari Preferences for a list of keyboard shorcuts that apply to your current settings.

=RSS=
RSS stands for &quot;Really Simple Syndication&quot;. It's an emerging web standard that lets website creators make special pages for their websites called &quot;feeds&quot;. Feeds have no visuals or layout; they simply provide a list of links with descriptions. It's up to an RSS reader application like Safari to display the links in a feed in a visually appealing way.

Feeds are taking the web by a storm, and you're lucky to have Safari; its RSS functionality is often considered the best of any browser. As you will see if you read this section, there are many unique uses for feeds.

==Finding a Feed==
Finding a feed is pretty easy. Start by hopping on over to [http://www.apple.com apple.com]. 

{{Mac Note Box|Remember to hold down ⌘ as you click the link. Doing so will cause it to open in a new window or new tab (depending on settings), so you can continue to read this wikibook while trying out the feed.}}

This is the beginning point for what will become a '''Contradancers Guide to Successfully Beginning Scottish Country Dance'''.  For now, I'm going to throw in a big disorganized mass of text, and hope that I can get some help in putting the thing together in a way that will be coherent and usable.

It should be noted that, while the main audience for this text are experienced contradancers, the text should be useful to other beginners at SCD.  


== Introduction ==

Contradance (Contra) and Scottish Country Dance (SCD) are related forms who trace their histories through English Country Dance (ECD).  Contra derives from localized variants of ECD in the Eastern United States from the time of English colonization that were revived with the popularization of folk music in the 1960s and have been adapted, modified and expanded over the decades since.  SCD was  known as “English Country Dance as Danced in Scotland” until the Second World War. 

From these similar origins, some substantial differences have developed.  Contra is a relatively relaxed and open form. Contra is done to a walking step, while SCD is done with a number of precisely defined and executed steps.  In SCD, there is a strong connection between the specific dances and the music they are danced to, while most Contra dances have no particular association to given pieces of music.  Minimum competency can be achieved in Contra with a short workshop before a dance, and intermediate status can be achieved after a few nights of dancing.  In SCD, minimum competency comes after a month or more of weekly classes, and intermediate status takes six months to a year of weekly classes to achieve.  

This last part is very important for the contradancer attempting to learn SCD to keep in mind – it is going to take a lot longer to know what you're doing with SCD than it did to learn Contra.  While you are struggling to learn footwork, pas-de-basque and how to tie them together into figures and formations, you will be finding others with more experience who seem to be doing all of those things with little thought or effort.  If you are patient with yourself and patient with others during your months of steep learning curve, you will find that you will soon be doing those things with as little thought and effort as the others, and that you're having quite a good time.  You will also find rather quickly that your Contra experience gives you a leg up on the beginner with no background in country dance.  

You may also find that you have developed a number of bad habits in Contra that SCD will make painfully obvious (and painful).  Correcting those habits will improve your Contra experience (and the experience of those you dance with as well).  

==Is SCD for you?==

It's not for everybody, not even every contradancer.  The only way to know for sure is to show up and try some classes and talk to your instructor about whether you're picking it up or not.  However, the following might give you an idea if you're apt to find this a good fit.

# Do you count the bars while dancing contra?
# Do you enjoy proper dances?
# Do you enjoy dances done in three and four couple sets, rather than long-line sets?
# Do you like dancing with people who try to dance their figures correctly and on the correct count?
# Would you enjoy Contra a bit more if it was a bit more formal or elegant sometimes?
# Do you like being around people in traditional Scottish dress on occasion?
# Do you have an affinity for traditional Scottish things?


== Helpful Hints ==

=== 1.  Commit to giving SCD a fair try ===


This is an important principle in Contra as well, as you've likely noticed beginners that show up after the beginner's workshop, stick with their beginner friends, never quite seem to get the hang of any of the dances, and leave (perhaps early) that night and never come back.  This is an even larger issue in SCD, where the learning curve is much steeper and longer than that of Contra.  A fair try in Contra would be two or three dances, to take into account differences in callers, partners, and bands, any of which could be a tough fit for the beginner.  A fair try in SCD would be three to six months of weekly classes and as many evenings of dancing as occur.  This will give you time to learn enough of the basics well enough that you can begin to get the sense of a dance so that you can not only remember the figure you're doing right this second, but also remember the next figure that's coming and how to flow from the one to the other.  The first time this happens is a rather magic moment, and, until you've experienced it, you won't really understand what SCD is all about.  Having (hopefully) reached this point with Contra already, you can appreciate this all the more when it happens in SCD.

=== 2.  Get involved with the classes ===

This is very different from Contra, and is worthy of a lot of emphasis.  SCD requires classes -- only the very most talented dancers will be able to pick up a minimal understanding of SCD from attending dances, and it will take them a period of years to get to that point.  By far the best way is to attend classes where you can be taught the basic steps, figures, some dances and etiquette.  

=== 3.  Come to the dances. ===


This should be less of a problem with Contradancers than with beginners that don't have a background in dance, because the dances are all there is to Contra.  However, many beginners think that they aren't good enough dancers to come to a dance, and this is just wrong.  The dance floor is a large space, and a good dance program should have a number of easy, beginner-friendly dances on it.  Come to the dance and you will get to meet and dance with dancers that don't attend your classes.  Dances are a very valuable place to learn what dancing is all about and how it works.  You will doubtless hear many times that SCD is social dance, and the place where SCD is social is at the dances.  There is an etiquette to learn that will make what you see done at dances make more sense.

== Before your first class ==


Before you show up for a class, it's not a bad idea to consider buying a good pair of dancing shoes (if you don't already have one).  Most male SCDers will be wearing ghillies or jazz shoes, and female SCDers will wear either of those or ballet shoes (not toe-shoes).  The soft-soles these have are easier on the floors you are dancing on, and will give you a better balance between sticking to the floor and sliding than most street-shoes.  Over time, maintaining traction on these shoe surfaces will be an issue, and you can get tips from experienced dancers on how to address it.

It's also not a bad idea to make contact with the instructor of the beginners class to verify the time and place information you've got, to introduce yourself, and to begin to get a feel for how the instructor operates.  They can also let you know about the local dance opportunities, the cost of the class, etc.  Ask about how beginner-tolerant the intermediate or experienced dance class is.


== At your first class ==


It's a good idea to show up a little early at your first class.  This will give you time to change into your dancing shoes, meet the instructor, and maybe chat with some of the other dancers.  You can also get a good warm-up prior to the class if you'd like.  

Something you should know by now is that dancing with beginners is very hard.  Learning SCD in an all-beginner environment is tricky because you not only need to learn how to dance your part --  you also need to learn enough of what your partner is to do that you can help prompt your partner from time to time.  This is an reason why going to dances is important while you're learning -- you will be able to dance with more dancers with more experience at the dances than you will in a beginners class.

==Things your teachers will teach you in class==

Yes, these are things your teachers will teach you, but you might find that the additional modality of reading will help you understand what they're saying.  
===Hands===
There are some phrases and words used in SCD that have specialized meaning.  For example, you will be told that any time you take hands in a figure, you should use a “hand-shake hold”.  This does not mean the same grip that two American businessmen would use in a meeting, and trying to use that grip will lead to confusion and awkward dancing.  “Hand-shake hold” means a hold where the gripping is done with the fingers and thumb, and what is held is the fingers – the palm of the hand is not involved.  This is usually done with the gentleman holding his hand out with his fingers horizontal, and the lady placing her hand on top of his.

When taking hands on the side of the dance, there are a number of systems as to how this should be done.  One is that, if there is an odd number of folks taking hands, the person in the middle will keep their palms up, with those on each side putting their palms down.  Another is that hands should be held with the left palm down and the right palm up so that everybody has their thumbs pointing to the right.  Clearly, these two systems are mutually exclusive, and adherents to either system, on the very rare occasion the subject comes up for open conversation between experienced dancers will result in disagreement about which method is proper.  In practice, the system that seems to happen the most is that hands are put out for gripping purposes without being looked at.  If the hands are lined up for an easy grip, that grip is taken.  If not, one or both parties will quickly switch their hand position until a grip can be taken.  In time, as you become familiar with the people you are dancing with (and, most of the time, you will be dancing with the same group of people), you can learn who takes which approach, if they have one, and adjust accordingly.

===Feet===
====Positions====
SCD uses foot positions taken from ballet.  For those not familiar with them, this guide might be helpful:

*'''First position''' is with the heels together, toes apart, so the feet form a right angle.

*'''Second position''' is like first position, but with the feet one step apart (heels more or less under the shoulders).

*'''Third position''' has the heel of the front foot resting in the instep of the other foot, forming a T.

*'''Fourth position''' is similar to third, only, again, the front foot is about a step further from the other foot, but the feet still form a right angle.

For all of these positions, even while resting, the weight should be on the balls of the feet and the toes, not the heels.  Having the heels off of the ground is a good thing.  

====Traveling Steps====

When dancing to a jig or a reel, the traveling step will be the '''skip change of step''' usually referred to as &quot;skip-change.&quot;  Skip-change begins from first position with the right foot going forward into fourth position, the left foot closing into third position, and the right food going forward again to fourth position, then the left foot moving forward into fourth, the right closing into third, and the left returning to fourth, then repeating with the right foot going back into fourth.  Once through this pattern takes two bars of music, with the right foot going forward on all odd-numbered bars, and the left foot going forward on all even-numbered bars.

When dancing the slower '''strathspey''' (which all instructors should tell you is unique to SCD), the step is actually similar in terms of what has been described here -- it starts in first position, the right foot goes forward to fourth, the left closes into third, etc.  However, this is done more slowly (as the music is more slow), the weight remains on the back foot in strathspey (it is on the front foot in skip-change), and there is a small hop as you switch from having the right foot forward in fourth to the left foot forward in fourth (and vice versa) to allow the back foot to go forward.  Those who have seen or done Irish Step Dance may want to lift their knees up during the hop, but this should be resisted willfully.  SCD tends to prefer straight legs as much as possible.  Also, on the first step, since the weight is on the back foot, the front leg stretches into fourth while the back knee bends, ready to spring straight for the push to move the weight to the front foot when it's time to close to third.  

Both steps are easier to do than these descriptions make them sound.  They can be about as difficult to learn as these descriptions indicate, so, if you're not getting them the first time you try them, don't be discouraged.  While you're dancing, watch others feet, not your own, and you'll find that you'll soon be doing them correctly.  

For circling, and a few other figures, we use '''slip step''' in which you start in first position, extend the left (or right) foot into second position, then bring the right (or left) foot to close back into first position.  Two of these open-close combinations go into one bar of music, rather than two bars for each right-left combinations in the other steps, so &quot;two bars of slip step&quot; is actually four slip step steps.  Beginners rarely have trouble learning slip step.

If you're ever too tired to do these steps properly, or if your legs or knees aren't up to the strain, a prompt walking step can cover the same ground in the same time.  

====Setting Steps====

Setting steps keep your feet and body moving without moving you across the floor very much or at all.  
=====Pas de basque=====
In jigs and reels, the setting step is the '''pas de basque''', which, for as common a step as it is, can be quite tricky to learn -- many experienced dancers do not do the pas de basque in a manner close to what is described here or in the instructions from the RSCDS.  This is a matter to apply as much patience as you need to.

The pas de basque begins (usually) in first position by moving the right foot into second position, then moving the left foot in front into third position, then raising up on the left foot for a beat, lowering to the right foot for a beat, then moving the left foot into second position, bringing the right foot in front into third position, raising up on the right foot for a beat, lowering to the left foot for a beat, then repeating.  This right-then-left combination will take two bars of music, and should have a definite movement of the body to the right and then left, and also a definite change of weight on the parts where you are raising up on the front foot that's in third position.  

The right-to-left movement should center on the place where you're dancing, so that your net movement is no movement at all.  

=====Strathspey=====

The setting set in strathspey time is much easier to learn and do than pas de basque.  It begins from first position, stepping the right foot into second position, closing into third position ''behind the right'' with the left, then stepping into second again with the right and bringing the left foot up to the side of the right leg during the hop, then returning the left foot to second, stepping into third ''behind with the right'', the back into second with the left and bringing the right foot up to the side of the left leg during the hop.  

=====Highland Schottishe Setting=====
This is a rather tricky variant of the strathspey setting step where you raise your right hand and bend your elbow so that your hand is above your head while you hop on your left foot once while moving your right foot out to second position, hop on your left again while bringing your right foot up behind your left leg (so the foot is in line with the leg, toes down), hop on your left again while bringing your right foot back out to second, hop on your left again while bringing your right foot up in front of your left leg (again, so the foot is in line with the leg, does down), then bringing your hand down and doing the rightward-moving portion of the strathspey setting step.  Half-way done now.  Then you reverse the process, putting your left hand above your head, and hopping once on the right while bringing your left foot out into second, hopping again on the right whle bringing your left foot behind the right leg, hopping again on the right while bringing your left foot into second again, hopping yet once more while bringing your left foot up in front of your right leg, and then dropping your hand while doing the leftward portion of the strathspey setting step.  

This means that one time-through of Highland Schottishe Setting will take four bars of music.  

If your instructor has you trying this before you've been in class for a year, it is okay to give them a suspicious or accusing look.  

====Petronella====

Petronella is actually a figure, but, since it's a close variant of setting, it's usually presented with setting, so it's being presented here with setting.  This does not refer to the petronella turn you learned in Contra -- they're derived from the same figure, but you'll need to do each a while to see how they're related. 

A petronella is done just like a regular pas de basque or strathspey setting step, with the same foot-to-beat pattern going on as the setting step, only it begins with the right foot going forward into fourth position rather than second position, the weight-shift portions accompanied by a pulling-back of the right shoulder, then the left foot going back into fourth position behind, continuing the pulling-back of the right shoulder such that, when you've finished, you're now half-way across the dance, facing to the left of where you started the petronella.  If repeated (which it often is) from that ending position, the second petronella will put you on the side opposite where you started.

== At your first dance ==

Your first dance can be a rather scary thing.  It's very easy to psych yourself out because you don't think you're good enough to go around experienced dancers.  However, most experienced dancers are happy to see new faces and will offer support and encouragement to new dancers.  

Your dance program should be available well ahead of time, and should include a mix of easier dances and more challenging dances, and those difficulty levels should be indicated in some fashion on the dance program.  It is a good idea to look the program over ahead of time with your instructor and decide which dances you'll be dancing, and, perhaps, to go over the dance descriptions shortly prior to the dance.  It's a good idea to pick a more experienced partner for dances that you're less certain about, so that you will have more support should you need it.

===Briefing v Walk-throughs===
It's a very good idea to ask whether the dances will be introduced by being briefed or whether there will be walk-throughs.  If you're going to do so, however, you should know a little history of the controversy you will be edging into.

In the old days, when people generally lived their lives and died within a few hours walking distance of where they were born, and the number of dances to know was much smaller, each community would have its set of dances that everybody learned and knew.  From this the tradition was that you should already know how to do a dance before the dance comes, so the dance would not be taught at a dance.  Later, as this became less true, the standard became that the dance would be briefed from memory by an instructor, with, again, the idea that you should know a dance well before lining up to dance it.  Many groups still use this standard.  Other groups will provide one (or more) walk-through to make more certain that everybody lined up for a dance has some idea what they're doing, which makes matters much easier for beginners and those traveling to attend a dance. 

Those who prefer briefing only will explain that it saves time, so that more time can be spent dancing.  Those who prefer walk-throughs will point out that walked-through dances are more likely to work out the first time, so the dance is less likely to need to be repeated.  

Without attempting to resolve the point in this space (which would mean nothing to any given group) the point here is that you should know how many, if any, walk-throughs will be taking place, so as to give you an idea of how prepared you need to be when you get to the dance.  

=== Dance Etiquette ===


Note that the following are not necessarily all universal guidelines to dance etiquette in all places.  However, they should give you a plan you can follow as you walk into a dancing experience.  

The program for a dance is usually published well before the dance, so it will be no mystery in most cases what the next dance will be.  However, it is customary to not take a partner nor to line up before either the name of the dance is announced or a portion of the music for the dance has been played.  It is nice if ladies not be in too much of a hurry to pair up with other ladies, particularly if the dance is small, as this can lead to men not having ladies to partner with.  

When taking a partner, it is customary for the man to take the lady by her left hand and his right hand so that, as they walk toward the top of the hall (the side from which the music is coming), they are lined up on the proper sides.  The first man in the top set of each line is expected to count the couples of his line and assign them to their sets.  This is the equivalent to &quot;hands four from the top,&quot; and it can take some time to get the sets figured out.  

It is no longer expected that the man accompany his partner back to the seat she was in when he asked her – it is rather likely that she wasn't seated when he asked her and that that particular spot of the floor has no particular significance to her.  

As in Contra, there is an expectation that you will dance with different partners throughout the evening of dancing, and, as with Contra, it's usually easy to not have to repeat a partner in an evening of dance.

== Figures shared between Contra and SCD ==


Due to their common origins, Contra and SCD have some shared figures.  Some will be similar figures, and some will have similar names, and some will be both.

==Vector==
A vector is a mathematical quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction. The direction is usually expressed as an angle in degrees. For example if it is said  that a ball is rolling down a hill at 30 metres per second and the hill has a 30 degree slope then this is a vector quantity. However if it is only said that it is rolling down the hill at 30 metres per second then it is a scalar quantity. A scalar quantity will only give a magnitude and not a direction. In most mechanics problems the direction will have a profound impact on the motion.

===Representation of Vectors===
When you write a vector you must add an arrow to the top like so &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt;.  When you draw a vector you need to draw as an arrow slanted at approximately the same degree as the direction. The vector described above would be drawn as such: [[Image:M1vector1.svg|20px]].

==Components of  Force==
A force is a vector that can be separated into x and y components which are perpendicular to each other. We separate a force into components so that we can add multiple forces together. [[Image:M1vector2.svg|centre|230px]]

If you draw an accurate enough diagram you can find the x and y components. However this can be tedious and is error prone and is unacceptable on the A-level examination. Instead you need to use trigonometry to separate a vector into x and y components. The force is always the hypotenuse of the triangle. The angle, which is the direction that the force is applied, is usually given in degrees. However sometimes you will also find the angle given in the Cardinal directions (east, south, west, north,etc.).

===Example 1===
Find the x and y components of a 40 Newton force acting on a ball at a 30° angle.
#Using the mathematical formulae we get:
##&lt;math&gt;y\ Force = 40N \sin 30 = 20N\,&lt;/math&gt;
##&lt;math&gt;x\ Force = 40N \cos 30 = 34.64N \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 2===
Find the Angle &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;  if the resultant force is 24N and the y component of the force is 18.11N.
##Using the mathematical formulae we get:
##&lt;math&gt;\theta=\arcsin\left(\frac{18.11N}{24N}\right) =49^{\circ} \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Resultant Force==
	When multiple forces are acting on one object you will get a resultant force. The resultant force is how all the forces combined will act on the object. The procedure for finding the resultant force is as follows:
#Draw the forces and the angles on a Cartesian plane. This is to ensure that you get the right angles.
#Make all angle in terms of the positive x axis.
#Separate each force into its x and y components. 
#Add all the x and y components. You can also use  the '''i''' and '''j''' notation,  where '''i''' is the horizontal component  and '''j''' is the vertical component.
#Find the resultant force.
#Find the angle. If a force is negative make it positive. Then place the angle in the right quadrant, because the inverse tangent will place all angles in the first quadrant. If necessary review Core 2 Trigonometry.
===Example 1===
A group of people are playing football. The ball is kicked simultaneously by one person with a force of 60N at an angle of 73°, another kicks the ball with a force of 40N at a 20 angle west of south and the third kicks with a 100N force at a 124° angle. What is the resultant force and angle?
#Draw the forces and the angles on a Cartesian plane. This is to ensure that you get the correct angles.
#:[[Image:forceaddex1.svg|200px]]
#Make all angle in terms of the positive x axis.
#:The 60 N is acting at a 73° angle.
#:The 40 N is acting at a  250° angle.
#:The 100N is acting at a 124° angle.
#Separate each force into its x and y components. 
##For the x components
#:&lt;math&gt;x\ Force = 60N \cos 73 = 17.54N \,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;x\ Force = 40N \cos 250 = -13.68N \,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;x\ Force = 100N \cos 124 = -55.92N \,&lt;/math&gt;
##For the y components
#:&lt;math&gt;y\ Force = 60N \sin 73 = 57.38N \,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;y\ Force = 40N \sin 250 = -37.59N \,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;y\ Force = 100N \sin 124 = 82.9N \,&lt;/math&gt;
#Add all the x and y components.
## x Force =  17.54N - 13.68N - 55.92N = -52.06
## y Force =  57.38N - 37.59N + 82.9N = 102.69
#Find the resultant force.
#:&lt;math&gt;F_{resultant}=\sqrt(-52.06^2+102.69^2) = 115.13N&lt;/math&gt;
#Find the angle.
#:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{102.69}{52.06}\right)=63.11^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;
#:Since the cosine is negative and the sine is positive the angle is in the second quadrant. 180° - 63.11° = 116.88°.

The resultant force will be 115.13N and will act at a 116.88° angle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objectives ==

By the end of this chapter you should be able to do the following:

Use (and recall) the definition of ''linear momentum'', and show an understanding of its vector nature in 1 dimension.

Understand and use ''conservation of linear momentum'', in 1 dimension, and solve simple problems involving direct collision of two bodies before and after impact.

== Momentum as a vector ==
Because momentum is defined to be mass times velocity, momentum is the product of a scalar and a vector, which is ultimately a vector.

&lt;math&gt;p = mv&lt;/math&gt;

== Conservation of Momentum ==

Within a closed system (i.e. a system not subject to an external influence) momentum is '''always''' conserved. Due to this, we can easily derive the following formula that is used in working out momentum:


&lt;math&gt; (M_1 * U_1) + (M_2 * U_2) = (M_1 * V_1) + (M_2 * V_2) &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

M = Mass
U = Initial Velocity
V = Velocity after collison

Whatever the momentum on the LHS, the total momentum on the RHS will be the same.


== Collisions ==

The conservation of momentum is best illustrated through an example question:

[[Image:Momentbefore.jpg]]

The system before the collision. 


[[Image:Momentafter.jpg]]

The system after the collision.

As we have all the values before the collision, we can use the formula above to work out the total momentum in the system:

&lt;math&gt; (2 * 5) + (5 * 0) = 10 Ns&lt;/math&gt;

Now we know that momentum before = momentum after. So, 10 = (2 * 10) + (5 * ?). This may seem to be unworkable at first, but because velocity is a vector and the two balls are rolling in opposite directions, the 5kg ball has a negative velocity. 

Rearranging our formula we get 10 - 20 = 5 * ?. Rearranging this again to &lt;math&gt; (10 - 20)/5 = ? &lt;/math&gt; we can see that &lt;math&gt;? = -2ms^-1&lt;/math&gt;

Is there any particular reason that it uses Jesus as an example? That doesn't seem particularly neutral...

What's the idea of having a table where you have to inflect nouns in cases if we have studied only nominative case? And below the table is exercise to copy pronoun table from lesson 7, but lesson 7 seven doesn't exists anymore. I wonder if the table can be removed or should it be moved to some other lesson? (And sorry my bad english)

Pardon if I am not polite, but I really think that this chapter could have been made by a silly or a person who does not know how to build a book like this one. --[[Special:Contributions/84.77.146.109|84.77.146.109]] 19:28, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

== Poor Construction ==

I think this article needs to be overlooked by an editor with some experience. It is not very well written in its current state. [[Special:Contributions/220.101.40.217|220.101.40.217]] ([[User talk:220.101.40.217|talk]]) 11:02, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

== First Exercise - Present verbs ==

I was thrown a bit by 4. ''&quot;Conjugate the verb 'to be' in the past and present tense in English and Latin (I am, You are, He is etc.) &quot;''. It asks for 'past and present', but only gives the present tense in the answers. --[[Special:Contributions/59.167.249.210|59.167.249.210]] ([[User talk:59.167.249.210|talk]]) 04:16, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

==Exercise Under &quot;Tense&quot;==
The book, as it currently reads, tells the reader to &quot;fill out this table of noun declensions.&quot; While I can find the singular declensions (on the introductory page #2), I cannot find the plural declensions.--[[User:Phillipps|Phillipps]] ([[User talk:Phillipps|talk]]) 04:02, 18 May 2008 (UTC)

I would also like to add that while the exercise asks for the table to be filled in, it does not give the source of the information required (It was on page 2 of the introduction).  The table that I am referring to does contain an inaccuracy; it states that the table is only for illustration, '''not to be memorized''', and does not display the plural as this would be redundant.  This is wrong, as: 1. The table is the only source of information on the declensions, 2. The exercise says that the table has to be memorized, and 3. The plural would not be redundant as it is given nowhere else and is needed to complete the exercise.  In fact, the only plurals I could find were that of puella in the nominative case (only for the first two declensions), and several others in the accusative.--[[User:Phillipps|Phillipps]] ([[User talk:Phillipps|talk]]) 04:19, 18 May 2008 (UTC)

== Shortest sentece ==

Two Romans took a bet. Who writes the shortest sentence wins. First wrote &quot;EO RUS&quot; (I'll go to the countryside), second replied &quot;I&quot; (Go!)

Relevant?

: I wonder if it should be clarified to say the shortest complete sentence that is not an imperative.
: 
: Also of note is that the article says that the shortest sentence is written as &quot;You are&quot; in English.  It comes close to implying that &quot;You are&quot; is the shortest (complete, non-imperative) English sentence possible.  The article should state more explicitly that &quot;Es&quot; is the shortest Latin sentence (with honourable mention to the above, perhaps) prior to mentioning the English translation, rather than the other way around.  The shortest non-imperative, complete English sentence is actually similar to the Latin, but uses a different conjugation: &quot;I am.&quot;  The shortest incomplete sentence is &quot;I&quot; in certain circumstances (&quot;Who ate the cookies?&quot;), but that is technically a shorthand for &quot;[It was] I&quot;, and that construction is exceedingly pedantic as it is generally preferable to answer &quot;Me&quot; even if grammatically inferior.  The shortest imperative sentence is also, remarkably, &quot;Go.&quot;
: 
: The complete coincidence of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Go&quot; is pretty fascinating, come to think of it. --[[Special:Contributions/208.181.64.45|208.181.64.45]] ([[User talk:208.181.64.45|discuss]]) 18:11, 12 February 2012 (UTC)</text>

== 1. Have the Microscopic Life honor. ==
{{ay prerequisite|Nature|Microscopic Life}}

== 2. Name two major constituents of blood.  What is the percentage of each in normal blood? ==
Human blood consists of about 45% blood cells, and 55% plasma.

== 3. Be able to draw pictures of and name the 7 types of blood cells and indicate what each type does. ==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Blood cells are treated with a staining agent before they are photographed so that identifiable features will stand out.

'''1. Red Blood Cells''' are responsible for transporting oxygen to other cells in the body, and for collecting carbon dioxide from them for disposal. Red blood cells can be identified by their donut-shape.

'''2. Platelets''' are the blood cell fragments that are involved in the cellular mechanisms that lead to the formation of blood clots.  Platelets appear in most of the photographs above  as tiny, irregular, bluish specks.

'''3. Neutrophils''', are a type of white blood cell which travel to infected tissue and surround bacteria, rendering them harmless to the body.  The picture above shows two neutrophils surrounded by multiple red blood cells.  Neutrophils have segmented nuclei and small granules that stain purple.

'''4. Eosinophils''', are a second type of white blood cells and are responsible for combating infections by parasites.  Eosinophils are filled with large granules that stain red.

'''5. Basophils''' are a third type of white blood cell which store histamine, a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated in certain ways (histamine causes some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction). Basophils tend to appear in specific kinds of inflammatory reactions, particularly those that cause allergic symptoms.  Basophils have large, dark granules in the cell that may cover the nucleus.

'''6. Lymphocytes''' are a fourth type of white blood cell involved in the human body's immune system. There are two broad categories of lymphocytes, namely T cells and B cells. T cells are especially important in cell-mediated immunity, which is the defense against tumor cells and pathogenic organisms inside body cells. They are also involved in rejection reactions.  B cells, in the presence of an antigen (a substance that stimulates an immune response), can become much more metabolically active and differentiate into plasma cells, which secrete large quantities of antibodies.  Lymphocytes have no granules, and they have very large nuclei that take up nearly all of the cell's area.  

'''7. Monocytes''', are a fifth type of white blood cell which also travel to infected tissue and turn into ''macrophages''.  As macrophages, these cells kill germs (including cancer cells) and start the production of antibodies.  Like neutrophils, monocytes have no granules, but their nuclei take up only about half the cell's area.  A monocyte's nucleus often has an indentation in it.

== 4. Observe some preserved human blood under a microscope.  Count 100 white blood cells and draw a graph showing the number of each of the five types of white blood cells you found.  Which type is most common?  Which type is least common? ==

Prepared microscope slides are offered for sale at many scholastic supply houses.  Many retailers offering such slides have an Internet presence.  Before spending money on this, check with a local high school biology teacher.  They will have microscopes and very well may have slides on hand already.

The charts below show the expected distribution of the different types of cells.  It is possible that you may not see any eosinophils or basophils in your sample since they are so rare and you're only looking at 100 white blood cells.

== 5. Do at least one of the following and report on what you observed. ==
=== Observe blood being drawn from someone's arm by a medical professional. ===
This requirement can be met by organizing a blood drive for your church.  Blood donation organizations will not accept blood from minors, but there are still ample opportunities for the Pathfinders to help in other ways.  This is an excellent way to meet the Community Service requirements for the AY curriculum.

Invite the organization to have a blood drive at your church.  Well before the date of the blood drive, have the Pathfinders advertise the event (this is a good opportunity to earn the Lettering and Poster Making honor).  Be sure to announce the blood drive in church for several weeks.  On the day of the event, the Pathfinders should help set everything up, greet people, hand out paper work to the donors, serve cookies and juice, and clean up afterwards.

=== With the help of an experienced person, observe blood flowing through some capillaries (either on video tape or in a living organism such as a hamster cheek-pouch, frog skin, or goldfish tail, using a microscope). ===
This downloadable
[http://www.klbschool.org.uk/interactive/science/heart_hlp.htm movie clip] shows blood flowing through a capillary, but it's very short.  Its shortness does make for a quick download (56Kbytes).  It is best to play the movie in &quot;loop&quot; mode.

This much longer (11 Mbytes) [http://www.apsarchive.org/renalpelvis/caliceal_dynamics_capillaries.htm movie clip] also shows blood flowing through a capillary.

=== Visit a medical lab where blood tests are performed. ===
Talk to your personal physician or a doctor in your church to find out where the local medical labs are.

=== Visit a blood bank. ===
Contact your local [[w:Red Cross|Red Cross]] to arrange a visit.  You can find your local chapter at their
[http://www.redcross.org website].

== 6. What two gases are transported by the red blood cells?  Explain why blood appears blue/green in your veins, but if you cut yourself, the blood that comes out is bright red.  Explain why a lack of iron in your diet might make you have yellowish-colored blood.==
Red blood cells transport oxygen to the rest of the body and carry the carbon dioxide away.  Blood carrying oxygen appears bright red.  When you cut yourself, your blood is exposed to oxygen in the air, and this is sufficient to cause it to turn color.  When little oxygen is present is the blood, it is still red, but it is much darker, tending more towards black.  Blood is  neither blue nor green inside your veins, but it looks this way sometimes because the veins themselves and pigment in your skin impart a bluish tint.

Blood carries oxygen by letting it bind loosely with iron.  Without sufficient iron in the blood, its oxygen carrying capacity is reduced.  Since oxygen is what makes the blood bright red, it cannot assume this color without iron.  Blood plasma is yellow, so when the red cells cannot impart their color to the blood with full power, the underlying color of the plasma has a greater influence.

== 7. Explain how blood clots when you are injured. How does typical &quot;First Aid&quot; help in the process?==
Blood clotting occurs in two stages called ''primary hemostasis'' and ''secondary hemostasis.''  Primary hemostasis begins immediately after the wall of a blood vessel is broken.  Platelets in the blood bind to a protein called collagen which is found in the vessel wall.  Normally the collagen is hidden from the platelets, but when the blood vessel is broken, it becomes exposed.  When the platelets bind with the collagen, it forms a plug which slows the flow of blood through the break in the blood vessel.

Secondary hemostasis takes place over the next couple of hours.  A protein in the blood called ''fibrinogen'' is converted to ''fibrin'' which is long and string-like.  The fibrin forms a mesh which makes the clot larger, eventually sealing the break in the blood vessel.

Typical first aid for bleeding concentrates on slowing and stopping the flow of blood from the wound.  If the blood is allowed to pool around the wound instead of flowing out of it, more platelets and fibrinogen is available on the scene and the clot can form more quickly.

== 8. What does it mean to be a blood donor?  If possible, know your blood type.  What types of blood can be donated to you?  Which blood types cannot be donated to you? Why?==

Being a blood donor means that a person allows his or her blood to be drawn so that it can be used at a later time.  Sometimes the blood is used by another person, and sometimes the blood is used by the donor herself.  Often when a person is scheduled for surgery and has plenty of advance notice, she has the opportunity to bank some of her own blood.  This is called an autologous donation.  Autologous blood donations do not need to be screened for things like AIDS or hepatitis because the person cannot contract a disease from herself.  If she has the disease, she has the disease.  If she doesn't, she won't contract it from her own blood.  However, if the blood donation is ''not'' autologous, it is carefully screened for all types of potential diseases so that the person receiving it does not contract it from the transfusion.

Before donating blood, the donor must fill out an extensive questionaire.  If the donor has traveled in certain foreign countries recently (where tropical diseases are common, for instance), or if the person is at high risk for contracting AIDS, the blood donation will not be accepted.  Blood is also not accepted from people who have ever had cancer, hepatitis, or any number of other diseases.

Once the forms have been filled out, the blood type is tested, and then the donor lies on a table.  A tube is inserted in an arm vein (this may involve a little pain, but it is brief and not severe), and the donor is then asked to squeeze a rubber ball.  The amount of time spent lying on the table depends on how quickly a pint of blood can be extracted, but it ranges between five and twenty minutes.  When a pint of blood has been extracted, the tube is removed and the donor may slowly sit up.  The wound is bandaged, and free cookies and juice are served to replenish the donor's body fluids and restore sugar.

'''Blood typing''' can be done at home or in the classroom.
[http://www.sargentwelch.com Sargent-Welch] sells blood typing kits that will test the blood type of 50 individuals for about $1.00 per person.  These kits are made for educational settings.

[http://www.healthhometest.com Health Hometest] has kits you can buy for testing a single person for about $10.00.

[http://nobelprize.org/medicine/educational/landsteiner/index.html Nobelprize.org] has an online &quot;Blood Typing Game&quot; for determining the blood type of a virtual patient.

The ABO and Rh blood typing systems categorize blood according to the way antigens and antibodies behave in a person's blood.  

'''ABO Groups:'''

* '''Blood Group A:''' Persons with type A blood have type A antigens on the surface of their red blood cells and type B antibodies in their blood plasma.
* '''Blood Group B:''' Persons with type B blood have type B antigens on the surface of their red blood cells and type A antibodies in their blood plasma.
* '''Blood Group AB:''' Persons with type AB blood have both type A and type B antigens on the surface of their red blood cells and neither type A nor type B antibodies in their blood plasma.
* '''Blood Group O:''' Persons with type O blood have neither type A nor type B antigens on the surface of their red blood cells and they have both type A and type B antibodies in their blood plasma.

'''Rh Factor:'''
* '''Rh Positive''' blood has Rh antigens on the surface of the red blood cells, and does not have Rh antibodies in the blood plasma.
* '''Rh negative''' blood does not have Rh antigens on the surface of their red blood cells.  It does not naturally have Rh antibodies in the blood plasma, but it can develop them if exposed to Rh positive antigens (if for instance, Rh+ blood is given to an Rh- patient).

The ABO group and Rh factor are combined to specify the blood type.  So a person with type AB+ (pronounced AB positive) blood has type AB blood and is Rh positive.

The blood plasma and corpuscles (red cells, white cells, and platelets) are separated in donated blood before it is transfused into a patient.  This removes most of the donor's antibodies from the blood since the antibodies are present in the plasma.  Because antibodies attack cells with a specific antigen marker, people with type A antibodies cannot receive blood that has type A antigens.  If a person with type A antibodies receives blood with type A antigens, the patient's blood will attack the donated blood causing it to clump together and eventually break down.  When the cells break down, they can release toxins that could possibly kill the patient.  The same holds for type B and type Rh antigens and antibodies.

== 9. Tell two stories in the Bible in which blood is involved.  From what you know about blood, why do you think that the Bible uses blood as a symbol of God's saving power?==

* '''Joseph's brothers''' dip his coat in blood before returning to their father.  Genesis 37:12-36.
* '''The Nile turns to blood''' during the showdown between Moses and Pharaoh. Exodus 7:14-24.
* During '''Passover''' the angel of death passes over houses marked with blood. Exodus 12:1-30.
* Blood is taken into the Most Holy Place on the '''Day of Atonement.''' Leviticus 16
* '''The priests of Baal''' cut themselves in their contest with Elijah on Mount Carmel.  1 Kings 18:16-40.
* '''King Ahab''' bleeds to death in his chariot.  1 Kings 22:29-40.
* '''The Last Supper''' is a symbol of Christ's body and blood.  Luke 22:7-32.
* '''Jesus's side is pierced''' on the cross and blood and water flows out.  John 19:28-37.
* '''The saints' robes''' washed in the blood of Jesus.  Revelation 7:15

Blood is responsible for collecting waste from all over our bodies.  In this sense, it literally washes us on the inside, just as Christ's blood washes away our sins.

== 10. List 10 specific health habits that can help your body stay healthy and fight off infection.  Find a reference from the Spirit of Prophesy that supports each one of these.  Keep a record for three weeks of how often you repeat these 10 habits.==

*'''1. Proper Diet.'''  ''&quot;When we feed on flesh, the juices of what we eat pass into the circulation. A feverish condition is created, because the animals are diseased; and by partaking of their flesh we plant the seeds of disease in our own tissue and blood.&quot;'' Healthful Living, p 212

*'''2. Fresh Air.''' ''&quot;The effects produced by living in close, ill-ventilated rooms are these: The system becomes weak and unhealthy, the circulation is depressed, the blood moves sluggishly through the system because it is not purified and ventilated by the pure, invigorating air of heaven. The mind becomes depressed and gloomy, while the whole system is enervated, and fevers and other acute diseases are liable to be generated.&quot;''-- Healthful Living, p 212.

*'''3. Get Plenty of Sleep.''' Your immune system replenishes itself while you sleep, so not getting enough sleep robs it of the time it needs to fully recharge.  The amount of sleep a person needs varies from one individual to another, but most people need eight hours per night.  If you wake up exhausted, you're not getting enough sleep.
''&quot;They may be weary, but how sweet is rest after a proper amount of labor. Sleep, nature's sweet restorer, invigorates the tired body and prepares it for the next day's duties.&quot;''--Child Guidance, pp 341,342.

*'''4. Avoid Caffeine.''' Caffeine interferes with your ability to get to sleep, so it should be avoided - especially after noon.
''&quot;The stimulating diet and drink of this day are not conducive to the best state of health. Tea, coffee, and tobacco are all stimulating, and contain poisons. They are not only unnecessary, but harmful, and should be discarded if we would add to knowledge, temperance.&quot;''--Review and Herald, Feb. 21, 1888. 

*'''5. Do Not Drink Alcohol.'''  ''&quot;Alcohol and tobacco pollute the blood of men, and thousands of lives are yearly sacrificed to these poisons.&quot;''--Health Reformer, November, 1871.

*'''6. Do Not Use Tobacco.'''  See above.

*'''7. Be Happy.'''  A cheerful heart does good, like a medicine.
''&quot;Let the sunshine of love, cheer, and happy content enter your own hearts, and let its sweet influence pervade the home. . . . The atmosphere thus created will be to the children what air and sunshine are to the vegetable world, promoting health and vigor of mind and body.&quot;''--Sons and Daughters of God, pg 168.

*'''8. Regular Exercise.'''  ''&quot;In many cases the sickness of children can be traced to errors in management. Irregularities in eating, insufficient clothing in the chilly evening, lack of vigorous exercise to keep the blood in healthy circulation, or lack of abundance of air for its purification, may be the cause of the trouble. Let the parents study to find the causes of the sickness and then remedy the wrong conditions as soon as possible.&quot;''--Adventist Home, pg 263.

*'''9. Regular Bathing.''' Taking a bath or a shower regularly washes pathogens from your skin and thus, away from your body.
''&quot;Persons in health should . . . by all means bathe as often as twice a week. Those who are not in health have impurities of the blood. . . . The skin needs to be carefully and thoroughly cleansed, that the pores may do their work in freeing the body from impurities; therefore feeble persons who are diseased surely need the advantages and blessings of bathing as often as twice a week, and frequently even more than this is positively necessary.&quot;''-- Testimonies to the Church, Volume III, p. 70.

*'''10. Wear Clean Clothing.''' Clothes that are worn day after day accumulate dirt and bacteria.  Change into clean clothing every day and keep the &quot;nasties&quot; away.
''&quot;It is important also that the clothing be kept clean. The garments worn absorb the waste matter that passes off through the pores; if they are not frequently changed and washed, the impurities will be reabsorbed.&quot;''--Child Guidance pg 109.

*'''11. Keep Your Home Clean.''' Bacteria love dirt.  Keep it out of your house.  Allow plenty of sunshine to enter your house during the day, and allow fresh air in as often as possible.  Sunshine kills many forms of bacteria, and stale air harbors it.
''&quot;I have often seen children's beds in such a condition that the foul, poisonous odor constantly rising from them was to me unendurable. Keep everything the eyes of the children rest upon and that comes in contact with the body, night or day, clean and wholesome. This will be one means of educating them to choose the cleanly and the pure. Let the sleeping room of your children be neat, however destitute it may be of expensive furniture.&quot;''--Child Guidance pg 109.

== 11. Define the following terms related to the body's defenses: ==

*'''Immunology:'''  a broad branch of biomedical science that covers the study of all aspects of the immune system in all organisms.
*'''Pathogen:''' a biological agent that causes disease or illness to its host.
*'''Inflammation:''' a pathological condition of any part of the body. It is manifested outwardly by redness and swelling, attended with heat and pain.
*'''Antibody:''' a protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. Each antibody recognizes a specific antigen unique to its target.
*'''Memory Cells:''' are a type of lymphocte (also known as memory B cells) that are formed following primary infection. When a B cell is activated by recognizing a specific antigen, it quickly reproduces to form antibody producing plasma cells and long-lived memory cells. The memory B cells are specific for the antigen that first stimulated their production.
*'''Immunity:''' a state of having sufficient biological defenses to avoid infection, disease, or other unwanted biological invasion.
*'''Vaccine:''' a medication given to stimulate the body's production of antibodies and provide immunity against a disease, prepared from the agent that causes the disease, or a synthetic substitute.
*'''Allergy:''' an immune malfunction whereby a person's body is over-sensitive to a substance that is harmless to most people, causing the immune system to attack it.
*'''Histamine:''' a chemical released by basophils and ''mast cells'' (which are very simlar to basophils) and causing an immune response.  In some cases, the response is unwarranted because the invading substance is harmless.  In this case, the response is known as an allergic reaction.  Histamines cause inflammation of the tissue, watery eyes, itching, runny nose, and sneezing.
*'''Antihistamine:''' a drug that suppresses the release of histamine.  Examples include the prescription drugs Clarinex, Allegra, and Zyrtec, and the over-the-counter drugs Claratin and Benadryl.

== 12. Poison ivy and poison oak are often encountered by active Pathfinders.  Be able to identify poison ivy and poison oak, and know how to avoid having allergic reactions to them, and explain what to do if you get an allergic reaction to either of them. ==

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Toxicodendron_radicans.jpg|Poison Ivy
Image:PoisonOak_wb_biggerLeaves.jpg|Poison Oak
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Poison ivy is shown in the picture on the left.  Poison Oak is on the right.  Learn to identify these by sight.  Poison ivy most often grows on &quot;disturbed&quot; ground, including stream banks, roadsides, and the edge of woods.  Both these plants contain an oil called urushiol which causes allergic reactions if it comes into contact with your skin.  Contact can be made directly (by touching the plant) or indirectly (by touching something that has touched the plant, such as a clothing, a friend, or a pet).  

The best way to avoid having an allergic reaction to either of these is to avoid them.  In order to avoid them, you must be able to recognize them.  If you do come into contact with either of these, wash the affected areas with hot soapy water as soon as possible.  Wash clothes in hot water too.  If your pet has contacted poison ivy or poison oak, wash him in hot soapy water to remove the oil from his fur.  The oil will not harm your pet (most animals are not allergic to urushiol), but your pet can easily transfer the oil to you.

If you still get an allergic reaction, treatment depends on the severity of the reaction.  

Seek emergency medical treatment under the following conditions:
# Swelling of the throat.
# Difficulty breathing.
# Weakness or dizziness.
# Bluish lips.
# Unconsciousness.

You should see a doctor if any of the following apply:
# A large area of the body is affected.
# Rash on the face.
# Rash around the eyes, mouth, or genitals.
# A rash with pus.

You may otherwise self-treat:
# For minor rashes, apply Calamine lotion (''not'' Caladryl), zinc oxide, or a mix of 3 teaspoons of baking soda with one teaspoon of water.  
# Take an over-the-counter antihistamine such as Benadryl.  
# Do not scratch

== 13. Make a list of as many as possible of the infectious diseases that you have had.  Which ones are you now immune to?  Explain why or why not. ==

A person acquires immunity to diseases he is exposed to either by contracting the disease or by receiving a vaccination.  Vaccinations are weakened forms of the disease-causing ''pathogen'', and they stimulate the immune system to develop a defense against that particular pathogen.

Some diseases, such as influenza, mutate frequently, and the immune system having developed a defense against one strain is not prepared for the new, mutated strain.  This is why flu shots are given annually.  The vaccine is developed to combat ''this'' years version of the flu.

Other diseases such as tetanus and diphtheria require booster shots every 10 years to maintain the body's immunity.

== 14. From your personal medical records, list all of the vaccinations that you have had and determine from your doctor when your next vaccination should be. ==
Encourage your Pathfinders to ask their parents about their immunization records.  These days pediatricians usually send immunization records home with the parents, so they should have them somewhere at home. 

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that vaccinations be given according to the schedule below.  For a more up-to-date schedule, visit the [http://www.cdc.gov CDC's website].

[[Image:CDC_immunization_schedule.png|750px|]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear all&quot;&gt;

== 15. Write or tell about one infectious disease (at least 250 words). ==
An infectious disease is any sickness caused by a biological agent (such as a virus, bacteria, or parasite) as opposed to being caused by a physical agent (such as a burn or a cut).

Here is a list of infectious diseases common today:
[[w:AIDS|AIDS]], [[w:Measles|measles]], [[w:Tuberculosis|tuberculosis]], [[w:Malaria|malaria]], [[w:Pertussis|pertussis]] (whooping cough), [[w:Tetanus|tetanus]], [[w:Meningitis|meningitis]], [[w:Chicken pox|chicken pox]], [[w:influenza|influenza]] (the flu), and [[w:Hepatitis|hepatitis]].

Other infectious diseases have been largely eliminated through the use of vaccines, including [[w:Polio|polio]], [[w:Smallpox|smallpox]], and [[w:Diphtheria|diphtheria]].

== 16. What is AIDS? How is it spread? Is there a cure?  Why is it so devastating? ==
AIDS is an acronym for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or acquired immune deficiency syndrome and is defined as a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the immune system caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, commonly called HIV.  Although treatments for both AIDS and HIV exist to slow the virus' progression in a human patient, there is no known cure.

AIDS is the most severe manifestation of infection with HIV. HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects vital components of the human immune system such as certain T cells and macrophages. It also destroys T cells. As T cells are required for the proper functioning of the immune system, when enough T cells have been destroyed by HIV, the immune system barely works, leading to AIDS.

The symptoms of AIDS are primarily the result of conditions that do not normally develop in people with healthy immune systems. Most of these conditions are infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that are normally controlled by the elements of the immune system that HIV damages.  Nearly every organ system is affected. 

Three main transmission routes of HIV have been identified:

#'''Sexual route.''' The majority of HIV infections have been, and still are, acquired through unprotected sexual relations. Sexual transmission occurs when there is contact between sexual secretions of one partner with the rectal, genital or mouth mucous membranes of another.
#'''Blood or blood product route.''' This transmission route is particularly important for intravenous drug users, hemophiliacs and recipients of blood transfusions and blood products. Health care workers (nurses, laboratory workers, doctors etc.) are also concerned, although more rarely. Also concerned by this route are people who give and receive tattoos and piercings.
#'''Mother-to-child route (vertical transmission).''' The transmission of the virus from the mother to the child can occur in utero during the last weeks of pregnancy and at childbirth. Breast feeding also presents a risk of infection for the baby. In the absence of treatment, the transmission rate between the mother and child was 20%. However, where treatment is available, combined with the availability of Cesarean section, this has been reduced to 1%.

features=eagle's head and wings, horse's body|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]}}

== Overview ==

A '''''hippogriff''''' is a creature that has the &quot;body, hind legs, and tail of a horse; but the front legs, wings, and head of what seemed to be a giant eagle, with a cruel, steel-colored beak and large, brilliant orange eyes. The talons on its front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking.&quot;

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], we are introduced to Hippogriffs by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]], then teaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]]. Like many of Hagrid's favorite creatures, Hippogriffs can be dangerous to handle.

=== &quot;Things You Gotta Know About Hippogriffs&quot; ===
(as mentioned by Rubeus Hagrid in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'')
*they're proud
*they're easily offended
*never insult one, 'cause it might be the last thing you do
*always wait for the hippogriff to make the first move
*it's polite
*try not to blink if you're facing one, hippogriff don't trust you if you blink too much
*never pull any of hippogriff's feathers, they won't like it
*to ride a hippogriff, climb up just behind the wing joint

=== Approaching A Hippogriff ===
Because they are polite there is a proper way to approach them. &quot;Walk toward him or her, and you bow, and you wait. If he or she bows back, you're allowed to touch him. If he or she doesn't bow, then get away from him or her sharpish; 'cause those talons hurts.&quot;

== Analysis ==

In an interview provided at the time of the theatrical release of the third film, the animators responsible for the sequences involving Hippogriffs mentioned that they had very little to work from. Hippogriffs are mentioned in Muggle mythology, and are described but apparently very rarely depicted. Given this, there is some question as to why Hippogriffs were selected at all. Looking at the story, though, we see that a means was needed to effect an escape for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], one that would allow him to travel out of England relatively quickly. Wit the alarm raised in the magical and Muggle worlds, about his only means of escape would be a magical flying object. Harry's broom, of course, is right out; while Sirius had bought it for Harry, it would have been far too much of a wrench, and far too hard to explain, if Harry were to give that to Sirius for him to escape on. So we must have some other means of flying Sirius away. We have not seen flying carpets, and as it turns out we will not; there is some reason for disallowing their importation, as we find out in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. Sirius has given his flying motorcycle to Hagrid, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]]'s flying car is likely no longer up to a long trip, even if it ever does forsake its home in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. So we must bring in some other means of flying; and the author, apparently, went through Muggle mythology to find a creature that could fly and was large enough, and possibly even-tempered enough, to be ridden. The characteristics of Hippogriffs, as mentioned above, are pure invention as far as we can tell, but they are very apt, as they reflect aspects of Hagrid's character that we are only now beginning to appreciate, and result in illumination also of the characters of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|his father]]. Additionally, they provide the set up for much of this story's secondary theme of the meaning and value of friendship, and allow for Buckbeak's departure without particular repercussions.

features=Causes perpetual dancing|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Tarantallegra''''' is a jinx that causes uncontrollable &quot;dancing&quot;.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Tarantallegra, the Dancing jinx, apparently causes uncontrollable jerking and twitching in the legs of the person against whom it is cast. It can apparently can be stopped by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Finite Incantatem|Finite Incantatem]] charm. We first see this spell when it is cast against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] in the Dueling Club.

It was later used in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Ministry of Magic]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]; the intent in that case was to prevent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] from escaping.

== Analysis ==

The Harry Potter story arc, consisting as it does of an epic struggle between good and evil, will have fights, larger battles, and perhaps even an all-out war. In order to prevent the series, ostensibly for children, from becoming excessively dark, there must be non-lethal weapons for the protagonists to use. To that end, the author has provided us with a number of disabling spells, ranging from the simple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|stunning]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmament]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Incarcerous|binding]] jinxes, through to those with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Rictusempra|humorous effects]], like this one. It is uncertain why there would need to be so many different ways to disable, but we can surmise that the author has at least some reason for use of each variety. The Tarantallegra jinx seems to be of limited use, as the actual effect, uncontrollable motions of the legs, would have little effect on the ability of the target to cast spells; it does, however, prevent escape of the subject, as he is unable to walk. We surmise that this jinx was included as acknowledgement of Muggle fairy tales that mention magic forcing someone to dance until they die of exhaustion.

advanced adult is subdivided to order of CPR/defibrillation is a) defib first in professional witnessed arrest, b) defibrillation technique is one shock and CPR for 2 minutes before other shocks , c) doubtful fine VF is not worth shocking delay of CPR, d) adrenaline 1mg after 2nd shock or non VF/VT / rate is 3-5 minutely,  e) vf/vt - amiodarone (load 300mg +/- 150mg, 900mg /24h) XOR lignocaine (max 3mg/kg/hr), f) PE/thrombolysis/prolonged CPR 60-90 minutes ,  g) hypothermia to 32deg for 12-24 hours definitely for out of hospital VF/VT, and maybe for all others ( in hospital all, out of hospital non VF/VT).

The principles might be: minimize circulation downtime ( a, b, c), provide drugs better or earlier (d e f),
more tenacity  in rescue ( f and g) . 


ABC - airway , breathing , compression.
This in general describes conceptual categories, but
is also the sequence of management in CPR: airways first, breathing next, compression of the heart.

The exception is when immediate defibrillation is available, AND equipment to diagnose 
ventricular tachyarrythmia or ventricular fibrillation is available. Then the sequence is : 
observed unexpected collapse + known history suggests ventricular fibrillation: e.g. was complaining of chest discomfort  -&gt;  attach equipment  -&gt; diagnose VF ( automatic or manual) -&gt; 
attach defibrillation pads -&gt; charge equipment to 200J (or wait automatic) -&gt; warn bystanders -&gt; defibrillate.
If manual, defibrillate x 3 , before resuming normal CPR sequence if still in ventricular fibrillation.

This is taken from an observed successful resuscitation of a witnessed arrest , as applied by
an experienced provincial emergency specialist nurse.  

It has some contrast to the recommended DRABCD sequence as per Guideline 7, February 2006, of the
Australian Resuscitation Council {{ref|ARC_CPR_FEB06}} , but is similar to the European Guidelines Summary
of Changes 2005 {{ref|ERC}}.

The pros and cons are : the first scenario meets the minimum time to defibrillation for successful
defibrillation criteria ; the first scenario maximizes the success rate of the cardiac arrest
resuscitation, as VF/VT arrest has a higher rate of successful treatment that asystolic and electromechanical dissociation arrest ; the second scenario is much easier to remember as mnemonic, and is a more
general framework for resuscitation from all causes , including primary airway obstruction causes, 
and hypoventilation/hypoxemia as a cause of unconsciousness.

DRABC is Danger Response, Airways, Breathing , Compression {{ref|ARC_CPR_FEB06}}.

== Danger == 
- remove from danger. Ensure your own safety - e.g. do not commence resuscitation in the
middle of a undiverted road.  

  D could also be DELEGATE - initiate a PHONE call for help (in Australia, dial 000 for emergency ambulance)
or request another to get help.
The RATIONALE for DELEGATE, is that in cardiac arrest where it is ventricular fibrillation,
the most effective management is electrical defibrillation, available when the ambulance arrives.

== Response ==
  check for consciousness - ask the patient to OPEN EYES and SQUEEZE MY HAND  , 
and also SHAKE THE SHOULDERS if an uninjured adult, or if a child, or adult suspected of spinal injury,
 apply PRESSURE STIMULUS ; anything less than or equal to a GROAN , is regarded as UNCONSCIOUSNESS.  {{ref|ARC_UNCONSCIOUS}}

== Airway == 
the aim is to open an obstructed , naturally positioned airway.
In an uninjured adult, CHIN LIFT and HEAD TILT ; in injured adult or small child, CHIN LIFT only.
an uninjured child may be SLIGHTLY TILTED, but AVOID PUSHING ON THE SOFT TISSUE OF THE NECK, and causing another source of obstruction.

CHIN LIFT can be achieved with - PINCER GRIP, PISTOL GRIP, or ANGLE OF JAW THRUST VERTICAL UPWARDS when the patient is lying horizontally face upwards (supine)
(ANGLE OF JAW is where the angle of the L shape of the side profile of the jaw is)

The rationale behind CHIN LIFT, is that by lifting the jaw forwards, this pulls up the tongue away from
the opening of the larynx, and opens up the collapsed larynx.  

In practice, a successful airway management is when spontaneous breathing is heard with the
ear placed over the mouth, or when artificial respiration results in the patient being heard to breath out again , and the chest move up and down.

==== CONSCIOUS SEVERE OBSTRUCTED AIRWAY (CHOKING WITH INEFFECTIVE COUGH) ====
INEFFECTIVE COUGH is where the patient appears not to be getting enough air between coughs, or is not
coughing and not breathing and unable to speak.

This is managed by ALTERNATING 5 BACK BLOWS between the shoulder blades with the palm, with 5 STERNAL THRUSTS with the palm {{ref|ARC_AIRWAY}};  this is different from the Heimlich maneuver, which was thrusting the diaphragm upwards with a fist in palm hands , whilst holding the patient from behind and under the armpits ;
this maneuver could cause internal organ injury, such as rupturing the spleen or liver .
If the patient is UNCONSCIOUS and was CHOKING, commence CPR as Airways , Breathing , Circulation described
here. {{ref|ARC_AIRWAY}}

== BREATHING ==
The new recommendation is to give 2 rescue breaths ; if the rescuer is unwilling
to give rescue breaths , mouth to mouth, with or without a separation device
e.g. a pocket resuscitation mask, a piece of glad wrap with a central hole over the mouth opening,
a piece of paper with a central hole over the mouth opening,
  then it is still important to provide circulation as below, with or without attempted expired air resuscitation.
  ANY ATTEMPT AT RESUSCITATION IS BETTER THAN NONE; BUT CALL FOR HELP (DIAL 000) , SO THAT
DEFINITIVE THERAPY CAN BE GIVEN. ANY ATTEMPT IS BUYING MORE TIME FOR DEFINITE HELP TO ARRIVE.

It is this author's experience, that mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, whilst lifting the patient's
chin, is MUCH EASIER than trying to ventilate the patient with a device such as a BAG AND MASK. The
only thing easier to ventilate, is a CORRECTLY SITED TRACHEAL INTUBATED patient ( getting to that
status though, is not easy).
 
The provision of artificial ventilation is probably the primary therapy for OPIATE OVERDOSE, other
than administering an opiate antagonist, such as NALOXONE;

there are anecdotes of drug affected patients being kept alive till the drug overdose wears
off , by other drug affected people with brains enough to provide expired air resuscitation
, but still not responsible enough to seek hospital or ambulance help. 
It is probably on par with being responsible human beings as drug buddies that dump the ODed user at the front door of the casualty department or the GP clinic , after attracting the attention of the triage nurse/receptionist.  Druggies can be heroes too ( like extreme sportsmen helping an injured fellow ?)
   Like the above statement about resuscitation, ANY ATTEMPT TO REMOVE FROM DANGER IS BETTER THAN NONE.

== COMPRESSION ==

Updated first aid guidelines for laypersons now downplay the significance of checking for a pulse, thus circulation.
Laypersons are advised to commence CPR immediately should the victim not be breathing.

external cardiac compression is achieved by placing 2 hands palm downwards over the MIDDLE OF LOWER HALF OF THE STERNUM , and leaning one's whole upper body onto STRAIGHT ARMS HELD VERTICAL OVER THE PATIENT, and pushing
down in a piston action, to a DEPTH of about 5 cm for adults, or
 ONE-THIRD THE DEPTH OF THE CHEST.

  In an INFANT, 2 FINGERS SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD. 

  THE RATE OF COMPRESSION IS 100 COMPRESSIONS PER MINUTE, for ALL AGE GROUPS.

SINCE THE RATIO OF COMPRESSION TO BREATHS GIVEN IS NOW 30 to 2 , THIS AMOUNTS TO ABOUT 
  3 CYCLES OF CPR PER MINUTE. 
The old rate was 2:15 , but the time to change from giving ventilation to cardiac compression
was a factor in decreasing the amount of compressions given in one minute; at 30:2 ,
there are half as many changeovers . {{ref|ERC}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__
==Changing the Color Palette==
The first problem in creating beautiful charts is the choice of colors. Excel only offers 64 colors, and most of them are hideous.

Fortunately, you can change them, and any changes you make travel with the workbook. This means that when your client opens it up, it's going to have your changed colors in it. It also doesn't affect any other workbooks - their colors will be unchanged.

Here is the standard Excel color palette, with very few light colors, which are important for attractive graphics. Alongside is shown an alternative, with many more light colors, arranged in sequence instead of all jumbled up.

[[Image:StdPalette.jpg]]   [[Image:NewPalette.0.jpg ]]

So how do you change them? Click on Tools, Options, then the Color tab. You should see the color palette below.

[[Image:PaletteDialog.jpg]]

Click a color you want to change, and then the button labeled Modify on the right hand side.

Either of the two dialogs below will then come up. You'll see you can flick between them by choosing the Standard or Custom tabs.

[[Image:DualPaletteDialog.jpg]]

The Standard colors let you choose from a much larger number of colors by simply clicking on them. This is all you need, most of the time.

Suppose, however, that you like a color but it is little too dark. Select it, then click the Custom tab. You can then use the slider bar at the right of the rainbow in the middle, to make it lighter.

If you are feeling creative, you can play with the numbers at the bottom to create the perfect color.

If you've gone to the trouble of changing colors and you want to copy them into another workbook, or if you want to use the palette I've created for you in this workbook, it's quite easy.

# Open both workbooks (the one you want to copy from, and the one you want to copy to)
# Activate the one you want to copy into.
# Select Tools, Options, and then the Color tab. You'll see a dropdown labeled &quot;Copy colors from&quot;. Click this and pick the workbook you want to copy from.
# All done. Save.

[[Image:CopyPalette.jpg]]

==Applying Formatting==
Standard Excel charts use strong colors and strong lines. This is probably so they show up clearly in all sorts of situations. 

[[Image:Stdcht.GIF]]

While this approach is understandable, the problem is that it results in charts lacking visual appeal. The best way to correct this is to see the effect of making some changes. Please note that there are many ways to do this, and these changes are not necessarily the best.

[[Image:Cht2.GIF]]

The chart should now look like this.  Let's change those awful colors next...

[[Image:Cht3.GIF]]

The chart should now look something like this…those colors are probably too light, but there's a nice trick we can use to give them some body.

[[Image:Cht4.JPG]]

[[Image:Cht5.JPG]]
Let's keep it fairly simple, so we'll click the One color button alongside

[[Image:Cht6.JPG]]

The chart should now look something like this…the colors have more body
[[Image:Cht7.JPG]]

Note: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. You may prefer to use different colors to start with and not go to all this trouble with special effects. 

There is no suggestion that you do all this for every chart. But the more you know, the more choices you will have when you build your next chart.

Now, perhaps, some subtleties
[[Image:Cht8.JPG]]

[[Image:Cht9.JPG]]

==Examples==
Here is a line chart. 
* the lines have been made thicker, with no markers (which is OK as long as it will be printed in color - if it is printed)
* the colors are a little softer
* the legend has been removed &amp; each line has been directly labeled, which makes it easier to read. (You can do this by selecting the last point of each series and showing the series name as the label - when you've selected the point, select Format Data Point, then Data Labels tab, Series Name checkbox). 
* a vertical grid has been added on the X axis, for every second point.

[[Image:Cht14.JPG]]

Here is a single series bar chart. Note how on the left, the gaps between bars are wider than the bars, which distracts your eye. If you narrow the gap, as on the right, it improves the look of the chart. (Do this by selecting the series, click Options tab, and reduce the gap width). If the bars get too fat when you reduce the gap, you can make the chart narrower until the bars look right.

I feel お早よう, 宜しく, and 有難う are to be written in hiragana, if there's no special reason, because we rarely write them with kanjis at least these days. お早う might be a little help for a lerner since the kanji imply that it's the word used early (早) in the morning, but for the others... - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 12:14, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

:I agree with you; here's the problem we ran into. I originally wanted to set the table up with English, Japanese, and Romaji columns. The Japanese would contain the phrase in hiragana or kanji with furigana. Unfortunately, furigana in tables crashes some versions of Internet Explorer, so I had to take it out. When I substituted a four column table with English, Kanji, Hiragana, Romaji, a reader took it upon him/herself to fill in the Kanji for 宜しく and 有難う, which makes sense because it completes the table.
:I don't want to imply that there are no kanji for these phrases, because there are. But I don't want students thinking that's the normal way to write it, either. So what I'll do is put an asterisk next to the offending kanji and footnote that these forms are rarely used. I hope that works. --[[User:Aaronsama|Aaronsama]] 14:45, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

== when to speak formally or informally ==

The comment that one should always speak informally to social inferiors is not correct. For example, teachers do not necessarily speak informally to students, nor does a boss necessarily speak informally to subordinates. -[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 03:52, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

:Corrected to &quot;general rule of thumb&quot;

==about the conversation==

I don't suppose 全然 means &quot;Don't mention it.&quot;.

(We probably hedge instead of answer to ありがとう when we talk informally.)

- Sorry,I'm poor speaker of English.

:'''''AMENDMENT XVI.''' The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.''

This book covers federal '''income tax''' in the United States. It approaches the tax system from a legal perspective, not an accounting perspective. Rather than show how to calculate tax liability, it shows which factors lead to tax liability, and how different types of transactions are treated by the Internal Revenue Code.

The Internal Revenue Code requires three income calculations when determining income tax liability:

#'''Gross income''', the actual income the taxpayer receives.
#'''Adjusted gross income (AGI)''', gross income reduced by &quot;'''above the line'''&quot; deductions such as trade and business expenses.
#'''Taxable income''', AGI reduced by &quot;'''below the line'''&quot; deductions such as personal and profit-seeking expenses.

While taxable income is the only amount that matters when calculating final tax liability, the other two values have great significance in the process as well.

==The definition of income==

Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-I-61.html] puts it broadly: &quot;Gross income means '''all income from whatever source derived'''.&quot; The Code supplies many examples, but provides that the list is not exhaustive. Among its enumerated types of gross income are compensation for services (i.e. wages and salaries), business income, income from dealings in property, interest, rent, royalties, dividends, alimony, annuities, life insurance income, pensions, and a number of other examples.

The simple definition of gross income has led to some questioning of what the word &quot;income&quot; actually means within the text of the statute. The authoritative opinion on this issue is the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[w:Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.|Commr. v. Glenshaw Glass Co.]]'', 348 U.S. 426 (1955), perhaps the most important case in American tax law. ''Glenshaw Glass'' established that income is:

* any undeniable accession to wealth,
* which is clearly realized by the taxpayer,
* over which the taxpayer has complete dominion.

===Accession===

An accession to wealth need not be in the form of money. For instance, if a farmer trades a bushel of tomatoes for an accountant's tax help, the tomatoes are an accession to wealth for the accountant. Such accessions are called '''receipts in kind'''&amp;mdash;goods or services received in exchange for services. Contrary to popular belief, receipts in kind are considered income, and their value for tax purposes is the fair market value of the goods or services at the time of transfer.

An accession need not be in consideration for anything. &quot;Windfalls,&quot; such as prizes and free samples, are accessions to wealth. Even an unanticipated windfall is considered income. For instance, if a taxpayer finds money hidden inside a piano, that money becomes income to them: see ''Cesarini v. U.S.'', 428 F.2d 812 (6th Cir. 1970).

Wealth is affected by assets and liabilities. '''Loans''' are usually not considered to be income because they are not true accessions to wealth: while they provide a tangible asset to the recipient, they offset this asset with an equivalent liability. But a &quot;loan&quot; that is ''not'' offset by an obligation to repay ''is'' income to the recipient. Moreover, if a third party pays off a taxpayer's debt, the taxpayer receives income to the extent their debt was reduced. See ''Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commr.'', 279 U.S. 716 (1929) (employer paying taxes on employee's behalf).

===Realization===

Realization can be thought of as an administrative rule: it serves to clarify ''when'' the taxpayer receives income. The simplest way to conceptualize realization is as the point in time when the taxpayer's property or interests are actually increased.

The Supreme Court used the theory of realization to ban income taxation of stock dividends (splits) in ''Eisner v. Macomber'', 252 U.S. 189 (1920). Because share-for-share stock dividends do not materially affect the assets of the corporation or its shareholders, the Court reasoned that there would be no income to the shareholders in such transactions.

===Dominion===

If a taxpayer sees a $20 bill, but does not pick it up, they have not yet realized any income, because the money is not yet theirs. Once they pick the money up and assert possession of it, the $20 is income to them: they have realized it and assumed dominion and control over it.

Consider a more complicated example: a person signs a long-term lease on a piece of property, then constructs a building on it. They fall behind on their rent and the landlord evicts them. According to ''Helvering v. Bruun'', 309 U.S. 461 (1940), the landlord realizes income amounting to the value of the building in the year of the repossession.

Dominion over wealth is based on practical considerations rather than the considerations of property law. When an accession is legally disputed (or disputable), the '''claim of right doctrine''' comes into play. If a taxpayer receives an amount, claims it as theirs, and has no restriction on their disposition of it, that amount is considered income in the year in which they receive it. For instance, if a taxpayer receives a piece of land and someone else disputes its title, the taxpayer will have income so long as they claim that land as their own. Any income gained from illegal activities is also considered to be income whether the taxpayer's title to it is valid or not.

However, the &quot;completeness&quot; of dominion is compromised if the taxpayer recognizes a legal obligation to return the wealth to its previous owner. Security deposits are one example: because they must usually be paid back, they are not considered income until the recipient is legally entitled to keep them. Advance deposits, on the other hand, are income upon receipt, because they are not accompanied by an obligation to repay.

==Exceptions to income==

===Employment benefits===

Some apparent accessions to wealth are not income because the '''primary purpose''' of the accession is to benefit the taxpayer's employer. A classic example is ''U.S. v. Gotcher'', 401 F.2d 118 (5th Cir. 1968), in which the taxpayer went on a business trip to Germany, all expenses paid by Volkswagen and the taxpayer's employer (an auto retailer). Examining the facts of the case, the court concluded that the trip primarily benefited Volkswagen, not the taxpayer, and was therefore not income to the taxpayer. But the taxpayer's wife also had her expenses paid to come on the trip, and the court ruled that her half ''was'' income, because the benefit of her share of the trip was hers alone and not Volkswagen's.

Besides this primary purpose test, more specific rules covering many types of employment benefits appear in the Internal Revenue Code.

*'''No additional cost services''' provided by employers are not income to employees. Standby tickets for airline employees are one example. Allowing employees to fly in otherwise empty seats does not cost an airline any appreciable amount. On the other hand, providing regular &quot;positive space&quot; tickets to airline employees ''would'' constitute income to the employees, because the service costs the airline money if it has to deny seats to paying passengers.
*'''Qualified employee discounts''', discounts on goods and services that are offered by the employer to its customers, are not income to employees. The Code imposes a maximum discount of the profit on goods and 20% on services: any greater employee discounts are considered income.
*'''Working condition fringes''', services or property that would be deductible by the employee as a business expense if purchased by the employee, are not income to the employee. Examples include on-the-job training expenses, safety equipment, and travel for purely business purposes.
*'''De minimis fringes''', benefits that are too low in value to be reasonably worth accounting for, are not income to employees. Coffee and donuts in an office are a classic example.
*'''Meals and lodging''' provided by employers follow special rules. To be excluded from income, they must be provided on business premises for a &quot;substantial noncompensatory business reason&quot; such as keeping the employee &quot;on call.&quot; Note that in the case of lodging, &quot;business premises&quot; does not refer to location: it means that some sort of business activity must be performed at the place of lodging.

===Gratuitous transfers===

Gratuitous transfers, such as '''gifts''' and '''inheritances''', are excluded from income by the Code. The standard for determining such a transfer is whether it was made &quot;from a detached and disinterested generosity, out of affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses.&quot; If a so-called &quot;gift&quot; is made in consideration or anticipation of a benefit, it loses its gratuitous status and can be considered income. See ''Commr. v. Duberstein'', 363 U.S. 278 (1960) (Cadillac given to contact who provided business leads in the past was includible in income despite being declared as a gift).

Transfers of property incidental to divorce are also treated as gifts under Section 1041 of the Code. To qualify, such transfers must either be within one year after the date of the cessation of marriage, or be &quot;related&quot; to the cessation if made beyond the one-year window.

Severance payments, bonuses, honorariums and other &quot;gifts&quot; from employers to employees are almost always considered to be income, although they may be excluded as fringe benefits as described above. Death benefits to survivors of employees have been a more difficult issue and have split the courts as to whether they should be considered as income.

===Life insurance===

Section 101 of the Code excludes life insurance payments from income, including accelerated death benefits for the terminally ill. There are several exceptions to this rule, mainly to cover obvious loopholes. Among them:

*One cannot exclude payment on a life insurance policy that was coupled with an annuity of equal value, because such an arrangement does not shift or distribute any risk.
*Creditors cannot exclude payment on life insurance policies they take out on debtors to secure repayment of their loans.

===Scholarships===

Scholarships are not income in some situations. To be exempt, they must be paid to degree candidates at an educational institution, and they are only exempt to the extent that they compensate for the cost of tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment. Payments for teaching, research and other services are ''always'' considered income even if they are only paid by reducing the student's tuition.

Loan forgiveness programs receive special treatment under Section 108(f). The discharge of the student's loan debt can be excluded from income, as long as the loan came from the government or an educational institution, contained a provision for forgiveness, and the forgiveness is in exchange for working in &quot;certain professions&quot; or for &quot;any broad class of employers.&quot;

===Social welfare===

Sections 85 and 86 of the Code exclude social welfare payments from income. The exclusion applies to TANF, Medicare, disaster relief, replacement housing payments, and assistance to victims of crimes, among many other types of payments. But unemployment compensation is considered to be income.

An exception to the exclusion is Social Security, which follows its own complicated rules because of its dual nature as a welfare program and investment scheme.

==Special rules==

===Damage awards===

The taxation of damages awarded in lawsuits poses complicated policy issues, but the general rules are:

*'''Punitive damages''' are always income.
*'''Compensatory damages''' may or may not be taxable depending on their nature.
**Damages that compensate for lost income, such as lost profits and back pay, are treated as income.
**Damages that compensate for lost capital, such as property, are not treated as income.
**Damages that arise due to physical injuries are not treated as income unless they are punitive. (This includes compensation to third parties, e.g. for loss of consortium.)
**Damages that compensate for emotional distress are treated as income unless they arise due to a physical injury.

===Conduit situations===

Some taxpayers receive income with the condition that they must pay it to somebody else or for something else. Examples include waitresses who share tips with busboys, political candidates who receive campaign contributions, and funds paying collective expenses for multiple businesses. In most '''conduit''' situations such as these, the money &quot;passing through&quot; the taxpayer is not considered income to the taxpayer, but the taxpayer must be able to prove that the income was received with the condition that it be paid to someone else or for something else.

Note that many corporations are taxed on their profits even if those profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends. This is described in further detail in the Tax Liability chapter.

The previous chapter in this text discussed the broad concept of [[US Income Tax: Income|income]]. Income often arises in the trading of property, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible. The income to a taxpayer from disposition of property is called '''gain''' or '''loss'''. Whether it is gain or loss depends on the '''adjusted basis''' of the property and the '''amount realized''' by the taxpayer in its disposition.

Gains are income to the taxpayer. Losses may be deductible from income, but not always. If losses are incurred by a corporation, or in an individual's trade or business, they reduce adjusted gross income. Nonbusiness profit-seeking losses, as well as some &quot;casualty losses,&quot; are treated as itemized personal deductions.

==Determining gain and loss==

'''Basis''' refers to a taxpayer's expenditure in acquiring property. Over time, the basis is &quot;adjusted&quot; to account for improvements, [[US Income Tax: Business Deductions#Cost recovery|cost recovery]], and other factors. When the property is sold, or when another &quot;taxable event&quot; takes place, its '''adjusted basis''' is subtracted from the '''amount realized''' by the taxpayer. If positive (amount realized exceeds adjusted basis), the amount is a gain. If negative (adjusted basis exceeds amount realized), it is a loss.

For example, a taxpayer might buy a piece of land for $10,000. Its basis thus becomes $10,000. The taxpayer puts a house on the land, at a cost of $40,000. Now, the property's adjusted basis is $50,000: the cost of the land plus the cost of the improvement. If the taxpayer sells the property for $90,000, they realize a gain of $40,000. Conceptually, the other $50,000 does not represent an accession to wealth, because it is wealth the taxpayer already had: they simply shifted its form from cash to property, and did not gain any wealth until they sold the property for more than they paid.

==Determining basis==

When the taxpayer purchases property for cash, basis is easy to determine. Other scenarios pose different problems.

===Financing===

Most real estate transactions, and many purchases of personal property, involve debt financing. When a taxpayer takes out a loan to purchase property, the loan is included in the basis of the property. When the property is transferred, the loan is included in the amount realized ''if'' the recipient takes the loan with the property.

In the first example above, the taxpayer could purchase the land with a $10,000 loan. The basis becomes $10,000 after purchase, and adjusts to $50,000 after the house is built. When the taxpayer sells the property for $90,000, their amount realized is $90,000 if the property is sold subject to the loan, but is only $80,000 if the taxpayer remains subject to the loan. The taxpayer therefore recognizes $10,000 in additional gain if the property is sold subject to the loan. In a sense, the taxpayer receives more income if the buyer takes on the liability for the loan, just as they would receive income if the buyer paid off their loan for them.

===Property as income===

In the first example above, the taxpayer might have received their land in exchange for supplying a service to its previous owner. In that case, the basis in the property would become its fair market value&amp;mdash;the same amount claimed by the taxpayer as income. Assuming $10,000 was the fair market value, this achieves the same result as if the taxpayer had received a $10,000 payment from the owner and then bought the land for that amount.

===Property as an inheritance===

If our example taxpayer received their land as an inheritance upon the previous owner's death, they would not have to declare it as income, and its basis would be reset to its fair market value as of the date of death of the decedent; i.e, the inheritor receives a '''stepped-up basis''' in the assets. There is an alternate valuation date, subject to the rules of IRC §2032, which may be used to value assets.  The alternate date is six (6) months to the day following the date of death of the decedent. The generally cited reason for this rule is that death is not an appropriate time to tax a person's heirs for the gains of the deceased, especially considering that they may be liable for a separate estate tax. (The rules concerning inheritances will temporarily change in 2010 to coincide with the temporary repeal of the estate tax.)

Note that while inherited property is essentially &quot;free&quot; for income tax purposes, '''income in respect of a decedent''' is not. For instance, if a person contracts to sell some property and then dies, the proceeds from the sale will be paid to that person's heirs and will be fully taxable as income to the heirs.

===Property as a gift===

Gifts by a living person follow a different rule from inheritances. Generally defined as a gratutitous transfer of property, the rule regarding gifts is that the basis in the hands of the donor becomes the basis in the hands of the donee. Effectively, the taxpayer is recognizing the previous owner's gain as well as his own. The reason for this rule is to prevent  people from giving property to each other for the sole purpose of resetting its basis and mitigating their gains.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I object to calling a civilization Celts and *Druids*. Druids were members of the priestly class of Celtic society. Also, the Celts covered a large area of Europe, including modern-day France, Spain, Northern Italy and Central Europe.

Also, this is meant to be a book. Don't you think that the answers to each of the subtopics/questions should be in a paragraph format? The answers are IMHO really too brief to make a book.

== Adoption ==

I'm going to adopt this book, and improve it where I can. It seems that no one else is working on it at all. [[User:Canaen|Canaen]] 20:34, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

:You are welcome to do so.  I have been monitoring it against vandalism, but it is something that does needs a subject matter expert, or at least somebody willing to pour some passion into it.  Please keep in mind this is something oriented toward children between the ages of 8 and 12, so try to keep the level of content and vocabulary to something these kids would understand.  Just do the best you can do, and don't sweat it.  Good Luck!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:47, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

::Thank you. [[User:Canaen|Canaen]] 23:19, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

== How far? ==

How far into modern times should we take sections of these articles? I know that this series is on '''ancient civilizations''', but many groups of Celts are alive and thriving today. I've already included bits towards the 17th century or so, but only when it expanded on a point made about ancient Celts. Thoughts? [[User:Canaen|Canaen]] 01:39, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== Incorrect details ==

The article describes the ancient celts as wearing clothing with tartan patterns woven into them. This is incorrect, tartans were introduced by modern celts. The article also describes celts in the Middle ages carrying rifles and pistols, which is nonsense.
: Agreed.  I will remove those sections. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:10, 6 November 2012 (UTC)</text>

Your work on the US legal pages looks great. I would love to spotlight this kind of polished work, as it would draw positive attention to the site. Nijongo wa shimas ka? That was something like the Japanese that I studied back in college .... Maybe you can give us unofficial legal advice later on on issues like certain ramifications of copyright law. I have one question right now: Is it legal for us to write study guides on this site that reveal the inner structure of the copyright books that they are a guide to? For example, a Seven Habits guide that reveals the chapter order.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Template:US Income Tax}}
Business pay income taxes on their '''profit''', whether the business is a major corporation or a self-employed individual. This is achieved by deducting trade and business expenses from gross income (which is '''revenue''' from a business's perpective) to find adjusted gross income.

==Trade and business defined==

Trade and business deductions are provided by [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VI-162.html Section 162] of the Internal Revenue Code, but that section does not define the terms &quot;trade&quot; and &quot;business.&quot; The current definition is provided by the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Commr. v. Groetzinger'', 480 U.S. 23 (1987):

:To be engaged in a trade or business, the taxpayer must be involved in the activity with continuity and regularity. The taxpayer's primary purpose for engaging in the activity must be for income or profit.

The &quot;continuity and regularity&quot; requirement distinguishes trade and business deductions from '''profit-seeking deductions''', which are provided under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VII-212.html Section 212]. Profit-seeking deductions can be claimed for any activity engaged in for income or profit, whether the taxpayer is actively involved or not. The key difference between the two classes is that profit-seeking deductions are '''below the line''', meaning they are applied against AGI, while trade and business deductions are '''above the line''', meaning they are applied against gross income. Profit-seeking expenses must also be '''itemized''', which is described in more detail later in this text, but practically means that they may not always benefit the taxpayer. Trade and business deductions, on the other hand, always apply against the taxpayer's income, assuming the taxpayer has income to deduct against.

==&quot;Ordinary and necessary&quot; defined==

To be deductible, Section 162(a) requires that trade and business expenses be &quot;'''ordinary and necessary'''.&quot; Like &quot;trade or business,&quot; the phrase &quot;ordinary and necessary&quot; is not defined by the statute. The Supreme Court has also failed to provide a definition for the term.

It is clear that ordinary and necessary business expenses exclude '''personal expenses''' and '''capital expenditures'''. Some courts have gone further to indicate that strange or arbitrary expenses are also not deductible.

==Business assets==

===Capitalization===

Many expenses in consideration of assets are classified as capital expenditures, and are not deductible as business expenses. Instead, capital expenditures give a basis to the assets purchased, and that basis reduces the amount of income realized when the asset is sold.

Generally, any expenditure that ''creates'' or ''adds value to'' an asset that will be held for over a year is a capital expenditure. This is not a strict rule: minor assets incidental to a business, such as supplies, materials, furniture and books, may simply be deducted when they are purchased. But all significant assets to be held in the long term must be treated as capital expenditures.

Capital expenditures may also be required for expenses incidental to the acquisition of assets. This was established by the Supreme Court's opinion in ''INDOPCO v. Commr.'', 503 U.S. 79 (1992), which held that the legal and consulting fees for a corporate acquisition are considered capital expenditures. The IRS later established so-called &quot;INDOPCO Regulations,&quot; which require capitalization of expenditures to acquire, create or enhance an intangible asset, as well as all expenditures incidental to such activity.

Improvements to a property are capital expenditures and affect basis. Repairs to property are normal business expenses which do not affect basis.

Because capitalization affects the basis of the asset in question, classifying an expense as a capital expenditure does not remove all of the tax benefit for that expense: capitalization &quot;shifts&quot; the tax benefit forward in time, so that it will be recognized as part of the gain or loss upon sale of the asset.

===Cost recovery===

Some assets have a limited lifespan: they are known as '''wasting assets''' because they lose value over time. Machinery and buildings are examples of wasting assets. Artwork and land, on the other hand, are not wasting assets because their value generally stays constant or goes up over time. Capital expenditures on wasting assets give rise to a type of deduction called '''cost recovery'''.

====Depreciation====

Depreciation is the typical form of cost recovery for wasting assets. It provides a system for gradually deducting the cost of the asset over a fixed period. In addition to being a business deduction, depreciation also deducts from the basis of the asset. This means that a fully-depreciated asset has a basis of zero.

Since 1981, the main method of depreciation has been '''accelerated cost recovery'''. Property placed into service after 1986 is depreciated by the '''Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System''' (MACRS), while property placed into service between 1981 and 1986 is depreciated by MACRS' predecessor, the '''Accelerated Cost Recovery System''' (ACRS).

Under MACRS, each asset is given a '''recovery period''' based on its &quot;midpoint life&quot; as determined by the IRS. The recovery periods are 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years for various forms of personal property, 27.5 years for residential buildings, and 39 years for nonresidential buildings.

Depreciation always starts and stops at the midpoint of each year. A 10-year asset, for instance, receives half a year's worth of depreciation in the year it is purchased, then depreciates normally until year 11, when it receives another half a year's worth of depreciation (which should equal its remaining basis). This '''half-year rule''' is intended to keep taxpayers from benefiting disproportionately if they purchase assets late in the year.

There are two methods for calculating the actual depreciation. The '''straight line''' method is mandatory for real property, but can be voluntarily applied to any depreciable asset. Under the straight line method, the same percentage of the asset's basis is deductible each year. So a 10-year asset with a basis of $100,000 would be deductible by $5,000 in the first year, $10,000 each year from year 2 to year 10, and $5,000 in year 11.

Other assets use the '''declining balance''' method, which provides higher depreciation in initial years but lower depreciation in later years. 15 and 20-year assets use 150-percent declining balance, while other assets use 200-percent (double) declining balance.

====Expensing====

Section 179 allows a limited amount of machinery and equipment to be &quot;expensed,&quot; or deducted immediately. Expensing can be performed in lieu of depreciation, or it can be applied against the basis of an asset and the remainder can then be depreciated normally.

====Amortization====

Section 179 makes a separate cost recovery provision for many intangible assets, including covenants not to compete, franchises, goodwill, government licenses, and trademarks. Such assets are amortizable over 15 years. Other intangibles can be amortized if the taxpayer can prove that they have a limited useful life.

====Depletion====

Depletion is essentially depreciation for natural resources. It applies to mining and lumber operations which are likely to reduce the value of land over time.

====Leveraged tax shelters====

From the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, many investors took advantage of cost recovery to create '''leveraged tax shelters''', investments that provided a high rate of return by generating high cost recovery deductions that were passed on to investors. The classic tax shelter was a piece of real estate financed through &quot;nonrecourse debt&quot;&amp;mdash;a loan secured against the property, such as a mortgage. The investor would put up a tiny portion of the purchase price, and then take cost recovery deductions every year until the property was fully depreciated. Often, they would recover their investment in the form of lower taxes within a few years.

Congress eventually created two rules to block leveraged tax shelters. The '''at-risk limitation''', passed in the Tax Reform Act of 1976, established that the deductible loss of a taxpayer cannot exceed the amount with respect to which the taxpayer is actually &quot;at risk.&quot; The limitation applies to all business and investment activities ''except'' real estate. 

Congress added the '''passive activity loss limitation''' in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Codified at [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-E-II-C-469.html Section 469], the rule states that deductions from passive business activities cannot be used to offset income from other sources. The rule essentially forces taxpayers to separate their &quot;passive&quot; business activities from their personal and &quot;active&quot; business activities, and only apply passive business losses against passive business income.

==Excluded business expenses==

Section 162 renders several types of business expenses non-deductible for &quot;public policy&quot; reasons.

===Penalties===

Fines and penalties for illegal conduct are not deductible under Section 162(f). This rule includes civil and criminal penalties of all kinds, as well as similar private payments such as settlements and restitution.

===Influence===

Lobbying expenses are not deductible under Section 162(e), which bars deductions of expenses to influence legislation, political campaigns, referenda and executive decisions.

Bribery is also not deductible as a business expense. Section 162(c) specifically prohibits businesses from deducting illegal bribes to government officials, although bribes to foreign officials are deductible if they are permitted under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

===Golden parachutes===

Section 280G prohibits deduction of &quot;excess parachute payments,&quot; defined as payments to an executive contingent upon a change in ownership or control of a corporation, when such payments exceed three times the executive's average annual compensation over the past five years.

===Drug trafficking===

Section 280E prohibits deduction of business expenses incurred in illegal drug trafficking.

==Business vs. personal==

Some types of business expenses can be construed as having both business and personal purposes. In such cases, their deductibility is often limited.

===Home offices===

[http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-IX-280A.html Section 280A] generally disallows business deductions for home offices, with a number of exceptions. A home office is deductible if it is exclusively used on a regular basis as the taxpayer's principal place of business, or by the taxpayer's clients for meeting or dealing with the taxpayer.

If a home office meets one of these exceptions, its proportion of the total expenses of the home can be deducted as business expenses. For instance, if the office constitutes twenty percent of the house's floor area, then twenty percent of the utility bills and insurance premiums would be deductible.

===Travel, meals and entertainment===

Business travel, including lodging, transportation and meals, is deductible under Section 162(a)(2) when the taxpayer is &quot;away from home.&quot; &quot;Home&quot; is considered to mean the taxpayer's principal place of business, so this rule disallows deductions for '''commuting''' expenses. If the taxpayer has no such place of business, their &quot;home&quot; is their residence.

Transport, lodging and meals are deductible whenever the taxpayer is spending the night away from home. For trips that do not involve an overnight stay, transportation expenses are deductible so long as they are not commuting expenses between the taxpayer's residence and principal place of business. A doctor, for instance, can deduct the cost of traveling between hospitals and clinics, but cannot deduct the cost of traveling between residence and hospital or residence and clinic. Rev. Rul. 90-23, 1990-1 C.B. 28.

However, there are many restrictions on what employees are allowed to expense and deduct. Most of these restrictions are found in [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-IX-274.html Section 274], which states that the following are nondeductible:

* Tickets purchased above face value (only deductible at face value).
* Skybox tickets (only deductible to an amount equal to the cost of box seats).
* Luxury water travel.

Entertainment expenses not directly related to the taxpayer's trade or business are generally not deductible, as are operating and membership expenses for entertainment facilities, such as sporting and social clubs. But such expenses ''can'' be deducted if they are provided as employee compensation or made available to the general public.

Meals and entertainment provided by employers to their employees are only deductible to 50 percent of their cost under Section 274(n). This restriction does not apply if the meal is considered a ''de minimis'' fringe, or if it is supplied to transportation workers subject to federal hours limits (e.g. aircrews and long-distance bus drivers).

===Vehicles, computers and phones===

[http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-IX-280F.html Section 280F] deals with vehicles, computers and phones, three types of property that are often provided by businesses to their employees, or used by self-employed individuals for their business. Such items are not depreciable under the usual accelerated system unless more than fifty percent of their use is for business. Use by employees must be for the employer's convenience and required as a condition of employment in order for such use to count as business use. &quot;Profit-seeking&quot; use is also not counted as business use.

'''Automobiles''' are subject to additional rules which greatly decelerate their depreciation. However, trucks, vans, ambulances, hearses and all vehicles over 6,000 pounds are not counted as &quot;automobiles&quot; for the purpose of this rule. This means that while a Rolls-Royce must be depreciated over a very long period, a Hummer can be depreciated over a relatively brief period.

===Uniforms===

Business uniforms are only deductible if they are unsuitable for ordinary wear outside the course of business. This leads to some seemingly arbitrary distinctions. The cost of military uniforms, for instance, cannot be deducted when the uniforms can be worn off duty. Fatigues, on the other hand, cannot be worn off duty, and therefore the cost of military fatigues is deductible. By similar logic, a performer can deduct the cost of a unique tuxedo they wear on stage; a lawyer cannot deduct the cost of a suit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cells==
[[Image:Plantcell.svg|thumb|A Plant Cell]]
All animals and plants are made up of cells. Most cells have:
*A nucleus – controlling the activity of the cell. All cells have these at one point.
*Cytoplasm – where chemical reactions occur. Inside the cytoplasm are enzymes which speed up these reactions. Cytoplasm also contains mitochondria which is where energy is released.
*A cell membrane – to control the passage of substances in and out of the cell.

Plants also have
*Cell walls – to strengthen the cell.
*Chloroplasts – to absorb sunlight energy to make food by photosynthesis.
*Vacuole –full of cell sap.

A more advanced drawing of cells that may occasionally appear at GCSE:

[[File:gcsebiolcell.gif]]

==Cells, tissues and organs==

An Organelle is a specialized subunit within a cell. Cells act together to form tissues. For instance, the cells on the surface of a leaf form &quot;pallisade tissue&quot;. A group of cells with similar structures and a particular function are called a tissue. Tissues are grouped together to form an organ. A leaf is an organ. Organs are grouped together to form an organism such as a whole plant or animal.

Organelle ----&gt; Cells   ----&gt;   Tissue   ----&gt;   Organ ----&gt; Organ system   ----&gt;   Organism

Tissues are usually formed from specialised cells. The cells in the pallisade tissue are specialised to perform photosynthesis and contain many chloroplasts. Some other specialised cells are:

*Guard cells
*Egg cells
*Sperm cells
*Red blood cells

==Diffusion==

Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of a lower concentration. The steeper the concentration gradient, the more rapid the rate of diffusion.

2 examples of diffusion are:
*Oxygen (required for respiration) passes through cell membranes and gas exchange surfaces (e.g. alveoli in lungs) by diffusion
*Carbon dioxide enters leaves and leaf cells by diffusion

If you spray a can of air freshener in a room in one corner and have another person sit somewhere else in the room, how come he/she can smell it after a few seconds? The air freshener diffuses throughout the room- from an area of high concentration (the area where you sprayed the deodorant) to an area of low concentration (where the other person is).

==Osmosis==

Osmosis is the movement of water from an area of high water concentration (more dilute) to an area of a low water concentration (stronger) through a partially permeable membrane.

A partially permeable membrane allows water molecules to pass through (as they are smaller) but not solute molecules (they are too big). It acts like a sieve. Visking tubing is a partially permeable membrane. It is used in dialysis machines.

===Turgor===
Plant cells need to be '''turgid''' (i.e. rigid) to support plant tissues. Plant cells become turgid when the concentration inside the cell is higher than outside. Therefore water moves into the cell by osmosis, and the vacuole swells and pushes against the cell wall.

If the concentration inside the cell is lower than outside, water moves out of the cell, the vacuole shrinks and the cell loses its shape and becomes flaccid. A cell which is flaccid (due to water loss from osmosis) is called '''plasmolysed'''. A plant that contains plasmolysed cells is said to '''wilt''' and the leaves droop, collapsing and hanging down from the stem.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Rhoeo Discolor epidermis.jpg|Before Plasmolysis...
File:Rhoeo Discolor - Plasmolysis.jpg|...and after.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

{{clr}}
Turgor is used to control the opening and closing of '''stomata''', the pores on the underside of leaves. The stomata are surrounded by '''guard cells''' that can become turgid or flaccid. Stomata allow carbon dioxide into the leaf and water to escape through evaporation. They can control the rate of water loss from the plant. They also control '''transpiration''' where water loss from the leaves due to evaporation causes the flow of water and fresh minerals up the plant.

[[File:gcsebiolstomata.gif]]

If an animal cell becomes turgid it can be in danger of bursting because it does not have a cell wall to protect it.

==Active Transport==

Diffusion and osmosis can only work if the concentration gradient is right. Sometimes an organism needs to transport something against a concentration gradient. The only way this can be done is through active transport, using energy produced by respiration. In Active transport, the particles move across a cell membrane from a lower to a higher concentration.

===Examples of active transport===

'''In plants:
Plants need mineral salts (e.g. nitrates) for making proteins and growth. Nitrates are at a higher concentration inside the root cells than they are when dissolved in the water around the soil particles. If the plant relied on diffusion alone, the vital nitrate salts would drain out of the cells into the soil. So energy is deployed by the cells to actively transport nitrates across the cell membrane into the root cells, against the concentration gradient.


'''In humans'''
Active transport takes place during digestion of food in the small intestine. After food has been absorbed by the villi for some time, the concentration of food molecules inside the villi increases, making it impossible for more food to diffuse into the villi. So simple sugars, amino acids, minerals and vitamins are actively absorbed into the villi, from an area of lower to an area of higher concentration

==The Cell Cycle==

At one time, biologists described the life of a cell division after another &quot;Interphase&quot;. During the Cell Cycle, a cell grows, prepares for division, and divides to create two daughter cells, each of which begin the cell cycle.
During the normal cell cycle, interphase can be quite long, whereas the actual division of the cell takes place quickly. Interphase is divided into three phases: G1, S, and G2.
The G1 period is a period of activity in which cells do most of their growing. During this phase, cells increase in size and synthesize new proteins and organelles.
G1 is followed by the S phase, in which chromosomes are replicated and the synthesis of DNA molecules takes place. Key proteins associated with the chromosomes are synthesized during the S phase. Usually, once a cell enters the S phase and begins the replication of its chromosomes, it completes the rest of the cell cycle, including mitosis.
When DNA replication is completed, the cell enters the G2 phase. G2 is usually the shortest of the three stages of interphase. During the G2 phase, many of the organells and molecules required for cell division are produced. When the events of the G2 phase is complete, the cell is ready to enter the M phase and begin the process of cell division.


===Prophase===
The first and longest phase of mitosis, prophase, can take as much as 50-60 percent of the total time to complete mitosis. During prophase, the chromosomes become visible. The centrioles, two tiny structures located in the cytoplasm near the nuclear envelope, separate and take up positions on opposite sides of the nucleus. The centriols lie in a region called the centrosome that helps to organise the spindle, a fanliek microtubule structure that help separate the chromosomes. During prophase, the condensed chromosomes become attached to fibers in the spindle at a point near the centromere of each chromatid.

===Metaphase===
The second phase of mitosis, metaphase, often only lasts a few minutes. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up across the center of the cell. Microtubules connect the centromere of each chromosome to the poles of the spindle.

===Anaphase===
Anaphase is the third phase of mitosis. During anaphase, the centromeres that join the sister chromatids separate, allowing the sister chromatids to separate and become individual chromosomes. The chromosomes continue to move until they have separated into two groups near the poles of the spindle. Anaphase ends when the chromosomes stop moving.

===Telophase===
Following anaphase is telophase, the fourth and final phase of mitosis. In telophase, the chromosomes, which were distinct and condensed, begin to disperse into a tangle of dense material. A nuclear envelope re-forms around each cluster of chromosomes. The spindle begins to break apart, and a nucleolus becomes bisible in each daughter nucleus. Mitosis is complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Human Digestive System==

[[Image:gcsebioldigest.gif|right]]Digestion begins inside the mouth, where chewing does 2 things - makes the food easier to swallow and increases the surface area (this helps to speed up digestion). Also inside the mouth, amylase (for digesting starch) can be found, produced by the salivary glands. The gullet then carries food from the mouth to the stomach by its muscular squeezing action called peristalsis.

The stomach does a number of things, including:
*pummels and churns the food
*produces protease enzymes to digest protein
*produces hydrochloric acid which kills bacteria and gives the ideal pH for protease to work.

The liver produces bile which emulsifies fats i.e. breaks them down into small droplets for a larger surface area. This will increase the rate at which the fat is digested by lipase. Bile also neutralizes the acid produced by the stomach to provide ideal alkaline conditions for enzymes in the small intestine. The gall bladder stores the bile made by the liver until it is needed. 

The small intestine produces amylase, lipase and protease. The pancreas, a pistol shaped organ, produces the enzymes amylase, lipase and protease and releases them into the small intestine when needed. The enzymes are used to fully digest the food molecules, so that they are small enough to diffuse into the bloodstream. Food molecules diffuse in the small intestine, which is ideal for this purpose. The small intestine walls are very thin so that there is a short diffusion pathway. It is long and folded with villi to increase surface area. There is a rich blood supply to maintain a steep concentration gradient for diffusion.

When all the useful products have diffused into the blood, the remaining waste reaches the large intestine where the majority of the remaining water is absorbed into the blood stream. Finally the waste products leave the body in the form of faeces through the anus.

[[image:gcsebiolgut2.gif|right]]It is useful to know that the ''small intestine'' consists of the ''duodenum'', jejunum and ileum and the ''large intestine'' consists of the caecum, colon and rectum in that order. The appendix is a small cul-de-sac at the base of the caecum. Only the terms in italics are needed by most GCSE boards.

===How digestion works===

The working of the digestive system is based on two things:
# Muscular Action – The gut is a muscular tube and its squeezing action is very important. It helps to break up the food into very small pieces with a large surface area for enzyme action to take place. It also helps the chemical breakdown of the food, mixing it with various digestive juices, which break down its molecules. The muscles also move the food along the gut from one area of chemical digestion to another. 
# Enzyme Action – enzymes are chemicals which speed up (catalyse) other reactions. They do not actually take part in the reaction or change it in any way except to make it happen faster. Each type of enzyme acts on a specific type of food.

==Enzymes==
Enzymes are proteins. They are made inside cells. Most of them work inside the cell, but some (e.g. digestive enzymes) work outside the cell. Enzymes are biological catalysts. A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction. It does not change the final products. A catalyst is not changed by the reaction – therefore it can be used over and over again. 

===How Enzymes Work===

In an enzyme the reactants (things on the left of the equation) are called substrates. An enzyme is a large molecule. It has an indentation on the surface called the active site. The active site has a specific shape which is exactly the right shape for the substrates. When the substrates fit into the active site, they bind to it forming an enzyme/substrate complex. The reaction occurs, and the products are released. This is known as the lock and key hypothesis – the enzyme is the lock and the substrate is the key.

===Key features of enzymes===

# They change '''substrates''' to '''products'''.
# They are proteins.
# They are catalysts. Tiny amounts of enzyme can be used over and over again.
# They have '''specificity''', acting on particular substrate molecules.
# They are pH sensitive, most work best at pH 7. Proteins can be damaged by high or low pH.
# Enzyme catalysed reactions go faster as the temperature increases.
# Enzymes give the fastest reaction at an '''optimum temperature'''.
# They are inactivated at temperatures over 40 degrees C because proteins are denatured at these temperatures so the active site is misshapen.

===Enzymes in Digestion===

Enzymes are very important in digestion. They help act as catalysts to break down the big molecules (which cannot pass through the gut wall into the blood) into smaller ones (which can diffuse into the blood). Starch, proteins and fats are big molecules. Sugars, amino acids and fatty acids/ glycerol are much smaller.

'''Amylase''' enzyme converts starch into simple sugars e.g. glucose. &lt;BR&gt;
'''Protease''' enzyme converts proteins into amino acids. &lt;BR&gt;
'''Lipase''' enzyme converts fats into fatty acids and glycerol. &lt;BR&gt;
Bile is not an enzyme. However, it emulsifies the fats, breaking it down into tiny droplets. This provides a much larger surface area for lipase enzyme to work on, so that fat is digested more quickly.

===Other enzymes===

'''Catalase''' is an enzyme found in cells that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.

==Key Ideas==
*Large food molecules must be broken down (using enzymes as a catalyst) so that they are small enough to diffuse through the gut wall into the blood.
*The small intestine is long, filled with bile, has thin walls and a rich blood supply - these features all speed up diffusion.

==Test Yourself==
#  Name 2 ways in which chewing helps digestion.
#  What organ carries food from mouth to stomach, and how does it do this?
# Where is bile a) produced? and b) stored?
# Name the 3 large molecules that cannot diffuse into the blood.
# Name the 4 small molecules that can diffuse into the blood.
# Name the 3 enzymes involved in digestion.

==Answers==
# Chewing aids digestion by making food easier to swallow and providing a larger surface area for amylase (produced by the salivary glands) to work on.
# The '''gullet''' carries food from the mouth to the stomach by '''peristalsis''', a muscular squeezing action.
# Bile is produced in the '''liver''' and stored in the '''gall bladder'''
# Starch, proteins and fats cannot diffuse into the blood
# Glucose (or another simple sugar), amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol.
# Amylase (for starch), protease (for protein) and lipase (for fats)

      <text xml:space="preserve">An operation is commutitive if and only if the order does not affect the result.

For example, addition is commutitive for the real numbers; thus, if &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; are both real:

&lt;math&gt;a + b = b + a&lt;/math&gt;

An operation that is not commutitive is subtraction over the reals; ie, the following is not true:

&lt;math&gt;a - b = b - a&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the situation one is stranded in the desert, there are two essentials to surviving: finding shelter away from the sun and staying hydrated. There are a few sources of '''water in the desert''', which are listed in this article.

==Staying hydrated==
Foremost, if you have bottled water with you, you should not ration it. Instead, drink it all at once &amp;mdash; people have been found dead with water remaining in their bottle. Assuming there are no bodies of freshwater around (such as a river), plants, the air, and animals are the only source of water. Some plants, especially some species of cactus, contain water in a form that can be tapped and drunk directly. More often, however, the moisture in a plant cannot be obtained by any method other than the use of a still, which can retrieve water from the air.


Water can be added to the surrounding air by placing plant parts in the still (but outside the area for capturing the pure water).  A simple still can be constructed of plastic sheeting, some rocks, and a cup. Simply dig a hole deep enough to hold the cup, with a couple of inches to spare. The wider the still, the better, since it will have more surface area for water to condense on. Place the cup in the center of the hole and cover the hole with plastic (clear plastic is better than opaque, since it absorbs less heat).  Use rocks to secure the edges of the plastic and place a small rock in the center of the plastic sheet to pull it down so that water condensing on the plastic drips into the cup.  Such a still does not produce enough water for a person to live on indefinitely, but even a little bit of water can improve one's chances of survival. 

If there is no available liquid and you are severely dehydrated, drinking urine can become an extreme survival option.

==Not Overhydrating==
Any activity or situation that promotes heavy sweating can lead to water intoxication when water is consumed to replace lost fluids. Persons working in extreme heat and/or humidity for long periods must take care to drink and eat in ways that help to maintain electrolyte balance. Even people who are resting quietly in extreme heat or humidity may run the risk of water intoxication if they drink large amounts of water over short periods for rehydration.

==What not to drink==
Drinking alcoholic beverages will slake your thirst temporarily, but due in part to the diuretic nature of alcohol, will leave you more dehydrated than before.  Since alcohol is a poison, the liver aggressively removes it, and a lot of water in the process.  Alcohol and water bond covalently, and boiling alcoholic drinks will not remove the alcohol any faster than it will remove the water. Drinking saltwater will lead to water being drained from the body, because of osmosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Template:US Income Tax}}
This chapter deals with the deductions that apply to individual taxpayers. The first set of deductions covered are those that are '''above the line'''&amp;mdash;subtracted from gross income to reach AGI. The other deductions for individuals are '''below the line'''&amp;mdash;subtracted from AGI to reach taxable income. When calculating below the line deductions, the taxpayer can either use a '''standard deduction''' provided by law, or elect to take '''itemized deductions'''.

==Above the line deductions==

The main type of above the line deduction is for '''business''' and '''employment''' expenses, which are discussed in the chapter on [[US Income Tax: Business Deductions|Business Deductions]]. Several other deductions are allowed &quot;above the line&quot; even though they are not business-related. These deductions are listed in [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-I-62.html Section 62].

===Property losses===

Ordinary losses from the sale of property, as detailed in the chapter on [[US Income Tax: Gains and Losses|Gains and Losses]], are deductible &quot;above the line.&quot; This makes them preferable to capital losses, as they can be applied directly against income rather than going through the complicated calculations for capital gains taxation.

===Interest===

[http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VI-163.html Section 163] provides that interest payments are generally deductible. However, interest on &quot;personal&quot; loans, with the exception of home mortgages and student loans, is not deductible.

Interest is generally defined as &quot;rent for borrowed money,&quot; so some payments labeled as &quot;interest&quot; may not be considered &quot;interest&quot; for tax purposes. Likewise, some payments are considered to be &quot;interest&quot; despite not being called by that name: &quot;points&quot; and loan origination fees, for instance, are deductible over the term of the loan. Rev. Rul. 69-188, 1969-1 C.B. 54.

&quot;Investment interest,&quot; interest for property held for investment (e.g. stocks, bonds, and land) can only be deducted to the extent of net investment income; disallowed investment interest is carried forward and treated as investment interest the following year.

Some interest payments are nondeductible due to the passive activity loss limitation, described in the section on [[US_Income_Tax:_Business_Deductions#Leveraged_tax_shelters|leveraged tax shelters]] in the previous chapter.

===Alimony===

===Educational expenses===

Educational expenses are deductible if they maintain or improve skills used in a present trade or business, and if they do not qualify an individual for a new trade or business.

This means that the ''type'' of education does not determine deductibility: the ''circumstances'' of the education do. In ''Ruehmann v. Commr.'', T.C. Memo. 1971-157, a student who entered an LLM program after four months of employment as an attorney was allowed to deduct the cost of his degree. But in ''Wassenaar v. Commr.'', 72 T.C. 1195 (1979), a student who entered an LLM program immediately after law school was denied a deduction for its cost, on the grounds that he was not employed as an attorney at the time he paid for the classes.

One exception to this rule is when a person takes a job contingent upon completing an educational requirement, as is the case when teachers are hired subject to completing a required degree, or when law school graduates are hired subject to passing the bar exam. In these cases, the cost of their education is not deductible because it is considered a &quot;minimum education requirement&quot; that qualifies the individual for their trade or business.

===Student loan interest===

==Personal exemptions==

As of 2005, the personal exemption is $3,500 for the taxpayer and each dependent.

Under Section 151(d)(3), personal exemptions &quot;phase out&quot; over a threshold income of $145,950 for single taxpayers and $218,950 for married couples (2005). They fall two percent for each $2,500 or fraction thereof over the threshold, reaching zero at income levels of $268,450 and $341,450 respectively.

A dependent is defined in Section 152 as someone who is reliant on the taxpayer for more than 50% of their support, and either living with or closely related to the taxpayer. Non-resident foreigners cannot be dependents unless they come from a country contiguous with the United States.

==Standard deduction==

==Itemized deductions==

===Medical expenses===
Medical expenses can be deducted to the amount of those expenses which the tax payer has not been reimbursed for and that they exceed 7.5% of the taxpayers adjusted gross income (AGI).  (i.e. 100 dollars of unreimbursed expenses for a person with an AGI of 1,000 can be deducted in the amount of 25 [100-1,000*.075])  These deductions are different when calculating Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and are subject to phaseout in higher income brackets.  See IRS form 1040 Schedule A instructions for more details.

===Investment interest===

===Wagering losses===

===Casualty losses===

Casualty losses include losses due to theft, accident, and other &quot;sudden&quot; incidents. A casualty loss may be the loss of an entire piece of property, or it may be in the form of damage to that property.

Casualty losses ''do not'' include:

* Losses compensated for by insurance. But a property owner may claim a casualty loss if their property is covered by insurance but no claim is pursued. ''Hills v. Commr.'', 691 F.2d 997 (11th Cir. 1982).
* Property confiscated under color of law.
* Losses due to the owner's gross negligence (e.g. setting a house on fire during a domestic dispute). However, loss due to the owner's ordinary negligence (e.g. dropping a diamond ring down the drain) is deductible as a casualty loss.
* Unrealized declines in property value. See, e.g., ''Chamales v. Commr.'', T.C. Memo. 2000-33 (2000) (neighbors of O.J. Simpson not allowed to claim casualty loss for decline in property value due to disorder in neighborhood following Simpson murders).
* Expenses incidental to the loss, such as legal expenses.

Each casualty loss is only deductible to the extent it exceeds $100, and total casualty losses are only deductible to the extent they exceed 10% of AGI.

Casualty loss can never exceed adjusted basis of the property. If casualty loss is taken for damage to property, the adjusted basis of that property is reduced by the amount of the loss.

===Profit-seeking expenses===

===Charitable contributions===

Charitable contributions are deductible under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VI-170.html Section 170]. The section imposes a limit on deductible contributions of 50 percent of AGI for individuals (less in the case of certain organizations) and 10 percent of taxable income for corporations.

The donor must have a '''donative intent''' in order for the contribution to be deductible. The analysis of donative intent is similar to the analysis used in determining whether a payment is a gift: the purpose of the donation must be &quot;detached and disinterested generosity.&quot; See ''Hernandez v. Commr.'', 490 U.S. 680 (1989) (payments to Church of Scientology for &quot;auditing&quot; sessions were non-deductible ''quid pro quo'' exchanges). If a good or service is provided in exchange for the contribution, the contribution is only deductible to the extent it exceeds the fair market value of that good or service. But a ''de minimis'' consideration, worth less than 2 percent of the contribution or $50, need not be subtracted from the donation.

When property is donated to a charity, the value of the donation is considered to be the fair market value of the property, not its adjusted basis. Because of this rule, many taxpayers choose to donate appreciated property to charity, rather than sell it and pay taxes on the gain.

===Foreign, state and local taxes===

Many non-federal taxes are deductible under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VI-164.html Section 164]. The main categories are foreign, state and local '''income taxes'''; foreign, state and local '''real property taxes'''; and state and local '''personal property taxes'''. Other types of taxes, such as sales taxes, are generally not deductible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Template:US Income Tax}}
'''Tax credits''' are applied at the last stage in the tax computation process. They directly reduce the actual tax paid by the taxpayer. This makes them highly preferable to equivalent deductions.

==Personal credits==

===Adoption credit===
You may be able to take a tax credit for qualifying expenses paid to adopt an eligible child (including a child with special needs). The adoption credit is an amount subtracted from your tax liability. Although the credit generally is allowed for the year following the year in which the expenses are paid, a taxpayer who paid qualifying expenses in the current year for an adoption which became final in the current year, may be eligible to claim the credit on the current year return. The adoption credit is not available for any reimbursed expense. In addition to the credit, certain amounts reimbursed by your employer for qualifying adoption expenses may be excludable from your gross income.

For both the credit or the exclusion, qualifying expenses include reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, traveling expenses (including amounts spent for meals and lodging while away from home), and other expenses directly related to and for which the principal purpose is the legal adoption of an eligible child. An eligible child must be under 18 years old, or be physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself. The adoption credit or exclusion cannot be taken for a child who is not a United States citizen or resident unless the adoption becomes final. An eligible child is also a child with special needs if he or she is a United States citizen or resident and a state determines that the child cannot or should not be returned to his or her parent's home and probably will not be adopted unless assistance is provided. Under certain circumstances, the amount of your qualified adoption expenses may be increased if you adopted an eligible child with special needs.

The credit and exclusion for qualifying adoption expenses are each subject to a dollar limit and an income limit.

Under the dollar limit the amount of your adoption credit or exclusion is limited to the dollar limit for that year for each effort to adopt an eligible child. If you can take both a credit and an exclusion, this dollar amount applies separately to each. For example, if we assume the dollar limit for the year is $10,000 and you paid $9,000 in qualifying adoption expenses for a final adoption, while your employer paid $4,000 of additional qualifying adoption expenses, you may be able to claim a credit of up to $9,000 and also exclude up to $4,000.

The dollar limit for a particular year must be reduced by the amount of qualifying expenses taken into account in previous years for the same adoption effort.

The income limit on the adoption credit or exclusion is based on your modified adjusted gross income (modified AGI). If your modified AGI is below the beginning phase out amount for the year, the income limit will not affect your credit or exclusion. If your modified AGI is more than the beginning phase out amount for the year, your credit or exclusion will be reduced. If your modified AGI is above the maximum phase out amount for the year, your credit or exclusion will be eliminated.

Generally, if you are married, you must file a joint return to take the adoption credit or exclusion. If your filing status is married filing separately, you can take the credit or exclusion only if you meet special requirements.

To take the credit or exclusion, complete Form 8839 , Qualified Adoption Expenses, and attach the form to your Form 1040 or Form 1040A .

'''Boneheadmx''' is currently a student at University of California, Berkeley and a former Bowles Hall President. I joined Wikipedia in the spring of 2005, because I am very interested in the sociological aspects of an internet community such as this one in which members participate by sharing useful information in a cross-referenced database. I am also a member of various other web communities such as Discogs.com, Photo.net, and Beer Advocate.com.

I enjoy learning very much, and I like to browse this site very often, looking up many new articles. I really enjoy learning random pieces of trivia, and enjoying the fine writing of various users exhibited by many of the articles.

The study of '''Social Deviance''' is the study of the violation of cultural norms in either formal (criminal) or informal (deviant) contexts.

Social deviance is a phenomenon that has existed in all societies where there have been norms. There are two possibilities for how an individual will act in the face of social norms; conform or violate.  There are implicit social norms and explicit social norms.  Explicit social norms are not necessarily laws (such as a sign at a computer lab that says food and drink are prohibited).  In reality, there is often a blend of conformity and deviance in the ways people behave.  Rarely if ever does a person deviate from or conform to all norms.  Furthermore, some behaviors in themselves reflect both conformity and deviance at once.  Consider breaking the speed limit, which is technically a legal violation, but which is also conformist, particularly on freeways where motorists &quot;go with the flow.&quot;  That is a critical feature of deviance, conformity, and norms.  Relativity abounds.  That is, norms can change over time (e.g. women in the paid labor force), depend on situational context (e.g. laughing at a party as opposed to doing so at a funeral), depend on statuses (e.g. an adolescent blowing up neighbors' mailboxes as opposed to an elderly woman doing so), and any number of other factors.  But it's not all relative.  There are forms of deviance (and certain norms) that are about as universal as anything in the social sciences can be, such as when one maliciously harms a child.  In light of the way we think about norms, deviance, and conformity, many thinkers throughout history have tried to explain the causes behind deviance.

==A Word About Theories==
Social science theories are just what they they are: theories. The philosophers who have come up with these theories believe in them because they have made a set of the assumptions by their observations and they have made conclusions based on these assumptions. However, as the reality of the world is open to interpretation, each theory describes the world in its own unique way. No theories are wrong if they are supportable by facts and observations. These theories you will learn are just ways that thinkers have used to describe the world around them. Just remember that you do not have to agree with a particular theory, but you must be able to understand all theories in order to make a conclusion about the world in which you live.

The best way to understand a particular ideology is to think as a philosopher would think. How would believers of a particular theory present a solution to a particular problem? Thinkers in different schools of thought will come up with different answers because of the differences in their assumptions. Make sure you understand how different theorists think.

Most importantly, understand that these theories are constantly being altered, borrowed from, and in some of the cases, discredited completely. Theories are not rules to the world but rather ways to look at the world. A person can look at the world in different perspectives and can combine different assumptions of theories to describe it. No matter how different theories can be, they can almost always be combined because they are almost never mutually exclusive.

# [[Social Deviance/What Is Crime And Deviance|What Is Crime And Deviance?]]: Before we can understand what crime and deviance are, it is necessary to know that crime and deviance are changeable in nature. John Hagan in his book ''Crime And Disrepute'' states two theories of describing crime before presenting the most commonly used approach. {{stage short|100%|January 1, 2006}}
# [[Social Deviance/Early Theories|Early Theories]]: Before the three classical branches of the sociological approach to deviance, there were early theories in criminology that attempted to define and explain crime in the context of the individual (instead of in the context of the individual as a part of the whole of society). These early theories helped to pave the way for modern sociological explanations of deviance. {{stage short|75%|January 1, 2006}}
# [[Social Deviance/Structural Functionalism|Structural-Functionalism]]: The structural-functionalist school of sociology is concerned with macro-level explanations. Therefore, this school is interested primarily in how norms and institutions fit in the study of deviance. {{stage short|25%|January 1, 2006}}
# [[Social Deviance/Symbolic Interactionism|Symbolic Interactionism]]: The symbolic interactionist school of sociology came up as a counterpoint to the structural-functionalist view. This school is interested primarily in individual-to-individual interactions by way of communication through symbols (the symbolic, subjective definitions of objects and ideas in the world; definitions that may hold different meanings for different individuals). {{stage short|00%|January 1, 2006}}
# [[Social Deviance/Power Conflict|Power Conflict Theories]]: Sociologists and philosophers who take on the power-conflict perspective believe that structural-functionalists and symbolic interactionists do not adequately take into account the use (or abuse) of power within societies. Many thinkers of this school tend to base their explanations of crime from the division of classes and the unequal distribution of power among different groups within the context of the larger group of the society. {{stage short|25%|January 15, 2006}}
# [[Social Deviance/Social Control|Social Control]]: Social control refers to the various means used by a society to bring its members back into line with cultural norms. {{stage short|00%|January 1, 2006}}

      <comment>Agree - unsure what to remove</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey.  I suggest you remove large parts of or split up [[Business Integration Engine 6.0.4 File Tree Structure]].  It's currently by far the largest module in wikibooks.  Would help myself, but I don't know what BIE is. Thanks! &amp;mdash;[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 07:59, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== Agree - unsure what to remove ==

Yes, I agree with you, but at the moment I'm a bit unsure what to remove first. 

First, let me explain what BIE is: BIE lets you move data between applications that are unable to exchange data by themselves and create automated workflows. Let's say you work at a doctor's office, which is able to output statistical information as comma separated file (CSV) from a proprietary electronic patient record system (EPR), but is unable to adhere to a national XML standard for such information in your country. BIE can automatically convert the CSV file to an XML version, then the XML version can be mapped field by field to the national XML standard. The links between fields can have macros associated with them, to convert strings from lower to upper case, mathematical or logical operations, regex replacement and so on. BIE handles transport between the different systems as well. See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Business_Integration_Engine_or_BIE for the main article.

Second, Brunswick WDI have chosen to include all dependencies in the download package, just install and run &quot;out of the box&quot;. Among the dependencies or plugins in BIE parlance are JBoss, Java SDK, and so on.

Third, the problem with BIE is that although BIE is released under the GNU GPL, Brunswick WDI has chosen to sell documentation and services from day one. This would not be a problem if it were not for the fact that BIE has not been updated for a year, and that users who bought the documentation was not very satisfied in the first place. That is why I've started this documentation initiative. Nobody - or very few outsiders - except Brunswick WDI know how the dependencies interact at the moment. I'm pretty sure that most of the files from Java SDK can safely be removed - I just don't know which files MUST be kept yet.

To make a long answer short: yes, I will clean up the File Tree Structure file, as soon as possible, but I think that will be in January. I have removed the Java SDK entries, hoping that this is just a standard installation. I think BIE 6.0.4 or it's dependencies depend on this particular version of Java SDK.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most Seikos have a relatively simple code--The first letter of the serial number is the last digit of the year, the second is the month, using N for November, D for December.   If the production dates of the movement are known, and they were made for less than 10 years this works well.  Some movements that were made for a long time are more difficult--The 7009 for instance was made longer than 10 years, so the exact date can be difficult.  One clue can be the number of digits--From about 1960 to 1967, Seiko used 7 digit serial numbers.  In 1967 and 68, they used both 7 and 6 digit numbers, and from 1969 on, used exclusively 6 digit numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
Getting a new version of the Mac OS feels like christmas for most Mac fans. As soon as you finish installing, you'll see an immediate increase in speed and discover lots of cool new features. But if you feel daunted by the task of installing Tiger and are putting it off, this appendix is made for you! It lays out in plain English what you need to do, and will let you get installation over with in about a half hour.

=Types of Installations=
Before you begin, you should pick how you're going to install Tiger. There are four choices, although depending on your current configuration, you won't be able to choose all of them. The choices are:

*'''Upgrade Install''' - An Upgrade Install takes a copy of Mac OS X 10.2 or 10.3 (Jaguar or Panther) and turns it into a copy of Tiger, by going under the hood and modifying only what's been changed since your current Mac OS version. It eliminates all extra installation headaches... but upgraded copies of Mac OS X tend to be slightly buggier than copies installed via either of the two methods below.
*'''Archive and Install''' - Archive and Install shrink-wraps your current OS, be it an early version of Mac OS X or even (heaven forbid) Mac OS 9, stores it in a folder, and puts a fresh copy of Tiger in its place. Among Mac users who are &quot;in the know&quot;, this is the most popular choice. You will need to tie up a few loose ends afterwards, though, so weigh the extra hassle against the slightly inferior reliability of an Upgrade Install.
*'''Erase and Install''' - Erase and Install completly obliterates the hard drive you install Tiger on and starts fresh - it's like getting a new Mac. Obviously, you'll want to make sure that any important files are backed up first.
*'''Basic Install''' - A Basic Install puts a copy of Mac OS X on a blank hard drive. If your hard drive isn't blank, then you can't choose this option.

=Pre-Installation To-Do List=
Before you install Tiger, make sure you've done these five simple things.

#'''Printing this Appendix''' - You can't connect to the Internet while installing Tiger, so it's important that you print this Appendix before installing so you can refer to it as you go. It's very simple to do this; in almost all web browsers, choose File &gt; Print and press the blue Print button in the dialog box that appears.
#'''Checking the Weather''' - Yes, you read that right. You should check the weather before you install Tiger and make sure conditions are good. High winds, snow, or thunder could knock out power to your house, and a power outage during installation is '''not''' a good thing.
#'''Plugging In''' - If the computer you're installing Tiger on is a laptop, plug it in, since installing Tiger will consume a lot of power.
#'''Repairing Permissions''' - This trouble-shooting procedure essentially smooths out any wrinkles that may have formed over time in the UNIX underpinnings of your current Mac OS, prepping it for being moved, deleted, or upgraded. The process of repairing permissions is simple and potentially beneficial. To Repair Permissions:
##Open Disk Utility in the Applications &gt; Utilities folder.
##Select your internal Hard Drive in the sidebar along the left.
##Click the &quot;Repair Disk Permissions&quot; button.
##Enter your administrator credentials.
##When the repairs are complete, quit the Disk Utility.
You don't need to do this if you are doing the Erase and Install option.
#'''Backing Up''' - It's a good idea to back up your important files before installing Tiger. While the chance that something goes wrong during installation is tiny, it's not worth the risk when you can easily back up. Have every user of your Mac burn a copy of their entire Home folder to a CD or DVD before you install, or do it for them. While CD Burning is described in Chapter 4, here's a quick tutorial on backing up a home folder:
##Open System Preferences' CDs &amp; DVDs pane and make sure that your Mac is set up to &quot;Ask what to do&quot; when you insert a blank CD or DVD (depending which you intend to back up on to).
##Log into the user you want to back up's account.
##Insert a Blank CD into your disc drive.
##Open the Users folder on your main hard drive.
##Drag the user's home folder onto the Blank CD's icon on the Desktop or in the Finder window's sidebar.
##Choose &quot;Burn Disc...&quot; from the Finder window and follow the dialog boxes' instructions.
##Repeat steps 2-6 for all other users.

=Installation=
==The Tiger Box==
Tiger comes in a little black box with a big chrome &quot;X&quot; logo on the front. Open up the box and take a peek inside. You'll find:

*The Tiger Disc - A black DVD in a paper sleeve.
*A Trial Version of iWork - A small gift from Apple, this is Apple's iWork productivity suite, minus the secret code included with the boxed version that keeps it running past 30 days.
*A card or two advertising some other Apple products.
*Another card explaining how to buy an AppleCare warranty for Tiger.
*A hard copy of the license agreement you agree to when you install Tiger.
*An &quot;Installation and Setup Guide&quot;, which is similar to this guide, only not nearly as well-written and helpful.
*A black &quot;Getting Started&quot; booklet, essentially an illustrated list of new features in Tiger.

==Starting the Installer==
Take the black Tiger DVD out of its protective paper sleeve and put it in your Mac's DVD drive.
{{Info|'''NOTE:''' If your Mac doesn't have an optical drive capable of reading a DVD, Apple has an exchange program in place that will let you trade in your one DVD for four Tiger CDs. You may also install with an external DVD drive, or with Target Disk Mode.}}

It should appear on your Desktop as a special black disc. The disc contains PDF versions of some of the printed material in the Tiger box, an &quot;Install Mac OS X&quot; application, and a folder called &quot;Xcode Tools&quot;.

Double-click on the &quot;Install Mac OS X&quot; application, and the Installer Starter application opens.

{{Yellow_Warning|'''WARNING:''' By pressing the blue &quot;Restart&quot; button, you temporarily plunge your computer into the Mac OS X installer, a very slow and stripped-down version of Mac OS X that actually runs from the Tiger DVD. While you can turn back and quit the installer later on, it's best to continue from here only if you're pretty sure you want to install Tiger. You will not be able to connect to the Internet while you install, so this is your last chance to print this appendix.}}

Click the Restart button, and your computer will shut down and restart from the DVD in your drive. This is a slow and laborious process due to the fact that CDs spin much slower than hard drives, so don't panic if your computer takes a very long time to start.

==The Introduction and License==
{{Info|'''NOTE:''' If you change your mind halfway through installing, you can quit and return to your current Mac OS at any time by choosing &quot;Quit&quot; from the Installer menu in the menu bar, clicking &quot;Startup Disk&quot;, choosing your system folder, and clicking &quot;Restart&quot;.}}

After selecting a language, the first thing you'll see is a simple welcome page. Click the continue button at the bottom. The next thing you see is the contract you agree to by installing Mac OS X. Read it if you'd like to, press &quot;Continue&quot;, and say that you agree. Remember that you have a hard copy of this contract, or &quot;license agreement&quot;, which came in the Tiger box.

==Choosing a Destination==
The next step is choose the volume (disk) you want to install Tiger on. Most of the time, this will be your computer's internal hard drive, which is usually called &quot;Macintosh HD&quot;. Click the disk so that it's circled and click the &quot;Options...&quot; button.

==Choosing an Installation Type==
On this sheet, you must select which type of Installation you wish to perform. The choices were explained at the beginning of this guide.

*Upgrade Install - If you want to perform an Upgrade Install, make sure that &quot;Upgrade Mac OS X&quot;  is selected and click OK. You'll need to be currently running Jaguar or Panther in order to do this, otherwise this option won't appear.

*Archive and Install - If you want to Archive and Install, select &quot;Archive and Install&quot; from the list. You then must choose whether or not you wish to copy all of your settings into Tiger, which you probably do. Click OK.

*Basic Install - If you want to perform a Basic Install, select &quot;Install Mac OS X&quot; from the list and press OK. If you already have a copy of Mac OS X on your hard drive, this option won't appear.

*Erase and Install - If you want to Erase and Install, select &quot;Erase and Install&quot; from the list and press OK. yeah

==Customizing the Installation==
Now you must choose exactly what gets installed. You have two options: go with Apple's picks, or pick and choose components yourself. We'll assume you want to pick the components yourself, since it's generally worthwhile.

Click the &quot;Customize&quot; button. You'll be given a list of components with checkboxes for toggling each one on and off.

*Essential System Software - This is the stuff that ''will'' be installed no matter what. That includes the Tiger system and all of the extra apps that come with it, like Dashboard and Automator.
*Printer Drivers - Printer Drivers are the bits of software that let your Mac connect to various printer models. By clicking the flippy triangle next to this item, you'll see specific brands that you can choose to install or ignore. Without printer drivers for a brand, you can't install any of that brand's printers without going hunting on the Internet for drivers. If you're squeezed for disc space, you might want to skip the brands you don't think you'll use, but otherwise, it's generally a good idea to have all of these drivers handy.
*Additional Fonts - Another good pick, you probably already have these fonts installed in your current version of the Mac OS, although you won't have them under Tiger if you uncheck this box. Fonts take up next to no space, and having a few extra fonts handy will help you spice up your documents and presentations a bit.
*Language Translations - Clicking the flippy triangle next to this item reveals a list of languages that you can use Tiger in. Removing the translations you think you're least likely to need will save disc space and speed up your installation. Please note, however, that it's fun to try using a computer in an obscure language from time to time, so you may want to leave a few extra translations in just for fun.
*X11 - This is a tool that lets UNIX nerds run certain graphical UNIX applications under Mac OS X. It isn't covered in this wikibook, and if you don't know what it is, you definitely don't need it.

==Leap of Faith==
At this point, it's time to make up your mind once and for all.

If you want to install Mac OS X, click &quot;Install&quot; or &quot;Upgrade&quot; (the wording depends on which Installation type you chose). Once you do this, you ''cannot'' quit the installer. Make sure that if you have a laptop, it's plugged in. If you don't want to install Mac OS X, you can return to your current Mac OS by choosing &quot;Quit&quot; from the Installer menu in the menu bar, clicking &quot;Startup Disk&quot;, choosing your system folder, and clicking &quot;Restart&quot;. 

==Your Mac's Turn==
Once you press install, your Mac will get to work on copying, moving, deleting, and modifying all of your system files, slowly building a copy of Tiger on your hard drive. This process takes fifteen minutes to a half hour, so go ahead and make yourself a snack while you wait.

==Finishing==
When Tiger is finished installing, restart your computer.

=The Setup Assistant=
Depending on how you installed Tiger, you may be serenaded by a little program called the &quot;Setup Assistant&quot; when using Tiger for the first time. After the snazzy introduction movie finishes playing, this app will guide you through the process of setting up your Mac.

{{Mac OS X Tiger/Book Box|'''BACKGROUND:''' The introduction movie is a famous part of the Mac experience, and a different movie is used in each Mac OS version. The music for Tiger's movie is a song called &quot;Bytecry&quot; by the artist &quot;Weevil&quot;. Incidentally, the song is availible on iTunes for 99 cents.}}

{{Info|'''NOTE:''' Your Mac is already set up, you say? You can quit the Setup Assistant at any time just like any other app.}}

==Transferring Files==
==Creating an Account==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please note that the text has been modified. (See History page for details.) One of the details removed included the following:

&quot;Almost all of the information we have about Jesus and his life was written by proselytizing followers several decades after his death, and the veracity of the text is considered suspect.&quot;

This has been repeated here because it refers to an Endnote.

== Denominations ==

I think three branches is really stretching things thin.
There are certainly types of Christians who do not fit any
of those three categories.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations


[[List_of_Christian_denominations]]

Also, there are Christian Denominations that do not believe in the relatively new theological construct of Sin, for instance.

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 03:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

== The goal of Christianity goes beyond personal transformation ==

Christianity is different.  Christians claim that their leader is alive -- in fact, God.  So we do seek personal transformation, but as a byproduct of God's presence.  Many Christians content themselves with &quot;being a good person and going to a good place when I die&quot;, but misunderstand God's intention.

Although being a &quot;better&quot; person is good, trying to be so based on rules of behavior has failed spectacularly.  In fact that is the very core of what is popularly called Phariseeism.  Jesus came to put an end to humankind's independence from God.  We can't be virtuous apart from ongoing fellowship with God, even if we have an exhaustive (and exhausting) set of rules.  The reason is because our inmost being when in rebellion against God's moment-by-moment leadership lacks the power and purity to choose well.  Selfishness always reemerges.

The Bible, Christianity's authoritative statement, says that we began in close relationship and ongoing communication with God, acknowledging God's lordship, or mastery.  We rejected God's direction and disobeyed, forsaking the place we were designed by God to occupy, and Jesus came to restore us to that place of tremendous priviledge.

Jesus came with the intention not to make us good, but to make us His.  Once His, He will personally lead us and then our choices will be transformed.  Jesus said, &quot;apart from Me you can do nothing,&quot; and &quot;Come to Me . . . take my yoke upon you and learn from Me . . .&quot; indicating a personal partnership with God is essential to God's plan for us.

I've written a small book called The Big Picture that I'm considering submitting that lays out my response as a Christian to the &quot;big&quot; questions.  It deals with this more thoroughly.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey boneheadmx, just letting you know that I'm trying to get the economics and intro to economics books deleted, but I'm putting a link to [[Political Economy]] on the [[Wikibooks:Economics bookshelf]]. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 17:55, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

The politcal economy module is starting to look pretty good. Let me know if you need any help with it. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 18:50, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

Unfortunately I don't know much about political economics- actually before I looked it up, I didn't really know what it was. If you'd like to help me out, my plans are pretty much to get rid of these books: [[Microeconomics]], [[Macroeconomics]], [[Introduction to Economics]], and [[Principles of Economics]], and consolidate them into 4 new books: [[Principles of Microeconomics]], [[Principles of Macroeconomics]], [[Microeconomic Theory]] and [[Macroeconomic Theory]]. These 4 books correspond to the 4 most common college economics classes. Before moving any material around, though, I'd like to create some kind of skeleton for the books, and decide exactly what should be included in each book. Apart from that, I'd like to categorize different aspects of economics, and decide which subjects should get an entire book, and which subjects should be included in one book. My ongoing &quot;list&quot; of economic subjects can be foud here: http://dettoaltrimenti.pbwiki.com/FrontPage Any feedback on my list would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 20:58, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

The cover and contents looks good! You seem to have a knack for knowing the order in which topics should go in a book. Before the new year, I'm going to try and start the 'principles of macroeconomics' book, and pull the information for macroeconomics, intro to economics, and principles of economics. I would really appreciate any help putting the TOC in order and making sure I'm covering all the topics I need to. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 18:55, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

Hi there, my name is Martin M. Elissetche. I'm a PhD student at the University of Maryland and the creator of a social science dictionary located at www.socialsciencedictionry.org. I wanted to know if I could place a copy of your book on my web site or whether you prefer if I just link to it. Please let me know what you think at info@socialsciencedictionary.org.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When I came across this book it was only contrasting American literature with literature from Europe. A study of literature through the ages should seek to include literature from all over the world in all of its major forms.

Sorry about all the saves in the history. I keep forgetting I'm not the only one looking at this.</text>
