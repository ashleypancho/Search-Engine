Coronation chicken was apparently created by Florist Constance Spry and Rosemary Hume for the banquet of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 - see [[w:Coronation chicken|Wikipedia's article on Coronation Chicken]] for more information. Although prevailingly more recent preparations often prescribe the addition of raisins, with which many will be more familiar, the following recipe is based on the &quot;official&quot; recipe published in 1956, and serves 8:

==Ingredients==

* One 2.3kg / 5lb chicken, poached (you can use other pre-cooked chicken e.g. roast)
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 1 tbsp curry paste
* 1 tbsp tomato purée
* 100ml red wine
* 1 bay leaf
* The juice of half a lemon
* 4 apricot halves, finely chopped
* 300ml (half a pint) mayonnaise
* 100 ml (4 fl oz) whipping cream
* Salt and pepper
* Watercress to garnish

==Method==

* Skin the chicken if needed, and cut it into small pieces. Traditionally the chicken is cooked whole in advance, but alternatively you can use raw chicken and grill the chicken pieces at this point.
* In a small saucepan warm a small amount of vegetable oil.
* Add the onion to the pan and cook gently until soft (about 3 minutes). 
* Add the curry paste, tomato puree, wine, bay leaf and lemon juice. Simmer uncovered for about 10 mins until well reduced. Strain and leave to cool.
* Purée the chopped apricots in a blender or processor. Beat the cooled sauce into the mayonnaise with the apricot purée.
* Whip the cream to stiff peaks and fold into the mixture. 
* Season with salt and pepper, and a little lemon juice if necessary.
* Fold in the chicken pieces, garnish with watercress and serve.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==7.1 Atoms and their constituents==

===7.1.1===

The idea of Millikan's oil drop experiment was to have very small oil drops which had some charge balanced between two electric plates. By knowing the strength of the field between the plates, it was possible to calculate the amount of force being applied per charge on the drop, which, if it was floating, would be exactly the same as the force of gravity downwards. From this, it is possible to find the mass to charge ratio of the drops.

The mass of the drop was then measured by cutting the field and measuring it's terminal velocity and using stokes equation. This allowed the charges on the drops to be found, and it was found that the smallest difference between these charges was 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; C, the charge of a single electron.

===7.1.2===
If a mass is being suspended by an electric field, then mg = qE (mass x gravity = charge x electric field strength). Electric field strength can be can be expressed as &lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, (potential difference divided by distance) for calculation purposes.

===7.1.3===
The results showed that the minimum difference between charges was 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; C and so this must be the smallest unit of charge possible.

===7.1.4===
This means that charge must be quantized (only comes in discrete chunks rather than being continuous), and the quantum of charge was 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; C.

===7.1.5===
An electron gun relies on the principle of thermonic emission. There is a large PD created between two metal plates in a vacuum. The cathode (the negative one from which the electrons come) emits a bunch of electrons. They accelerate towards the anode (the positive plate), which has a hole in it, and so some of the electrons fly through and create a sort of beam of electrons (originally called a cathode ray).

===7.1.6===
Cathode rays can be deflected by both electric and magnetic fields, and act as negatively charged particles would in such fields. Both these properties can be explained by the fact that they are actually electrons.

===7.1.7===
Thompson's experiment involved using electric and magnetic fields to exactly cancel each other's effects and allow an electron to pass undeflected. The electric field is then removed and the radius of curvature is measured. The equations then simplify down to give an expression for &lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; in which all the other terms are known, and so the ratio of charge to mass could be accurately found.

===7.1.8===

By knowing the charge of an electron (Millikan) and the charge to mass ratio (Thompson) it is possible to find the mass of an electron. That makes Thompson the discoverer of the electron (hooray for him).

===7.1.9===

The alpha particle scattering experiment (by Rutherford/Geiger+Marsden) involved firing alpha particles at a sheet of very thin gold foil, and detecting where they went (with a screen).

===7.1.10===

The results of the above experiment were that the majority of alpha particles passed straight through. Of those which were deflected, many were deflected through very large angles, and even straight back at the source. This result suggested that atoms consisted mostly of empty space, with a small nucleus of high positive charge.

===7.1.11===
Rutherford's model was that around the small, highly charged nucleus, electrons orbited like planets around the sun. This created many more questions. Why didn't the electrons emit radiation and lose energy? How would they be kept in a constant orbit?

==7.2 Nuclei and their constituents==

===7.2.1===

Radioactive decay is basically atoms (or more specifically nuclei) spontaneously breaking off small parts (alpha, beta and gamma particles) of themselves. This was accidentally discovered due to the effects of these particles on photographic film which was being kept in a drawer with them.

This lead to a systematic analysis of such particles, and the elements which produced them. The three different types mentioned above were found and separated, and the effect on the atoms undergoing this process (changing elements from one type to another) was examined.

===7.2.2===

The three types of radiation were first divided by their ionising power. Rutherford later showed an alpha particle to be the nucleus of a helium atom by measuring their emission spectra. Beta particles were found to be free electrons, but emitted from the nucleus as a result of the changes which occurred in it. Gamma rays were found to be a type of very high frequency electromagnetic radiation.

===7.2.3===

The products of alpha and beta decay are quite easy to find. Simply write out and balance the nuclear equations.

&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;X -&gt; &lt;sup&gt;A-4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Z-2&lt;/sub&gt;Y + &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;He. The specific isotope represented by Y can then be determined.

===7.2.4===

Radiation tends to ionise (strip the electrons from) gases when it passes through. This fact is used for the detection of radiation with Geiger counters. (No real detailed knowledge is required here.)

===7.2.5===

&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;X : A is the mass number, the number of nucleons or whatever else you'd like to call it. I find it easiest to think of it as the number of protons + the number of neutrons. Z is the proton number, the atomic number i.e. the number of protons. To find the number of neutrons, obviously, subtract Z from A:   A - Z = Number of Neutrons.
The number of electrons is most commonly equal to the number of protons. ie, z is equal to number of protons which is equal to number of electrons: Z = P = N.

===7.2.6===
Artificial transmutation : When atoms decay, they change into different atoms, and this is called artificial transmutation. Atoms usually only lose alpha and beta particles (gamma is just a loss of energy, so not relevant here). An alpha particle is 2 protons and 2 neutrons. A beta particle is 1 negative charge, which turns a neutron into a proton in the nucleus. These facts can be put together to predict the results of nuclear equations. Transmuation also occurs when atoms of one element change into atoms of another element during fusion reactions, or during bombardment of an element with alpha particles or other small nuclear particles. An example is the bombardment of uranium by deturions to create plutonium.

===7.2.7===

Describe how the reaction between N and He led to the discovery of the proton : By bombarding nitrogen nuclei with alpha particles, Rutherford caused the ejection of hydrogen nuclei and the production of a new oxygen nucleus. As a result, the proton was discovered.

===7.2.8===

The proton is the thing in the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, and there are an increasing number in other atom's nuclei. It has the same magnitude of charge as an electron, though it is positive rather than negative.

===7.2.9===

Radioactive decay is a random process for individual atoms, but overall, a block of radioactive atoms' rate of decay is exponential, falling to zero eventually. The decay rate can not be affected by physical or chemical conditions. For a large number of atoms, the number of radioactive atoms will halve over a regular period of time, called the half life, and this results in the exponential nature.

===7.2.10===

Half life is the period of time (average, though accurate for a large number of atoms) required for the rate of decay of a radioactive sample to decrease to half its initial value. This is a constant for a given isotope.

===7.2.11===
The half life life can be determined from a graph by first taking a point on the graph, finding it's rate or decay. Calculate the rate of decay which is half of the original value, then find the point on the graph which corresponds to this half rate. The half life is the time (from the x-axis) between the two points.

===7.2.12===

The reactivity after n half lives will be Initial x (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. This equation is not in the data booklet, but is hopefully fairly obvious.

Vegetarian “Pate” Recipe  
 

For those of you that love hosting get-togethers, parties or volunteering for the latest function at your community center, you know that tasty food is central to a successful round of compliments and second helpings. One type of guest however, always seems to be left out: the vegetarian. The lone vegetarian walks toward the buffet table, glances over the leg of lamb, brisket, chicken tenders and other food items that are off his/her checklist (aside from the salad, but who wants to eat just salad at a party?). Being a considerate host, you adore your guests and want them to feel comfortable eating your dishes, so you create a type of dip just for them. My grandmother loved experimenting with different ingredients and handed down the recipe to my mother, who as it happens loves to entertain.  
 
Vegetarian “Pate” is a hearty, heart-healthy recipe that can be used as a dip or spread. Sweet peas are a good source of protein and Vitamin A, while the walnuts are jammed with omega-3 essential fatty acids which help reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. Omega-3 essential fatty acids are also said to lower the chance of blood clots in arteries and help maintain a healthy heart rhythm.  
 
Total cooking time: 8 minutes.  

Equipment: This recipe will require pot, and either a hand-held blender or food processor.  

Ingredients:  
1 can sweet peas  
1 medium onion  
1/8 teaspoon (a pinch) salt  
1/8 teaspoon (a pinch) black pepper  
1/8 teaspoon (a pinch) cumin  
¾ cup walnuts  
 
Directions:  
 
1) Sauté 1 medium onion with walnuts in a pot for about 5 minutes.  
 
2) In a different bowl, combine sweet peas, salt, black pepper and cumin together and        mix the ingredients well.  
 
3) Then, add the sweet pea mixture to the onion and walnuts and continue sautéing for about 3 more minutes.  
 
4) Turn off the heat and let cool. Puree with a hand-held blender or in food processor until you achieve a creamy, though slightly nutty texture similar to that of pate or dip.  

5) Serve with crackers, bread, baby carrots and other snack type vegetables.  
 
 
Here’s an idea. While serving the “pate” to your guests, ask them what ingredients they think are present in the dish. Tell them you mixed sprinkles, a handful of marshmallows, potato chips and pickled eggs together as a joke at first, to see if they believe you. Then, share the real ingredients and explain to them that the “pate” is actually healthy and completely animal free. Your carnivorous and vegetarian guests will surely zoom back for any occasion.

Vegan “Pate” Recipe  
 

For those of you that love hosting get-togethers, parties or volunteering for the latest function at your community center, you know that tasty food is central to a successful round of compliments and second helpings. One type of guest however, always seems to be left out: the vegetarian. The lone vegetarian walks toward the buffet table, glances over the leg of lamb, brisket, chicken tenders and other food items that are off his/her checklist (aside from the salad, but who wants to eat just salad at a party?). Being a considerate host, you adore your guests and want them to feel comfortable eating your dishes, so you create a type of dip just for them. My grandmother loved experimenting with different ingredients and handed down the recipe to my mother, who as it happens loves to entertain.

= King's Bishop Gambit Accepted =
===3.Bc4===
With this move, white develops the bishop. This move, common in the nineteenth century, is now less popular than 3. Nf3. Black has an opportunity to prevent white from castling with 3...Qh4+, but in exchange places his queen on a poor square. Alternatively, the second player can develop a piece with 3...Nf6 or play aggressively in the center and give up a pawn with 3...d5 for open lines.

      <comment>Difference between T'Size and Object'Size</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A common Ada programming mistake is to assume that specifying 'Size for a type T forces the compiler to allocate exactly this number of bits for objects of this type. This is not true. '''The specified T[[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Size|'Size]] will force the compiler to use this size for components in packed arrays and records and in Unchecked_Conversion''', but the compiler is still free to allocate more bits for stand-alone objects.

Use 'Size on the object itself to force the object to the specified value.&lt;noinclude&gt;

|Even though R has not been fully introduced yet, it is instructive to see how simple a useful R session can be. As an example, we will fit a statistical model using the cars data from the previous topic, and see how to produce a similar plot to [[:image:R-car_stopping_distances_1920+linear.svg| Figure 1.2b]], with a straight best-fit line. This is a common task in many simple analyses. 

Some of the commands in this example will be unfamiliar: don't worry, the main point is not to understand the commands, but to get an overall sense of how R works. Nevertheless, if you ''do'' want to understand the commands fully, you will need to know about [[../R/Data frames|data frames]] (essentially, tables of data with named columns) and [[../R/Model formulae|model formulae]] (essentially, a notation of the form &lt;code&gt;''a'' ~ ''b'' + ''c''&lt;/code&gt;, meaning ''a'' is predicted by ''b'' and ''c'').

|plot(dist ~ speed, data{{=}}cars)                     #A common way of creating a specific plot is via a model formula
straight.line.model &lt;- lm(dist~speed, data{{=}}cars)  #This creates and stores a model (&quot;lm&quot; means &quot;Linear Model&quot;).
abline(straight.line.model, col{{=}}&quot;red&quot;)            #&quot;abline&quot; will also plot a straight line from a model
straight.line.model                               #Show model predictions (estimated slope &amp; intercept of the line)
|&lt;nowiki&gt;&gt; plot(dist ~ speed, data=cars)                     #A common way of creating a specific plot is via a model formula
&gt; straight.line.model &lt;- lm(dist~speed, data=cars)  #This creates and stores a model (&quot;lm&quot; means &quot;Linear Model&quot;).
&gt; abline(straight.line.model, col=&quot;red&quot;)            #&quot;abline&quot; will also plot a straight line from a model
&gt; straight.line.model                               #Show model predictions (estimated slope &amp; intercept of the line)

Call:
lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)        speed  
    -17.579        3.932  

&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Note that unlike the examples in the [[../R/Graphics|graphics topic]], we have plotted the data by specifying a  [[../R/Model formulae|model formula]], rather than just giving the name of the dataset. Although in this case the resulting plot is the same as seen with &lt;code&gt;plot(cars)&lt;/code&gt;, the formula interface makes it clearer what is being plotted.

|The strength and depth of R comes from the various functions and other objects which are provided for your use. These are actually provided by a variety of separate '''packages'''. For example, Figure 1.1 is based on data from the &quot;datasets&quot; package. To use the contents of a package, it must be made available to R, then loaded into your R session. 

Some packages should always be available within R, and a number of these are automatically loaded at the start of an R session. These include the &quot;base&quot; package (which is where the &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sqrt()&lt;/code&gt; functions are defined), the &quot;utils&quot; package (which is where &lt;code&gt;RSiteSearch()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;citation()&lt;/code&gt; are defined), the &quot;graphics&quot; package (which allows plots to be generated), and the &quot;stats&quot; package (which provides a broad range of statistical functionality). In total, the default packages allow you to do a considerable  amount of statistics.

However, one of the strengths of R is the variety of additional packages that are available. Packages are, for example, which allow you to analyse genetic data, to interface to geographical information systems, for economic analysis, and so forth. To make a package available to R, you need to download it and install it somewhere on your system. There is a central place (called &quot;CRAN&quot;) from where you can download most additional packages. Once you have installed a package, you can load it into R at any time by using the &lt;code&gt;library()&lt;/code&gt; function.

|library(&quot;datasets&quot;)  #Load the already installed &quot;datasets&quot; package
cars                #Having loaded &quot;datasets&quot;, the &quot;cars&quot; object (containing a set of data) is now available

|Note that some packages require other packages to be installed in order to work properly (one package is said to &quot;depend&quot; on another). For example, &quot;vioplot&quot; requires the &quot;sm&quot; package. If these dependent packages are not installed, then you will not be able to load the original package within R. Installing a package in the manner above, by calling &lt;code&gt;install.packages()&lt;/code&gt;, should also install dependencies&lt;ref&gt;Actually, the details are slightly more complex, depending on whether there is a default location to install the packages, see &lt;code&gt;?install.packages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are several other ways of installing packages. If you start R by typing &quot;R&quot; on a unix command-line, then you can install packages by running &quot;R CMD INSTALL packagename&quot; from the command-line instead (see &lt;code&gt;?INSTALL&lt;/code&gt;). If you are running R using a graphical user interface (e.g. under Macintosh or Windows), then you can often install packages by using on-screen menus. Note that these methods may not install other, dependent packages.

{{message box|heading=You only need to read the following if you are are having problems installing packages.|message=If a package is not installed already, and you encounter problems when trying to install it (e.g. when calling &lt;code&gt;install.packages(&quot;vioplot&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;), this may be for one of the following reasons:
* R needs to know where to get the package. This normally involves downloading the package from the internet, in particular, from the CRAN archive, or one of its mirrors. You may need to call &lt;code&gt;chooseCRANmirror()&lt;/code&gt; to set this.
* You need to be able to access the selected CRAN mirror (so you need to be connected to the internet!). Note, however, that it ''is'' possible to install a local copy of a package, see the example in ?install.packages
* You need to be able to install the package somewhere where R can find it. Normally, packages are installed to a central location on your computer, but this may require administrator access. There are several ways of telling R where to install packages and where to find them: these are not covered here, but are detailed in the R FAQs.}} }}

      <text xml:space="preserve">All software has bugs, but together with your help we can get rid of them as fast as possible. One of the fastest ways to do this (and make Kdenlive better) is to make sure that the developers spend as much time as possible fixing bugs rather than trying to figure out basic details in bug reports like what the problem actually is and when it happens. When you provide this information in your bug report, you increase the chances and speed of it getting fixed for you, and free up developer time to work on the great new features that you would love!

== Where to report ==
Use [http://www.kdenlive.org/mantis/ mantis] to report problems and wishlist items.

== Content of the report ==
Here's the information that can help the most and how to provide it (it's also a good idea to include the title as well, so developers can quickly scan for the information they need):

===Description:===
OK, this is pretty obvious, but the more clear, and detailed you can make the description, the better we know what you're talking about. 

Try and use the actual names of features / menus / windows you see in the application (eg ''Project Tree, Help -&gt; About Kdenlive'').

Try to describe what you see and what you expected to see.

'''NOTE:''' Only include '''one''' issue or wishlist per report. It only takes one more click to open a second and also ensures that none of your issues get missed.

===Backtraces:===
After the description, the most useful thing you can provide is what's known as a backtrace. It's kind of like your computers description of what happened. 

* If you installed with the Builder Wizard, then when kdenlive crashes it should ask if you'd like to review the log. Just say yes and copy the text it shows (all of it) and save it with a text editor like kate or gedit. Give it a name that describes the crash and your user name in a couple of words and upload it on your bug report using the &quot;Upload files&quot; button.

* If you installed by another method, you can follow the steps [[Kdenlive/Troubleshooting#Publishing_a_gdb_trace|here]].

===Version:===
Your problem may have already been fixed, so providing the version of the software you're using is important.

* If you installed packages, name what distribution you're using with the version (eg Kubuntu 8.10, Mandriva 2008 etc) and where the packages came from. You can get the version number from the ''Help -&gt;About Kdenlive menu'' (eg 0.7).

* If you installed using the Kdenlive Builder Wizard, you'll have a folder called &quot;Bin&quot; that has your kdenlive binary that you run. Navigate to that folder in the command line (or in Dolphin and then push the f4 key), and then type:

 ./kdenlive_start --version


You'll see something that looks a bit like this:

 Kdenlive Builder Wizard version: 0.7.0
 ffmpeg: Revision: 15918 Last Changed Date: 2008-11-23 14:36:44 -0500 (Sun, 23 Nov 2008)
 mlt: Revision: 1240 Last Changed Date: 2008-11-17 00:57:32 -0500 (Mon, 17 Nov 2008)
 mlt++: Revision: 1240 Last Changed Date: 2008-11-06 00:32:23 -0500 (Thu, 06 Nov 2008)
 kdenlive: Revision: 2722 Last Changed Date: 2008-11-23 14:34:31 -0500 (Sun, 23 Nov 2008)
 Qt: 4.4.3
 KDE: 4.1.3 (KDE 4.1.3)
 Kdenlive: 0.7

Just copy the whole thing into your bug report.

===Steps to Reproduce:===
This should be a numbered, one step per number guide that could walk someone who had never used Kdenlive before through to see the same problem. EG:
# Imported clip using the &quot;Add Clip&quot; button.
# Dragged a clip from the Project Tree tab to the timeline.
# Dragged the &quot;oldfilm&quot; effect from the effect list onto the clip in the timeline.
# Press play on the project monitor tab.
# No effect appears.

===Playback / Rendering Testing:===
If you installed with the Builder Wizard or by compiling from source, and your issue has anything to do with video playback or rendering, it's also useful to see if these can be played properly by the two pieces of software Kdenlive uses.

Navigate to the bin folder where the kdenlive binary is in the command line and copy the following (replacing the path, with the path to your video file):

 ./inigo /path/to/your/video/file
and then:
 ./ffplay /path/to/your/video/file

Both of these should play your video file properly. If they don't (and even if they do) let us know this in your bug report, along with any errors you see in the command line.

== Missing user contribution ==

Although mentioning enough information for developers I cannot find information concerning contributions a user can make in order to give his support to the Aros project. This whole section is missing whilst aros.org does mention this part (http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/contribute.php). Perhaps even a short mentioning of this with a direct link to the aros.org website is a small short solution ?

In my specific case I wanted to know more about translating catalogs. I seemed to be unable to make a logical entry in this wikibook because in this special case I wanted to know if I would have to do something special concerning codepages and using aros svn in relation to the .cd files. The nighly build part of this aros bookwiki mentions using ISO8859-15 but this is not valid for every catalog file.

I therefore think it would be wise mentioning a direct link to the aros.org website (http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/translating.php) or an entry in this book explaining the procedure.

For somebody not having enough background: AFAIK one should use the language specific codepage the .cd file is created for in the first place. e.g. when making an english catalog ISO8859-15 english is the correct codepage but if the translation file is containing russian one should use the corresponding codepage used to create the file in the first place thereby omitting the requirement mentioned in the nightly build part of this wiki stating that the codepage should always be ISO8859-15.

All the above is perhaps logical and a piece of cake for the more expierenced ones but not for newbies and some clueless people (like myself).

As I am a compleet noob concerning wikibooks and especially in relation to the aros bookwiki I therefore mentioned the above in the hope somebody can confirm/dismiss the proposal and i would kindly ask for somebody more experienced in looking into this matter (e.g. dismissing my proposal or make an entry for it in the wikibook).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Acoustics}}

After drawing the electro-mechanical analogy of a mechanical system, it is always safe to check the circuit. There are two methods to accomplish this:


==Review of Circuit Solving Methods==

'''Kirchkoff's Voltage law'''

&quot;The sum of the potential drops around a loop must equal zero.&quot; 

[[Image:KVL.png‎]]

&lt;math&gt;v_1 + v_2 + v_3 + v_4 = 0 \displaystyle&lt;/math&gt;

'''Kirchkoff's Current Law'''

&quot;The Sum of the currents at a node (junction of more than two elements) must be zero&quot;

[[Image:KCL.png‎]]

&lt;math&gt; -i_1+i_2+i_3-i_4 = 0  \displaystyle&lt;/math&gt;

'''Hints for solving circuits:'''

Remember that certain elements can be combined to simplify the circuit (the combination of like elements in series and parallel)

If solving a ciruit that involves steady-state sources, use impedances. Any circuit can eventually be combined into a single impedance using the following identities:

Impedances in series: &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{eq} = Z_1 + Z_2 + \,\cdots\, + Z_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Impedances in parallel: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z_\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{1}{Z_1}  +   \frac{1}{Z_2}  + \,\cdots\, +  \frac{1}{Z_n} .&lt;/math&gt;

== Dot Method: (Valid only for planar network) ==
This method helps obtain the dual analog (one analog is the dual of the other). The steps for the dot product are as follows:
1) Place one dot within each loop and one outside all the loops. 
2) Connect the dots. Make sure that only there is only one line through each element and that no lines cross more than one element.
3) Draw in each line that crosses an element its dual element, including the source. 
4) The circuit obtained should have an equivalent behavior as the dual analog of the original electro-mechanical circuit.

'''Example:'''

[[Image:Dotmethod.jpg]]

The parallel RLC Circuit above is equivalent to a series RLC driven by an ideal current source

== Low-Frequency Limits: ==
This method looks at the behavior of the system for very large or very small values of the parameters and compares them with the expected behavior of the mechanical system. For instance, you can compare the mobility circuit behavior of a near-infinite inductance with the mechanical system behavior of a near-infinite stiffness spring.

[[File:Myoglobin and heme.png|right|thumb|Myoglobin(blue) with its ligand heme group(orange).]]
A ligand is a small molecule that is able to bind to proteins by weak interactions such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals interactions, and hydrophobic effects.  In some cases, a ligand also serves as a signal triggering molecule. A ligand can be a substrate inhibitor, activator or a neurotransmitter.

For example, oxygen is the ligand that binds to both hemoglobin and myoglobin.


'''Binding site:''' a region of the protein that is complementary to a specific molecule or ion. This site usually exhibits specificity to ligands. The weak interactions of the primary structure of protein, specifically the side chains to the ligand, usually initiates a response. The concentration at which all binding sites are bound to a ligand is termed the point of saturation. 

[[File:Hemoglobin as protein and oxygen as ligand.png|thumb| Binding site and the ligand]]

'''Induced fit''' is the concept that an enzyme is a flexible rather than a rigid entity. Interactions between the active site and substrate continually reshape the tertiary structure slightly. Instead of the substrate simply binding to the active site, the enzyme and substrate mold to induce a fit similar to that of  a lock and key. This allows the substrate to be in the precise position to enable a catalytic response. 


'''Dissociation constant:''' Kd is the tendency for a ligand to bind to a binding site. It is measured by the ratio of concentrations of the ligand and enzyme over the concentration of the Enzyme-ligand complex. It is equal to the concentration of the ligand at which the total binding sites are half occupied. Association constant is equal to the reciprocal of the dissociation constant. 

Cooperativity:
Allosterism:
Hill equation: 

A molecule, atom, or ion that is charged or neutral and of non-bonding pairs of electrons as electron donors or Lewis bases that form bond to a central metal atom or ion to be as complex ion; it is important for control of chemical reactivity of the complex of ligands and metal; monofunctional ligands are complex ions that have one non-bonding pair of electrons, polyfunctional or known as chelates, two or more. Biological ligands are mostly electron-donating groups; important one of biological system is heme that is of nitrogen donating groups and forms chelate structure.

When a ligand binds to the protein, the chemical conformation of the protein changes. The tertiary structure of the protein is altered. The conformation of the protein determines the function of the protein, as structure often denotes a lot about the function. The tendency in which the ligand binds to the protein is known as the term ''affinity''.

The binding affinity depends on the interaction of the binding site with the ligand. When the interaction of the intermolecular forces between the ligand and binding site are high, the affinity is increased. Similarly, when the intermolecular forces between the ligand and binding site are weak, the affinity is low. 

When the affinity is high for the ligand binding, the concentration of the ligand does not need to be high in order for the ligand to bind to its maximum potential. Similarly, when the affinity is low, the concentration of the ligand must be large in order for the ligand to bind properly to the binding site.

For example, ligands have an effect on biphosphoglycerate in the T-form of hemoglobin. The ligand binds to the deoxyhemoglobin cavity which decreases the oxygen affinity. Thus, it stabalizes the deoxy form of hemoglobin.

==Introduction==
A ligand is a substance that has the ability to bind to and form complexes with other biomolecules in order to perform biological processes. Essentially, it is a molecule that triggers signals and binds to the active site of a protein through intermolecular forces (ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces). The docking (association) is usually a reversible reaction (dissociation). Within biological systems, it is rare to find irreversible covalent bonds between the ligand and its target molecule. The chemical conformation is changed when the ligand bonds to its receptors. For example, the three dimensional shape of the receptor protein is change upon the binding of the ligand. Also, the conformational state of a receptor protein will cause variations in the functional state of a receptor. The strength/tendency of the ligand binding is known as affinity. Different types of ligands include substrates, inhibitors, activators, and neurotransmitters.

==Receptor/Ligand Binding Affinity==
Human cells use receptor-mediated endocytosis to take in cholesterol for use in the synthesis of membranes and as a precursor for the synthesis of other steroids. Cholesterol travels in the blood in particles called low-density lipoproteins(LDLs), complexes of lipids and proteins. These particles act as ligands hence they bind to LDL receptors on membranes and enter the cells by endocytosis. In humans with familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited disease characterized by a very high level of cholesterol in the blood, the LDL receptor proteins are defective or missing so the LDL particles cannot enter cells. Instead, cholesterol accumulates in the blood, where it contributes to early atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of lipid deposits within the walls of blood vessels, causing of the bulge inwards of vessels and impeding blood flow.


[[Image:Endocytosis_types.svg]]


''Note: These are the three types of endocytosis that the cell participates in. The third one represents the receptor-ligand binding mentioned for cholesterol in humans.''

== How Ligands Bind==
The binding of a ligand to a protein is greatly affected by the structure of the protein and is often accompanied by conformational changes. As an example, the specificity with which heme binds its various ligands changes when the heme is a component of myoglobin. When carbon monoxide binds to free heme molecules, it binds more than 20,000 times better than oxygen does, but it only binds 200 times better than oxygen when the heme is bound in myoglobin. The difference is most likely due to steric hindrance but there are other factors that have not yet been well-defined that may also affect the interaction of heme with carbon monoxide.

==Reversible Binding of Protein to Ligand==

===Oxygen-Binding Proteins===
Oxygen is poorly soluble in aqueous solutions and cannot be carried to tissues in sufficient quantity if it is only dissolved in blood serum. The diffusion of oxygen through tissues is also ineffective over distances greater than a couple of millimeters. The evolution of larger, multicelluluar animals, though, depended on the evolution of proteins that could transport and store oxygen, but none of the amino acid side chains in proteins are suited for the reversible binding of oxygen molecules. This function was filled by certain transition metals, among them being iron and copper, that have a strong tendency to bind oxygen. The multicellular organisms make use of the properties of metals, most commonly iron, for oxygen transport. However, iron promotes the formation of highly reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA and other macromolecules. Therefore, the iron used in cells is bound in forms that isolate it or make it less reactive. In order for multicellular organisms to make use of iron, especially when it must be transported over long distances, iron is incorporated into a protein-bound prosthetic group called heme. Iron in the ferrous state binds oxygen reversibly while the ferric state does not bind oxygen. Heme is found in many oxygen-transporting proteins as well as in proteins that participate in oxidation-reduction reactions. When oxygen binds to heme, the electronic properties of the heme iron change, which accounts for the change in color from the dark purple of oxygen-depleted venous blood to the bright red of oxygen-rich arterial blood. Some small molecules, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen monoxide (NO), coordinate to heme iron with greater affinity than does oxygen gas. When a molecule of carbon monoxide is bound to heme, oxygen is excluded and this is why carbon monoxide is highly toxic to aerobic organisms. By surrounding and isolating heme, oxygen-binding proteins can regulate the access of CO and other small molecules to the heme iron.

Myoglobin is a relatively simple oxygen-binding protein that is found in almost all mammals, primarily in muscle tissue. It facilitates the oxygen diffusion in muscles. Myoglobin is a single polypeptide consisted of 153 amino acid residues with one molecule of heme. It is typical of the family of proteins called globins, all of which have similar primary and tertiary structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Protein Properties: Binding Sites==

A binding site is a position on a protein that binds to an incoming molecule that is smaller in size comparatively, called ligand.

In proteins, binding sites are small pockets on the tertiary structure where ligands bind to it using weak forces (non-covalent bonding).  Only a few residues actually participate in binding the ligand while the other residues in the protein act as a framework to provide correct conformation and orientation. Most binding sites are concave, but convex and flat shapes are also found.

A ligand-binding site is a place of chemical specificity and affinity on protein that binds or forms chemical bonds with other molecules and ions or protein ligands. The affinity of the binding of a protein and a ligand is a chemically attractive force between the protein and ligand. As such, there can be competition between different ligands for the same binding site of proteins, and the chemical reaction will result in an equilibrium state between bonding and non-bonding ligands. The saturation of the binding site is defined as the total number of binding sites that are occupied by ligands per unit time. High affinity ligands have a high intermolecular force, are able to reside in the binding site longer since it has a low concentration, and cause the receptors to change.

The most common model of enzymatic binding sites is the induced fit model. It differs from the more simple &quot;Lock &amp; Key&quot; school of thought because the induced fit model states that the substrate of an enzyme does not fit perfectly into the binding site. With the &quot;lock &amp; key&quot; model, it was assumed that the substrate is a relatively static model that does not change its conformation and simply binds to the active site perfectly. According to the induced fit model, the binding site of an enzyme is complimentary to the transition state of the substrate in question, not the normal substrate state. The enzyme stabilizes this transition state by having its NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; residues stabilize the negative charge of the transition state substrate. This results in a dramatic decrease in the activation energy required to bring forth the intended reaction. The substrate is then converted to its product(s) by having the reaction go to equilibrium quicker.

==Biological Importance of Proteins==
Proteins are important in our human body. A protein is a chain of amino acids joined by peptide bonds. By understanding protein function, we can solve different problems in our body because proteins are among the main biological components. In order to understand protein functions, there will be four main ideas to study, such as: structure, binding, catalysis, and switching. However, these ideas will be much easier to understand if we know about protein binding. Protein binding has an extremely important role in biochemistry. Protein binding is often reversible and can be stable or unstable depend on the structures and the activities of it. Furthermore, that is also a reason why protein binding can be influence the drug's biological half life in our body. Indeed, many scientists try to perform experiments and research on the binding structure in order to discover diseases and how to destroy it. 

Protein binding and the fraction unbound written as the concentration of unbound drug over the total concentration of the drug, which depends on several factors. It is determined by the drug’s affinity for the protein, the concentration of the binding protein, and the concentration of the drug relative to the binding protein. 

Protein binding also is very crucial for the hemoglobin and myoglobin. Hemoglobin is involved in the transport of other gases. Also, it carries some of the body's respiratory carbon dioxide, in which CO2 is bound to the globin protein. Hemoglobin exhibits characteristics of both the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins. Hemoglobin consists mostly of protein, and these proteins, in turn, are composed of sequences of amino acids. Myoglobin is found in the muscle tissues and it was the first protein to have its three-dimensional structure revealed. Even though hemoglobin is found in the blood and myoglobin is found in the muscles, they are have a great connection with each other through functioning and deliver and transport oxygen.  



==Properties that Affect Binding==

&lt;b&gt;Complementarity&lt;/b&gt;
Molecular recognition depends on the tertiary structure of the enzyme which creates unique microenvironments in the active/binding sites. These specialized microenvironments contribute to binding site catalysis.

&lt;b&gt;Flexibility&lt;/b&gt;
Tertiary structure allows proteins to adapt to their ligands (induced fit) and is essential for the vast diversity of biochemical functions (degrees of flexibility varies by function). Flexibility is essential for biochemical function.

&lt;b&gt;Surfaces&lt;/b&gt;
Binding sites can be concave, convex, or flat. For small ligands – clefts, pockets, or cavities. Catalytic sites are often at domain and subunit interfaces. Catalytic sites often occur at domain and subunit interfaces. 

&lt;b&gt;Non-Covalent Forces&lt;/b&gt;
Non-covalent forces are also characteristic properties of binding sites. Such characteristics are: higher than average amounts of exposed hydrophobic surface, (small molecules – partly concave and hydrophobic), and displacement of water can drive binding events, and weak interaction can lead to an easy exchange for partners. 

&lt;b&gt;Affinity&lt;/b&gt;
Binding ability of the enzyme to the substrate (can be graphed as partial pressure increases of the substrate against the affinity increases).

=Enzyme Inhibitors=
==Overview==
Enzyme inhibitors are molecules or compounds that bind to enzymes and result in a decrease in their activity. An inhibitor can bind to an enzyme and stop a substrate from entering the enzyme's active site and/or prevent the enzyme from catalyzing a chemical reaction. There are two categories of inhibitors.
#irreversible inhibitors
#reversible inhibitors

Inhibitors can also be present naturally and can be involved in metabolism regulation. For example, negative feedback caused by inhibitors can help maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors include proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This is useful in eliminating harmful enzymes such as proteases and nucleases. In addition, many different man made substances are capable of inhibiting enzymes. For example, fluorinated phosphonates (i.e. sarin, VX) bind irreversibly to the enzyme cholinesterase resulting in a buildup of acetylcholine in the body. Moreover, drugs, such as MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) bind reversibly to the enzyme monoamine oxidase allowing for the accumulation of monoamine neurotransmitters, which is useful in the treatment of certain medical conditions.
nwwwwwwwwww
 competitive inhibition, the inhibitor and substrate compete for the enzyme (i.e., they can not bind at the same time).[58] Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of folic acid and this drug are shown in the figure to the right bottom. Note that binding of the inhibitor need not be to the substrate binding site (as frequently stated), if binding of the inhibitor changes the conformation of the enzyme to prevent substrate binding and vice versa. In competitive inhibition the maximal velocity of the reaction is not changed, but higher substrate concentrations are required to reach a given velocity, increasing the apparent Km.

==Irreversible Inhibitors==
Irreversible inhibitors covalently bind to an enzyme, cause chemical changes to the active sites of enzymes, and cannot be reversed. A main role of irreversible inhibitors include modifying key amino acid residues needed for enzymatic activity. They often contain reactive functional groups such as aldehydes, alkenes, or phenyl sulphonates. These electrophilic groups are able to react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts. The amino acid components are residues containing nucleophilic side chains such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups such as amino acids serine, cysteine, threonine, or tyrosine.

[[Image:Irreversible inactivation2.svg|thumb|Kinetics of Irreversible Inhibitor]]

First, irreversible inhibitors form a reversible non-covalent complex with the enzyme (EI or ESI). Then, this complex reacts to produce the covalently modified irreversible comple EI*. The rate at which EI* is formed is called the inactivation rate or kinact. Binding of irreversible inhibitors can be prevented by competition with either substrate or a second, reversible inhibitor since formation of EI may compete with ES.

[[Image:DFMO mechanism.png|thumb|Example of a reversible inhibitor forming an irreversible product.]]

In addition, some reversible inhibitors can form irreversible products by binding so tightly to their target enzyme. These tightly-binding inhibitors show kinetics similar to covalent irreversible inhibitors. As shown in the figure, these inhibitors rapidly bind to the enzyme in a low-affinity EI complex and then undergoes a slower rearrangement to a very tightly bound EI* complex. This kinetic behavior is called slow-binding. Slow-binding often involves a conformational change as the enzyme &quot;clams down&quot; around the inhibitor molecule. It changes shape slightly to accommodate the substrate enough to allow the reaction to kinetically proceed forward. Some examples of these slow-binding inhibitors include important drugs such as methotrexate and allopurinol.

'''Group Specific Reagents'''

Group specific reagents inactivate an enzyme by reacting with a certain side chain on an amino acid. One example is Iodoacetamide reacting with a cysteine side chain to completely inactivate the enzyme and creating I- and H+ ions along the way. Another example is diisopropylphophofluoridate (DIPF)inactivating enzymes by reacting with a crucial serine side chain in acetylchloinesterase.

'''Reactive Substrate Analogs (Affinity Labels)'''

Affinity labels are specific to the binding site on the enzyme. They covalently bind to active-sites in place of the substrate and thus modify a crucial side-chain and inhibit the activity of the enzyme. For example, bromoacetol phosphate binds to triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) at its active site. The covalent bonding inhibits the enzymatic activity since the active side chain (i.e. glutamic acid) is not active. 

'''Mechanism Based Inhibitors (Suicide Inhibitors)'''

Mechanism based inhibitors affect the enzyme after the initial substrate has already been bound to an enzyme and has undergone a normal catalytic mechanism. The catalysis generally generates an intermediate that covalently inhibits the enzyme.

==Reversible Inhibitors==
Reversible inhibitors bind non-covalently to enzymes. Many different types of inhibitions can occur depending on the structure of the enzyme the inhibitors bind to. The non-covalent interactions between the inhibitors and enzymes include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and ionic bonds. Many of these weak bonds combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to substrates and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors generally do not undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or dialysis.

There are three kinds of reversible inhibitors: 

1) competitive

2) mixed

3) uncompetitive/mixed 

*'''Competitive inhibitors''', as the name suggests, compete with substrates to bind to the enzyme at the same time. The inhibitor has an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds to. This type of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentrations of substrate in order to overcome the inhibitor. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the substrate. These inhibitors increase the K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.[[File: competitive inhibitor.docx]]


Oxyanion hole stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate. It is formed by hydrogen bonds linking peptide NH groups to the negatively charged oxygen atom.
Step 3: Instability of the negative charge on the substrate carbonyl oxygen when will leads to collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate, re-formation of a double bond with carbon which breaks the peptide bond between the carbon and amino acid group. The amino leaving group is protonated by His57, facilitating its displacement.
Step 4: The amine component is departed from the enzyme (metabolized by the body) and this completes the first stage (acylation of enzyme). The first product is been made.
Step 5: A water molecule is added.
Step 6: An incoming water molecule is deprotonated by acid-base catalysis, generating a strongly nucleophilic hydroxide ion. Attack of hydroxide on the ester linkage of the acylenzyme generates a second tetrahedral intermediate.
Step 7: collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate form the second product, a carboxylate anion, and displace Ser195.
Step 8: The carboxylic acid is released and the enzyme is reformed to catalyze the next reaction.

*'''Uncompetitive inhibitors''' bind to the enzyme at the same time as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice-versa. This type of inhibition cannot be overcome, but can be reduced by increasing the concentrations of substrate. The inhibitor usually follows an allosteric effect where it binds to a different site on the enzyme than the substrate. This binding to an allosteric site changes the conformation of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced. These inhibitors lower the K &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;and V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.[[File:uncompetitive inhibition.docx]]

*'''mixed inhibition&quot;&quot; the inhibitors can bind to the enzyme at the same time as the enzyme substrate. If the concentrate of substrates is higher than the inhibitor, then this type of inhibition can be reduced.[[File:mixed inhibition.docx]]

*Uncompetitive inhibitors are able to bind to both E and ES, but their affinities for these two forms of the enzyme are different. Therefore, these inhibitors increase Km and decrease Vmax because they interfere with substrate binding and hamper catalysis in the ES complex.

*Non-competitive inhibitors have identical affinities for E and ES. They do not change Km, but decreases Vmax.

      <comment>/* Heme D */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Red blood cells, or erythrocytes are by far the most numerous blood cells. Each red blood cell contains hemoglobin which is the iron-containing protein that transports oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body. In hemoglobin, each subunit contains a heme group; each heme group contains an iron atom that is able to bind to one oxygen molecules. Since hemoglobin consists of four polypeptide subunits, two alpha chains and two beta chains, and each subunit contains a heme group; each hemoglobin protein can bind up to four oxygen molecules. 
== General information ==
[[File:Jheme.gif‎|thumb|alt=heme group|Heme Group]]
The [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Prosthetic Group|prosthetic group]] consists of an iron atom in the center of a protoporphyrin which is composed of four pyrrole rings that are linked together by a methane bridge, four methyl groups, two vinyl groups and two propinoic acid side chains. Each pyrrole ring consists of one methyl group. Two of the pyrrole rings have a vinyl group side chain, while the other two rings have a propionate group independently. Heme proteins have some iron-porphyrins such as heme a, heme b, heme c, heme d, heme d1, heme o, etc. They are constituted by tetrapyrrole rings but differ in substituents. For example, heme o contain methyl group while heme a contain methyl group, the rest structure are similar between two groups. The difference between hemes assigned each of them different functions. 

Heme of [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] protein is a [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Prosthetic Group|prosthetic group]] of heterocyclic ring of porphyrin of an iron atom; the biological function of the group is for delivering oxygen to body tissues, such that bonding of ligand of gas molecules to the iron atom of the protein group changes the structure of the protein by amino acid group of histidine residue around the heme molecule.  A holoenzyme is defined to be an enzyme with its [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Prosthetic Group|prosthetic group]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Coenzymes|coenzyme]], its [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Cofactors|cofactor]], etc. Therefore an example of a holoenzyme is [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] with its iron-containing heme group.

[[File:heme2.jpg|300px|cneter|thumb|]]

===Heme A===
Heme A is a bimolecular heme that is made up of of macrocyclic ligand called a porphyrin, chelating an iron atom. Heme A differs from Heme B in that it contains a methyl side chain at a ring position that is oxidized to a formyl group and hydroxyethyfarnesyl group. Moreover, the iron tetrapyrrole heme will be attached to a vinyl side and an isoprenoid chain. Heme A is known to be relatively comparable to Heme O since both include farnesyl.

===Heme B===
Heme B is present in hemogoblin and mygogoblin. Typically, heme B is binded to apoprotein, a protein matrix executed with a single coordination bond between the heme iron and amino-acid side-chain.

The iron contained in heme B is bounded to four nitrogens of the porphyrin and one electron donating atom of the protein, which puts it in a pentacoordinate state. The iron turns into a hexacoordinate when carbon monoxide is bounded.

===Heme C===
Heme C differs from heme B in that the two vinyl side from the heme B are substituted with a covalently thioether linkage with the apoprotein. Because of this connection, heme C has difficulty dissociating from holoprotein and cytochrome c.

Heme C functions a crucial role in apoptosis because some molecules of cytoplasmic cytochrome c must contain heme C. As a consequence, this will lead to cell destruction.

===Heme D===
Heme D is another form of heme B. Instead, the hydroxylated propionic acid side chain forms a gamma-spirolactone. Heme D reduces oxygen in water of bacteria with a low oxygen tension.

==Coordination==
Heme is a porphyrin that is coordinated with Fe(II). One of the most important classes of chelating agents in nature are the porphyrins &lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;Campbell&quot;&gt;Biology, Eight Edition,Pearson, Benjamin Cummings, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;.  A porphyrin molecule can coordinate to a metal using the four nitrogen atoms as electron-pair donors. In the body, the iron in the heme is coordinates to the four nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin and also to a nitrogen atom from a histidine residue, one of the amino-acid residues in hemoglobin) of the hemoglobin proteins. The sixth protein, coordination site, around the iron of the heme is occupied by O2 when the hemoglobin is oxygenated. The heme group is nonplanar when it is not bound to oxygen &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. The iron is pulled out of the plane of the porphyrin, toward the histidine residue to which it is attached. This nonplanar configuration is characteristic of the deoxygenated heme group, and is often referred to as being &quot;domed shape&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. When the Fe heme group binds to an oxygen molecule, the porphyrin ring adopts a planar configuration and hence the Fe lies in the plane of the porphyrin ring &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. 
[[File:oxydeoxy.gif|500px|Oxygenated and deoxygenated conformation of Hemoglobin]]

As may be seen in the figure, the left shows representations of electron-density clouds of the de-oxygenated heme group, depicted in pink, and the attached histidine residue which may be seen in light blue &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. These regions of electron density repel each other, and the iron atom in the center is drawn out of the plane. They non planar shape of the heme group is represented by the bent line. The right image depicts the electron-density clouds of the oxygenated heme group, shown in pink, the attached histidine residue in light blue, and the attached oxygen molecule which is shown in gray &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. The oxygenated heme assumes a planar configuration, and the central iron atom occupies a space in the plane of the heme group which is depicted by a straight red line &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;.

==Heme Group Shape==
The shape change in the heme group also has important implications for the rest of the hemoglobin protein. When the iron atom moves into the porphyrin plane upon oxygenation, the histidine residue to which the iron atoms is attached to is drawn closer to the heme group. This movement of the histidine residue then shifts the position of other amino acids that are near the histidine &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. When the amino acids in a protein are shifted in this manner by the oxygenation of one of the heme groups in the protein, the structure of the interfaces between the four subunits is altered &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. So when a single heme group in the hemoglobin protein becomes oxygenated, the whole protein changes its shape &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. In the new shape, it is easier for the other three heme groups to become oxygenated. The binding of one molecule of oxygen to hemoglobin enhances the ability of hemoglobin to bind more oxygen molecules. This property of hemoglobin is known as &quot;cooperative binding&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;.

== Association Constant ==

Association constant is the constant at which the bonding affinity between two different molecules, the substrate and the product, is at stable equilibrium. An example of such a bonding constant occurs in the hapten-antibody interaction.

== Dissociation Constant ==

Dissociation constant is the quantifiable constant in which a compound, molecule, or ion dissociates. A type of dissociation constant is acid dissociation constant. This constant is used to calculate the occurrence of a weak and strong acid dissociation.

== Function ==
The Heme group gives [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Heme group/Myoglobin|myoglobin]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] the ability to bind oxygen because of the presence of iron atom. It also contributes to the red color found in muscles and blood. Each heme group contains an iron atom that is able to bind to one oxygen (O2) molecule. Each [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] protein can bind four oxygen molecules. The iron atom, usually in the ferrous oxidation state (Fe&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;2+&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), lies between four pyrrole rings but slightly bends away from the plane (0.4 Angstrom from the plane). The iron ion has two extra binding sites called the fifth and sixth coordination sites on each side of the protoporphyrin plane. Usually, the fifth coordination binds with proximal histidine where the sixth coordination binds to an oxygen. When oxygen binds to iron, the iron becomes slightly smaller allowing it to move into the plane of the porphyrin ring. A distal histidine binds to oxygen to make sure reactive oxygen is not released. The distal histidine will not allow the release of oxygen when the Iron is in the 3+ state.

[[File:Hememovie.gif|500px|Crystal structure of apo heme oxygenase-1]]

== Mechanistic Functionality ==
The Iron atom is too large in size to fit perfectly inside the porphyrin ring, and sits outside the ring by 0.4 Angstroms. However, upon binding oxygen, the Iron radius shrinks, facilitating a planar alignment with the porphyrin ring. This change causes the proximal histidine bound the Fe atom to be pulled up and cause a structural change to the alpha helix attached to the histidine residue. This alpha helix's carboxyl terminus interacts with the other alpha-beta dimer, creating a total conformational change in the overall protein. The conformational change facilitates an increased affinity for oxygen, which is shown by a transformation from the T to R state in [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]]. The changes that occur in blood upon oxygenation and deoxygenation are visible not only at the microscopic level but also at the macroscopic level. It has been known that blood in the systemic arteries is red-colored while blood in the systemic veins is blue. The blood in the systemic arteries is oxygen-rich, having just traveled from the lungs to the heart and then being pumped throughout the body to deliver its oxygen to the body's cells &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. The blood in the systemic veins, on the other hand, is oxygen-poor. It has unloaded its oxygen to the body’s cells and must now return to the lungs to replenish the supply of oxygen &lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;/&gt;. Hence, a simple macroscopic observation such as noting the color of the blood, can tell us whether the blood is oxygenated or deoxygenated.

'''Induced fit''' indicates a continuous change in the conformation and shape of an enzyme in response to substrate binding. This makes the enzyme catalytic which results in the lowering of the activation energy barrier causing an increase in the overall rate of the reaction. In other words, when a substrate binds to an enzyme, it will change the conformation of the enzyme. This forms a transitional intermediate which lowers the activation energy and allows the reactants to proceed towards the product at a faster rate. In the case of macromolecules (e.g. proteins), induced fit shows the changes in the shape of a macromolecule in response to a ligand binding so that the binding site of macromolecule conforms more efficiently to the shape of the ligand. The enzyme will change its shape until it is completely complementary to a substrate to activate the enzyme-substrate complex.

As the Enzyme-substrate complex is formed, free energy is released from the formation of the many weak interactions between the enzyme-substrate complex.  The free energy that is released is called binding energy and it is maximized only when the &quot;correct&quot; substrate binds to the corresponding specific enzyme. To maximize the release of free energy, the substrate has to be in its transition state.  When this happens, the Enzyme-substrate complex becomes a catalyst, which then makes other activation energies lower.

Of enzyme, the active site is the binding site for catalytic and inhibition reaction of enzyme and substrate; structure of active site and its chemical characteristic are of specificity for binding of substrate and enzyme. Two theories for the ways in which enzyme binds to substrate are lock-and-key model and induced fit model; induced fit is the model such that structure of active site of enzyme can be easily changed after binding of enzyme and substrate.

[[File:Induced fit.jpg|thumb|An illustration of an induced fit interaction between substrates and enzymes]]

The induced fit model describes the formation of the E-S complex as a result of the interaction between the  substrate and a flexible active site.  The substrate produces changes in the conformation on the enzyme, aligning properly the groups in the enzyme. It allows  better binding and catalytic effects. 

This model opposes to the lock and key model that explains the formation of the E-S complex as a result of the binding of complementary geometrical rigid structures, as a lock and a key. The concerted model and the sequential model are models used to explain the allosteric changes of conformation of an enzyme from the T structure to the R structure and vice versa. In the concerted model all the subunits that form the allosteric protein change conformation at once, while in the sequential model the change in conformation of one subunit favors the change in conformation of the other subunits.
 
The '''Michaelis Menten model''' is related to the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions, and describes the relationship between the concentration of substrate and enzyme velocity in a reaction assuming that no allosteric effects exist.

Adenylate kinase is a good example of induced fit. This enzyme functions by slightly changing conformation when both the necessary substrate, ATP and NMP are bound. When both ATP and NMP are bound to this kinase a part of this enzyme called the P-loop moves down and forms a lid over the two groups, this in turns helps to hold the two substrate closer together in order to more easily carry out the reaction of transferring a phosphate group from ATP to NMP. This holds the phosphate group of ATP to a closer proximity to NMP, this also holds the two substrate in the proper orientation. This conformational change helps to carry out the reaction more efficiently by placing the substrate in the right position and closer to each other. We see that this enzyme functions through an induced fit, as the substrate bind the conformation of the enzyme slightly changes in order to better interact with the substrate. When Both substrate are bound various conformational changes occurs, this ensures that the reaction only proceeds when both substrate are present and this eliminates any unnecessary transfer of a phosphate group to water if the NMP is not present.

== Impact ==
There are 4 types of catalysis mechanisms that occur after the substrate is bound to an enzyme, causing formation of a transition-state complex and the product: 

1. '''Catalysis by Bond Strain''': The new arrangement occurs in the binding of the substrate and the enzyme to ultimate bind together in order to form a strained substrate bond. Such binding will rapid the formation of transition-state. However, the final conformation is not allowed for bulky group and substrate atoms.

2.'''Catalysis by Proximity and Orientation''': Enzyme-substrate interactions shows a clear direction to the reactive groups and make them close to one another. The inducing strains are also reactive which play an important role in the catalysis.

3.'''Cataylsis Involving Acids and Bases''': The strain mechanism makes amino acid act as an acid or base to complete the catalysis reaction. Acid is proton donor, and based is proton acceptor.

4.'''Covalent Catalysis''': Since the substrate is directed to the active site of an enzyme, a covalent bond forms between the substrate and the enzyme. Example: Proteolysis by serine protease is a reaction when proteases have a serine active site that forms a covalent bond between the alkoxyl group of serine and carbonyl carbon of the peptide.

== Interfacing ==

Ada is one of the few languages where interfacing is part of the language standard. The programmer can interface with other programming languages, or with the hardware.

== Other programming languages ==

The language standard defines the interfaces for [[C Programming|C]], [[COBOL|Cobol]] and [[Programming:Fortran|Fortran]]. Of course any implementation might define further interfaces &amp;mdash; [[Ada Programming/GNAT|GNAT]] for example defines an interface to [[C++ Programming|C++]].

Interfacing with other languages is actually provided by pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Export|Export]], [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Import|Import]] and [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Convention|Convention]].

== Hardware devices ==

Embedded programmers usually have to write device drivers. Ada provides extensive support for interfacing with hardware, like using [[Ada Programming/Representation clauses|representation clauses]] to specify the exact representation of types used by the hardware, or standard interrupt handling for writing [[w:Interrupt service routine|Interrupt service routine]]s.

== Introduction ==

Each project should follow a specific [[w:coding standard|coding standard]] to ease readability and maintenance of the source code, and reduce the insertion of errors. Depending on the requirements of the project, a set of guidelines can help to achieve the desired level of performance, portability, code complexity...

There are many [[w:Ada Semantic Interface Specification|ASIS]] tools that can be used to check automatically the adherence of Ada source code to the guidelines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a set of web services based on the National Information Exchange Model.

== Process ==
We will import the core NIEM data as an XML Schema.

To do this first download the NIEM data model from the NIEM.gov web site.  Inside the zip file you will find a niem-core directory with a niem-core.xsd file.  Add this to your database and run the following XQuery on it:

== Sample Code ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xml media-type=text/xml indent=yes&quot;;

let $doc := '/db/niem/data/niem-core.xsd'

return
&lt;results&gt;{
      for $type in doc($doc)//xs:complexType
      return
          &lt;type&gt;{substring-before(data($type/@name), 'Type')}&lt;/type&gt;
}&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This will return a list of all the NIEM complex types.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The source-filter theory (Fant 1960) hypothesizes that an acoustic speech signal can be seen as a source signal, filtered with the resonances in the cavities of the vocal tract downstream from the glottis or the constriction. This simple model for speech synthesis is based on a assumption that the dynamics of the system is linear and separable into three main blocks: a glottal energy (source), the vocal tract (filter) and the effect of modeling radiation sound that are independent(figure1).

The glottal source roughly matches the subglottal systems, while vocal tract (VT) corresponds to the supra-glottal system. The radiation block can be considered as a converter, which converts volume velocity in to acoustic pressure.In general, the radiation characteristic R(f) and the spectrum envelop of the source function S(f) for the glottal source are smooth and monotonic functions of frequency. The transfer function T(f), however, is usually characterized by several peaks corresponding to resonances of the acoustic cavities that form the vocal tract. Manipulating the shape of these cavities results in the positions and amplitudes of the peaks. Figure () qualitatively shows the configuration of vocal tract corresponding to a vowel. The forms of the source spectrum S(f), the transfer function T(f), the radiation characteristic R(f), and the sound pressure pr(f) is shown in each case. 

The transfer function T(f) is determined by applying the theory of sound propagation in tubes of arbitrary shape. For frequencies up to 5000 Hz, the cross dimensions of vocal tract are less than a wavelength of the sound. Therefore, the sound propagation can be considered as plane waves parallel to the axis of the tube and the vocal tract can be viewed as an acoustic tube of varying diameter.

== Vocal tract transfer function ==
The vocal tract is approximated as an acoustic tube of a given length composed of a number of sections with different section areas. This is equivalent to the modeling of the sampled vocal tract transfer function (H(z)) as a superposition of a given number of spectral poles and zeros , which in spectral domain can be represented by


Where K is constant, sa,sb,..are the zeros of T(s), s1,s2,... are the poles. for this equation, the poles and zeros mostly occur in complex conjugate pairs, and the real parts of these complex frequencies are much less than the imaginary parts which means that the peak energy lost in one cycle is much less than the energy stored in one cycle of the oscillation. Therefore, the poles of T(s) can be expressed as below:

Where Kp is a constant and the stars indicate complex conjugates. Natural frequencies of vocal tract are represented by poles and the imaginary parts indicate formant frequencies which refers to frequencies at which oscillations happen in the absence of excitation[reference]. In the other words, depending on the shape of the acoustic tube (mainly influenced by tongue position), a sound wave traveling through it will be reflected in a certain way so that interferences will generate resonances at certain frequencies. These resonances are called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant formants] . Their location largely determines the speech sound that is heard.

'''CXS''', or '''Conlang X-SAMPA''', is an encoding of the International Phonetic Alphabet into 7-bit ASCII.  CXS is a slightly modifed form of X-SAMPA, an encoding proposed in 1995 by a British phonetician, John C. Wells; the modifications have been devised by and for the members of the CONLANG mailing list &amp;mdash; whose name gave rise to the word ''conlang'' used in this book, and thus indirectly to all the other uses of prefix ''con-'' in the Conworld series of wikibooks.

== Sounds ==

Click on the name of a sound in these tables to hear the sound.  If a sound isn't available here, its name is shown in &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;.  If the sound files don't play on your computer, see [[w:Wikipedia:Media help]].

You may notice that many of the red links have long names.  A design priority for the CXS encoding is to give the shortest names to the most commonly encoded sounds &amp;mdash; which means that the most unusual sounds, most likely not to have sound files available here, are also most likely to have longer names.

=== Consonant sounds ===

In the table of pulmonic consonants, for each place and manner of articulation (column and row), there may be an unvoiced consonant and a voiced consonant.  Unvoiced consonants appear on the left side of that cell in the table, voiced consonants on the right.

== Diacritics and suprasegmentals ==

A diacritic is a modifier added to a sound symbol to either alter or more specifically describe the sound.  In CXS, all diacritics are suffixes after the symbol.  All but four of the CXS diacritics are sequences of two or more characters starting with underscore (the other four being the single-character diacritics '''{{CXS|~}}''' '''{{CXS|{{=}}}}''' '''{{CXS|;}}''' and '''{{CXS|`}}''').

A suprasegmental is a symbol that describes a feature of language sound above the level of consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, or stress.

Some conlangers use '''{{CXS|_j}}''' for palatalization instead of '''{{CXS|;}}'''.
&lt;!--
Here are some non-conlanger-specific notes, that might eventually be worked in here or later.

Voiced diacritic with a voiced consonant (such as /{{CXS|d_v}}/) may be used to indicate ''stiff'' voice, a slighly narrower glottal opening than modal voice (modal voice = ordinary voicing) but not as narrow as creaky voice.

Voiceless diacritic with an unvoiced consonant (such as /{{CXS|d_o}}/) may be used to indicate ''slack'' voice (a.k.a. ''lax'' voice), a slightly wider glottal opening than modal voice but not as wide as breathy voice.

Some people use the breathy voice diacritic instead of the aspirated diacritic.

Some conlangers use '''{{CXS|&quot;}}''' for primary stress and '''{{CXS|%}}''' for secondary stress, instead of '''{{CXS|'}}''' and '''{{CXS|,}}'''.&lt;!--  ('''{{CXS|&quot;}}''' and '''{{CXS|%}}''' are used in X-SAMPA, '''{{CXS|'}}''' and '''{{CXS|,}}''' are closer to the IPA symbols.)--&gt;

== Data tables ==

Here are tables of detailed data on CXS symbols and other notations, arranged alphabetically by CXS coding.  The tables include translations of each notation to IPA; descriptions of the notations' meanings, with links to associated Wikipedia articles; and examples of words using the notations.

For high-level explanations, and charts arranged by how the sounds are pronounced, see the [[{{FULLPAGENAME}}#Comparison between CXS and IPA|next section]].

=== Sounds ===
These sequences represent sounds.  All CXS sequences starting with a letter or digit are here.
{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/CXS table |uppercase=1|lowercase=1|digit=1|special=1}}

=== Diacritics and suprasegmentals ===
These notations represent diacritics and other information (suprasegmentals).  They are ordered by ''primary character'' &amp;mdash; which is often the first character in the sequence, but is the second character if the sequence begins with an underscore (such as {{CXS|_F}}) or is an angle-bracketed letter (such as {{CXS|&amp;lt;F&amp;gt;}}).  Letters are listed first, then digits, then non-alphanumerics.
{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/CXS table |nonsymbol=1 }}

== Comparison between CXS and IPA ==

IPA symbols that are ordinary lower-case letters are the same in CXS as in the IPA, and vice versa. 

CXS uses a following backslash as an escape character to create a new symbol.  Often the new symbol is similar to the old in some way or other, as with the velar nasal '''{{CXS|N}}''' and uvular nasal '''{{CXS|N\}}''', but sometimes they have nothing to do with each other, as with the open-mid back rounded vowel '''{{CXS|O}}''' versus the bilabial click '''{{CXS|O\}}'''.

IPA consonant symbols that are ordinary (small) upper-case letters are named in CXS by adding a backslash to the IPA symbol.  IPA vowel symbols of this type (ordinary upper-case letters) are the same in CXS as in the IPA (no backslash added).

Alternative notation '''{{CXS|v\}}''' can be used for '''{{CXS|P}}''' (the labiodental approximant).
&lt;!--

Comment here on which of these IPA symbols are unofficial.  Here's a list of the CXS names whose IPA equivalents had to be worked out because they don't have ''dedicated official'' IPA symbols, but some of them are constructed from official IPA elements even though they aren't dedicated symbols.  There may also be yet another class of names to list, the ones that don't have official CXS names, and there is also the matter of lack of congruence between the CXS and IPA names.

CXS names that don't have dedicated official IPA symbols: '''{{CXS|r`r)}}''' '''{{CXS|&gt;\:}}''' '''{{CXS|v_X_+}}''' '''{{CXS|v_X}}''' '''{{CXS|&gt;\_X}}''' '''{{CXS|K;}}''' '''{{CXS|L_0_r}}''' '''{{CXS|L\_0_r}}''' and '''{{CXS|l\`}}'''.  The labiodental flap now has an IPA symbol, but the symbol for it isn't available yet (maybe a unicode thing?); the ad hoc IPA notation for it is used, but the ad hoc IPA notation for the bilabial flap is ''not'' used, because the recent addition of the labiodental flap has an associated recommentation to use the advanced diacritic on it for the bilabial flap.

Some conlangers use '''{{CXS|_j}}''' for palatalization instead of '''{{CXS|;}}'''.
&lt;!--
Here are some non-conlanger-specific notes, that might eventually be worked in here or later.

Voiced diacritic with a voiced consonant (such as /{{CXS|d_v}}/) may be used to indicate ''stiff'' voice, a slighly narrower glottal opening than modal voice (modal voice = ordinary voicing) but not as narrow as creaky voice.

Voiceless diacritic with an unvoiced consonant (such as /{{CXS|d_o}}/) may be used to indicate ''slack'' voice (a.k.a. ''lax'' voice), a slightly wider glottal opening than modal voice but not as wide as breathy voice.

Some people use the breathy voice diacritic instead of the aspirated diacritic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page walks you through the steps required to setup a usable Clojure environment. You will:
# Install Clojure
# Install several standard enhancements to Clojure
# Configure Clojure for use with an IDE or text editor

Once these steps are complete, you'll be ready to start coding.

== Installation ==
To give Clojure a test drive, without having to perform an installation, point your (reasonably up-to-date) web browser to http://www.try-clojure.org/.  There, you can interact with a REPL (read-eval-print loop) to get a feel for Clojure's interactive environment.

To move beyond baby steps, you will need your own installation.  The following sections provide installation instructions for various systems. In addition, check out the official Getting Started page on the Clojure wiki: http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started

The easiest way to start with Clojure is to just download ClojureW from here:
http://bitbucket.org/kasim/clojurew/get/tip.zip
Just unzip it to your directory of choice and in that directory, run:
     clojurew/bin/clj

For platform specific installation, please follow below instruction:

=== Windows ===
The easiest installation option for Windows users is [https://github.com/devinus/clojure-box ''Clojure Box''].  A video installation guide for ''Clojure Box'' is available at http://vimeo.com/9219062.
Note: Clojure Box is not maintained anymore and last version support Clojure 1.2, it doesn't support 1.3 very well 2012-02-17

An up-to-date alternative is [http://lispcabinet.sourceforge.net/ ''Lisp Cabinet''], which supports Clojure up to at least 1.5.1. 2013-06-04

=== Mac OS X ===

==== Using MacPorts ====
Users running Mac OS X can install Clojure automatically using MacPorts. If MacPorts is not already installed, first go to [http://www.macports.org macports.org] and follow the directions there to install it. 

Once MacPorts is installed, Clojure can be installed by issuing the command 
    
    sudo port install clojure +rlwrap

The &quot;+rlwrap&quot; part of the command can be left off (or changed to &quot;+readline), but it is recommended, since it will include JLine and rlwrap for better history support in the REPL. Once Clojure has been installed with MacPorts, you can enter the REPL with the command 

    clj

or run a script with 

    clj myscript.clj

If Clojure is installed this way, the steps below related to creating a &quot;clj&quot; script and enhancing the REPL with JLine or rlwrap do not need to be performed.

'''Note:''' There are reports as of 2010-12-11 of the &lt;code&gt;leiningen&lt;/code&gt; MacPort being broken; use the instructions on the Leiningen website instead. As of 2011-12-17, the &lt;code&gt;leiningen&lt;/code&gt; MacPort appears to be working.

==== Using Homebrew ====
You can also use homebrew for easy installation of Clojure. To install Clojure through homebrew, first download homebrew through the homebrew webpage at [http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/] and install it following the guide there.

Once installed you can install Clojure through using the command:

    brew install clojure

No sudo required. To enter the REPL just write &quot;clj&quot; into the terminal.

=== Debian GNU/Linux and Derivatives ===
On Debian-based systems, the easiest way to install Clojure is to run:

    sudo apt-get install clojure1.2

This installs the Clojure jar with a bash script to make command-line invocation easier.  The access for this is a little different from other methods.  To run a Clojure script just call:

    clojure script-name.clj arguments to script

Invoking without script name and arguments opens the REPL.

'''Note''': This installs version 1.0.  To install a newer version of Clojure, you must use one of the following methods:

=== Installing a JAR ===
On systems that don't support apt-get or if you need a version newer than 1.0, the easiest way to start with Clojure is to download the zip file available [http://clojure.org/downloads here]. However, Clojure is under active development, and you may want to download and build from source.

=== Installation from Source ===
You need Git to download the latest source code.  To compile you need the Java Development Kit (javac) and either Maven (mvn) or Ant (ant). The examples below use ant to run the build, but mvn may be used in its place.

You can download the latest code using:

    git clone git://github.com/clojure/clojure.git

Then to compile using Ant:

    cd clojure
    ant

or with Maven:

    cd clojure
    mvn package -DskipTests

=== Additional Installation Options ===
There are currently many pre-packaged options available for installing Clojure, including:
; [http://github.com/liebke/cljr Cljr] : Provides a Clojure REPL and package manager.
; [http://github.com/russolsen/dejour Dejour] : Package consisting of: Clojure, clojure-contrib, JLine, and a startup script.
; [http://github.com/relevance/labrepl labrepl] : Web application package containg multiple libraries as well as exercises.
; [https://github.com/citizen428/ClojureX ClojureX] : Includes Clojure, clojure-contrib, JLine, and a very full-featured startup script (this was unmainted for a while but is under active development again since 04/2011).

=== Running Clojure ===

==== With version 1.6.0 ====
you start a clojure REPL with
    java -cp clojure-1.6.0.jar clojure.main
or
    java -jar clojure-1.6.0.jar

To get out of it, press 
*'''Ctrl+C''' on Windows
*'''Ctrl+D''' on UNIX, Linux and Mac OS X
or type: 
    (System/exit 0)

For more usage options:
    java -cp clojure-1.6.0.jar clojure.main --help


If you get errors use &quot;-cp ./clojure-1.3.0.jar&quot; or put the current directory &quot;.&quot; into your CLASSPATH.

==== With old versions up to 1.2.1 ====
you start the eval loop with
    java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main
or
    java -jar clojure.jar
and you get the usage options with
    java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main --help

==Enhancing the Environment ==
In this section we explain how to install some standard enhancements to Clojure.  
You can either use rlwrap or JLine with the Clojure REPL to get functionality, like being able to press the up arrow to retrieve the previous command.

=== Enhancing Clojure REPL with JLine ===

[http://jline.sourceforge.net/downloads.html Download JLine]. 

There is some problem with jline 1.0 on ubuntu and some version of OSX where the retrieving the previous line will not take into account the offset created by the prompt
So jline 0.9.94 is preferred. Copy the jar into the clojure directory. Then you can run:

    java -cp jline-VERSION.jar:clojure.jar jline.ConsoleRunner clojure.main

If you are on Ubuntu, you can install the JLine library like so:
    
    sudo apt-get install libjline-java libjline-java-doc

Run 'dpkg -L libjline-java' to check the name of the library. On Ubuntu 8.0.4 you'll see something like this:

    $ dpkg -L libjline-java
    /.
    /usr/share/java
    /usr/share/java/jline-VERSION.jar

Then run:

     java -cp /usr/share/java/jline-VERSION.jar:clojure.jar jline.ConsoleRunner clojure.main

If you want to run a script from the command line:

    echo '(println &quot;Hello, World&quot;)' &gt; hello-world.clj
    java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main hello-world.clj

=== Create clj Script===
A clj script is a convenient script to launch your clojure applications.  Each of the recipes below depends on the jline library being installed.

==== Unix ====

There is a bash script [http://github.com/richhickey/clojure-contrib/blob/master/launchers/bash/clj-env-dir included in Contrib].

==== Windows ====

For Windows users, here's the suggested clj.bat BATCH file:
&lt;source lang=dos&gt;
    :: Setup:
    :: 
    :: 1. Change the constants to match your paths
    :: 2. Put this clj.bat file on your PATH
    ::
    :: Usage:
    ::
    :: clj                           # Starts REPL
    :: clj my_script.clj             # Runs the script
    :: clj my_script.clj arg1 arg2   # Runs the script with arguments

    @echo off

    :: Change the following to match your paths
    set CLOJURE_DIR=D:\clojure-1.2.0
    set CLOJURE_JAR=%CLOJURE_DIR%\clojure-1.2.0.jar
    set CONTRIB_JAR=%CLOJURE_DIR%\clojure-contrib-1.2.0.jar
    set JLINE_JAR=%CLOJURE_DIR%\jline-0.9.94.jar

    if (%1) == () (
        :: Start REPL
        java -cp .;%JLINE_JAR%;%CLOJURE_JAR%;%CONTRIB_JAR% jline.ConsoleRunner clojure.main
    ) else (
        :: Start some_script.clj
        java -cp .;%CLOJURE_JAR%;%CONTRIB_JAR% clojure.main %1 -- %*
    )
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Note''': If clojure is installed to a path with spaces, you will need to put the places where the variables are in quotes.
Thus,

&lt;source lang=dos&gt;
    java -cp %CLOJURE_DIR%\jline-VERSION.jar;%CLOJURE_JAR% jline.ConsoleRunner clojure.main
&lt;/source&gt;

would become

&lt;source lang=dos&gt;
    java -cp &quot;%CLOJURE_DIR%\jline-VERSION.jar;%CLOJURE_JAR%&quot; jline.ConsoleRunner clojure.main
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Enhancing Clojure REPL with rlwrap ===
To enhance the Clojure REPL under Unix variants, one
very useful utility is [http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/rlwrap/ &lt;code&gt;rlwrap&lt;/code&gt;].

It adds the following features to the Clojure interactive shell.
# Tab Completion
# Parenthesis matching
# History across Clojure sessions
# Vi or Emacs binding based on your [http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html#SEC9 readline .inputrc] settings

As a first step build and install &lt;code&gt;rlwrap&lt;/code&gt;. It might also be available as a part of you package
repository for your GNU/Linux distribution. Ensure that &lt;code&gt;rlwrap&lt;/code&gt; version 0.30 or above is in your path (previous versions have issues with multiline prompts).

    [cljuser:~]% rlwrap -v
    rlwrap 0.30
    [cljuser:~]%


Save the following bash script as &lt;code&gt;clj&lt;/code&gt; and add it to your path
after making it executable:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
    #!/bin/sh
    breakchars=&quot;(){}[],^%$#@\&quot;\&quot;;:''|\\&quot;
    CLOJURE_DIR=~/clojure
    CLOJURE_JAR=&quot;$CLOJURE_DIR&quot;/clojure.jar
    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then 
         exec rlwrap --remember -c -b &quot;$breakchars&quot; \
            -f &quot;$HOME&quot;/.clj_completions \
             java -cp &quot;$CLOJURE_JAR&quot; clojure.main
    else
         exec java -cp &quot;$CLOJURE_JAR&quot; clojure.main $1 -- &quot;$@&quot;
    fi
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that this script uses &lt;code&gt;rlwrap&lt;/code&gt; and not JLine.
The file &lt;code&gt;~/.clj_completions&lt;/code&gt; is the file &lt;code&gt;rlwrap&lt;/code&gt; will use for providing tab completions.

Also, note that the file &lt;code&gt;clojure.jar&lt;/code&gt; in the script should refer to whatever is the name of
the jar built by either ant or maven. Ant builds &lt;code&gt;clojure.jar&lt;/code&gt;.

The following Clojure program can be used to generate the completions file:
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(def completions (keys (ns-publics (find-ns 'clojure.core))))

(with-open [f (java.io.BufferedWriter. (java.io.FileWriter. (str (System/getenv &quot;HOME&quot;) &quot;/.clj_completions&quot;)))]
    (.write f (apply str (interpose \newline completions))))
&lt;/source&gt;

To generate completions for all the standard Clojure namespaces (not just 'closure), substitute the first line of that code with the following definition.
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(def completions (mapcat (comp keys ns-publics) (all-ns)))
&lt;/source&gt;

At this point you are good to go.
Here are the settings from &lt;code&gt;~/.inputrc&lt;/code&gt;:

    set editing-mode vi
    tab: complete
    set completion-ignore-case on
    set blink-matching-paren on

For the Vi key bindings, the user can use &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; for jumping to matching
parenthesis in the interactive shell.
For Emacs bindings the keys are 'M-C-f' ('forward-sexp') and 'M-C-b' ('backward-sexp').

Invoke the REPL as &lt;code&gt;clj&lt;/code&gt;

    [cljuser:~]% clj
    Clojure
    user=&gt; (de'' --&gt; tab''
    Desktop/      defmethod     defstruct     deref
    dec           defmulti      delay         derive
    definline     defn          delay?        descendants
    defmacro      defn-         destructure
    user=&gt; (def'' --&gt; tab''
    definline  defmacro   defmethod  defmulti   defn       defn-      defstruct
    user=&gt; (take-'' --&gt; tab''
    take-nth    take-while
    user=&gt; (take-

This REPL also remembers the symbols created by you:

    [cljuser:~]% clj
    Clojure
    user=&gt; (def foo 10)
    #'user/foo
    user=&gt; (def foobar 20)
    #'user/foobar
    user=&gt; (def foo-next 30)
    #'user/foo-next
    user=&gt; (fo'' --&gt; tab''
    foo       foo-next  foobar    for       force
    user=&gt; (fo

Happy REPLing!

=== User settings ===

clojure.lang.Repl will run all the files listed before it goes to
the prompt. So I have my clj script updated to accept a
.cljrc.clj file that has my settings.
&lt;pre&gt;
  (set! *print-length* 50)
  (set! *print-level* 10) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Installing clojure.contrib ===
Clojure contrib is a common library for Clojure.  Several projects depend on it, so it should be one of the first things you install.  It is currently only available in source form, so check it out as follows:

   git clone git://github.com/richhickey/clojure-contrib.git

Use Apache Maven to build by typing &quot;mvn package&quot; in the clojure-contrib subdirectory. Add the newly built clojure-contrib.jar from the &quot;target&quot; subdirectory to the classpath in your startup script:

    java -cp $CLOJURE_JAR:$CONTRIB_JAR clojure.main

Or skip building the clojure-contrib.jar and add clojure-contrib/src/main/clojure to your classpath instead.

== Editors/IDEs ==

=== Official Instructions for various IDEs ===

See the [http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started Getting Started] section on the official Clojure wiki.

=== Emacs ===

See [http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Emacs the instructions in the Clojure documentation].

=== Vim ===

The state of the art in using Vim to edit Clojure code is the [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501 VimClojure] plugin (recently merged with the Gorilla plugin, and depends on having a Ruby-enabled Vim (a Windows build of vim including Ruby support can be found [http://wyw.dcweb.cn/#download here])).

With VimClojure set up, you have:
* syntax highlighting (including rainbow parens) and indenting
* a REPL buffer inside Vim (with command history, highlighting and indenting)
* the ability to evaluate code from your program
* documentation lookup, omni-completion, and more

Gorilla is in active development (particularly to remove the Ruby dependency), but is very stable and useful.

Both VimClojure and Gorilla were created by, and are maintained by, Meikel Brandmeyer.

Some notes on these plugins:
* Two (out of date) screencasts can be viewed: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqweCwAMan0&amp;fmt=18 VimClojure] and [http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cjXn2Nnog Gorilla].
* A more UpToDate-Screencast can be found at: [http://blip.tv/file/1884989 Installing VimClojure]
* Installation instructions are included at the plugin pages.  Note that Gorilla comes with a file &lt;tt&gt;gorilla.jar&lt;/tt&gt; that needs to be in your classpath when you run Gorilla.
* The way to use Gorilla is this: run it (so that a REPL server is in operation), then open a Clojure file in Vim.  \sr will start a REPL buffer; \et will evaluate the expression under the cursor; see &lt;tt&gt;:help gorilla.txt&lt;/tt&gt; for more.

==== Completions ====
If you are using the &lt;code&gt;VimClojure&lt;/code&gt; plugin from the previous section, &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-N&lt;/code&gt; completions should work for you out of the box and you don't really need to bother with this section.

However, if you are using the bleeding edge Clojure from the sources, there may be some additions / changes to the API. If this is the case, you would need to generate an updated list of completions for Clojure. This can be created using the Clojure script from section [[Clojure_Programming/Getting_Started#Enhancing_Clojure_REPL_with_rlwrap | Enhancing Clojure REPL with rlwrap]]. Once generated this completions file may be linked into your VimClojure plugin or you could update your &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the completions generator script is already available as a part of the &lt;code&gt;VimClojure&lt;/code&gt; plugin.

Once you have the file &lt;code&gt;~/.clj_completions&lt;/code&gt; add the following line to your &lt;code&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
au Bufenter,Bufnewfile *.clj setl complete+=k~/.clj_completions
&lt;/pre&gt;

With this setting you should be able to use &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+N&lt;/code&gt; in insert mode to see possible completions. For example, &lt;code&gt;take&lt;/code&gt;''Ctrl+N'' will show &lt;code&gt;take-while&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;take-nth&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;take&lt;/code&gt; in a drop-down list.

==== Other ways to communicate with a REPL from Vim ====

If you are unwilling or unable to run Gorilla, there are two other ways you can access a Clojure REPL from Vim.

[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2348 Chimp] is the precursor to Gorilla.  It uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen screen] to send text to a running REPL.  It is far less convenient that Gorilla, but better than nothing.

[http://technotales.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/like-slime-for-vim/ This article] describes exactly the same basic idea as Chimp, but is a more lightweight plugin.

As these two approaches rely on Screen, they are essentially available on Unix-like (including Cygwin) systems only.

=== Eclipse ===

There are a couple Eclipse plug-ins for Clojure development, the most prominent one being [http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/ Counterclockwise].


=== NetBeans ===
A NetBeans plugin is available from the Enclojure project, http://www.enclojure.org/.

== Introductions and Tips ==

=== Clojure for Java  Programmers ===

Rich Hickey gave a talk entitled &quot;An Introduction For Java Programmers&quot;. Audio and slides are available in two parts on the [http://clojure.blip.tv/#989128 Clojure blip.tv channel]. Good &quot;Clojure Scripting&quot; tutorial [http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php/Clojure_Scripting here] covers many basics of Clojure, as well as its Java integration (for example, using ImageJ from Clojure).

==== Invoking Clojure from Java ====

The main site's [http://clojure.org/java_interop Java Interop reference] shows how you can call your Java code from Clojure. But because Clojure is implemented as a Java class library, you can also easily embed Clojure in your Java applications, load code, and call functions.

Repl.java and Script.java in the distribution are the canonical examples for loading code from a user or from a file. In this section we'll show how to use the same underlying machinery to load code and then manipulate it directly from Java.

Here's a script that defines a simple Clojure function.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
; foo.clj
(ns user)

(defn foo [a b]
  (str a &quot; &quot; b))
&lt;/source&gt;

And here's a Java class that loads the script, calls the foo function with some Java objects as arguments, and prints the returned object.

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
// Foo.java

import clojure.lang.RT;
import clojure.lang.Var;

public class Foo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Load the Clojure script -- as a side effect this initializes the runtime.
        RT.loadResourceScript(&quot;foo.clj&quot;);

        // Get a reference to the foo function.
        Var foo = RT.var(&quot;user&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;);

        // Call it!
        Object result = foo.invoke(&quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;there&quot;);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Compile this and run it to see the printed result:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;javac -cp clojure.jar Foo.java

&gt;java -cp clojure.jar Foo
Hi there

&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

When Calling code from outside the classpath, the same effect can be achieved by running
&lt;pre&gt;
clojure.lang.Compiler.loadFile(&quot;foo.clj&quot;);
&lt;/pre&gt;
From within the Java code instead of &lt;tt&gt;RT.loadResourceScript(&quot;foo.clj&quot;);&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Clojure for Scheme Programmers ===

When asked about using SICP to learn about Clojure, Rich had this to say:

:Everyone's experience will be different, of course. Here's my 2 cents:

:I don't think SICP is a book about a programming language. It's a book about programming. It uses Scheme because Scheme is in many ways an atomic programming language. Lambda calculus + Tail Call Optimization (TCO) for loops + Continuations for control abstraction + syntactic abstraction (macros) + mutable state for when you need it. It is very small. It is sufficient.

:The book really deals with the issues in programming. Modularity, abstraction, state, data structures, concurrency etc. It provides descriptions and toy implementations of generic dispatch, objects, concurrency, lazy lists, (mutable) data structures, 'tagging' etc, designed to illuminate the issues. 

:Clojure is not an atomic programming language. I'm too tired/old/lazy to program with atoms. Clojure provides production implementations of generic dispatch, associative maps, metadata, concurrency infrastructure, persistent data structures, lazy seqs, polymorphic libraries etc etc. Much better implementations of some of the things you would be building by following along with SICP are in Clojure already.

:So the value in SICP would be in helping you understand programming concepts. If you already understand the concepts, Clojure lets you get on with writing interesting and robust programs much more quickly, IMO. And I don't think the core of Clojure is appreciably bigger than Scheme's. What do Schemers think?

:I think the Lisps prior to Clojure lead you towards a good path with functional programming and lists, only to leave you high and dry when it comes to the suite of data structures you need to write real programs, such data structures, when provided, being mutable and imperative. Prior Lisps were also designed before pervasive in-process concurrency, and before the value of high-performance polymorphic dispatch (e.g. virtual functions) as library infrastructure was well understood. Their libraries have decidedly limited polymorphism. 

:Stuart Halloway's book ''[http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure Programming Clojure]'' is now available as an e-book (in Beta) and will come out on paper soon. Of course to the extent Schemes go beyond the standard to provide more complete functionality (as most do), there are no books on that either. Just docs in both cases.

:Learning Scheme or Common Lisp on your way to Clojure is fine. There will be specifics that don't translate (from Scheme - no TCO, false/ nil/() differences, no continuations; from CL - Lisp-1, symbol/var dichotomy). But I personally don't think SICP will help you much with Clojure. YMMV.

=== Clojure for Common Lisp Programmers ===
The table below lists some of the Common Lisp entities (functions, macros etc.) and their (somewhat) equivalent Clojure entities. Note that some of the concepts may not be an ''exact'' match. For the exact behavior of the Clojure entities it is recommended that the reader see the [http://clojure.org/ Clojure Reference Documentation] available at the Clojure home page. Note that some of these differences may be because Clojure has its heritage in Lisp-1 and not Lisp-2.

The Clojure reference also documents common differences to lisps [http://clojure.org/lisp here].

=== Clojure for Python/Ruby/Perl Programmers ===

A [http://gist.github.com/17283 list of equivalent clojure functions] for all methods in Ruby's Enumerable and Array classes.

=== Unit Testing in Clojure ===
There are several unit testing solutions available in Clojure. They have
slightly different ideas of how to approach testing. Check out each one and see
which fits your testing philosophy the best.

==== test-is ====

The test-is framework by Stuart Sierra is included in clojure.contrib. It allows
you to tag your function definitions with assertions declared by the &quot;is&quot; macro as 
shown in this example (from the code):

 (defn add2
   ([x] (+ x 2))
     {:test (fn [] (is (= (add2 3) 5))
                   (is (= (add2 -4) -2)
                   (is (&gt; (add2 50) 50)))}

Tests can be built standalone as well:

 (deftest test-new-fn
   (is (= (new-fn) &quot;Awesome&quot;)))

The best place to look for more detail is in the source code itself which is
part of the [http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/ clojure-contrib]
library on Google Code.

In recent releases, this function has been moved into the core distribution
in the namespace clojure.test; a compatibility library still exists in clojure-contrib.

==== Fact ====

Fact is a unit testing library by James Reeves styled after systems such as
Ruby's RSpec. Using this approach, you write your tests as &quot;facts&quot; each
with an assertion which should demonstrate that fact:

 (fact &quot;The length of a concatenated list is equal to the length of its parts&quot;
   [xs (rand-seqs rand-ints)
    ys (rand-seqs rand-ints)]
   (= (count (concat xs ys))
      (+ (count xs) (count ys)))) 

James posted a description of the library on the google group
[http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/193023afbf87698d/c555efbfe954b1cf?lnk=gst&amp;q=unit+testing#c555efbfe954b1cf here]. The library is hosted on github [http://github.com/weavejester/fact/tree here].

==== unit-test ====

unit-test is a xUnit-style unit test system that allows you to define tests
using a deftest macro. Tests contain various assertions and if one of the
assertions fails, the test fails.

An example:
 (deftest my-example-test []
    (let [x 1]
      (assert-equal 1 x &quot;x is NOT one!&quot;)))

The original version of unit-test has not been kept up to date with Clojure
changes 
([http://gnufoo.org/clojure/unit-test/README.html original home page here]), but
Tyler McMullen has patched it up and posted a working version on github [http://github.com/tyler/unit_test/tree here].

=== Shebang Scripting in Clojure ===
This was tested on Linux only, but should work in other Un*xes.

Put this into command-line-args.clj
&lt;pre&gt;
#^:shebang '[
exec java -cp &quot;$HOME/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.5.1/clojure-1.5.1.jar&quot; clojure.main &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
]
(prn *command-line-args*)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Make it executable with something like &lt;pre&gt;$ chmod 755 command-line-args.clj&lt;/pre&gt;

And then run it with parameters.
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ~/src/clj/lab/command-line-args.clj a b c
(&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The explanation for this approach is described in [http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/03785524320dea22 this mail] on Clojure group.

----
A more modern version of this approach is to write command-line-args.clj as:

&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;:&quot;;exec java -cp &quot;$HOME/path-to-clojure.jar&quot; clojure.main $0 $*

(ns command-line-args)

(defn command-line? []                               
  (.isAbsolute (java.io.File. *file*)))

(defn main [] (println *command-line-args*))

(if (command-line?) (main))

&lt;/pre&gt;

It has a simpler &quot;shebang&quot; line. 

(main) is always executed when the script is called from the command-line, even when called with no arguments.

(main) is not executed when command-line-args is used or required by another clojure file.

This method is inspired by [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsScripts this] method of emacs scripting and works for the same reasons.
----

A recent update to Clojure made #! a to-end-of-line comment. Using revision 1106 or later shebang scripting can be done as normal if you have created a clj script, such as those described in [[Clojure_Programming/Getting_Started|Getting started]]:

&lt;pre&gt;
#! /usr/bin/env clj

(println &quot;Hello World!&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Otherwise, you can reference java the jar directly, like so:

&lt;pre&gt;
#! /usr/bin/java -jar clojure.jar clojure.lang.Script
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: this may not work on all systems, since on some systems only one argument is allowed!

----

On Windows, a similar approach works for embedding a Clojure script into a batch file:

&lt;pre&gt;
:x (comment
@echo off
java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main &quot;%~f0&quot; %*
goto :eof
)

(println &quot;Hi!&quot; *command-line-args*)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here, the first line is seen as a label (because of the initial colon) by cmd.exe, and as a bare keyword followed by the start of a multi-line comment by Clojure. The next lines (to the closing parenthesis) run Java with an appropriate classpath, passing the batch file name (&quot;%~f0&quot;) and the command line arguments (&quot;%*&quot;) and then exit the batch file (goto eof). The closing parenthesis then terminates the Clojure comment, and Clojure interprets the rest of the file.

=== Distributing application as self contained .jar ===

(done under linux under bash shell)

* add ./classes and ./ to the CLASSPATH shell variable and make sure that this class-path is also used by clojure (could mean editing the clj bash script):

&lt;pre&gt;
bash# export CLASSPATH=./classes:./
&lt;/pre&gt;

* bash# mkdir -p project/{app,classes}
* bash# cd project
* create the clojure application app/hello.clj with content:

&lt;pre&gt;

(ns app.hello (:gen-class))

(refer 'clojure.core) ; not sure if this is necessary

(defn -main [&amp; args] (println &quot;application works&quot;))
&lt;/pre&gt;

* compile the clojure application, using clojure REPL/shell:

&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (compile 'app.hello)
app.hello
user=&gt; &lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;d&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

* the compiled application is in classes/app:
&lt;pre&gt;
bash# ls classes/app/
hello.class  hello__init.class  hello$_main__4.class
&lt;/pre&gt;

* unpack the clojure.jar into ./classes :

&lt;pre&gt;
bash# unzip /opt/clojure/clojure.jar -d classes/.
&lt;/pre&gt;

* delete ./classes/META-INF

&lt;pre&gt;
bash# rm -r ./classes/META-INF
&lt;/pre&gt;

* create manifest text file called mf-app.txt with content:

&lt;pre&gt;
Main-Class: app.hello
Class-Path: .
&lt;/pre&gt;

(make sure that the file ends with a new-line character after the &quot;.&quot; character)

* create the .jar file:

&lt;pre&gt;
bash# jar cmf mf-app.txt app.jar -C classes .
&lt;/pre&gt;

(the command ends with a &quot;.&quot;)

* Try the application (app.jar):

&lt;pre&gt;
bash# java -jar app.jar
application works
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Using the (ns) macro ===

The (ns) macro can be a bit tricky. Here are some examples that might help.

* Require all of the functions from clojure.contrib.str-utils, without importing them directly into the namespace.

&lt;pre&gt;
(ns foo
  (:require clojure.contrib.str-utils))

(clojure.contrib.str-utils/str-join &quot;, &quot; [&quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;])
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Import all of the functions from clojure.contrib.str-utils directly into the namespace.

&lt;pre&gt;
(ns foo
  (:use clojure.contrib.str-utils))

(str-join &quot;, &quot; [&quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;])
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Import all of the functions from clojure.contrib.str-utils with an aliased namespace.

&lt;pre&gt;
(ns foo
  (:require [clojure.contrib [str-utils :as str-utils]]))

(str-utils/str-join &quot;,&quot; [&quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;])
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Exclude Clojure's &quot;list&quot; function so that you can define your own function with that name.

&lt;pre&gt;
(ns foo
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [list]))
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Concepts ==

=== Basics ===

==== Numbers ====

===== Types of Numbers =====
Clojure supports the following numeric types:

* Integer
* Floating Point
* Ratio
* Decimal

[http://clojure.org/data_structures Numbers in Clojure] are based on [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Number.html java.lang.Number]. BigInteger and BigDecimal are supported and hence we have arbitrary precision numbers in Clojure.

The Ratio type is [http://clojure.org/data_structures described on Clojure page] as

::'''Ratio'''
::Represents a ratio between integers. Division of integers that can't be reduced to an integer yields a ratio, i.e. 22/7 = 22/7, rather than a floating point or truncated value.

Ratios allows a computation to be maintained in numeric form. This can help
avoid inaccuracies in long computations.

Here is a little experiment. Lets first try a computation of &lt;code&gt;(1/3 * 3/1)&lt;/code&gt; as floating point. Later we try the same with Ratio.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (def a (/ 1.0 3.0))
 (def b (/ 3.0 1.0))

 (* a b)
 ;; ⇒ 1.0

 (def c (* a a a a a a a a a a)) ; ⇒ #'user/c
 (def d (* b b b b b b b b b b)) ; ⇒ #'user/d

 (* c d)
 ;; ⇒ 0.9999999999999996
&lt;/source&gt;

The result we want is &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, but the value of &lt;code&gt;(* c d)&lt;/code&gt; above is &lt;code&gt;0.9999999999999996&lt;/code&gt;. This is due to the inaccuracies of a and b multiplying as we create c and d.
You really don't want such calculations happening in your pay cheque :)

The same done with ratios below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (def a1 (/ 1 3))
 (def b1 (/ 3 1))

 (def c (* a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1))
 (def d (* b1 b1 b1 b1 b1 b1 b1 b1 b1 b1))

 (* c d)
 ;; ⇒ 1
&lt;/source&gt;

The result is &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; as we hoped for.

===== Number Entry Formats =====

Clojure supports the usual formats for entry as shown below 

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 user=&gt; 10       ; decimal
 10
 user=&gt; 010      ; octal
 8
 user=&gt; 0xff     ; hex
 255
 user=&gt; 1.0e-2   ; double
 0.01
 user=&gt; 1.0e2    ; double
 100.0
&lt;/source&gt;

To make things easier, a radix based entry format is
also supported in the form &lt;code&gt;&lt;radix&gt;r&lt;number&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Where radix can be any natural number between 2 and 36.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 2r1111
 ;; ⇒ 15
&lt;/source&gt;

These formats can be mixed and used.
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (+ 0x1 2r1 01)
 ;; ⇒ 3
&lt;/source&gt;

Many bitwise operations are also supported by [http://clojure.org/api Clojure API]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (bit-and 2r1100 2r0100)
 ;; ⇒ 4
&lt;/source&gt;

Some of the others are:
* (bit-and x y)
* (bit-and-not x y)
* (bit-clear x n)
* (bit-flip x n)
* (bit-not x)
* (bit-or x y)
* (bit-set x n)
* (bit-shift-left x n)
* (bit-shift-right x n)
* (bit-test x n)
* (bit-xor x y)

===== Converting Integers to Strings =====

One general purpose way to format any data for printing is to use a 
[http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?java/util/Formatter.html java.util.Formatter].

The predefined convenience function &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; makes using a Formatter easy (the hash in &lt;code&gt;%#x&lt;/code&gt; displays the number as a hexadecimal number prefixed with &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt;):

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt; 
 (format &quot;%#x&quot; (bit-and 2r1100 2r0100))
 ;; ⇒ &quot;0x4&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Converting integers to strings is even easier with
[http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html java.lang.Integer]. 
Note that since the methods are static, we must use the &quot;/&quot; syntax instead of &quot;.method&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt; 
 (Integer/toBinaryString 10)
 ;; ⇒ &quot;1010&quot;
 (Integer/toHexString 10)
 ;; ⇒ &quot;a&quot;
 (Integer/toOctalString 10)
 ;;⇒ &quot;12&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is another way to specify the base of the string representation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt; 
 (Integer/toString 10 2)
 ;; ⇒&quot;1010&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Where 10 is the number to be converted and 2 is the radix.

Note: In addition to the above syntax, which is used for accessing static fields or methods, &lt;code&gt;. (dot)&lt;/code&gt; can be used. 
It is a special form used for accessing arbitrary (non-private) fields or methods in Java as explained in the Clojure Reference ([http://clojure.org/java_interop Java Interop]). 
For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt; 
 (. Integer toBinaryString 10)
 ;; ⇒ &quot;1010&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

For static accesses, the / syntax is preferred.

===== Converting Strings to Integers =====

For converting strings to integers, we can again use java.lang.Integer.
This is shown below.

    user=&gt; (Integer/parseInt &quot;A&quot; 16)      ; hex
    10
    user=&gt; (Integer/parseInt &quot;1010&quot; 2)    ; bin
    10
    user=&gt; (Integer/parseInt &quot;10&quot; 8)      ; oct
    8
    user=&gt; (Integer/parseInt &quot;8&quot;)         ; dec
    8

The above sections give an overview of the integer-to-string and 
string-to-integer formatting. There is a very rich set of well documented
functions available in the Java libraries (too rich to document here).
These functions can easily be used to meet varied needs.

==== Structures ====

Structures in Clojure are a little different from those in languages
like Java or C++. They are also different from structures in Common
Lisp (even though we have a &lt;code&gt;defstruct&lt;/code&gt; in Clojure).

In Clojure, structures are a special case of maps and are explained in
the [http://clojure.org/data_structures data structures] section in the
reference.

The idea is that multiple instance of the structures will need to access
their ''field'' values using the ''field names'' which are basically
the map '''keys'''. This is fast and convenient, especially because Clojure
automatically defines the '''keys''' as accessors for the structure instances.

Following are the important functions dealing with structures:
* defstruct
* create-struct
* struct
* struct-map
For the full API refer to [http://clojure.org/data_structures data structures] section
in Clojure reference.

Structures are created using &lt;code&gt;defstruct&lt;/code&gt; which is a macro
wrapping the function &lt;code&gt;create-struct&lt;/code&gt; which actually creates
the struct. &lt;code&gt;defstruct&lt;/code&gt; creates the structure using
&lt;code&gt;create-struct&lt;/code&gt; and binds it to the structure ''name'' supplied to
&lt;code&gt;defstruct&lt;/code&gt;.

The object returned by &lt;code&gt;create-struct&lt;/code&gt; is what is called the
''structure basis''. This is not a structure instance but contains information
of what the structure instances should look like. New instances are
created using &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;struct-map&lt;/code&gt;.

The structure field names of type '''keyword''' or '''symbols''' are automatically usable as functions to access fields of the structure. This is possible
as structures are maps and this feature is supported by maps. This is ''not
possible for other types'' of field names such as strings or numbers. It is
quite common to use keywords for field names for structures due to the above
reason. Also, Clojure optimises structures to share base key information. The following shows sample usage:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (defstruct employee :name :id)
 (struct employee &quot;Mr. X&quot; 10)                           ; ⇒ {:name &quot;Mr. X&quot;, :id 10}
 (struct-map employee :id 20 :name &quot;Mr. Y&quot;)             ; ⇒ {:name &quot;Mr. Y&quot;, :id 20}

 (def a (struct-map employee :id 20 :name &quot;Mr. Y&quot;))
 (def b (struct employee &quot;Mr. X&quot; 10))'

 ;; :name and :id are accessors
 (:name a)                                              ; ⇒ &quot;Mr. Y&quot;
 (:id b)                                                ; ⇒ 10
 (b :id)                                                ; ⇒ 10
 (b :name)                                              ; ⇒ &quot;Mr. X&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Clojure also supports the &lt;code&gt;accessor&lt;/code&gt; function that can
be used to get accessor functions for fields to allow easy access.
This is important when field names are of types other than keyword
or symbols. This is seen in the interaction below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (def e-str (struct employee &quot;John&quot; 123))
 e-str
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;John&quot;, :id 123}

 (&quot;name&quot; e-str) ; ERROR: string not an accessor
 ;; ERROR ⇒
 ;; java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn
 ;; java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn
 ;;         at user.eval__2537.invoke(Unknown Source)
 ;;         at clojure.lang.Compiler.eval(Compiler.java:3847)
 ;;         at clojure.lang.Repl.main(Repl.java:75)

 (def e-name (accessor employee :name))  ; bind accessor to e-name
 (e-name e-str) ; use accessor
 ;; ⇒ &quot;John&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

As structures are maps, new fields can be added to structure instances using
&lt;code&gt;assoc&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;dissoc&lt;/code&gt; can be used to remove these
instance specific keys. Note however that ''struct base keys'' '''cannot''' be
removed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 b
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;Mr. X&quot;, :id 10}

 (def b1 (assoc b :function &quot;engineer&quot;))
 b1
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;Mr. X&quot;, :id 10, :function &quot;engineer&quot;}

 (def b2 (dissoc b1 :function)) ; this works as :function is instance
 b2
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;Mr. X&quot;, :id 10}

 (dissoc b2 :name)  ; this fails. base keys cannot be dissociated
 ;; ERROR ⇒ java.lang.Exception: Can't remove struct key
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;assoc&lt;/code&gt; can also be used to &quot;update&quot; a structure.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 a
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;Mr. Y&quot;, :id 20}

 (assoc a :name &quot;New Name&quot;)
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;New Name&quot;, :id 20}

 a                   ; note that 'a' is immutable and did not change
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;Mr. Y&quot;, :id 20}

 (def a1 (assoc a :name &quot;Another New Name&quot;)) ; bind to a1
 a1
 ;; ⇒ {:name &quot;Another New Name&quot;, :id 20}
&lt;/source&gt;

Observe that like other sequences in Clojure, structures are also
immutable, hence, simply doing &lt;code&gt;assoc&lt;/code&gt; above does not change
&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. Hence we rebind it to &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt;. While it is
possible to rebind the new value back to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, this is ''not''
considered good style.

==== Exception Handling ====

Clojure supports [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/exceptions/index.html Java based Exceptions]. This may need some getting used to for Common Lisp users who are used to the Common Lisp [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/09_a.htm Condition System].

Clojure does not support a condition system and is not expected to be supported anytime soon as per [http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/659c409104238915 this message]. That said, the more common exception system which is adopted by Clojure is well suited for most programming needs.

If you are new to exception handling, the [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/exceptions/index.html Java Tutorial on Exceptions] is a good place to learn about them.

In Clojure, exceptions can be handled using the following functions:
* &lt;code&gt;(try expr* catch-clause* finally-clause?)&lt;/code&gt;
** catch-clause -&gt; (catch classname name expr*)
** finally-clause -&gt; (finally expr*)
* &lt;code&gt;(throw expr)&lt;/code&gt;

Two types of exceptions you may want to handle in Clojure are:
* Clojure Exception: These are exception generated by Clojure or the underlying Java engine
* User Defined Exception: These are exceptions which you might create for your applications

===== Clojure Exceptions =====

Below is a simple interaction at the REPL that throws an exception:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
user=&gt; (/ 1 0)
java.lang.ArithmeticException: Divide by zero
java.lang.ArithmeticException: Divide by zero
        at clojure.lang.Numbers.divide(Numbers.java:142)
        at user.eval__2127.invoke(Unknown Source)
        at clojure.lang.Compiler.eval(Compiler.java:3847)
        at clojure.lang.Repl.main(Repl.java:75)
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above case we see a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArithmeticException&lt;/code&gt; being
thrown. This is a runtime exception which is thrown by the underlying JVM. The long
message can sometimes be intimidating for new users but the trick is to
simply look at the exception (&lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArithmeticException: Divide by zero&lt;/code&gt;) and not bother with the rest of the trace.

Similar exceptions may be thrown by the compiler at the REPL.
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
user=&gt; (def xx yy)
java.lang.Exception: Unable to resolve symbol: yy in this context
clojure.lang.Compiler$CompilerException: NO_SOURCE_FILE:4: Unable to resolve symbol: yy in this context
        at clojure.lang.Compiler.analyze(Compiler.java:3669)
        at clojure.lang.Compiler.access$200(Compiler.java:37)
        at clojure.lang.Compiler$DefExpr$Parser.parse(Compiler.java:335)
        at clojure.lang.Compiler.analyzeSeq(Compiler.java:3814)
        at clojure.lang.Compiler.analyze(Compiler.java:3654)
        at clojure.lang.Compiler.analyze(Compiler.java:3627)
        at clojure.lang.Compiler.eval(Compiler.java:3851)
        at clojure.lang.Repl.main(Repl.java:75)
&lt;/source&gt;
In  the above case, the compiler does not find the binding for &lt;code&gt;yy&lt;/code&gt; and hence it throws the exception. If your program is correct (i.e. in this case &lt;code&gt;yy&lt;/code&gt; is defined &lt;code&gt;(def yy 10)&lt;/code&gt;) , you won't see any compile time exceptions.

The following interaction shows how runtime exceptions like &lt;code&gt;ArithmeticException&lt;/code&gt; can be handled.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
user=&gt; (try (/ 1 0)
            (catch Exception e (prn &quot;in catch&quot;))
            (finally (prn &quot;in finally&quot;)))
&quot;in catch&quot;
&quot;in finally&quot;
nil
&lt;/source&gt;

The syntax for the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block is &lt;code&gt;(try expr* catch-clause* finally-clause?)&lt;/code&gt;.

As can be seen, it's quite easy to handle exceptions in Clojure. One thing to note is that &lt;code&gt;(catch Exception e ...)&lt;/code&gt; is a catch all for exceptions as &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; is a superclass of all exceptions. It is also possible to catch &lt;b&gt;specific&lt;/b&gt; exceptions which is generally a good idea.

In the example below, we specifically catch &lt;code&gt;ArithmeticException&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
user=&gt; (try (/ 1 0) (catch ArithmeticException e (prn &quot;in catch&quot;)) (finally (prn &quot;in finally&quot;)))
&quot;in catch&quot;
&quot;in finally&quot;
nil
&lt;/source&gt;

When we use some other exception type in the catch block, we find that the &lt;code&gt;ArithmeticException&lt;/code&gt; is not caught and is seen by the REPL.
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
user=&gt; (try (/ 1 0) (catch IllegalArgumentException e (prn &quot;in catch&quot;)) (finally (prn &quot;in finally&quot;)))
&quot;in finally&quot;
java.lang.ArithmeticException: Divide by zero
java.lang.ArithmeticException: Divide by zero
        at clojure.lang.Numbers.divide(Numbers.java:142)
        at user.eval__2138.invoke(Unknown Source)
        at clojure.lang.Compiler.eval(Compiler.java:3847)
        at clojure.lang.Repl.main(Repl.java:75)
&lt;/source&gt;

===== User-Defined Exceptions =====

As mentioned previously, all exceptions in Clojure need to be a subclass of [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Exception.html java.lang.Exception] (or generally speaking - [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html java.lang.Throwable] which is the superclass for Exception). This means that even when you want to define your own exceptions in Clojure, you need to derive it from Exception.

Don't worry, that's easier than it sounds :)

Clojure API provides a function &lt;code&gt;[http://clojure.org/api#gen-and-load-class gen-and-load-class]&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to extend &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Exception&lt;/code&gt; for user-defined exceptions. &lt;code&gt;gen-and-load-class&lt;/code&gt; generates and immediately loads the bytecode for the specified class.

Now, rather than talking too much, let's quickly look at code.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(gen-and-load-class 'user.UserException :extends Exception)

(defn user-exception-test []
  (try
    (throw (new user.UserException &quot;msg: user exception was here!!&quot;))
    (catch user.UserException e
      (prn &quot;caught exception&quot; e))
    (finally (prn &quot;finally clause invoked!!!&quot;))))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we are creating a new class &lt;code&gt;'user.UserException&lt;/code&gt; that
extends &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Exception&lt;/code&gt;. We create an instance
of &lt;code&gt;user.UserException&lt;/code&gt; using the special form &lt;code&gt;(new Classname-symbol args*)&lt;/code&gt;.
This is then &lt;b&gt;thrown&lt;/b&gt;.

Sometimes you may come across code like &lt;code&gt;(user.UserException. &quot;msg: user exception was here!!&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.
This is just another way to say &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;. Note the &lt;code&gt;. (dot)&lt;/code&gt; after the &lt;code&gt;user.UserException&lt;/code&gt;. This does exactly the same thing.

Here is the interaction:
&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (load-file &quot;except.clj&quot;)
#'user/user-exception-test

user=&gt; (user-exception-test)
&quot;caught exception&quot; user.UserException: msg: user exception was here!!
&quot;finally clause invoked!!!&quot;
nil
user=&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

So here we have both the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt;
clauses being invoked. That's all there is to it.

With Clojure's support for Java Interop, it is also possible for the user to create
exceptions in Java and catch them in Clojure, but creating the exception in Clojure
is typically more convenient.

==== Mutation Facilities ====
===== Employee Record Manipulation =====

Data structures and sequences in Clojure are immutable as seen in the examples
presented in [[Clojure_Programming/Concepts#Structures]] (it is suggested that the
reader go through that section first).

While immutable data has its advantages, any project of reasonable size will
require the programmer to maintain some sort of state. Managing state in a language
with immutable sequences and data structures is a frequent source of confusion for
people used to programming languages that allow mutation of data. 

A good essay on the Clojure approach is [http://clojure.org/state Values and Change - Clojure's
approach to Identity and State], written by Rich Hickey.

It may be useful to watch [http://clojure.blip.tv/file/812787/ Clojure Concurrency screen cast] as some of those concepts are used in this section. Specifically '''refs''' and '''transactions'''.

In this section we create a simple employee record set and provide functions
to:
* Add an employee
* Delete employee by name
* Change employee role by name

The example is purposely kept simple as the intent is to show the state and mutation facilities rather than provide full functionality.

Lets dive into the code.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(alias 'set 'clojure.set)   ; use set/fn-name rather than clojure.set/fn-name

(defstruct employee
           :name :id :role) ; == (def employee (create-struct :name :id ..))

(def employee-records (ref #{}))

;;;===================================
;;; Private Functions: No Side-effects
;;;===================================

(defn- update-role [n r recs]
  (let [rec    (set/select #(= (:name %) n) recs)
        others (set/select #(not (= (:name %) n)) recs)]
    (set/union (map #(set [(assoc % :role r)]) rec) others)))

(defn- delete-by-name [n recs]
  (set/select #(not (= (:name %) n)) recs))

;;;=============================================
;;; Public Function: Update Ref employee-records
;;;=============================================
(defn update-employee-role [n r]
  &quot;update the role for employee named n to the new role r&quot;
  (dosync 
    (ref-set employee-records (update-role n r @employee-records))))

(defn delete-employee-by-name [n]
  &quot;delete employee with name n&quot;
  (dosync
    (ref-set employee-records
             (delete-by-name n @employee-records))))

(defn add-employee [e]
  &quot;add new employee e to employee-records&quot;
  (dosync (commute employee-records conj e)))

;;;=========================
;;; initialize employee data
;;;=========================
(add-employee (struct employee &quot;Jack&quot; 0 :Engineer))
(add-employee (struct employee &quot;Jill&quot; 1 :Finance))
(add-employee (struct-map employee :name &quot;Hill&quot; :id 2 :role :Stand))
&lt;/source&gt;

In the first few lines we define the &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; structure.
The interesting definition after that is &lt;code&gt;employee-records&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(def employee-records (ref #{}))
&lt;/source&gt;

In Clojure [http://clojure.org/refs refs] allow mutation of a storage location with a transaction.

&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (def x (ref [1 2 3]))
#'user/x
user=&gt; x
clojure.lang.Ref@128594c
user=&gt; @x
[1 2 3]
user=&gt; (deref x)
[1 2 3]
user=&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Next we define private functions &lt;code&gt;update-role&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;delete-by-name&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;defn-&lt;/code&gt; (note the minus '-' at the end). Observe that these are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function pure functions] without any side-effects.

&lt;code&gt;update-role&lt;/code&gt; takes the employee name &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, the new role &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; and a table of employee records &lt;code&gt;recs&lt;/code&gt;. As sequences are immutable, this function returns a '''new''' table of records with the employee role updated appropriately.
&lt;code&gt;delete-by-name&lt;/code&gt; also behaves in a similar manner by returning a new table of employees after deleting the relevant employee record.

For an explanation of the &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; API see [http://clojure.org/api Clojure API reference].

We still haven't looked at how state is maintained. This is done by the public functions in the listing &lt;code&gt;update-employee-role&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;delete-employee-by-name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;add-employee&lt;/code&gt;.

These functions delegate the job of record processing to the private functions. The important things to note are the use of the following functions:
* &lt;code&gt;ref-set&lt;/code&gt; sets the value of a ref.
* &lt;code&gt;dosync&lt;/code&gt; is mandatory as refs can only be updated in a transaction and &lt;code&gt;dosync&lt;/code&gt; sets up the transaction.
* &lt;code&gt;commute&lt;/code&gt; updates the in-transaction value of a ref.
For a detailed explanation of these functions see the [http://clojure.org/refs refs section] in API reference.

The &lt;code&gt;add-employee&lt;/code&gt; function is quite trivial and hence not broken up into private and public function.

The source listing initializes the records with sample data towards the end.

Below is the interaction for this program.
&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (load-file &quot;employee.clj&quot;)
#{{:name &quot;Jack&quot;, :id 0, :role :Engineer} {:name &quot;Hill&quot;, :id 2, :role :Stand} {:name &quot;Jill&quot;, :id 1, :role :Finance}}

user=&gt; @employee-records
#{{:name &quot;Jack&quot;, :id 0, :role :Engineer} {:name &quot;Hill&quot;, :id 2, :role :Stand} {:name &quot;Jill&quot;, :id 1, :role :Finance}}

user=&gt; (add-employee (struct employee &quot;James&quot; 3 :Bond))
#{{:name &quot;James&quot;, :id 3, :role :Bond} {:name &quot;Jack&quot;, :id 0, :role :Engineer} {:name &quot;Hill&quot;, :id 2, :role :Stand} {:name &quot;Jill&quot;, :id 1, :role :Finance}}
user=&gt; @employee-records
#{{:name &quot;James&quot;, :id 3, :role :Bond} {:name &quot;Jack&quot;, :id 0, :role :Engineer} {:name &quot;Hill&quot;, :id 2, :role :Stand} {:name &quot;Jill&quot;, :id 1, :role :Finance}}

user=&gt; (update-employee-role &quot;Jill&quot; :Sr.Finance)
#{{:name &quot;James&quot;, :id 3, :role :Bond} {:name &quot;Jack&quot;, :id 0, :role :Engineer} {:name &quot;Hill&quot;, :id 2, :role :Stand} {:name &quot;Jill&quot;, :id 1, :role :Sr.Finance}}
user=&gt; @employee-records
#{{:name &quot;James&quot;, :id 3, :role :Bond} {:name &quot;Jack&quot;, :id 0, :role :Engineer} {:name &quot;Hill&quot;, :id 2, :role :Stand} {:name &quot;Jill&quot;, :id 1, :role :Sr.Finance}}

user=&gt; (delete-employee-by-name &quot;Hill&quot;)
#{{:name &quot;James&quot;, :id 3, :role :Bond} {:name &quot;Jack&quot;, :id 0, :role :Engineer} {:name &quot;Jill&quot;, :id 1, :role :Sr.Finance}}
user=&gt; @employee-records
#{{:name &quot;James&quot;, :id 3, :role :Bond} {:name &quot;Jack&quot;, :id 0, :role :Engineer} {:name &quot;Jill&quot;, :id 1, :role :Sr.Finance}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Two things to note about the program:
* Using refs and transactions makes the program inherently thread safe. If we want to extend the program for a multi-threaded environment (using [http://clojure.org/agents Clojure agents]) it will scale with minimal change.
* Keeping the pure functionality separate from the public function that manages state, it is easier to ensure that the functionality is correct as pure functions are easier to test.

* use &lt;code&gt;refer&lt;/code&gt; to refer to functions in the current namespace
* use &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; to load and refer all in one step
* use &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; to refer to Java classes in the current namespace

Require

1. You can load the code for any clojure library with &lt;code&gt;(require&lt;/code&gt; &lt;I&gt;libname&lt;/I&gt;&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. Try it with &lt;code&gt;clojure.contrib.math&lt;/code&gt;:
      (require clojure.contrib.math)
2. Then print the directory of names available in the namespace
      (dir clojure.contrib.math)
3. Show using &lt;code&gt;lcm&lt;/code&gt; to calculate the least common multiple:
      1	(clojure.contrib.math/lcm 11 41)
      2	-&gt; 451
4. Writing out the namespace prefix on every function call is a pain, so you can specify a shorter alias using &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;:
      (require [clojure.contrib.math :as m])
5. Calling the shorter form is much easier:
      1	(m/lcm 120 1000)
      2	-&gt; 3000
6. You can see all the loaded namespaces with
      (all-ns)

===== Refer and Use =====

1. It would be even easier to use a function with no namespace prefix at all. You can do this by referring to the name, which makes a reference to the name in the current namespace:
      (refer 'clojure.contrib.math)
2. Now you can call &lt;code&gt;lcm&lt;/code&gt; directly:
      1	(lcm 16 30)
      2	-&gt; 240
3. If you want to load and refer all in one step, call &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt;:
      (use 'clojure.contrib.math)
4. Referring a library refers all of its names. This is often undesirable, because
* it does not clearly document intent to readers
* it brings in more names than you need, which can lead to name collisions
Instead, use the following style to specify only those names you want:
      (use '[clojure.contrib.math :only (lcm)])
The &lt;code&gt;:only&lt;/code&gt; option is available on all the namespace management forms. (There is also an &lt;code&gt;:exclude&lt;/code&gt; which works as you might expect.)

5. The variable &lt;code&gt;*ns*&lt;/code&gt; always contains the current namespace, and you can see what names your current namespace refers to by calling
      (ns-refers *ns*)
6. The refers map is often pretty big. If you are only interested in one symbol, pass that symbol to the result of calling &lt;code&gt;ns-refers&lt;/code&gt;:
      1	((ns-refers *ns*) 'dir)
      2	-&gt; #'clojure.contrib.ns-utils/dir

=====Import=====

1. Importing is like referring, but for Java classes instead of Clojure namespaces. Instead of
      (java.io.File. &quot;woozle&quot;)
you can say
      1	(import java.io.File)
      2	(File. &quot;woozle&quot;)
2. You can import multiple classes in a Java package with the form
      (import [package Class Class])
For example:
      1	(import [java.util Date Random])
      2	(Date. (long (.nextInt (Random.))))
3. Programmers new to Lisp are often put off by the &quot;inside-out&quot; reading of forms like the date creation above. Starting from the inside, you
* get a new Random
* get the next random integer
* cast it to a long
* pass the long to the Date constructor
You don't have to write inside-out code in Clojure. The -&gt; macro takes its first form, and passes it as the first argument to its next form. The result then becomes the first argument of the next form, and so on. It is easier to read than to describe:
      1	(-&gt; (Random.) (.nextInt) (long) (Date.))
      2	-&gt; #&lt;Date Sun Dec 21 12:47:20 EST 1969&gt;

=====Load and Reload=====

The REPL isn't for everything. For work you plan to keep, you will want to place your source code in a separate file. Here are the rules of thumb to remember when creating your own Clojure namespaces.

1. Clojure namespaces (a.k.a. libraries) are equivalent to Java packages.

2. Clojure respects Java naming conventions for directories and files, but Lisp naming conventions for namespace names. So a Clojure namespace com.my-app.utils would live in a path named com/my_app/utils.clj. Note especially the underscore/hyphen distinction.

3. Clojure files normally begin with a namespace declaration, e.g.
      (ns com.my-app.utils)

4. The syntax for import/use/refer/require presented in the previous sections is for REPL use. Namespace declarations allow similar forms&amp;mdash;similar enough to aid memory, but also different enough to confuse. The following forms at the REPL:
      1	(use 'foo.bar)
      2	(require 'baz.quux)
      3	(import '[java.util Date Random])
would look like this in a source code file:
      1	(ns
      2	 com.my-app.utils
      3	 (:use foo.bar)
      4	 (:require baz.quux)
      5	 (:import [java.util Date Random]))
Symbols become keywords, and quoting is no longer required.

5. At the time of this writing, the error messages for doing it wrong with namespaces are, well, opaque. Be careful.

Now let's try creating a source code file. We aren't going to bother with explicit compilation for now. Clojure will automatically (and quickly) compile source code files on the classpath. Instead, we can just add Clojure (.clj) files to the src directory.

1. Create a file named student/dialect.clj in the src directory, with the appropriate namespace declaration:
      (ns student.dialect)
2. Now, implement a simple canadianize function that takes a string, and appends , eh?
      (defn canadianize [sentence] (str sentence &quot;, eh&quot;))
3. From your REPL, use the new namespace:
      (use 'student.dialect)
4. Now try it out.
      1	(canadianize &quot;Hello, world.&quot;)
      2	-&gt; &quot;Hello, world., eh&quot;
5. Oops! We need to trim the period off the end of the input. Fortunately, clojure.contrib.str-utils2 provides chop. Go back to student/dialect.clj and add require in clojure.contrib.str-utils2:
      (ns student.dialect (:require [clojure.contrib.str-utils2 :as s]))
6. Now, update canadianize to use chop:
      (defn canadianize [sentence] (str (s/chop sentence) &quot;, eh?&quot;))
7. If you simply retry calling canadianize from the repl, you will not see your new change, because the code was already loaded. However, you can use namespace forms with reload ( or reload-all) to reload a namespace (and its dependencies).
      (use :reload 'student.dialect)
8. Now you should see the new version of canadianize:
      1	(canadianize &quot;Hello, world.&quot;)
      2	-&gt; &quot;Hello, world, eh?&quot;

=== Functional Programming ===
==== Anonymous Functions ====

Clojure supports [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_functions anonymous functions] using &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; or the shorter [http://clojure.org/reader reader macro] &lt;code&gt;#(..)&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;#(..)&lt;/code&gt; is convenient due to its conciseness but is somewhat limited as &lt;code&gt;#(..)&lt;/code&gt; form ''cannot be nested''.

Below are some examples using both forms:
&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; ((fn [x] (* x x)) 3)
9

user=&gt; (map #(list %1 (inc %2)) [1 2 3] [1 2 3])
((1 2) (2 3) (3 4))

user=&gt; (map (fn [x y] (list x (inc y))) [1 2 3] [1 2 3])
((1 2) (2 3) (3 4))

user=&gt; (map #(list % (inc %)) [1 2 3])
((1 2) (2 3) (3 4))

user=&gt; (map (fn [x] (list x (inc x))) [1 2 3])
((1 2) (2 3) (3 4))

user=&gt; (#(apply str %&amp;) &quot;Hello&quot;)
&quot;Hello&quot;

user=&gt; (#(apply str %&amp;) &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;, &quot; &quot;World!&quot;)
&quot;Hello, World!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in &lt;code&gt;#(..)&lt;/code&gt; form, &lt;code&gt;%N&lt;/code&gt; is used for arguments (1 based) and &lt;code&gt;%&amp;&lt;/code&gt; for the rest argument. &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is a synonym for &lt;code&gt;%1&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Lazy Evaluation of Sequences ====

This section tries to walk through some code to give a better
feel for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation lazy evaluation] of sequences by Clojure and how that might be useful. We also measure memory and time to understand whats happening better.

Consider a scenario where we want to do a &lt;code&gt;big-computation&lt;/code&gt;
(1 second each) on records in a list with a billion items.
Typically we may not need all the billion items processed
(e.g. we may need only a filtered subset).

Let's define a little utility function &lt;code&gt;free-mem&lt;/code&gt;
to help us monitor memory usage and another function
&lt;code&gt;big-computation&lt;/code&gt; that takes 1 second to do
its job.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn free-mem [] (.freeMemory (Runtime/getRuntime)))

(defn big-computation [x] (Thread/sleep 1000) (* 10 x))
&lt;/source&gt;

In the functions above we use [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html java.lang.Runtime] and [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html java.lang.Thread] for getting free memory and supporting sleep.

We will also be using the built in function &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt;
to measure our performance.

Here is a simple usage at REPL:

&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (defn free-mem [] (.freeMemory (Runtime/getRuntime)))
#'user/free-mem

user=&gt; (defn big-computation [x] (Thread/sleep 1000) (* 10 x))
#'user/big-computation

user=&gt; (time (big-computation 1))
&quot;Elapsed time: 1000.339953 msecs&quot;
10
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we define a list of 1 billion numbers called &lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (time (def nums (range 1000000000)))
&quot;Elapsed time: 0.166994 msecs&quot;
#'user/nums
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that it takes Clojure ''only'' 0.17 ms to create a list of 1 billion
numbers. This is because the list is not really '''created'''. The user just
has a promise from Clojure that the appropriate number from this
list will be returned when asked for.

Now, let's say, we want to apply &lt;code&gt;big-computation&lt;/code&gt; to x from 10000 to 10005 from this list.

This is the code for it:
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
;; The comments below should be read in the numbered order
;; to better understand this code.

(time                              ; [7] time the transaction
  (def v                           ; [6] save vector as v
    (apply vector                  ; [5] turn the list into a vector
           (map big-computation    ; [4] process each item for 1 second
                (take 5            ; [3] take first 5 from filtered items
                      (filter      ; [2] filter items 10000 to 10010
                        (fn [x] (and (&gt; x 10000) (&lt; x 10010)))
                        nums)))))) ; [1] nums = 1 billion items
&lt;/source&gt;

Putting this code at the REPL, this is what we get:

&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (free-mem)
2598000
user=&gt; (time (def v (apply vector (map big-computation (take 5 (filter (fn [x] (and (&gt; x 10000) (&lt; x 10010))) nums))))))
&quot;Elapsed time: 5036.234311 msecs&quot;
#'user/v
user=&gt; (free-mem)
2728800
&lt;/pre&gt;

The comments in the code block indicate the working of this
code. It took us ~5 seconds to execute this. Here are some points
to note:
* It did not take us 10000 seconds to filter out item number 10000 to 10010 from the list
* It did not take us 10 seconds to get first 5 items from the list of 10 filtered list
* Overall, it took the computation ''only'' 5 seconds which is basically the computation time.
* The amount of free memory is virtually the same even though we now have the promise of a billion records for processing. (It actually seems to have gone up a bit due to garbage collection)


Now if we access v it takes negligible time.
&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (time (seq v))
&quot;Elapsed time: 0.042045 msecs&quot;
(100010 100020 100030 100040 100050)
user=&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another point to note is that a lazy sequence does not mean that
the computation is done every time; once the computation is
done, it gets cached.

Try the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
user=&gt; (time (def comps (map big-computation nums)))
&quot;Elapsed time: 0.113564 msecs&quot;
#'user/comps

user=&gt; (defn t5 [] (take 5 comps))
#'user/t5

user=&gt; (time (doall (t5)))
&quot;Elapsed time: 5010.49418 msecs&quot;
(0 10 20 30 40)

user=&gt; (time (doall (t5)))
&quot;Elapsed time: 0.096104 msecs&quot;
(0 10 20 30 40)

user=&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the first step we map &lt;code&gt;big-computation&lt;/code&gt; to a billion &lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt;. Then we define a function &lt;code&gt;t5&lt;/code&gt; that takes 5 computations from comps.
Observe that the first time t5 takes 5 seconds and after that it takes neglegible time. This is because once the calculation is done, the results are cached for later use. Since the result of &lt;code&gt;t5&lt;/code&gt; is also lazy, &lt;code&gt;doall&lt;/code&gt; is needed to force it to be eagerly evaluated before &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; returns to the REPL.

Lazy data structures can offer significant advantage assuming that
the program is designed to leverage that. Designing a program for lazy sequences and infinite data structures is a paradigm shift from eagerly just ''doing the computation'' in languages like C and Java vs ''giving a promise of a computation''.

This section is based on [http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/86276269653a88a5 this mail] in the Clojure group.

==== Infinite Data Source ====

As Clojure supports [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation lazy evaluation] of sequences, it is possible to have infinite data sources in Clojure. The infinite sequence (0 1 2 3 4 5 ....) can be defined using &lt;tt&gt;(range)&lt;/tt&gt; since clojure 1.2:&lt;ref&gt;[http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/range range] on ClojureDocs&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (def nums (range))         ; Old version (def nums (iterate inc 0))
 ;; ⇒ #'user/nums
 (take 5 nums)
 ;; ⇒ (0 1 2 3 4)
 (drop 5 (take 11 nums))
 ;; ⇒ (5 6 7 8 9 10)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we see two functions that are used for create an infinite list of numbers
starting from 0. As Clojure supports lazy sequences, only the required items are generated and taken of the
head of this list. In the above case, if you were to type out &lt;tt&gt;(range)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;(iterate inc
0)&lt;/tt&gt; directly at the prompt, the [http://clojure.org/reader
&lt;tt&gt;reader&lt;/tt&gt;] would continue getting the next number forever and you would
need to terminate the process.

&lt;code&gt;(iterate f x)&lt;/code&gt; is a function that continuously applies f to the
result of the previous application of f to x. Meaning, the result is
&lt;code&gt;...(f(f(f(f .....(f(f(f x)))))...&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;(iterate inc 0)&lt;/code&gt;
first gives 0 as the result, then &lt;code&gt;(inc 0) =&gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;(inc
(inc 0)) =&gt; 2&lt;/code&gt; and so on.

&lt;code&gt;(take n coll)&lt;/code&gt; basically removes &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; items from the collection. There are many variation of this theme:
* (take n coll)
* (take-nth n coll)
* (take-last n coll)
* (take-while pred coll)
* (drop n coll)
* (drop-while pred coll)

The reader is encouraged to look at the [http://clojure.org/sequences Clojure Sequence API] for details.

==== List Comprehension ====

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension List Comprehensions] are the constructs offered by a language that make it easy to
create new lists from old ones. As simple as it sounds, it is a very powerful
concept. Clojure has good support for List comprehensions.

Lets say we want a set of '''all''' &lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt; for all &lt;code&gt;x divisible by 4&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; starting from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.

Here is one way to do it in Clojure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
(def nums (iterate inc 0))
;; ⇒ #'user/nums
(def s (for [x nums :when (zero? (rem x 4))] (inc x)))
;; ⇒ #'user/s
(take 5 s)
;; ⇒ (1 5 9 13 17)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt; is the infinite list of numbers that we saw in the previous
section. We need to &lt;code&gt;(def s ...)&lt;/code&gt; for the set as we are creating an
infinite source of numbers. Running it directly at the prompt will make the
&lt;code&gt;reader&lt;/code&gt; suck out numbers from this source indefinitely.

The key construct here is the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; macro. Here the expression
&lt;code&gt;[x nums ...&lt;/code&gt; says that x comes out of &lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt; one at a
time. The next clause &lt;code&gt;.. :when (zero? (rem x 4)) ..&lt;/code&gt; basically says
that x should be pulled out only if it meets this criteria. Once this x is out,
&lt;code&gt;inc&lt;/code&gt; is applied to it. Binding all this to &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; gives
us an infinite set. Hence, the &lt;code&gt;(take 5 s)&lt;/code&gt; and the expected result
that we see.

Another way to achieve the same result is to use &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
(def s (map inc (filter (fn [x] (zero? (rem x 4))) nums)))
;; ⇒ #'user/s
(take 5 s)
;; ⇒ (1 5 9 13 17)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we create a predicate &lt;code&gt;(fn [x] (zero? (rem x 4)))&lt;/code&gt; and pull out
x's from nums only if this predicate is satisfied. This is done by
&lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;. Note that since Clojure is lazy, what &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;
gives is only a promise of supplying the next number that satisfies the predicate.
It does not (and cannot in this particular case) evaluate the entire list. Once
we have this stream of x's, it is simply a matter of mapping inc to it &lt;code&gt;(map
inc ...&lt;/code&gt;.

The choice between List Comprehension i.e. &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;map/filter&lt;/code&gt; is largely a matter of user preference. There is no
major advantage of one over the other.

=== Lisp ===

==== Sequence Functions ====

===== (first coll) =====

Gets the first element of a sequence.  Returns ''nil'' for an empty sequence or ''nil''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (first (list 1 2 3 4))
 ;; ⇒ 1
 (first (list))
 ;; ⇒ nil
 (first nil)
 ;; ⇒ nil
 (map first [[1 2 3] &quot;Test&quot; (list 'hi 'bye)])
 ;; ⇒ (1 \T hi)
 (first (drop 3 (list 1 2 3 4)))
 ;; ⇒ 4
&lt;/source&gt;

===== (rest coll) =====

Gets everything ''except'' the first element of a sequence.  Returns ''nil'' for an empty sequence or ''nil''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (rest (list 1 2 3 4))
 ;; ⇒ (2 3 4)
 (rest (list))
 ;; ⇒ nil
 (rest nil)
 ;; ⇒ nil
 (map rest [[1 2 3] &quot;Test&quot; (list 'hi 'bye)])
 ;; ⇒ ((2 3) (\e \s \t) (bye))
 (rest (take 3 (list 1 2 3 4)))
 ;; ⇒ (2 3)
&lt;/source&gt;

===== (map f colls*) =====

Applies ''f'' lazily to each item in the sequences, returning a lazy sequence of the return values of ''f''.

Because the supplied function always returns true, these both return a sequence of ''true'', repeated ten times.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (map (fn [x] true) (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ (true true true true true true true true true true)
 (map (constantly true) (range 10)) 
 ;; ⇒ (true true true true true true true true true true)
&lt;/source&gt;

These two functions both multiply their argument by 2, so (map ...) returns a sequence where every item in the original is doubled.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (map (fn [x] (* 2 x)) (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ (0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18)
 (map (partial * 2) (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ (0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18)
&lt;/source&gt;

(map ...) may take as many sequences as you supply to it (though it requires at least one sequence), but the function argument must accept as many arguments as there are sequences.

Thus, these two functions give the sequences multiplied together:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (map (fn [a b] (* a b)) (range 10) (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ (0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81)
 (map * (range 10) (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ (0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81)
&lt;/source&gt;

But the first one will only take two sequences as arguments, whereas the second one will take as many as are supplied.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (map (fn [a b] (* a b)) (range 10) (range 10) (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong number of args passed
 (map * (range 10) (range 10) (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ (0 1 8 27 64 125 216 343 512 729)
&lt;/source&gt;

(map ...) will stop evaluating as soon as it reaches the end of any supplied sequence, so in all three of these cases, (map ...) stops evaluating at 5 items (the length of the ''shortest'' sequence,) despite the second and third giving it sequences that are longer than 5 items (in the third example, the longer sequence is of ''infinite'' length.)

Each of these takes a a sequence made up solely of the number 2 and a sequence of the numbers (0 1 2 3 4) and multiplies them together.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (map * (replicate 5 2) (range 5))
 ;; ⇒ (0 2 4 6 8)
 (map * (replicate 10 2) (range 5))
 ;; ⇒ (0 2 4 6 8)
 (map * (repeat 2) (range 5))
 ;; ⇒ (0 2 4 6 8)
&lt;/source&gt;

===== (every? pred coll) =====

Returns true if ''pred'' is true for every item in a sequence. False otherwise.  ''pred'', in this case, is a function taking a single argument and returning true or false. 

As this function returns ''true'' always, (every? ...) evaluates to true. Note that these two functions say the same thing.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (every? (fn [x] true) (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ true
 (every? (constantly true) (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ true
&lt;/source&gt;

(pos? x) returns true when its argument is greater than zero. Since (range 10) gives a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 and (range 1 10) gives a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10, (pos? x) returns false once for the first sequence and never for the second.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (every? pos? (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ false
 (every? pos? (range 1 10))
 ;; ⇒ true
&lt;/source&gt;

This function returns true when its argument is an even number.  Since the range between 1 and 10 and the sequence (1 3 5 7 9) contain odd numbers, (every? ...) returns false.

As the sequence (2 4 6 8 10) contains only even numbers, (every? ...) returns true.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (every? (fn [x] (= 0 (rem x 2))) (range 1 10))
 ;; ⇒ false
 (every? (fn [x] (= 0 (rem x 2))) (range 1 10 2))
 ;; ⇒ false
 (every? (fn [x] (= 0 (rem x 2))) (range 2 10 2))
 ;; ⇒ true
&lt;/source&gt;

If I had a need, elsewhere, to check if a number were even, I might, instead, write the following, making (even? num) an actual function before passing it as an argument to (every? ...)
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (defn even? [num] (= 0 (rem num 2)))
 ;; ⇒ #&lt;Var: user/even?&gt;
 (every? even? (range 1 10 2))
 ;; ⇒ false
 (every? even? (range 2 10 2))
 ;; ⇒ true
&lt;/source&gt;


'''''Complementary function:''''' (not-every? pred coll)

Returns the complementary value to (every? pred coll).  False if ''pred'' is true for all items in the sequence, true if otherwise.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (not-every? pos? (range 10))
 ;; ⇒ true
 (not-every? pos? (range 1 10))
 ;; ⇒ false
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Looping and Iterating ====

Three different ways to loop from 1 to 20, increment by 2, printing the loop index each time (from [http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/217e99b88125af01/857df37052447014?lnk=gst&amp;q=loop#857df37052447014 mailing list discussion]):

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 ;; Version 1
 (loop [i 1]
   (when (&lt; i 20)
     (println i)
     (recur (+ 2 i))))
 
 ;; Version 2
 (dorun (for [i (range 1 20 2)]
          (println i)))
 
 ;; Version 3
 (doseq [i (range 1 20 2)]
   (println i))
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Mutual Recursion ====

Mutual recursion is tricky but possible in Clojure. The form of (defn ...) allows the body of a function to refer to itself or previously existing names only. However, Clojure does allow dynamic redefinition of function bindings, in the following way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 ;;; Mutual recursion example
 
 ;; Forward declaration
 (def even?)
 
 ;; Define odd in terms of 0 or even
 (defn odd? [n]
   (if (zero? n)
       false
       (even? (dec n))))
 
 ;; Define even? in terms of 0 or odd
 (defn even? [n]
   (if (zero? n)
       true
       (odd? (dec n))))
 
 ;; Is 3 even or odd?
 (even? 3) 
 ;; ⇒ false
&lt;/source&gt;

Mutual recursion is not possible in internal functions defined with &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;. To declare a set of private recursive functions, you can use the above technique with &lt;code&gt;defn-&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;defn&lt;/code&gt;, which will generate private definitions.

However one can emulate mutual recursive functions with &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;recur&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
(use 'clojure.contrib.fcase)

(defmacro multi-loop
  [vars &amp; clauses]
  (let [loop-var  (gensym &quot;multiloop__&quot;)
        kickstart (first clauses)
        loop-vars (into [loop-var kickstart] vars)]
    `(loop ~loop-vars
       (case ~loop-var
          ~@clauses))))

(defn even?
  [n]
  (multi-loop [n n]
    :even (if (zero? n)
            true
            (recur :odd (dec n)))
    :odd  (if (zero? n)
            false
            (recur :even (dec n)))))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Collection Abstractions ===

=== Concurrency ===

=== Macros ===

A nice walkthrough on how to write a macro can be found at http://blog.n01se.net/?p=33 by Chouser.

Macros are used to transform data structures at compile time. Let's develop a new &lt;code&gt;do1&lt;/code&gt; macro. The &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; special form of Clojure evaluates all containing forms for their side-effects and returns the return value of the last one. &lt;code&gt;do1&lt;/code&gt; should act similar, but return the value of the first sub-form.

In the beginning one should first think about how the macro should be invoked.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(do1
  :x
  :y
  :z)
&lt;/source&gt;

The return value should be &lt;code&gt;:x&lt;/code&gt;. Then the next step is to think about how we would do this manually.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(let [x :x]
  :y
  :z
  x)
&lt;/source&gt;

This first evaluates :x, then :y and :z. Finally the let evaluates to the result of evaluating :x. This can be turned into a macro using &lt;code&gt;defmacro&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;`&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defmacro do1
  [fform &amp; rforms]
  `(let [x# ~fform]
     ~@rforms
     x#))
&lt;/source&gt;

So what happens here. It is just a simple translation. We use the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; to create a temporary place for the result of our first form to stay. Since we cannot simply use some name (it might be used in the user code), we generate a new one with &lt;code&gt;x#&lt;/code&gt;. The # is a special notation of Clojure to help us: it generates a new name, which is guaranteed to be not used by the user code. The &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; &quot;unquotes&quot; our first form, that is &lt;code&gt;~fform&lt;/code&gt; is replaced by the first argument. Then the &lt;code&gt;~@&lt;/code&gt; is used to inject the remaining forms. Using the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; basically removes one set of () from the following expression. Finally we refer again to the result of the first form with &lt;code&gt;x#&lt;/code&gt;.

We can check the expansion of our macro with &lt;code&gt;(macroexpand-1 '(do1 :x :y :z))&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Libraries ===

The lib package from &lt;code&gt;clojure.contrib&lt;/code&gt; is now integrated into clojure. It is easy to define libraries that can be loaded by other scripts. Suppose we have an awesome &lt;code&gt;add1&lt;/code&gt; function which we want to provide to other developers. So what do we need? First we settle on a namespace, eg. &lt;code&gt;example.ourlib&lt;/code&gt;. Now we have to create a file in the classpath with the filename &quot;example/ourlib.clj&quot;. The contents are pretty straight forward.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(ns example.ourlib)

(defn add1
  [x]
  (add x 1))
&lt;/source&gt;

All we have to do now is to use the functionality of &lt;code&gt;ns&lt;/code&gt;. Suppose we have another file, where we want to use our function. &lt;code&gt;ns&lt;/code&gt; lets us specify our requirements in a lot of ways. The simplest is &lt;code&gt;:require&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(ns example.otherns
  (:require example.ourlib))

(defn check-size
  [x]
  (if (too-small x)
    (example.ourlib/add1 x)
    x))
&lt;/source&gt;

But what if we need the &lt;code&gt;add1&lt;/code&gt; function several times? We have to type always the namespace in front. We could add a &lt;code&gt;(refer 'example.ourlib)&lt;/code&gt;, but we can have this easier. Just use &lt;code&gt;:use&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;:require&lt;/code&gt;! &lt;code&gt;:use&lt;/code&gt; loads the library as &lt;code&gt;:require&lt;/code&gt; does and immediately &lt;code&gt;refer&lt;/code&gt;s to the namespace.

So now we have already two small libraries which are maybe used in a third program. 

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(ns example.thirdns
  (:require example.ourlib)
  (:require example.otherns))
&lt;/source&gt;

Again we can save some typing here. Similar to &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; we can factor out the common prefix of our libraries' namespaces.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(ns example.thirdns
  (:require (example ourlib otherns)))
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course &lt;code&gt;ourlib&lt;/code&gt; contains 738 more functions, not only those shown above. We don't really want to have &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; because bringing in so many names risks conflicts, but we also don't want to type the namespace all the time either. So the first thing we do is employ an &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt;. But wait! You guessed it: &lt;code&gt;ns&lt;/code&gt; helps us again.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(ns example.otherns
  (:require (example [ourlib :as ol])))
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;:as&lt;/code&gt; takes care of the aliasing and now we can refer to our &lt;code&gt;add1&lt;/code&gt; function as &lt;code&gt;ol/add1&lt;/code&gt;!

Up to now it is already quite nice. But if we think a bit about our source code organization, we might end up with the insight that 739 functions in one single file is maybe not the best idea to keep around. So we decide to do some refactoring. We create a file &quot;example/ourlib/add1.clj&quot; and put our functions there. We don't want the user to have to load many files instead of one, so we modify the &quot;example/ourlib.clj&quot; file to load any additional files as follows.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(ns example.ourlib
  (:load &quot;ourlib/add1&quot;
         &quot;ourlib/otherfunc&quot;
         &quot;ourlib/morefuncs&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

So the user still loads the &quot;public&quot; example.ourlib lib, which takes care of loading the rest. (The :load implementation includes code to provide the &quot;.clj&quot; suffix for the files being loaded)

For more information see the docstring of require - &lt;code&gt;(doc require)&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The source-filter theory (Fant 1960) hypothesizes that an acoustic speech signal can be seen as a source signal, filtered with the resonances in the cavities of the vocal tract downstream from the glottis or the constriction. This simple model for speech synthesis is based on an assumption that the dynamics of the system is linear and separable into three main blocks: a glottal energy (soure), the vocal tract (filter) and the effect of modeling radiation sound that are independent(As shown in the figure on the right).

The glottal source roughly matches the subglottal systems, while vocal tract (VT) corresponds to the supra-glottal system. The radiation block can be considered as a converter, which converts volume velocity in to acoustic pressure.In general, the radiation characteristic R(f) and the spectrum envelop of the source function S(f) for the glottal source are smooth and monotonic functions of frequency. The transfer function T(f), however, is usually characterized by several peaks corresponding to resonances of the acoustic cavities that form the vocal tract. Manipulating the shape of these cavities results in the positions and amplitudes of the peaks. Figure on the left qualitatively shows the configuration of vocal tract corresponding to a vowel. The forms of the source spectrum S(f), the transfer function T(f), the radiation characteristic R(f), and the sound pressure pr(f) is shown in each case. 

The transfer function T(f) is determined by applying the theory of sound propagation in tubes of arbitrary shape. For frequencies up to 5000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the cross dimensions of vocal tract are less than a wavelength of the sound. Therefore, the sound propagation can be considered as plane waves parallel to the axis of the tube and the vocal tract can be viewed as an acoustic tube of varying diameter.

== vocal tract transfer function==

The vocal tract is approximated as an acoustic tube of a given length composed of a number of sections with different section areas. This is equivalent to the modelling of the sampled vocal tract transfer function (H(s)) as a superposition of a given number of spectral poles and zeros, which in spectral domain can be represented by

&lt;math&gt;
H(s)= k\begin{matrix} \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{s-s_{ai}}{s-s_i}\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where K is constant, s&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;,s&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;,..are the zeros of H(s), s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... are the poles. for this equation, the poles and zeros mostly occur in complex conjugate pairs, and the real parts of these complex frequencies are much less than the imaginary parts which means that the peak energy lost in one cycle is much less than the energy stored in one cycle of the oscillation. Therfeore, the poles of H(s) can be expressed as below:

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{k_n}\begin{matrix} \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{s_i{s_i}^*}{(s-s_i)(s-{s_i}^*)}\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where Kp is a constant and the stars indicate complex conjugates. Natural frequencies of vocal tract are represented by poles and the imaginary parts indicate formant frequencies which refers to frequencies at which oscillations happen in the absence of excitation and the real parts give the rates of decay of theses oscillations. In the other words, depending on the shape of the acoustic tube (mainly influenced by tongue position), a sound wave travelling through it will be reflected in a certain way so that interferences will generate resonances  at certain frequencies. These resonances are called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant formants] . Their location largely determines the speech sound that is heard.

== Acoustic interpretation of transfer function==
[[Image:Vocal tract as tubes with varying cross section.jpg|thumb|Vocal tract as tubes with varying cross section|300px]]

According to acoustics of tubes, Pressure and volume velocity of a tube at the end of tube (x=L) can be related to the variables at beginning of the tube (x=0). The following transfer matrix expresses the acoustical relationship between two sides of a tube in frequency domain:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
P_0 \\
U_0\\
\end{bmatrix}
=T(\omega)* \begin{bmatrix}
P_L \\
U_L \\
\end{bmatrix},   T(\omega)=
\begin{bmatrix}
 a_{11} &amp; a_{22} \\
 a_{21} &amp; a_{22}\\
 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
a_{11}=cos(KL), a_{21}=jsin(KL)/(\rho*c), a_{21}=\rho*c*jsin(KL), a_{22}=cos(KL) 
&lt;/math&gt;

where K is the wave number, and L is the length of the tube.The aboved mentioned relation can be used to calculate the state of the wave field at one location, having on hand te state of the field at another location.

Since the vocal tract can be considered as n tubes with different cross section (see figure on the right), the transer function can be used to relate the states between glottis and the radiate sound:

:&lt;math&gt;
T(\omega)=T_1(\omega)*T_2(\omega)*T_3(\omega)*....*T_n(\omega)
&lt;/math&gt;

and the overall equation for vocal tract becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
P_g \\
U_g\\
\end{bmatrix}
=T(\omega)* \begin{bmatrix}
P_r \\
U_r \\
\end{bmatrix}, where P_r=U_r*Z_{rad} 
&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, Z&lt;sub&gt;rad&lt;/sub&gt; is the radiation imedance. Up to a frequency of about 6000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the acoustic radiation impedance can be written approximately as:

:&lt;math&gt;
Z_{rad}=\rho*c/A_m*(\pi*f^2/c^2*A_m)*K_s(f)+j*2*\pi*f*\rho*(0.8a)/A_m
&lt;/math&gt;

where A is the area of the mouth opening, a is the effective radius, and K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(f)is adimensionless frequency dependant factor that accounts for baffling effect of the head.

The Transfer function of the system can be calculated as fallows:

:&lt;math&gt;
H(\omega)=U_r/U_g 
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the eqations result in:

:&lt;math&gt;
P_r(\omega)=U_g(\omega)*H(\omega)*Z_{rad}(\omega) 
&lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen the equation above, expressses the pressure in front of the mouse with a source, filter and radiation characteristics of the mouse. This equation describes the source filter theory mentioned in the first section.

== Effects of vocal tract wall and other losses==

In previous section vocal tract is modeled as a system without losses, except the termination impedance term. However, There are some other second order effects that are necessary for precise modelling, such as wall effects, heat conduction and viscosity, glottal opennig. These loses can change band-widths of the resonances frequencies. Also, they can change or shift resonance frequencis. 
 

== Resonant frequencies of air in a tube ==

The relationship between vocal tract shape and transfer function is complex -we will consider the simple case of a uniform tube. The vocal tract in a vowel can be approximated by a tube which is closed at one end (the glottis) and open at the other (the lips).
For a relatively unconstricted vocal tract, the resonances of a 17&amp;nbsp;cm vocal tract occur at the following frequencies:
 f= n * c / 4 * L for n = 1, 3, 5, ...
f = formant frequency in Hz
c = speed of sound 34,000&amp;nbsp;cm/s
L= length of vocal tract in cm

So the lowest formant frequency in a 17&amp;nbsp;cm. vocal tract is:

f = c / 4 * L
= 34,000 / 4 * 17
= 500&amp;nbsp;Hz

And the spacing between formants is:
f = 2 *c / 4 * L
= c / 2 * L (always twice the lowest f)
= 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz

Therefore, formant frequencies are: F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=500, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=1500, F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=2500, F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=3500.

== Two Tube Vocal Tract Models of Vowels==
[[Image:tube a.jpg|thumb|Two tube model for vowel /a/|left|300px]]
[[Image:tube i.jpg|thumb|Two tube model for vowel /i/|right|300px]]

Two resonators or uniform tubes of different cross sectional areas can be connected to approximate some vowels or consonants. In this case, natural frequencies of the whole system are not simply the frequencies for each tube because of acoustic coupling. figures() shows different configuration of tubes to simulate vowels /a/, /i.

Typical values (for an adult male vocal tract for vowel /a/) are l1 = 8&amp;nbsp;cm, l2 = 9&amp;nbsp;cm with A1 = 5 cm2, A2 = 0.5 cm2.  Acoustic theory predicts that there will be resonances at 944&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1063&amp;nbsp;Hz, 2833&amp;nbsp;Hz. The narrow and wide tubes can be considered as separate tubes with resonance frequencies obeying the one stated in previous section for a tube. However, the acoustic impedance at the boundary between two tubes is not zero, thus effects the natural frequencies of the tubes. The natural frequencies of the combined system are the frequencies for which the sum of the reactances at the junction is zero that is:

:&lt;math&gt;
-\rho*c/A_1 cot(KL_1)+\rho*c/A_2tan(KL_2)=0
&lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that when the natural frequencies of the tubes are remote from one another, the influence of coupling is small.

Typical values for vowel /i/ in the human vocal tract are l1 = 9&amp;nbsp;cm, l2 = 8&amp;nbsp;cm, A1 = 5 cm2, A2 = 0.5 cm2. Thus, in theory, F1 = 202&amp;nbsp;Hz, F2 = 1890&amp;nbsp;Hz, F3 = 2125&amp;nbsp;Hz.

== Four Tube Vocal Tract Models of Vowels==
[[Image:four tube model model.jpg|thumb|four tube model|400px]]

Four tube models of vowels provide a much better estimate of formant frequencies for a wider range of vowels than do two tube models and so are more a more popular method of modeling vowels. Such models consist of a lip tube (tube 1) a tongue constriction tube (tube 3) and unconstricted tubes either side of the constriction tube. This model is controlled by three parameters. They are i) the position of the centre of tube 3, ii) the cross-sectional area of tube 3, and iii) the ratio of the length to the cross-sectional area at the lip section. For extreme back constrictions tube 4 disappears whilst for extreme front constrictions tube 2 disappears.

Calculations of resonance frequencies using the 4 tube model are quite complex and so Fant (1960) supplied a (fairly complex) graphical representation of the relationship between the three parameters and the resultant formant frequencies. These graphical representations are called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomograms nomograms]. The original versions of these nomograms supply, for a continuous range of x constriction positions (i.e. distance from the centre of the tongue constriction to the glottis) a continuous range of resultant F1 to F5 values. The original nomograms do this for 5 values of lip area (A1) and for two values of tongue constriction cross-sectional area (A3). For different vocal tract lengths, different nomograms need to be computed.

The four tube, three parameter, model provides a sufficiently accurate prediction of most vowel sounds, but cannot model nasalisation of vowels.

=Rhetorical Nature of Technical and Professional Writing=

Communication in the workplace is practiced and accomplished for many practical purposes. The goal is to effectively convey information to an audience, whether it be to co-workers or someone with greater responsibilities in the workplace. Workplace writing differs from written communication in other contexts, such as educational or social arenas. In the workplace, writing is considered a legal document and is frequently archived or retained for several years at a time. These writings can be referenced to in the future if legal complications arise. Workplace writing also varies from typical writing due to the fact that the audience is generally reading documents not for entertaining nor teaching themselves; it should contain important, relevant and needed information only, with no redundancy. 

==Reader-Centric Writing== 

Workplace writing should always focus on the audience; what does the reader need to know? Writing should effectively convey the precise information that the reader is seeking. If the writing is an attempt to persuade the reader, then the writer must consider what will persuade the reader most. For example, a work team may be writing a proposal to install new production machinery in a factory. Different readers in the company will want different information from this proposal. A well-written document will consider every potential reader and give the information that each reader is seeking.

Throughout all of your work, constantly think about your readers. As you make each writing decision, consider your readers' characteristics, goals, expectations, situation, and other factors that will shape their response to what you say. Concentrate on crafting a communication that will be persuasive and usable in your readers' eyes. These are two important qualities of successful work-related communications. Focus specifically on the ways your readers will respond, moment by moment, while they are reading your communication. This will be the only opportunity to influence your readers directly.

==Effective Workplace Writing==

Workplace writing must be persuasive and usable to all potential readers. For a document to be efficient, it must be easily understood by the intended audience.  It is important to use simple sentences, words, and structure so that all that view the document can comprehend it. A document that is hard to understand is not usable or effective, since the audience will be unable to properly understand the document. Highly usable writing should help readers quickly locate, understand, and use the information to complete their task(s). It can be used as a reference, a how-to, or a means for them to see your progress on your own tasks and what still needs to be done.

Persuasive writing should convince readers that the information is accurate and should be followed.  For example, a reader may be considering several different proposals.  The chosen proposal is most likely to be the one that is most persuasive; however, if writing is not persuasive, then it is not likely to be followed.  Thus, the entire writing effort will have been wasted.  It is pertinent to understand, though, that being persuasive does '''NOT''' mean conducting unethical behavior. Do not write a document to simply to have yours preferred or chosen over others.  Always be sure to use ethical practices.

Some ethical practice questions to ask yourself:
''Did I cite my sources?''
''Did I use credible information?''
''Did I &quot;twist&quot; any information?''
''Am I using the correct language?''
''Am I only telling the truth, no &quot;bluffing&quot;?''
''Am I being realistic?''
''Am I being timely?''
''Am I being accurate?''
''Am I giving a correct assessment and perception of what will be done?''

==How Writers and Readers Interact==

Writers and readers interact in unique ways. In all cases, writing is a one-way flow of information. Therefore, writers must consider and include all of their readers' needs. Every reader is different, but an effective writer must anticipate what will be most useful to the audience. Additionally, the world is extremely diverse. Some readers may be more relaxed or open-minded than others. For this reason, writers must learn to be conscientious in their writing to ensure they won't discourage or offend any of their readers. If a reader is offended, any decision made will likely not be made in the writer's favor. Effective writing eliminates unnecessary pieces of information and ensures a concise document.

Different readers may construe different meanings from the same words. The meaning may be shaped by a user's previous experience, culture, or even a user's state of mind. Each reader will construct a meaning based on the context of the writing and their previous experiences. This is why when writing a document you must start with who your audience is and what they need to know. 

Readers react moment by moment when reading a document. Important information will usually have a greater impact if it is placed at the beginning of a document. This ensures that it will be read right away. Many readers will not finish a document, and so this &quot;inverted pyramid&quot; writing style is very effective. In addition, the average business professional says that they do not spend more than 30 seconds reading a resume, and no more than 5 minutes on a business proposal. It is prudent to place the most important information at the beginning of the document and least important at the end. The writer should ensure stylistic continuity as well. A writer attempting humor in a long technical document may confuse the reader; while the same humor, if used while writing about a personal anecdote, may more easily amuse the reader. To reiterate, every reader will have a different reaction to a piece of writing, and these reactions will depend on everything from the context of the writing to the reader's cultural upbringing.

==Basic Assumptions==

It is important to be aware of any assumptions you have around a certain topic. Before acting on the assumptions it is best to research and fully understand the background and experience of that audience or topic. 
[[Professional and Technical Writing/Rhetoric/Assumptions|This section]] discusses assumptions about professional writing.

==Rhetorical Framework==

[[Professional and Technical Writing/Rhetoric/Rhetorical Framework|This section]] discusses relationship between the author and the audience. It is very important to consider your audience when writing, because if the message is not displayed properly then the audience will not listen or understand what you have to say. It is always best to consider your audience when you first begin writing. Having an idea of the background, experiences, and culture of your audience will help you to create a well rounded and well organized document.

==Appreciating Technical Communication Audiences==

[[Professional and Technical Writing/Rhetoric/Audiences|This section]] elaborates on the different types of audiences you may encounter in your professional writing and how to customize your documents for certain audiences.

==The Special Nature of the Subject in Technical Communication==

[[Professional and Technical Writing/Rhetoric/Subject|This section]] focuses on the subject of technical and professional writing and how it differs from other types of writing, such as academic or social styles.

==Developing an Authorial Voice==

[[Professional and Technical Writing/Rhetoric/Author|This section]] deals with how you can develop your authorial voice, specifically focusing on altering your tone based on your audience.

==Persuading the Reader==

[[Professional and Technical Writing/Rhetoric/Purpose|This section]] explains how to use persuasion and to what degree. Almost all documents will be at least somewhat persuasive.

==The Many Contexts of Communicating Technical Information==

[[Professional and Technical Writing/Rhetoric/Context|This section]] clarifies how to communicate effectively in professional settings; this is not limited to writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Resources, as with an essay, are essential to making a game. Without them, many of the things you would like to see would be non-existent from the characters walking around to the title screen and fonts. Resources are the way to make your game original, and to make it look great!

==How to Import Resources==

Well, first things first, let’s tell you how to get them up there. Most of the resources will be images, but some of them are also sound files. Make sure you have something to import and you know its location before you try getting it onto your resources list. Then, make sure that the something you chose is in the correct format: .png or .xyz image files for images, and .midi or .mp3 for audio files.

After you’ve clarified what file type you have and where you put it, it’s time to import. Click on the folder icon label that fits your image or sound (and in some cases, movies, but we won’t get into that) and press the “Import” button. Then choose the file you want to import, and Voila! You’ve got your new resources up!

Now that you know how to import your files, we’re going to talk about the topic they can fit into.

==Types of Resources==

There are several types of resources you can import into. Nineteen in fact. Before you import though, it’s good to know which area your resources are going to be needed in!

===Backdrop===

The backdrop is the background for random encounters. These pictures will be used depending on what you set as the battle background on your map properties (see [[RPG_Maker_2003/Map|Map]]).

===Battle===

The battle folder is used for importing graphics for the battle animations. These usually include graphics such as dark spheres for dark spells, music notes for spells that encompass singing, as well as many others. This allows you to import some color and animations into your battles.

===Battle2===

This is for really really large battle animations. They can be useful for a variety of things like a character walking around the screen to do a move or a really large picture of something that does something.

===BattleCharSet===

This simply means the character sheet you will use during the battle scenes. When you play the game, this sheets allows your battle characters to appear to move, not move, use spells, attack, and many other things. Without this, you would have a very bland game, or at least bland battle sequences.

===BattleWeapon===

As with the BattleCharSet above, these are necessary for battle animations. These are what the characters you create are displayed as using for attacks. You can set each one to use a different set, so each character can have a different mace, sword, and staff.

===CharSet===

One of the most important aspects of RPG Maker 2003 is the CharSet, or Character Set. This is the sheet of sprites that are used to display characters walking in all directions, and allow them to interact with the environment you create.

===ChipSet===

These are what make a map. Please see [[RPG_Maker_2003/ChipSets|The Chip Sets page]].

===FaceSet===

When speaking, you may want some important characters to display faces next to what they say. That’s what the FaceSets do. It’s a collection of squares with a characters face in it, and can be inserted into messages on either the left or the right.

===Frame===

A frame is a graphic that can be laid over the game window. It allows for nice graphics around the screen based on what you want your game to look like, or you could have a demo overlay for when you release your game as a demo.

===GameOver===

These are graphics that will cover the screen either when all characters in the party in your game die, or when a game over event is initiated. These can be customized as you like.

===Monster===

Monster graphics are a necessity for your game if you plan on fighting anything during your battle sequences. This is where you would upload monster graphics for your battles.

===Movie===

Movies can be a big part of your game if you’d like them to. You can create your own, and then upload it to RPG Maker 2003 as an .avi or a .mpg. These can be played at any time during the game using an event.

===Music===

Music files can come as .mid, .wav, or .mp3, and are usually played in the background as something happens, such as a small cutscene, or just someone playing the game. Boring games usually don’t have music, so if your game is heading in that direction, this will be a big part in creating a successful game.

===Panorama===

Panoramas, although not needed, would be nice additions to any game. They allow you to show movement in an environment without having to move any other aspect of the map. You could show an airship flying through the sky by using a sky panorama and making it move on that map.

===Picture===

Pictures are just what their name suggests; they are merely images that will sit stationary on the screen, and can change depending on what keys are pressed, or can be there for a certain amount of time to display a certain idea. Many games, such as the Legend of Zelda: Ages and Seasons, used this to show Link dancing and singing with the oracles.

===Sound===

Like music, this is a very important aspect of the game to prevent boredom. It allows doors to sound like they’re opening, monsters sound like they’re being hit, and any other sounds you can think of.

===System===

System is the set of files used for shop inventories and character item comparisons and for the menu screen. This includes arrows, the color of words, and the frames surrounding different parts of the screen.

===System2===

System2 is the set of files you use for battle meters and indications. This includes arrows to tell you whose turn it is, which monster you are targeting, and how much magic and health you have left.

===Title===

This is the image that will become the title screen. This can be any number of pictures, like the Game Over screen, and is fully customizable to your whims and desires. It still, like all of the other resources, has a pixel size limit to it, and can only be 320X240.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The database holds all important information for creating your perfect RPG. The database is where you can edit the names and looks of your heroes, give them the skills necessary for survival, make items and weapons for them, make monsters to give them a challenge, the attributes that could help or hinder them, as well as many of the crucial layouts of the battle scenes, the animations of their attacks, and what the menus could look like. Without the database, your game might look like everyone elses, and who wants that?

Make sure to read this section so you can get a handle on everything that you need to create the backbone to a successful game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How has mobility affected commerce and services?}}

Mobile commerce (m-commerce) begins by the use of wireless POS (Point Of Sale) swipe terminals. The first m-commerce technologies were through Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and i-mode mobile Internet service. WAP technology paved the way of m-commerce, which has powerfully developed on 3G-phone technology. Nokia was the first to begin m-commerce application with software Nokia toolkit version 4.0. 

Mobile commerce is a sort of e-commerce conducted through cellular phones, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) and other devices with a wireless connection. These technologies give opportunities to small businesses to sell new goods and services and to operate more efficiently.

==Applications==
''Mobile Banking'': Online banking services through a mobile device.
''Wireless Electronic Payments'': Instantly authorization payments can be made directly from your bank.  Micro-payments can replace cash but it has some risk (e.g. fraud).
''Mobile Wallet'': enables cardholder to purchasing from their mobile devices.
''Wireless Bill Payments'': are made directly from a cell phone.
''Voice and Mobile Portals'': gives access to information.
''Telemedicine'': provides clinical care to people who don’t have access to local doctors.
''Telemetry'': transmission and receipt of data from remote sensors.

==Benefits==
* ''Selling products or services'': brings buyer and seller together very easily; gives greater profits and it also provides flexibility to conduct business.
* ''Improving productivity'': SMS (short message service) is very useful for workers to have to operate away from their offices.

==Disadvantages==
Today many people are using their cell phones for their business as well as personal communication; it is why a secure mobile line is fundamental. Security issue need to be corrected in order to avoid large problems to companies. Millions of dollars could be in jeopardy if the wrong party get access to details of a transaction. Cell phones require a very secure SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) Card which is a portable memory chip used in some models of cell phones. Gemalto, the world leader in digital security conducted a survey; they found that 40% of Americans would purchase more online if security was reinforced, and 49 % would be visit more new merchant websites. People use cell phones more and more because they can work from any location and also because they don’t want to be tied to a computer, this might eliminate the use of a laptop in the near future. Mobile commerce technology is advancing as much as security issue is growing. With no security in doing mobile transactions the financial world could be in a huge chaos. Thieves would have easy access to our personal information or our banking account information. Business transactions and banks won’t be secure anymore; even national security could be in jeopardy.  The need of secure mobile lines is paramount. Mobile security is an issue that is needed to be paid attention right now.

      <comment>Slight re-write of introduction</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This book covers the subject of '''Ecclesiatical Latin''', in the form in current use by the Catholic Church.  As such, it is not a primer on Classical Latin.  These two idioms of the Latin languages are mutually understandable but usage and subject matter often differ considereably between them.

Ecclesiastical Latin is also a living language that regularly adopts and develops new vocabulary, grammar rules, idioms and even letters to adapt itself to the requirements of communication.  As a language, Latin is an orally spoken system of communication and is not in and of itself holy in the eyes of the Catholic Church.  However, since the Church has a long history of expressing herself on very important matters in this language, as well as continuing a regimen of prayer life in the Liturgy of the Hours in this language, it is fitting that the Church retain and even promote Latin, as well as the other seven liturgical languages, even in this age of moving toward the vernacular.

Several writing conventions will be used in this book that do not agree with the current writing conventions used for Classical Latin.  Ecclesiastical Latin does not use Macrons, but does however use the letter &quot;j&quot; where appropriate.  V and U are always differentiated.  Many words may be spelled slightly differently from time to time depending on how the word is pronounced.  There is not the same idea of &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;incorrect&quot; spelling that exist in Classical Latin or in modern English.  Rather, there is &quot;acceptable&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; spelling.  

In the book, we will focus on the study of the grammatical points needed and the vocabulary used in basic Latin prayers, passages from the Vulgate Bible, phrases from the Roman Liturgy, and excerpts from the writings of Church Doctors.  We will also focus on understanding rather than translation.  

From this foundation, we will also attempt to develop chapters that will instruct the student in how to memorize the various prayers and learn how to speak Latin for everyday life.

      <comment>Clean-up of language. Grammatical corrections.  Redrafted into an impersonal form to avoid use of &quot;we&quot; and &quot;you&quot;.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The first and most basic sentence pattern can be described as follows:

Nominative Noun (NN) + esse.    '''NN  + esse.'''

A noun in the nominative case is expressed followed by the appropriate form of the verb ''esse''.  

This sentence pattern is used to say that something exists, i.e. &quot;it is&quot; or &quot;it exists&quot; or &quot;there is&quot;.

To say &quot;It is a tree&quot; all that is needed is to take the nominative case of Arbor and then place the correct form of ''esse'' after it, i.e. ''Arbor est.''

When using a personal pronoun in Latin, such as &quot;I, you, he, she, we, them&quot;, it is not necessary to state the pronoun; the correct form of ''esse'' can be used by itself.  Latin is described as being a [[w:Wikipedia:Pro-drop language|Pro-drop language]] because it allows the speaker to omit or drop the subject pronoun.

To say &quot;I am&quot; or &quot;I exist&quot; it is not necessary to say &quot;''ego sum''&quot;.  It is generally sufficient to say &quot;''sum''&quot; unless a little more emphasis is required, in which case the word &quot;''ego''&quot; is used on its own.  This can be translated as &quot;I and nobody else&quot;.  The form &quot;''ego sum''&quot; would be very rarely used. In the Vulgate translation of the Bible, the translator often uses &quot;''ego sum''&quot; when Jesus is speaking and this is taken as an affirmation of his Divinity.


Here is another, very similar, sentence pattern:

'''NN1 NN2 + esse.'''

In this pattern, the verb normally (but not necessarily) goes at the end of the sentence.  Noun One, in the nominative case, is considered to be equal to Noun Two, which is also in the nominative case.  This differs from what would be expected in English, where the object form of words must be used after the verb per [[w:Wikipedia:Subject-object-verb|English Word Order rules]].  

In English one would say &quot;I am the teacher&quot; but the word &quot;I&quot; has to be changed to &quot;me&quot; if the word order of the sentence changed, as in &quot;The teacher is me&quot;.  However, Latin does not do this.  In both cases the nominative of the noun is used and will not change:  &quot;''Ego magister sum''&quot; or &quot;''Magister ego sum''.&quot;  

Since Latin is a Pro-drop language, this sentence pattern will often sound like the first sentence pattern, giving &quot;''Magister sum''.&quot;  It is understood that an unspoken &quot;''ego''&quot; has been dropped.  

It should also be pointed out that when using '''NN1 NN2 + esse''' it is possible to equate any two nouns, regardless of what grammatical differences may exist between them.  A male noun can be equated with a female noun.  A singular noun can be equated with a plural noun.  A noun with gender can be equated with a noun that does not have gender.

==1. List the necessary tools a beginner needs in leather craft and demonstrate the proper use of each. ==
Most leather craft starter kits come with the following:

* A few pieces of leather
* Stamping tools
* A Mallet
* Swivel knife
* Leather coloring

You will also need a sturdy work surface.

Additionally, if you wish to lace the leather and do not have a pre-punched leather blank, you will need a leather punch.  This tool is similar to a hole punch for paper, but it may have several punch sizes.  These are often arranged in a star-shape so that the device resembles an equestrian spur.

The first step in working with leather is to lay out the design (see requirement 4).

Once the design is ready, the leather should be moistened.  Moistening softens the leather and makes it more amenable to having an impression made on it by the stamp.  The leather is then placed flat on the work surface in front of the crafter.  Then the stamp is placed on a section of the leather where the design calls for an impression to be made.  The crafter carefully holds the stamp in a vertical position with the stamp face held against the leather.  Then the top of the stamp is struck sharply with the mallet.

Once this is done, the stamp is moved to an adjacent area, and the mallet is brought to bear once again.  This is repeated until all the areas that are to be impressed have been impressed.  The crafter may switch to any number of different stamps as called for in the design.

Once the design has been stamped into the leather, the leather may be cut to shape (though cutting can also be done before stamping).

The piece is then ready for a finish.  (See requirement 5).

==2. Know how to distinguish different kinds of leather, such as calf, goat, and imitation leather. What leathers are most suitable for tooling? ==

;Calfskin: Calfskin is a soft leather with dense grain.  The hair follicles are tightly packed in a random pattern.
;Goatskin: Goatskin is softer and generally more stretchy than calfskin, but it too has a dense grain.  The hair follicles are arranged in rows.  Tanned leather from goatskin is considered extremely durable and is commonly used to make rugs (for example in Indonesia) and carpet binding. It is often used for gloves, boots, and other products that require a soft hide. Kid gloves, popular in Victorian times, are still made today.
;Imitation leather: Imitation leather can be distinguished from genuine leather by its appearance, odor, and feel.  The flesh side of genuine leather is fuzzy, whereas the &quot;flesh&quot; side of imitation leather is either smooth, or even cloth-backed.


Do not be fooled by the term &quot;top grain leather.&quot;  Top grain leather is not, as its name implies, the top layer of the animal's hide.  Leather, in its natural form is quite thick, so it is split into layers.  The outermost layer is called &quot;full grain.&quot;  Top grain leather is the next layer beneath.

The only type of leather suitable for tooling is vegetable tanned, full grain leather. This is because the vegetable tanning process allows the leather to absorb water, which is used to soften the leather before the carving process, and the grain of the leather is necessary to allow the leather to hold the shape after the carving process is complete. Other leathers lack these two essential qualities.

==3. Give the steps necessary in the preparation of leather. ==
All leather needs to be prepared before it can be tooled. The leather carver soaks the leather with water, thus making the leather easier to tool.

One point to note is that if leather is too wet, it will not hold a sharply defined carving. Properly cased leather should be cool to the touch, and should feel like wet clay.

A good way to test if the leather is properly cased is to fold the corner. Properly cased leather should fold smoothly and hold a crease well.

Leather can be cased by spraying it with a mist of water, or by going over it with a damp sponge.

==4. Transfer a design to leather, and tool and lace some object in leather, such as a billfold, magazine cover, belt, key keeper, or small purse. ==
Make (or obtain) a full-size diagram outlining the design on paper.  Place carbon paper on the leather, and then place the pattern on top of it.  Trace over the pattern with a pencil, and the carbon paper will mark the leather.  Be sure to trace where all cuts are to be made, as well as any holes that will need to be punched.  The design may also include a pattern for stamping.

Cut the pieces out with a sharp swivel knife.  Be sure to lay the leather on a surface that will not be damaged by the knife (a regular kitchen cutting board works great for this, but you can also use a piece of scrap wood).

Once the pieces have been cut out, you will need to punch holes with a leather punch to allow the pieces to be laced together.  Select a punch size that is just big enough to allow the lace you have selected to pass through.  Do not lace it up until you have done any tooling you intend to do.  It's a lot easier to tool the leather when it is in its flat, two-dimensional form, versus having to contend with several layers in three dimensions.

After tooling is complete, you can dye or paint the pieces.  When the color is dry, you can lace the pieces together.

==5. Show how to use leather dye. ==
Due to changing environmental laws, alcohol-based dyes are no longer available in some localities. They have been replaced by water-based alternatives, though they tend not to work as well.

Leather dyeing used to involve the use of spirit or alcohol based dyes where alcohol quickly gets absorbed into moistened leather, carrying the pigment deep into the surface. &quot;Hi-liters&quot; and &quot;Antiquing&quot; stains can be used to add more definition to patterns. These have pigments that will break away from the higher points of a tooled piece and so pooling in the background areas give nice contrasts. Leaving parts unstained also provides a type of contrast. The predominant brand of leather dye is Fiebing's Leather Dye.

Alternatives to spirit stains might include a number of options. Shoe polish can be used to dye and preserve leather.

==6. What kind of finish should be used on leather? ==
If the leather is allowed to get wet and is then flexed, the impressions may swell and fade.  Once the color has dried to the crafter's satisfaction, it should be sealed with a sealing agent, such as neatsfoot oil,  linseed oil, or a wax paste.  This will slow the absorption of water by the leather, lengthening the life of the design.

==Basic Idea==

The basic idea of this page is to arrainge the table of contents along the idea of a primer instead of a Grammatical Referance book.  Instead of just giving many list of grammatical forms, we want to set up lessons that will expose the students to the needed grammar, vocabulary, and sentence patterns they will need.  Each lesson should be focused on the sentence pattern and introduce the grammar needed to understand and use the given sentence pattern. 

In latter lessons we will shift from understanding sentence patterns to understanding and practicing various prayers, and reading from the Vulgate and Doctors of the Catholic Church.   

At the bottom of the page I have added a grammatical apendix for showing the various list of grammatical forms.  

It is also my hope to be able to add a section with homework and assignments sheets that can be printed out and completed by the student independently.  

Various links to webpages that deal with appropriate aspects of Ecclesiastical Latin would also be appreciated.

==Why Catholics Pray==

The International Space Station [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station (ISS)] is a research facility laboratory made up of several different modules in a Low Earth Orbit. This facility represents a union of several different space station projects from various different nations. The long-term goals of ISS is to develop the technology necessary for human-based space and planetary exploration and colonization (including life support systems, safety precautions, environmental monitoring in space), new ways to treat diseases, more efficient methods of producing materials, more accurate measurements than would be possible to achieve on Earth, and a more complete understanding of the Universe. 

In order to achieve these objectives, human space flight centers train highly qualified astronauts in order to best perform different tasks on board the ISS. Astronauts spend months at a training facility and in a variety of conditions which simulate the environment of space before going to ISS. A part of astronauts are cross trained to perform a number of tasks. A pilot, for example, might also be trained to carry out scientific experiments, or to work on equipment repairs. Astronauts schedule is usually very dense on ground, and this becomes even more critical on board the ISS. Therefore, care needs to be taken in order to provide astronauts a safe and habitable working environment once they are on orbit.

One of the major problems on board the ISS is the presence of noise. Basically, each module of ISS have equipments such as fans, pumps, compressors, avionics, and other hardware or systems that serve ISS functionality and astronauts’ life support needs. These equipments present a significant acoustics challenge to ISS because of difficulties with controlling the noise produced by various elements provided by international partners. The excessive noise levels from machinery or equipment on ISS has shown to affect crews’ hearing, habitability, safety, productivity, annoyance, and sleep interference. Crew performance concerns include inability to effectively communicate and understand what is being said or what is going on around them (e.g. [http://www.meyersound.com/support/papers/speech/index.htm intelligibility], speech interference, inability to hear alarms or other important auditory cues such as an equipment item malfunctioning, inability to concentrate, strain in vocal cords).

==Normal Hearing Response and Hearing Threshold ==

The sensitivity of hearing mechanism is highly dependant upon the frequency content of the received sound. Human ears can detect sound between frequencies of 20 to 20000 Hz. Intensity of sound is measured in decibels (dB). The decibel is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio (10 log10 (p2/p1)2). The ratio may be power, sound pressure, voltage or intensity or several other things. Sound power level (in dB) of typical sources could be viewed [http://iacamerica.com/usa/reference/bluebook/a_-_sound_power_level_of_typical_sources.html here].
There are several different units to quantize the perceived sound by human ears. We will introduce some of them. The phon is a unit that is related to dB by the psychophysically measured frequency response of the ear. At 1 kHz, readings in phons and dB are, by definition, the same. For all other frequencies, the phon scale is determined by the results of experiments in which healthy volunteers are asked to adjust the loudness of a signal at a given frequency until they judge its loudness is equal to that of a 1 kHz signal [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/hearing.html exercise]. To convert from dB to phons, a [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/dB.html graph] of such results is needed. Such a graph depends on sound level: it becomes flatter at high sound levels. 
Hearing threshold defines the level at which the ear barely perceives the sound. The threshold is frequency-dependent and corresponds to the 0-phon curve. Damage to the hearing mechanism has the effect of raising the hearing threshold, which indicates that higher sound levels are required in order to be heard. The degree of shift in the hearing threshold is used as an index of the amount of hearing impairment incurred; criteria for hearing damage are usually based on shifts in this threshold. 

==dBA==

The human ear does not respond equally to all frequencies: we are much more sensitive to sounds in the frequency range about 1 kHz to 4 kHz than to very low or high frequency sounds. For this reason, sound meters are usually fitted with a filter whose response to frequency is a bit like that of the human ear. If the sound pressure level is given in units of dB(A) or dBA, the &quot;A weighting filter&quot; is used. dBA roughly corresponds to the inverse of the 40 dB (at 1 kHz) equal-loudness curve. Sound pressure level on the dBA scale is easy to measure [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/dB.html link] and is therefore widely used. It is still different from loudness, however, because the filter does not respond in quite the same way as the ear.

==Noise Exposures==
[[Image:Table 1 Permissible noise exposures.jpg|thumb|50px|left|]]

Exposure to excessive and prolonged noise is one major cause of hearing disorders worldwide. Hearing damage result in an increase in hearing threshold. Table 1 shows the duration of exposure to higher sound intensities, set by Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), which will result in no more damage to hearing than that produced by 8 h at 90 dBA. In addition people must not be exposed to steady sound levels above 115 dBA, regardless of the duration.


When the daily noise exposure is composed of two or more periods of noise exposure of difference levels, their combined effect should be considered, rather than the individual effect of each. When people are exposed to different sound levels during the day, the mixed dose (D) must be calculated by using the following formula: 
 &lt;math&gt;D=C1/T1+C2/T2+...+Cn/Tn&lt;/math&gt;

where Cn is the total exposure time at a given noise level and Tn is the total exposure time permitted at that level. If the sum of the fractions equals or exceeds 1, then the mixed exposure is considered to exceed the limit value.

==Intelligibility==

The listeners’ speech comprehension is diminished by the ambient noise and the distortion of the system. One could ensure that a message is clear and intelligible in all situations by measuring the “intelligibility” of the system. 
Speech intelligibility is the degree to which speech can be understood by a listener in a noisy environment. For satisfactory communication the average speech level should exceed that of the noise by 6dB, but lower S/N ratios can be acceptable (Moore, 1997). 
The most common method to rate the speech interference effect of noise is called the Preferred Speech Interference Level (PSIL) shown in the figure bellow. 

[[Image:PSIL.jpg|thumb|top]]

==Noise detection and protection on board the ISS==

In order to determine the total exposure to noise during a given period astronauts wear an audio dosimeter. The astronauts of the ISS are exposed to an average noise level of 72dBA for the entire duration of their stay on the ISS, which can last up to six months. One of the medical flight rules sets noise exposure limits based on a 24-hour exposure level. If the 24-hour noise exposure levels measured by the audio dosimeters exceed 65 dBA, then the crewmembers are directed to wear approved hearing protection devices. Design specifications of 60 dBA for work areas and 50 dBA for sleep areas have been agreed upon as “safety limits” for ISS operations. The use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) is suggested if noise exposure levels exceed 60 dBA, or if the crewmembers are exposed to high intermittent noise periods (e.g. use of exercise devices such as the treadmill, airlock repress, or other short term high noises). 
The ISS specifications take into account the impact of noise on crew hearing (both temporary and permanent threshold shifts), as well as habitability and performance (disrupted communication, irritability, impaired sleep, etc.). 
Use of HPDs during sleep provides additional lowering of the noise input to the inner ear and aids recovery from acoustic trauma sustained during the day. Recovery is more robust in quieter environments such as in an adequately quieted crew sleep station or with the use of hearing protection during high noise exposure periods.
Although hearing protection headsets are available, astronauts do not use them all the time, as they are uncomfortable to wear continuously and make communication with other crewmembers difficult. Since hearing needs to be tested in a quiet environment, researchers' efforts to record in-flight changes in hearing have not been successful because of the continuous noise on the ISS.
Some of the astronauts' reports could be found in the following website: [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=831 SpaceRef]

Read http://www.ddj.com/architect/184405772 and http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2007/5/8/88107

Volatile is defined in terms of C but not defined for the machine itself.  Therefore the CPU, the memory cache and the memory bus may all reorder operations on &quot;volatile&quot; values.  This will '''not''' be thread-safe.  

The Intel x86 architecture is somewhat forgiving because it ''usually'' does memory operations in order.  However, &quot;usually&quot; is not &quot;always&quot;, especially with deeper pipelines and more speculative execution.  On RISC or EPIC CPU architectures code that uses volatile for locking will be totally screwed.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the future of mobile messaging?}}

SMS stands for Short Messaging Service, a communication protocol mainly used on cell phones, enabling the transmission of text messages usually limited to 140 characters. It is believed the first SMS was sent in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;txtN cn B a powerful 2l 4 gud or 4 ill, Allen G. Breed, Globe and Mail, [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061016.gttexting16/BNStory/Technology/ALLEN+G.+BREED]&lt;/ref&gt; on an experimental basis, as very few phones at the time were equipped to receive text messages. SMS did not really take hold for good until about 2000. At the time, Internet chat services (such as ICQ) started offering the possibility of texting to cell-phone users, thereby extending the use of this medium to the non cell-phone using public. Nowadays, most messaging applications bridge the gap to mobile users. SMS is now widely used as a very large percentage of the wireless population have access to this service.

== Sub-culture ==
It can be said that SMS gave birth to its own dialect, as people came up with ways of abbreviating their spelling making it less tedious to use a typical phone keypad. In some cases, SMS has made such a large imprint in peoples' lives, that some conduct a lot of their social business through texting: &quot;do U take me to B yr lawful...&quot;, &quot;4evrUrz&quot;, &quot;URHstry!&quot; - yes, people get fired or ditched through SMS!&lt;ref&gt;Lingo 2 Word, reference site for txt definitions, [http://www.lingo2word.com/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some are concerned that this dialect has a polluting effect on everyday written word as &quot;txt&quot; expressions are leaking into mainstream usage: it is not uncommon for many SMS users to drop expressions like &quot;Gr8&quot;, &quot;BTW&quot;, &quot;How R U?&quot; in written communications such as e-mail, chat sites or even class papers&lt;ref&gt;The Death of English (LOL), Lily Huang, Newsweek, [http://www.newsweek.com/id/150449]&lt;/ref&gt; (the nerve!) where they are not necessarily warranted. People have taken to task this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Comité de lutte contre le langage SMS et les fautes volontaires sur Internet [http://sms.informatiquefrance.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abuse ==
You know a medium has come of age when the spammers and scammers are in on the act. These days people are getting spam and phishing SMS in volume,&lt;ref&gt;Scammers introduce ATM skimmers with built-in SMS notification, Dancho Danchev, ZDNet [http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=2000]&lt;/ref&gt; which also gives rise to another problem. Lately, some mobile carriers have started charging for incoming messages,&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Telus customers to pay for incoming text messages, CBC News, [http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2008/07/08/text-messages.html]&lt;/ref&gt; which is causing users to consider dropping the option (if they can't switch carriers altogether). Another threat is also present in SMS's younger sibling, MMS (for Multimedia Messaging Service), by which users can transmit and receive other content such as pictures, sound files and short video clips. Hackers have come up with ways of contaminating MMS transmissions with worms.&lt;ref&gt;Les vers se propagent aussi par MMS, Grégory Le Bras, Virustraq, [http://www.virustraq.com/actualite/10098/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Future of Messaging ==
SMS is widely used right now, but it has already declined in parts of the world where it is slowly being supplanted by mobile e-mail services,&lt;ref&gt;The History of SMS Messaging, Text Messaging Center, [http://www.tmcsms.com/sms-history.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; such as the one offered by Blackberry. The possibilities that 3G is offering will also have an impact, as the adoption of this standard has increased bandwidth availability and is decreasing per-byte transmission fees. SMS and MMS as protocols are already doomed, destined to be replaced by wireless e-mail. However, for better or for worse, txt is er 2 stA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic Latin alphabet that is used to write Ecclesiastical Latin is as follows;

'''A B C D E F G H I J L M N O P Q R S T U V X'''

This is a total of 22 letters.  These are all the letters that are needed or used to write native Latin words.  

Latin also has 4 additional extra letters that are used in loan words from other languages.
These are;

'''K Y Z W'''

If you see a word with one of these letters it means that the word is not a native Latin word but rather has been borrowed from either Greek or German or some other language.  It also means that even though we are using the word in a Latin sentence, the word still retains its non-Latin identity.  This is similar in English when we use words like Fiance from French which retains it non-English identity.  

Just as many words from French eventually became &quot;anglicized&quot; and lost their non-English identity, so the same happened to many borrowed words in Latin.  We evidence of this in spelling changes.  Words from Greek that were formally spelled with a K to identify them as borrowed words eventually lost their Greek identity and became Latinized.  People just forgot that these words were borrowed and learned them as part of their native language and as such they took on a Latin identity.  When a word such as Kalens was Latinized it changed to Calens, which you may recognize as the origin of the word Calendar. 

'''K''' and '''Y''' represent sounds that are equal to sounds that normal Latin letters make.  '''Z''' and '''W''' represent sounds that do not normally exist within the Latin language and thus can not be converted to a Latin letter.  They may on occasion be written by aproximation using '''DS''' for '''Z''' and '''UU''', or '''UOU''' for '''W'''.  

People who study Classical Latin teach that the letter '''V''' makes the same sound as '''W'''. Whether or not this is true is not at issue here.  What is at issue is that in Ecclesiastical Latin, the letter '''V''' ''never'' makes the same sound as '''W'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vowels in Latin are very easy to learn.  There are only five of them.  This does not mean that there are only five vowel letters, but rather that there are only five vowel sounds.  

This point is difficult for English speakers because English has 18 vowel sounds and has employed many spelling rules to differentiate their various sounds or silence.

This kind of spelling convention only exists in English.  In Latin there are FIVE vowel sounds, only.  Also, there are a total of ZERO silent letters in Latin.  If you see the letter, it means you say the letter.  If the letter is not said, it is not written.  

The Latin vowels are as follows;

'''A E I O U Y'''

They can be learned effectively in two groups.   Here is group one.

*'''A''' sounds like the '''O''' in the English word '''''not'''''.
*'''O''' sounds like the '''O''' in the English word '''''note'''''.
*'''U''' sounds like the '''OO''' in the English word '''''boot'''''.

These letters never make a different sound than what is above.  They may at times sound for a short time or for a long time, with stress or without stress but the actual SOUND of the letter will never change.  

Here is group two.

*'''E''' sounds like the '''E''' in the English word '''''net'''''.
*'''I''' sounds like the '''EE''' in the English word '''''need'''''.
*'''Y''' always sounds like Latin '''I'''.  It is only used in borrowed words and may be accidently written as the letter '''I'''.

Again, it must be pointed out that these vowels will never change the sound they make.  Not today, not tomorrow, not next week, not if there is a an '''E''' at the end of the word, never.

Latin vowels may be long or short but the idea of long and short in Latin is not the same as that in English.  In English we say a vowel is long or short to say that it changes sound.  The English letter '''A''' will sound with as many as five different sounds depending on the other letters around it or more importantly the word it is used it is just memorized to have a certain sound.  The normal way that English speakers think of their vowels is as follows.

'''A''' will sound as either short as in '''Cat''', a sound that does not exist in Latin, or as '''Kate''', a sound that sounds to a Latin as '''EI'''.  

'''E''' will sound short as in '''set''', but long as in '''seat''', a sound that is represented by the Latin letter '''I'''.

'''I''' will sound short as in '''hill''', a sound that does not exist in Latin, or long as in '''Kite''', a sound that sounds to a Latin as '''AI'''.

'''O''' will sound short as in '''hot''', which sounds to a Latin as '''A''', and long as in '''Hope''', which sounds just as a Latin expects '''O''' to sound but with no need for the '''E''' as the end of the word.

'''U''' will sound short as in '''cup''', but this sound does not exist in Latin, and long as in '''cute''', but this sound will sound like '''IU''' or '''JU''' in Latin.


Latin words are spelled exactly as they are spoken, so if the vowel sound changes, then the vowel letter will change.  

You can practice making sure you are using the correct vowel sounds by saying this;

'''Ah'''

'''Eh'''

'''EE'''

'''Oh'''

'''OOh'''

which of course in Latin looks like;


'''A'''

'''E'''

'''I'''

'''O'''

'''U'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General information ==
'''Allosteric regulation''' is the regulation of activities of an enzyme or a protein caused by the binding of regulators at the site other than the active site of the enzyme or protein. Therefore, it causes the active site to change in shape and prevents the binding of the substrate. In that way, the activity of an enzyme is affected. The term &quot;'''allosteric'''&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;'''allo'''&quot; which means &quot;'''other'''&quot;; &quot;'''steric'''&quot; means &quot;'''space'''.&quot; Example of allosteric regulations includes the feedback from downstream products, the feed forward from upstream substrates. An allosteric protein is a protein with multiple ligand-binding sites such that ligand binding at one site affects ligand binding at another, this is known as cooperative binding.

As we have known, an enzyme can convert itself between active and inactive conformations. In the present of regulator, for example, an inhibitor, fewer enzymes are available for free binding of substrates. However, as the inhibitor releases, the enzyme turns back to its original shape and the active site is available for substrate to bind and form product. The substrates form weak bonds with the active site and specificity of binding depends on the precise arrangement of atoms.

== Allosteric activation and inhibition ==
In the cell, the allosteric enzyme, which mostly have two or more subunits, can oscillate from active form to inactive form. Depends on which state of the enzyme, regulators can be used to stabilize the enzyme's conformation; the binding of an activator at regulator site can stabilize the active form of that allosteric enzyme while the binding of an inhibitor stabilizes the inactive form of the enzyme. The subunits of an allosteric enzyme fit together in a way that a conformational change in one subunit is transmitted to all others. through this interaction, a single activator or inhibitor molecule that binds to one regulatory site will affect the active sites of all subunits. In the cell, activators and inhibitors dissociate when at low concentrations which then allows the enzyme to oscillate again. This fluctuation of regulators can cause a sophisticated pattern of response in the activity of cellular enzymes. One example of this is the products of ATP hydrolysis which play a major role in balancing the flow of traffic between anabolic and catabolic pathways depending on their effects on key enzymes. For example, ATP binds to several catabolic enzymes allosterically which lowers their affinity for substrate and as a result inhibits their activity while ADP acts as an activator of the same enzyme. So if ATP production lags behind its use, ADP accumulates and activate these key enzymes that speed up catabolism, producing more ATP. If the supply exceeds demand however, catabolism slows down as ATP molecules accumulate and bind to enzymes, inhibiting them. In this way, allosteric enzymes control the rates of key reaction in metabolic pathways.

*All enzymes must be tightly regulated to perform essential chemical reaction life.

== Cooperativity ==
When the ennzyme can switch back and forth inactive and active form, the active form is not really stable and not always ready for substrates to bind. Copperativity involves the binding of one substrate to one active site (as the enzyme is in an active form)of one subunit triggers and &quot;locks&quot; all the other subunits in their active form in the way that the active form of the enzyme is stabilized, allowing more substrates to bind to other active site of other subunits.

&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Cooperativity_allosteric_activation.jpg‎|700]]
&lt;br/&gt;

==Cooperativity Models==
There are two models that describe and give explanation of the '''''cooperativity''''' binding of ligands. The first model is the '''''concerted model''''' (MWC model) states that there are only two possible forms in which protein can exist. It is either T (tense) or R (relaxed) state. The process of the addition of ligands shifts the protein from T state to R state. In the example of the hemoglobin protein, the ''deoxy'' form is in T state, but the addition of the oxygen ligands to the active sites of the protein, transfers hemoglobin into the ''oxy'' form which corresponds to the R state. 
[[Image:Concerted_Model.jpeg]]

For the T state, because it is &quot;deoxy&quot;, the affinity (the ability for the ligand to bind into the protein) is low, therefore there would be a high concentration of oxygen needed to be saturated. Because the R state is in the fully oxygenated form, it has a higher affinity for oxygen to bind to the protein. However, the model would only be in either the T state or the R state, or else it would not be cooperative.
&lt;br&gt; 
The second model is the '''''sequential model''''' states that the process of addition of ligands to the active site does not completely convert T model to the R model. In example of hemoglobin, when three active sites of the protein are occupied by oxygen ligands, the hemoglobin molecule binds oxygen much more powerfully (appx. Three times) compare to the ''deoxy'' model. 
Each of these two models has advantages and disadvantages; the use of both models at the same time is the best way to approach the precise analysis.
Allosteric enzymes do not obey the Michaelis-Menten equation. The graph will look like a shape &quot;s&quot;, this indicates that the velocity of the reaction depends on the concentration of the substrate.

== Feedback inhibition ==
'''Feedback inhibition''' occurs when an end product synthesized after a chain of anabolic pathways becomes an inhibitor that binds at allosteric site of the first enzyme that made this end product and affects the shape of the enzyme. Thus the enzyme no longer can bind the substrate at its active site. The metabolic pathway is then switch off and can no longer produce the end products that were the same as the inhibitor that bind to the allosteric site. This can be used as a method of metabolic control.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Feedback_Inhibition.jpeg]]
&lt;br&gt;
In the above image, the substrate first attaches itself to the Enzyme 1's active site, and the active site turns the substrate into a shape that is the same as the Enzyme 2's active site. This continues until the substrate turns into a product. The feedback inhibition starts when the product binds to the Enzyme 1's allosteric site, changing the shape of Enzyme 1's active site. Because the active site for Enzyme 1 has changed, the substrate that used to bind to Enzyme 1 can no longer bind to the enzymes anymore. Other kinds of substrate may be able to bind to the changed Enzyme, but may not be able to bind to Enzyme 2's active site. 
&lt;br&gt;

Feedback inhibition usually takes place in organism’s cells, and the inhibition manages the chemical reactions within the cell. Additionally, it can be found in synthesis of amino 
acid and cholesterol.

In amino acids, the pathways of biosynthesis are regulated by feedback inhibition, where one of the enzymes that participated in the reaction is allosterically inhibited by the final product. The feedback inhibition can be used to stop a synthesis reaction if there are too many products being formed by the synthesis. For instance, as the glutamine synthetase in E.coli continues to increase, the cumulative feedback inhibition would bind to an enzyme’s allosteric site, thus changing the enzyme’s formal form, and the glutamine cannot be made.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hemoglobin''' is a protein that is carried by red blood cells. Hemoglobin picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers oxygen to the tissues to maintain cellular viability. It is composed of four polypetide chains with four prosthetic groups. Two of the units have the same amino acid sequences and are called α-chains, the other two identical amino acid sequences are called β-chains. The α-chains and β-chains combine to form the body of hemoglobin. Usually the α-chains combine with the β-chains rather than α-chains and α-chains while β-chains combine with β-chains. The latter is not expressed before birth. Hemoglobin protein which is found only during fetal development is called gamma (γ). It substitutes for the β-chains. Fetals have γ-chains instead of β-chains because it needs a higher affinity for oxygen, so the fetuses can draw sufficient amount of oxygen from the mother. The fetus accomplishes this task by altering the amino acid sequences of the β-chains. γ-chains altered in the way that it removes the two positive charges on the β-chains in which the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). This reduces the affinity for 2,3-BPG. Since 2,3-BPG lowers the affinity for oxygen, reduction in that would increase the fetus' ability to bind to an oxygen. The fact that 2,3-BPG helps hemoglobin protein binding oxygen molecule for more oxygen to be delivered to body tissues is known as '''heterotropic allosteric effect'''. Bisphosphoglycerate (BPG), pH, and carbon dioxide can have an effect on the hemoglobin. In the cell, when the pH decrease, it lowers the affinity of oxygen in the cell and therefore becomes more efficient oxygen tranporter. When the presence of carbon dioxide increases, it lowers the affinity of oxygen in the cell which is another factor that allows cell to become a better oxygen transporter. 

A protein of tetramer, with two α and β units of amino acids or, globin or globular protein and four heme groups that each has an iron atom, and the importance is that Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is, by which bonding to globin group by proximal histidine and oxygen molecules by bent form of geometry by cooperativity for the biological function of the protein such that they are circulated through body in red blood cells to be delivered to tissues (to be used for glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation), and bonding to carbon dioxide for it to be transported to lungs (to be exhaled as waste). Oxyhemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin that the heme group of the protein molecule binds to oxygen; deoxyhemoglobin is that without oxygen.

[[Image:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|thumb|Structure of Hemoglobin]]

== Binding Sites of Hemoglobin ==
The iron ion of +2 state of heme group is bonded to four nitrogens in one plane of 4 porphyrin ring and a proximal histidine amino acid of imidazole ring of globin molecule under plane of porphyrin ring. The heme group binds oxygen by bending. This does not increase the oxidation state of the iron ion but it decreases in atomic size. This causes the iron ion to move into the plane of porphyrin ring and brings up the proximal histidine amino acid group. Ultimately, it changes the allosteric conformation of globulin molecule. 
As iron binds oxygen, the iron ion changes its position to stay in the same plane of porphyrin ring. This causes the bond distance of iron and oxygen to increase while the bond distance of iron to histidine of imidizole ring decreases. The decrease of iron to histidine of the imidizole ring causes the plane of the ring to move out of tetramer of hemoglobin. Now, the binding sites of the heme groups are opened up for the bonding of oxygen. Overall, the process is classified as positive cooperativity. The hemoglobin protein's binding affinity to oxygen can be increased by increasing substrate saturation of oxygen molecule. The bonding of the hemoglobin protein and oxygen changes the conformation of the binding site which results in an increase affinity for other oxygen molecules to bind the protein molecule. The indirectly proportional relation for the binding affinity of hemoglobin protein molecules between oxygen and carbon dioxide is known as Bohr effect, for which, the oxygen binding curve of the protein molecule changes place to the right of the graph, as such, the decreased level of carbon dioxide bonding to hemoglobin increases oxygen bonding affinity to the protein molecule.

== 2,3 Biphosphoglycerate Function ==
[[Image:2,3bpg.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Structure of 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate]]

2,3-BPG binds to hemoglobin in the center of the tetramer to stabilize the T state (E.g. in muscle tissues).

2,3-BPG is also extremely important in the role of stabilizing the T state of hemoglobin. The hemoglobin wants to change into a more favorable R state due to the fact that the T state is quite unstable. Pure hemoglobin (without 2,3-BPG) was tested and found to bind oxygen much more vigorously than hemoglobin in blood. A hemoglobin with 2,3-BPG has a lower affinity for oxygen binding in the tissue which allows it to be a better oxygen transporter than a pure hemoglobin, which does not have 2,3-BPG. When 2,3 BPG is present, it transports about 66% of oxygen while the pure hemoglobin only transports about 8%. The reason is that the 2,3-BPG binds inside of the hemoglobin and somehow stabilizes its T state (the state that has less affinity for oxygen). When enough oxygen has bonded to hemoglobin, a transition occurs from the T state to the R state, which releases the 2,3-BPG. 2.3-BPG stays in the hemoglobin until enough oxygen has come to replace it. This keeps the oxygen in its T state until it is ready to transition to the R state (where its affinity for oxygen increases dramatically). This broadens hemoglobin's oxygen saturation curve.

When the oxygen binds to Hemoglobin, the iron in the Heme group moves from the outside to the inside of the plane. In doing so, the Histidine side group also changes its alpha helix when the iron moves. Thus, this triggers the carbonyl terminal of the alpha helix to change position and that favors transition from T state to R state.

2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) or 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) binds to deoxyhemoglobin with larger bonding affinity, such that it makes the T state of hemoglobin protein more stable or increases oxygen affinity of the protein; its biological function is to control bonding between hemoglobin and oxygen molecules for oxygen to be released to body tissues.

This allosteric effector binds to a site on the tetramer that is only present on the Tense(T) form of hemoglobin. The site is in the form of a pocket which is bordered by beta subunits. These positively charged subunits, His143, Lys82, and His2, interact with 2,3-BPG holding it in place. When the equilibrium of the tense form is pushed to the relaxed(R) form, the bonds that hold the 2,3-BPG molecule in place are broken and it is released. The hemoglobin stays in the T form during low concentrations of oxygen, so when 2,3-BPG is present, more of the oxygen binding sites must be filled in order for the transition from T to R form to occur.

== Cooperativity ==
[[Image:Cooperativity graph.JPG‎]]

The cooperativity of hemoglobin makes it a much more efficient transporter of oxygen than myoglobin. Although myoglobin and hemoglobin both become highly saturated with oxygen at high concentrations (E.g. in the lungs), hemoglobin is characterized by much weaker binding to oxygen at low concentrations compared to myoglobin. The cooperativity of tetramers work both ways in hemoglobin.  As one oxygen molecule binds to one heme group, the oxygen affinity for the other groups increase. Once an oxygen molecule is released, this stimulates the release of the other oxygen molecules. This makes hemoglobin ideal in transporting and releasing oxygen from lungs to tissues where it is needed.

Cooperativity occurs as a result of a change in the hemoglobin structure. In the deoxy form (where oxygen is absent), hemoglobin exists in the '''T (tense)-state'''. Upon oxygenation, the dimers in hemoglobin shift by 15 degrees and the '''R (relaxed)-state''' is adopted. The R-state form has a much higher affinity for oxygen.

For specifics sakes, the cooperativity experienced in hemoglobin among its four seperate monomers occurs as a result of a proximal histidine shift when one monomer binds to an oxygen atom. The heme group of hemoglobin is situated in such a way that it is composed of 4 pyrrole coordinating around an iron ion. In addition, there is a proximal histidine group that is also cooridnated the iron group constituting the 5th coordination ligand. In the deoxy form, the iron ion is not completely in the plane of the pyrrole rings, in fact it is about 0.4 angstroms below the plane of the ring. This downward shift is due to the proximal histidine ligand on the bottom of the coordination complex. However, when one of the monomers binds to an oxygen molecule, the iron ion gains a sixth coordination ligand, the oxygen molecule itself, and it pulled up 0.4 angstroms to the plane of the pyrrole rings. This shift upwards also pulls the proximal histidine group up as well. It this movement of the histidine group that contributes to the cooperativity property of hemoglobin. The proximal histidine is located at the interface of the alpha and beta subunits found in hemoglogin (hemoglobin having two identical alpha units and two identical beta units). When the histidine group moves upwards, it forces a conformational change in that interface, which conforms the next monomer to situate itself in a fashion that increases its affinity to another oxygen molecule. As that monomer binds an oxygen molecule, the whole process happens again. It this cascade of events, the iron shifting up upon binding and the histidine moving up as a result, that describes the cooperativity that hemoglobin has between its four monomers and the transition it makes from the T state to the R state. 

Chemical process by which as active site of enzyme is bonded by substrate, the enzyme can react with substrate with more effect; three forms of which are positive cooperativity, negative cooperativity, and non-cooperativity; for positive cooperativity, for example, when oxygen binds to hemoglobin, the affinity of the protein for oxygen increases; therefore, binding of oxygen to the protein is more easily done; for negative cooperative, for example, when enzyme binds to ligand, the bonding affinity decreases.

== Sigmoid Binding Model ==

From the oxygen binding curve of the hemoglobin, it is said that hemoglobin follows a sigmoid model because it looks like a &quot;S&quot; shaped curve. The curve also suggested that hemoglobin has a lower oxygen binding affinity. This is due to that fact that hemoglobin binds to 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate inside of the red blood cell. 

The sigmoid binding model of the curve indicates that hemoglobin follows a special oxygen binding behavior, known as cooperativity. The curve shows that binding at one site of the protein will increase the likelihood of other binding at other sites. And also the unloading of oxygen at one site will also facilitate the unloading of oxygen at other sites. 

The biological of this sigmoid model of oxygen binding leads to efficient oxygen transport. The unloading of oxygen can be seen in the graph where in the lungs (100 torr) the protein is saturated with oxygen and all of the oxygen binding sites are occupied. However when this is moved to the tissues to release the oxygen, the saturation level drops and the total unloading oxygen level is 66%. This situation is favored because the hemoglobin goes through cooperativity and it increases the tendency for oxygen binding and unbinding. Unlike myoglobin, which binds to tightly to oxygen for its release.

== Cooperativity Models ==

In the '''concerted model''', T and R states are the only two forms of hemoglobin that exist. T state is the state where hemoglobin has its quaternary structure in the deoxy form, which is also a tense form. The R state is the state where the hemoglobin has its quaternary structure in completely oxygenated form. This state is relaxed, less constrained, and leaves the oxygen binding sites free. An equilibrium exists between these two states that is shifted by the binding of oxygen, which shifts equilibrium towards R-state. This shift (to R-state) increases the affinity of oxygen of its binding sites. All tetramers of the hemoglobin must be in the same state. 

[[Image:Hemoglobinconcertedmodel.jpg]]

In the '''sequential model''', there is no full conversion from the T-state to R-state. The binding of oxygen changes conformation of the subunits, which subsequently induces changes in other subunits to increase their affinity for oxygen. The subunit to which the a ligand binds changes its conformation without interrupting other subunits to have conformational changing.

In the curve of fractional saturation (fraction of possible binding site that include the binded oxygens) vs. the concentration of oxygen measured by its partial pressure in torr, the T-state bining curve is relatively shallow at low concentration of oxygen when all molecules are in the T state because if a molecule is assumed in the R state, the oxygen affinity increases, which means that new oxygen molecules have more chances to bind to the rest of the three unoccupied sites. 
The R-state binding curve goes sharply at the beginning but level off when all of the binding sites are occupied by oxygens. 

Hemoglobin behavior resembles a mix of these two models. A molecule with only one bound oxygen molecule exists primarily in T-state, but the other subunits have a much higher affinity for oxygen as suggested by the sequential model. Meanwhile, a molecule with three subunits bound exists primarily in the R-state as suggested by the concerted model.

[[Image:Transition.JPG]]
Le Chatelier's Principle can be seen to play a role in the circulation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the body. Within the erythrocyte, by decreasing the concentration of HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, it acts a force in which it requires more CO2 to be in the cell so that it can be converted to HCO3-. 

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;---&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

This reaction, which is carried out by carbonic anhydrase, also decreases the pH within the erythrocyte. Consequently this encourages the hemoglobin to take on the T-state as the excess hydrogen in the cell allows for salt bridges to form. These salt bridges then induce the cell to form the T-state more often than the R-state.

== Allosteric Effectors of Hemoglobin ==

An allosteric effector of hemoglobin is a regulation by a molecule that is structurally unrelated to oxygen and binds to a site completely distinct from the oxygen binding site.

===2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate===

[[Image:BPG.JPG‎|‎right|thumb|2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate]]

2,3-BPG is a highly anionic compound found in hemoglobin, making it an efficient oxygen transporter.  It lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin by binding in the center of the tetramer, stabilizing hemoglobin's &quot;T&quot; state.  2,3-BPG, with such high negative charge, interacts with 3 positively charged groups on each beta chain in the two alpha-beta dimer.  For the transition of &quot;T&quot; state to &quot;R&quot; state to occur, the 2,3-BPG must be broken.  For this to occur, more oxygen-binding sites within the hemoglobin tetramer must be occupied.  Therefore, the hemoglobin remains in the lower-affinity T state until a much higher oxygen concentration is reached.  In pure hemoglobin with no 2,3-BPG, only 8% of the sites would contribute to oxygen transport.  The presence of 2,3-BPG in hemoglobin increases the percentage to 66%.
[[Image:Fetal red blood cells.JPG‎|250px|thumb|right|Oxygen affinity of fetal red blood cells]]

2, 3 BPG is the reason why maternal red cells are better at transporting oxygen. Since maternal hemoglobin are better at binding to 2,3 BPG  than fetal hemoglobin, maternal red cells have a lower affinity to oxygen.

===The Bohr Effect (Hydrogen Ions and Carbon Dioxide)===
====Hydrogen====

A hemoglobin traveling from a region of high pH to a region of lower pH has a tendency to release more oxygen.  This is because as pH decrease, the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin decreases.  The &quot;T&quot; state of the hemoglobin is stabilized by 3 amino acids (alpha&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Lys40, beta&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; His146, beta&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; Asp94) that form 2 salt bridges.  The residue at the C terminus of the His146 forms salt bridge with the lysine residue in the alpha subunit of the other alpha-beta dimer.  The salt bridge between the His146 and the Asp94 is formed only when pH drops, protonating the side change of His146.

====Carbon Dioxide====

Carbon dioxide also stimulates oxygen release in the hemoglobin.  Carbonic anhydrase takes carbon dioxide diffused from the tissue into the red blood cell and water to yield carboxylic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is a strong acid (pKa 3.5).  Once this compound is formed, it dissociates into HCO&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which increases the acidity of the environment and lowers the pH level.  This drop in pH level will again stabilize the T-state of the hemoglobin.  In the hemoglobin, there are three key amino acid residues responsible for the bind of oxygen to the active site: lysine (Lys), histidine (His), and aspartate (Asp). The three amino acids are linked by two salt bridges. One of the salt bridge, between histidine and aspartate, does not form until there is an proton added to histidine. Under conditions of low pH, the histidine gets protonated to allow then the formation of the salt bridge and thus, a conformational change that stabilizes the T-state, lower its affinity for oxygen. In addition, carbon dioxide reacts with the amino-terminals of hemoglobin, resulting in the formation of negatively charged carbamate groups which further stabilize the T state by supporting the salt bridge interactions. This is convenient on a physiological sense. Since tissues tend to be low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide concentration, the low pH environment will lower hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and cause the red blood cell carriers to release the oxygen at the tissues.

== Carbon Dioxide Transport from Tissues to Lungs ==
== Hemoglobin's loss of oxygen ==
Hemoglobin is an efficient oxygen transporter around the body. How does it release oxygen to the tissue? Hemoglobin releases oxygen where it is a necessity. Examples include working muscles and tissues. When tissue is metabolizing, it releases carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions. Hemoglobin reacts these conditions. These are called the carbon dioxide effect and the pH effect. 

Christian Bohr discovered that hemoglobin is found to have a lower oxygen saturation in lower pH.The release of protons signifies a change in pH. The reason is that protons protonate a histidine on the end of one of the beta chains found on the hemoglobin. Consequently, this makes the histidine charged and creates a salt bridge (ion-ion interaction) with aspartate (negatively charged) on the same polypeptide chain. That salt bridge stabilizes the T state of hemoglobin, which favors the release of oxygen. 

Carbon dioxide released by cells are mixed with the blood serum to make carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is a relatively strong acid, so it dissociates into bicarbonate and a proton (which can be used above). The carbon dioxide itself, however, can also participate in oxygen release. When the carbon dioxide meets the terminal amino group of hemoglobin's peptides, it can react to form carbamates, which are negatively charged. This reaction also produces an additional acidic proton. These negatively charged groups can also participate in salt bridges that further stabilize the T state of the hemoglobin to further facilitate the release of oxygen. This effect was seen when someone noticed that oxygen saturation was lowest when in an acidic and carbon dioxide-rich environment.

== Mutations in Hemoglobin ==
[[Image:Hemoglobin t-r state ani.gif|400px|thumb|Animation of a hemoglobin in different states]]
The deficiency or mutations of hemoglobin can be a result of abnormality of structure of protein molecules, which is related to '''anemia''' and '''sickle cell disease''' - a condition that malformed red blood cells are resulted from structural abnormality of hemoglobin molecules restrict passage of blood vessels for the supply of blood flow to body tissues.

'''Sickle cell anaemia''' is a disease caused by one amino acid substitution. In this case, valine was substituted for glutamate in position 6 of the beta chain of hemoglobin. The mutated form is known as ''Hemoglobin S'' (HbS). The elimination of the negative charges of glutamate and the substitution of glutamate with hydrophobic valine causes hydrophobic interactions between different hemoglobins. From electron micrographs, studies have shown that hemoglobin in sickle red blood cells form large fibrous aggregates. The fibrous aggregates form across the red blood cells distorting the shape and increasing their potential to clog small capillaries. This detrimental effect leads to a high risk of stoke and bacterial infection from poor blood circulation. Not only does the sufferer attain insufficient amounts of oxygen, but the aggregated hemoglobins make it harder for blood to flow through small vessels which can cause blood clots. It is interesting to note that the areas with high population of people carrying sickle cell traits is correspond to the areas with high prevalence of malaria. Sickle cell traits means that a person have one normal gene and one mutated gene, disease does not take place in these people. The reason is that a person carrying sickle cell traits are resistant to malaria. The malaria causing parasite can not reproduce effectively in people with sickle cell traits. It should be noted however that the sickle cell gene is codominant. This means that in a person carrying one normal gene and one mutated gene, there will be both regular healthy blood cells and mutated blood cells. However, the function of the normal blood cells makes up for the abnormal cells and no symptoms are felt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==New Patterns==

The second sentece patter we will look at is really two different sentence patterns that use two different grammatical scructures to give us more information about he subject of the sentence.  

The first is;

'''NN NA ESSE.'''

This looks very familiar to the sentence pattern from before, which was '''NN1 NN2 ESSE.'''  However, in this sentence pattern, we are not saying that one thing is equal to another thing.  We are using an adjective, in the nominative case of course, to give us information about our subject. So if I said, &quot;I am tall.&quot;  I do not mean to say that I am the personification of Tallness, just that I have the quality of &quot;tall&quot;.  This sentence pattern is used to introduce the idea that the subject has this quality.  The listener did not know before that that the subject had this quality.  

'''Maria pulchra est.'''

Here the listener did not know that Maria was pretty so we use the above sentence to inform him.  

NOTE: The adjective must &quot;agree&quot; with the word it modifies, even if that word is dropped from the sentence.  As such it must be in the Nominative case when used in this sentence pattern.

The second sentence pattern we will learn here is thus;

'''NN AV ESSE.'''

We use this sentence pattern to give more information about the subject in the form of an adverb.  The adverb can imply location, wellbeing or anything else that makes sense.

'''Maria hic est.  Maria bene est.'''  

Notice that since the word giving additional information is an adverb, not an adjective, it does not need to agree with '''Maria''', or any other word in the sentence.  I will in fact never change form.  It does not modify Maria directly the way an adjective does, but rather modifies the way '''Maria''' is by affecting the verb '''EST'''.

==Extention of old patterns==

Now that you have seen the adjectives and the adverbs, you should know that these can be added at will to sentence patterns tht were learned earlier.

If we add an adjective to '''NN ESSE''', we basically end up with '''NN NA ESSE'''.  It will depend on the context to hear the difference but it is not so important. Examples in English include &quot;The boy is small&quot; versus &quot;There is a small boy.&quot;  


If we add adjectives to '''NN1 NN2 ESSE''' we get '''NN1 NA1 NN2 NA2 ESSE'''.  Here agian, the context will tell us which word the adjectives go with.  As NA2 is not next to NN1, it can not go with '''NN1''', but as '''NA1''' is next to both '''NN1''' and '''NN2''', it could go with either but would probably go with '''NN1'''.  However, as the two nouns are equal to each other, it isn't that big a deal.  

'''Puella pulchra discipula bona est.'''


The same can be done to add Adverbs as seen here.

'''Puella hic discipula bona est.'''

In these cases, the adjective or adverb is only an extra idea tackted onto the sentnece and is not the central point of the sentence as seen in the sentence patterns studied above.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: begining → beginning, orginal → original using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several verbs in Latin that mean the same or about the same as the '''BE''' verb in English.  The most common one in usage is '''ESSE''' which we will explore here in the present tense.

Like most Copula verbs in most languages, ESSE is irregular however it is still very simple to learn.

'''Sum''' means &quot;I am&quot;.  

'''Es''' means &quot;You are&quot;.

'''Est''' means &quot;He is&quot;.  

If you are familiar with older English this should be easy to see the link.  We used to say;

I am

Thou art

He is

Now the '''M''' in the Am is fine, we can just link that in our minds to the '''M''' in '''Sum'''.  

As we see above, in older English the letter '''T''' was for the You form and the '''S''' was for the He form.  In Latin this is the reverse.  The '''S''' characterizes the You form and the '''T''' characterizes the He form.  

Now in English we have just one form, Are, to take care of all plural forms.  In Latin however, we need a different form for each.

'''Sumus''' means &quot;We are&quot;.

'''Estis''' means &quot;Ya'll are&quot;.

'''Sunt''' means &quot;They are&quot;.

You should notice that while in English we use &quot;you are&quot; for both singular and plural; in Latin we use two different forms.  English only has a total of three forms, Latin has a total of Six. You should also notice that while we do use a different form for the plural, it is similar to the singular form.  '''M''' changes to '''MUS''', '''S''' changes to '''TIS''', and '''T''' changes to '''NT'''.  See that isn't hard at all.

Now if we consider the fact that the original base of the verb was '''ES''', and we attempt to add our endings to just a bare '''ES''' we get this,

ESM

ESS

EST

ESMUS

ESTIS

ESNT

If you try to say these as is you will find yourself automatically inserting an &quot;'''oo'''&quot; sound between the '''S''' and the '''M''' or '''N'''.  Eventually that '''U''' sound got too big and it drowned out the '''E''' sound at the beginning and people stopped saying it.  The only other issue here has to do with '''ESS''' which would just be a double '''S''' sound that people would probably been happy to just say a simple '''ES''' and move on with their lives.  Thus in a very natural way we then get;

'''Sum'''

'''Es'''

'''Est'''

'''Sumus'''

'''Estis'''

'''Sunt'''

You should also make sure to remember these endings, '''-M, -S, -T, -MUS, -TIS,''' and '''-NT'''.  You will see these over and over again.  The first person '''M''' is more often an '''O''' in most verbs in the present tense but will become '''M''' again in other tenses.

1
: '''U''' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
: ''A'' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
: ''B'' = {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
: ''C'' = {3, 7}


: (a) Illustrate the sets '''U''', ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' in a Venn diagram, marking all the elements in the appropriate places.  (Note: if any region in your diagram does not contain any elements, re-draw the set loops to correct this.)


: (b) ''Using your Venn diagram'', list the elements in each of the following sets:

: ''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'',  ''A'' &amp;cup; ''C'',  ''A''&amp;prime;,  ''B''&amp;prime;,  ''B'' &amp;cap; ''A''&amp;prime;,  ''B'' &amp;cap; ''C''&amp;prime;,  ''A'' – ''B'',  ''A'' &amp;Delta; ''B''


: (c)	Complete the statement using a single symbol: ''C'' - ''B'' = ... .


2
: True or false?

: (a) | &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; | = 1

: (b) | { x, x } | = 2

: (c) | '''U''' &amp;cap; &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; | = 0


3
: What can you say about two sets ''P'' and ''Q'' if:

: (a) ''P'' &amp;cap; ''Q''&amp;prime; = &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt;
: (b) ''P'' &amp;cup; ''Q'' = ''P''?

[[Image:VennExercise3Question4.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Question 4'']]


4
: Make six copies of the Venn diagram shown alongside, and then shade the areas represented by:

: (a) ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cup; ''B''

: (b) ''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime;

: (c) (''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'') &amp;prime;

: (d) ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cup; ''B'' &amp;prime;

: (e) (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime;

: (f) ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime;

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
5
: Identify the sets represented by each of the shaded areas below, using the set notation symbols &amp;cap;, &amp;cup; and &amp;prime; only:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


6
: (a) One of the shaded regions in question 5 represents the set ''A'' – ''B''.  Identify which one it is, and hence write a definition of ''A'' – ''B'' using only symbols from the list &amp;cap;, &amp;cup; and &amp;prime;.


: (b) Again using one of your answers to question 5, write a definition of ''A'' &amp;Delta; ''B'' using only symbols from the list &amp;cap;, &amp;cup; and &amp;prime;.  (There are two possibilities here – see if you can find them both!)

: A chess board’s 8 rows are labelled 1 to 8, and its 8 columns ''a'' to ''h''.  Each square of the board is described by the ordered pair (column letter, row number).

: (a) A knight is positioned at (''d'', 3).  Write down its possible positions after a single move of the knight.

: (b) If ''R'' = {1, 2, ..., 8}, ''C'' = {''a'', ''b'', ..., ''h''}, and ''P'' = {coordinates of all squares on the chess board}, use set notation to express ''P'' in terms of ''R'' and ''C''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These letters are used in the Latin alphabet but are not used to write native Latin words.  They instead are used to write borrowed words, usually from Greek.  

K equals C, but does not change sound.
Ch also equals C and also does not change sound.
Th equals T and was used to mark a word with a Greek Theta.
Ph equals F.
Y equals I.
Z makes the same sound it does in English.
ZG makes the same sound as the S in the English word Treasure.  This sound is only found in Slavic names written in Latin and is thus rare.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is a continuation of [[../|Discrete_Mathematics/Set_theory]]. It may be omitted at a first reading.

== Power Sets ==

The '''''power set''''' of a set ''A'' is the set of all its subsets (including, of course, itself and the empty set).  It is denoted by '''P'''(''A'').

Using set comprehension notation, '''P'''(''A'') can be defined as
: '''P'''(''A'') = { ''Q'' | ''Q'' &amp;sube; ''A'' }


''Example 4''

:  Write down the power sets of ''A'' if:

(a) ''A'' = {1, 2, 3}

(b) ''A'' = {1, 2}

(c) ''A'' = {1}

(d) ''A'' = &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt;


''Solution''

(a) '''P'''(''A'') = { {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 3}, {1, 2}, {1}, {2}, {3}, &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; }

(b) '''P'''(''A'') = { {1, 2}, {1}, {2}, &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; }

(c) '''P'''(''A'') = { {1}, &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; }

(d) '''P'''(''A'') = { &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; }


=== Cardinality of a Power Set ===

Look at the [[../#Cardinality|cardinality]] of the four sets in ''Example 4'', and the cardinality of their corresponding power sets.  They are:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| 
| &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''A'' &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''P'''(''A'') &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| (a)
| 3
| 8
|-
| (b)
| 2
| 4
|-
| (c)
| 1
| 2
|-
| (d)
| 0
| 1
|}
{{clear}}

Clearly, there's a simple rule at work here: expressed as powers of 2, the cardinalities of the power sets are 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. 

It looks as though we have found a rule that if | ''A'' | = ''k'', then | '''P'''(''A'') | = 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.  But can we see why?


Well, the elements of the power set of ''A'' are all the possible subsets of ''A''. Any one of these subsets can be formed in the following way:

*: Choose any element of ''A''. We may decide to ''include'' this in our subset, or we may ''omit'' it.  There are therefore 2 ways of dealing with this first element of ''A''.

*: Now choose a second element of ''A''.  As before, we may include it, or omit it from our subset: again a choice of 2 ways of dealing with this element.

*: ...and so on through all ''k'' elements of ''A''.


Now the fundamental principle of combinatorics tells us that if we can do each of ''k'' things in 2 ways, then the total number of ways of doing them all, one after the other, is 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Each one of these 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; combinations of decisions - including elements or omitting them - gives us a different subset of ''A''.  There are therefore 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; different subsets altogether.


So if | ''A'' | = ''k'', then | '''P'''(''A'') | = 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

== The Foundational Rules of Set Theory ==

The [[#The Laws of Sets|laws listed below]] can be described as the Foundational Rules of Set Theory. We derive them by going back to the definitions of [[../#Intersection|intersection]], [[../#Union|union]], [[../#Universal Set|universal set]] and [[../#Null set (empty set)|empty set]], and by considering whether a given element is in, or not in, one or more sets.


''The Idempotent Laws''

As an example, we'll consider the ''&amp;prime;I heard you the first time&amp;prime; Laws'' – more correctly called the ''Idempotent Laws'' - which say that:

: ''A'' &amp;cap; ''A'' = ''A'' and ''A'' &amp;cup; ''A'' = ''A''


This law might be familiar to you if you've studied logic.  The above relationship is comparable to the tautology.

These look pretty obvious, don't they? A simple explanation for the intersection part of these laws goes something like this:

The intersection of two sets ''A'' and ''B'' is defined as just those elements that are in ''A'' and in ''B''. If we replace ''B'' by ''A'' in this definition we get that the intersection of ''A'' and ''A'' is the set comprising just those elements that are in ''A'' and in ''A''. Obviously, we don't need to say this twice (''I heard you the first time''), so we can simply say that the intersection of ''A'' and ''A'' is the set of elements in ''A''. In other words:

: ''A'' &amp;cap; ''A'' = ''A''

We can derive the explanation for ''A'' &amp;cup; ''A'' = ''A'' in a similar way.


''De Morgan's Laws''

There are two laws, called ''De Morgan's Laws'', which tell us how to remove brackets, when there's a ''complement'' symbol - &amp;prime; - outside.  One of these laws looks like this:

: (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime; = ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime;


(If you've done [[../Exercises#Set Theory Exercise 3|Exercise 3]], question 4, you may have spotted this law already from the Venn Diagrams.)


Look closely at how this Law works. The complement symbol after the bracket affects ''all three'' symbols inside the bracket when the brackets are removed:

: ''A'' becomes ''A'' &amp;prime;

: ''B'' becomes ''B'' &amp;prime;

: and &amp;cup; becomes &amp;cap;.


To prove this law, note first of all that when we defined a [[../#Subsets|subset]] we said that if 

: ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B'' and ''B'' &amp;sube; ''A'', then ''A'' = ''B''

So we prove:

: (i) (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime; &amp;sube; ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime;

and then the other way round:

: (ii) ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime; &amp;sube; (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime;


The proof of (i) goes like this:

Let's pick an element at random ''x'' &amp;isin; (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime;. We don't know anything about ''x''; it could be a number, a function, or indeed an elephant. All we do know about ''x'', is that

:  ''x'' &amp;isin; (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime;

So

:  ''x'' &amp;notin; (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'')

because that's what complement means. 

This means that ''x'' answers ''No'' to both questions ''Are you in A?'' and ''Are you in B?'' (otherwise it ''would'' be in the union of ''A'' and ''B''). Therefore

:   ''x'' &amp;notin; ''A'' and ''x'' &amp;notin; ''B''


Applying complements again we get

:    ''x'' &amp;isin; ''A'' &amp;prime; and ''x'' &amp;isin; ''B'' &amp;prime;


Finally, if something is in two sets, it must be in their intersection, so

:   ''x'' &amp;isin; ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime;


So, any element we pick at random from (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime; is definitely in ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime;.  So by definition

:  (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime; &amp;sube; ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime;


The proof of (ii) is similar:

First, we pick an element at random from the first set, ''x'' &amp;isin; ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime;

Using what we know about intersections, that means

:  ''x'' &amp;isin; ''A'' &amp;prime; and ''x'' &amp;isin; ''B'' &amp;prime;

So, using what we know about complements,

:  ''x'' &amp;notin; ''A'' and ''x'' &amp;notin; ''B''

And if something is in neither ''A'' nor ''B'', it can't be in their union, so

:   ''x'' &amp;notin; ''A'' &amp;cup; ''B''

So, finally:

: ''x'' &amp;isin; (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime;

So:

: ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime; &amp;sube; (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime;


We've now proved (i) and (ii), and therefore:

: (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime; = ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime;


This gives you a taste for what's behind these laws.  So here they all are.


=== The Laws of Sets ===


''Commutative Laws''
: ''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'' = ''B'' &amp;cap; ''A''
: ''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'' = ''B'' &amp;cup; ''A''


''Associative Laws''	
: (''A'' &amp;cap; B) &amp;cap; C = ''A'' &amp;cap; (''B'' &amp;cap; C)
: (''A'' &amp;cup; B) &amp;cup; C = ''A'' &amp;cup; (''B'' &amp;cup; C)


''Distributive Laws''
: ''A'' &amp;cap; (''B'' &amp;cup; C) = (''A'' &amp;cap; B) &amp;cup; (''A'' &amp;cap; C)
: ''A'' &amp;cup; (''B'' &amp;cap; C) = (''A'' &amp;cup; B) &amp;cap; (''A'' &amp;cup; C)


''Idempotent Laws''
: ''A'' &amp;cap; ''A'' = ''A''
: ''A'' &amp;cup; ''A'' = ''A''


''Identity Laws''
: ''A'' &amp;cup; &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; = ''A''
: ''A'' &amp;cap; '''U''' = ''A''
: ''A'' &amp;cup; '''U''' = '''U'''
: ''A'' &amp;cap; &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; = &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt;


''Involution Law''	
: (''A'' &amp;prime;) &amp;prime; = ''A''


''Complement Laws''
: ''A'' &amp;cup; ''A''' = '''U'''
: ''A'' &amp;cap; ''A''' = &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt;
: '''U''' &amp;prime; = &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt;
: &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; &amp;prime; = '''U'''


''De Morgan’s Laws''
: (''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'') &amp;prime; = ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cup; ''B'' &amp;prime;
: (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;prime; = ''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'' &amp;prime;

=== Duality and Boolean Algebra ===

You may notice that the above ''Laws of Sets'' occur in pairs: if in any given law, you exchange &amp;cup; for &amp;cap; and vice versa (and, if necessary, swap '''U''' and &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt;) you get another of the laws. The 'partner laws' in each pair are called ''duals'', each law being the dual of the other.

*: For example, each of De Morgan's Laws is the dual of the other.

*: The first complement law, ''A'' &amp;cup; ''A'' &amp;prime; = '''U''', is the dual of the second: ''A'' &amp;cap; ''A'' &amp;prime; = &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt;.

*: ... and so on.


This is called the '''''Principle of Duality'''''.  In practical terms, it means that you only need to remember ''half'' of this table!


This set of laws constitutes the axioms of a '''''Boolean Algebra'''''. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra Boolean Algebra] for more.

=== Proofs using the Laws of Sets ===

We may use these laws - and only these laws - to determine whether other statements about the relationships between sets are true or false.  Venn diagrams may be helpful in suggesting such relationships, but only a proof based on these laws will be accepted by mathematicians as rigorous.


''Example 5''

Using the Laws of Sets, prove that the set (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;cap; (''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'') &amp;prime; is simply the same as the set ''A'' itself.  State carefully which Law you are using at each stage.


Before we begin the proof, a few do's and don't’s:
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| '''Do''' start with the single expression (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;cap; (''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'') &amp;prime;, and aim to change it into simply ''A''.
| '''Don’t''' begin by writing down the whole equation (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;cap; (''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'') &amp;prime; = ''A'' – that’s what we must end up with.
|-
| '''Do''' change just one part of the expression at a time, using just one of the set laws at a time.
| '''Don't''' miss steps out, and change two things at once.
|-
| '''Do''' keep the equals signs underneath one another.
| '''Don't''' allow your work to become untidy and poorly laid out.
|-
| '''Do''' state which law you have used at each stage.
| '''Don't''' take even the simplest step for granted.
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

| Complement
|-
| 
| = ''A''
| Identity
|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


We have now proved that (''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') &amp;cap; (''A'' &amp;prime; &amp;cap; ''B'') &amp;prime; = ''A'' whatever the sets ''A'' and ''B'' contain.  ''A'' statement like this – one that is true for all values of ''A'' and ''B'' – is sometimes called an '''''identity'''''.


''Hints on Proofs''

There are no foolproof methods with these proofs – practice is the best guide. But here are a few general hints.

*: Start with the more complicated side of the equation, aiming to simplify it into the other side.

*: Look for places where the Distributive Law will result in a simplification (like factorising in 'ordinary' algebra - see the third line in ''Example 5'' above).

*: You’ll probably use De Morgan’s Law to get rid of a ' symbol from outside a bracket.

*: Sometimes you may need to 'complicate' an expression before you can simplify it, as the next example shows.


''Example 6''

Use the Laws of Sets to prove that ''A ''&amp;cup; (''A ''&amp;cap;'' B'') ='' A''.

Looks easy, doesn’t it? But you can go round in circles with this one. (Try it first before reading the solution below, if you like.) The key is to 'complicate' it a bit first, by writing the first ''A ''as ''A ''&amp;cap; '''U''' (using one of the Identity Laws).

=== Ordered pairs ===

To introduce this topic, we look first at a couple of examples that use the principle of combinatorics that we noted earlier (see [[#Cardinality of a Power Set|Cardinality]]); namely, that if an event ''R'' can occur in ''r'' ways and a second event ''S'' can then occur in ''s'' ways, then the total number of ways that the two events, ''R'' followed by ''S'', can occur is ''r'' &amp;times; ''s''. This is sometimes called the ''r-s Principle''.


''Example 7''
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''MENU'''
|-
| ''Main Course''
|-
| Poached Halibut
|-
| Roast Lamb
|-
| Vegetable Curry
|-
| Lasagne
|-
| 
|-
| ''Dessert''
|-
| Fresh Fruit Salad
|-
| Apple Pie
|-
| Gateau
|}

How many different meals – Main Course followed by Dessert - can be chosen from the above menu? 

''Solution''

Since we may choose the main course in four ways, and then the dessert in three ways to form a different combination each time, the answer, using the ''r-s Principle'', is that there are 4 &amp;times; 3 = 12 different meals.


''Example 8''

You're getting ready to go out.  You have 5 different (clean!) pairs of underpants and two pairs of jeans to choose from. In how many ways can you choose to put on a pair of pants and some jeans? 

''Solution''

Using the ''r-s Principle'', there are 5 &amp;times; 2 = 10 ways in which the two can be chosen, one after the other.


In each of the two situations above, we have examples of '''''ordered pairs'''''. As the name says, an ordered pair is simply a pair of 'things' arranged in a certain order.  Often the order in which the things are chosen is arbitrary – we simply have to decide on a convention, and then stick to it; sometimes the order really only works one way round.

In the case of the meals, most people choose to eat their main course first, and then dessert.  In the clothes we wear, we put on our underpants before our jeans. You are perfectly free to fly in the face of convention and have your dessert before the main course - or to wear your underwear on top of your trousers - but you'll end up with different sets of ordered pairs if you do. And, of course, you'll usually have a lot of explaining to do!


The two 'things' that make up an ordered pair are written in round brackets, and separated by a comma; like this:

: (Lasagne, Gateau)

You will have met ordered pairs before if you've done coordinate geometry. For example, (2, 3) represents the point 2 units along the ''x''-axis and 3 units up the ''y''-axis.  Here again, there's a convention at work in the order of the numbers: we use alphabetical order and put the ''x''-coordinate before the ''y''-coordinate.  (Again, you could choose to do your coordinate geometry the other way round, and put ''y'' before ''x'', but once again, you'd have a lot of explaining to do!)


Using set notation, then, we could describe the situation in ''Example 7'' like this:

: ''M'' = {main courses}, ''D'' = {desserts}, ''C'' = {complete meals}.

Then ''C'' could be written as:

: ''C'' = { (''m'', ''d'') | ''m'' &amp;isin; ''M'' and ''d'' &amp;isin; ''D'' }.

''C'' is called the '''''set product''''' or '''''Cartesian product''''' of ''M'' and ''D'', and we write:

: ''C'' = ''M'' &amp;times; ''D''

(read 'C equals M cross D')


Suppose that the menu in ''Example 7'' is expanded to include a starter, which is either soup or fruit juice. How many complete meals can be chosen now?

Well, we can extend the ''r-s Principle'' to include this third choice, and get 2 &amp;times; 4 &amp;times; 3 = 24 possible meals.


If ''S'' = {soup, fruit juice}, then we can write:

: ''C'' = ''S'' &amp;times; ''M'' &amp;times; ''D''


An element of this set is an ''ordered triple'': (starter, main course, dessert). Notice, then, that the order in which the individual items occur in the triple is the same as the order of the sets from which they are chosen:  ''S'' &amp;times; ''M'' &amp;times; ''D'' does not give us the same set of ordered triples as ''M'' &amp;times; ''D'' &amp;times; ''S''.

=== Ordered ''n''-tuples ===

In general, if we have ''n'' sets: ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then their Cartesian product is defined by:

: ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; ... &amp;times; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = { (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) | ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)  }

and (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is called an '''''ordered n-tuple'''''.


''Notation''

''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; ... &amp;times; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is sometimes written:

: &lt;math&gt;\times_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;



=== The Cartesian Plane ===

[[Image:CartesianPlane.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''The Cartesian Plane: Fig. 8'']]
You probably know already the way in which a point in a plane may be represented by an ordered pair.  The diagram in ''Fig. 8'' illustrates a ''Cartesian Plane'', showing the point represented by the ordered pair (5, 2).

The lines are called ''axes'': the ''x''-axis and the ''y''-axis.  The point where they meet is called the ''origin''.  The point (5, 2) is then located as follows: start at the origin; move 5 units in the direction of the ''x''-axis, and then 2 units in the direction of the ''y''-axis.


''Using set notation:''

If ''X'' = {numbers on the ''x''-axis} and ''Y'' = {numbers on the ''y''-axis}, then:

:(5, 2) &amp;isin; ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y''

and, indeed, if ''X'' = {all real numbers}, and ''Y'' = {all real numbers} then ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' as a whole represents ''all'' the points in the ''x-y'' plane.

(This is why you will sometimes see the ''x-y'' plane referred to as '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where '''R''' = {real numbers}.)
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
''Example 9''

It is believed that, if ''A'', ''B'', ''P'' and ''Q'' are sets where ''B'' &amp;sub; ''A'' and ''Q'' &amp;sub; ''P'', then:

: ''B'' &amp;times; ''Q'' &amp;sub; ''A'' &amp;times; ''P''

Use a carefully shaded and labelled Cartesian diagram to investigate this proposition.


''Solution''

Bearing in mind what we said above about the ordered pairs in ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' corresponding to points in the ''x-y'' plane, if we want to represent a Cartesian product like ''A'' &amp;times; ''P'' on a diagram, we shall need to represent the individual sets ''A'' and ''P'' as sets of points on the ''x''- and ''y''- axes respectively.  

The region representing the Cartesian product ''A'' &amp;times; ''P'' is then represented by the points whose ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates lie within these sets ''A'' and ''P''. Like this:

[[Image:CartesianPlaneExample9a.jpg|left|thumb|350px|''The Cartesian Plane: Fig. 9a'']]
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

The same can also be said about ''B'' and ''Q'': ''B'' must lie on the ''x''-axis, and ''Q'' on the ''y''-axis.

In addition, since ''B'' &amp;sub; ''A'', then we must represent ''B'' as a set chosen from within the elements of ''A''.  Similarly, since ''Q'' &amp;sub; ''P'', the elements of ''Q'' must lie within the elements of ''P''.

When we add these components on to the diagram it looks like this:
[[Image:CartesianPlaneExample9b.jpg|left|thumb|350px|''The Cartesian Plane: Fig. 9b'']]
{{clear}}

Finally, when we represent the set ''B'' &amp;times; ''Q'' as a rectangle whose limits are determined by the limits of ''B'' and ''Q'', it is clear that this rectangle will lie within the rectangle representing ''A'' &amp;times; ''P'': 

[[Image:CartesianPlaneExample9c.jpg|left|thumb|350px|''The Cartesian Plane: Fig. 9c'']]
{{clear}}

So, the proposition ''B'' &amp;times; ''Q'' &amp;sub; ''A'' &amp;times; ''P'' appears to be true.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Word Order==

In English, the basic grammar of a sentence is based on word order.  If I say &quot;Harry saw Sally&quot; you know that Harry is the one who is doing and Sally perhaps didn't see anything.  This difference in English is called Subject and Object.  However, if I wanted to say that &quot;Sally saw Harry&quot; then I simply reverse the order of the words.  

In Latin, Word Order does not affect the grammar of a sentence the way it does in English.  Instead each word has a sound or set of sounds at the end of the word that informs us of the grammar of the word.  We employ a little of this in English.  We say &quot;he&quot; if the man is going to be the subject of the sentence but we say &quot;him&quot; if he is the object of the sentence.  In English only pronouns do this and only in three cases.  In Latin, almost every word does this and in as many as seven cases, but usually only five.  

Even though Latin lacks grammar from word order and can put the words in almost any order at will, there are nonetheless some very common patterns that emerge.  These patterns don't have to be followed exactly for the meaning to still come across but it helps as the listener will expect to hear the words in this normal order unless one of the words in the sentence needs to be stressed more than the rest.

In this book we will attempt to explore some of the most common sentence patterns, but outside of these rules, you should know that the logical sequence of words flows as follows. Do not worry if you do not understand all of what is initially written, you should come back to this at at later time and look it over again.

First is the Subject, but this need be expressed if it is understood. Nominative

Second is the Indirect Object if there is one.  Dative

Third is the Direct object if there is one. Accusative

Fourth is any adverbs or adverbial phrases.  These will include prepositions, ablatives and any adverbs.

Last is the verb.  The verb functions as a kind of spoken period.  When people hear the verb, they assume that the sentence is coming to an end.  Now the verb does not absolutely have to go at the end of the sentence, but it is the normal way.

Besides these, there are also adjectives, and the semi-adjective case of the noun known as the Genitive, which will usually be next to the word they modify, and in some cases will stand in for the word they modify, leaving the substantive unexpressed.  Since they can modify any noun, they can go anywhere in the sentence to be next to the word they modify.

==Latin is not English==

This seems odd to people to say as it seems like common sense but a lot of people get into a trap of understanding only a translation from the Latin instead of the Latin itself.  Latin is not English written in a funny code.  Latin words do not always mean what the English counterpart means.  Latin sentences are not arranged as English sentences are and the normal thought pattern of a Latin speaker is different.

==Latin is Simple==

Compared to English, Latin is actually a very simple language. Her simplicity makes Latin very easy if you get it, and very hard if you don't get it.  Her simplicity makes her powerful and expressive, but also weak and vague.  

==Enjoy the Latin==

You have the rest of your life to learn Latin.  Sure, some of you may have a test next week, or a deadline to be able to pronounce the Latin songs sung in the Church choir, but after that, will you give up?

When you finish High School and College, what then?  Will you be like most and just forget your Latin?  I say no.  That is the dark path.  If you do that, then all your work has been in vain.  Sure you may benefit from understanding your English a little better, or know how to think critically but that is not the goal of Language.  The goal of language is communication.  You are here to learn to communicate in this language, if not with another human being then at least with God.  Sure, God understand English, but he also understands Latin so if no one else will listen to you speak this beautiful language, then turn your words to the one who is always ready to listen and speak your Latin likes there's no tomorrow, because remember, one day that will be true.  

Latin can be a drudgery if you make it that but why would you want to?  She can also be a fun and wonderful lady that you can take with you in your mind.  You must feel the Latin flowing through you.  Even when saying things that in English would sound terrible, just let it flow and hear how Latin will make it just so beautiful.  

In English we don't like to repeat what we say.  So when the Catholic Liturgy comes to that point when it is said &quot;Through my fault, through my fault, through my great fault&quot; it sounds odd.  Not only are we breaking a rule of English semantics, not to repeat, but also we are talking about how bad we are and no one likes to do that.  But in Latin, she helps us to feel our remorse before God.  '''Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa'''.

==Review==

Language learning is over learning.  In order to communicate effectively in a language, you need to know three times as much as you will need.  Some even say that you will only ever use ten percent of the language that you know.  How many times have you learned a new English word and understood it for just that one time it was encountered, only for it to be forgotten and never come into your life again?  If you are well read, this should happen almost everyday.  Yet, learning those words we will never use helps us to be better communicators in English.  

Also, language has a sink in factor to it.  You can not just memorize some grammar rules and some vocabulary and expect to be able to use a language.  You have to practice and give it some time.  It has to sink in and you can not control how fast your brain will let that happen.  

However, you can encourage by reviewing constantly.  You should be going over the basics, over and over again, from the Alphabet to the Ablative.  

Don't just learn a poem or a prayer, memorize it and know what every word means and why.  

Speak Latin everyday.  Learn a new word everyday.  Read some Latin everyday and pray in Latin everyday.  For how long?  For the rest of your life.  People who learn English as a second language never quite get to the point where they don't have to pick up a dictionary and look a word up so why should we be any different taking Latin on as a second language.  

==Dictionary==

Get a good dictionary.  Use it until it is used up and then get another one.  No joke.  If you don't know a word, look it up.  In this book I will not be providing so much as a vocabulary list as a word list for you to look up in your dictionary.

==Articles==

Many teachers teach that Latin does not have articles the way English does.  This is wrong.  Latin does have articles, we just don't use them.  Or rather, they went out of normal use but were then recycled and are now used differently.  The word that used to mean &quot;the&quot; now is used as a pronoun and rarely will be used in Article Substantive combination unless in certain set idioms like &quot;eo tempore&quot; &quot;in the time&quot;.  The words for &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; in Latin also have a tendency to be used almost like an article but this is resisted.  For the most part, you should not worry about articles in Latin.  In English they are required; in Latin they are optional, and in fact usually avoided if at all possible.

== Exercises? ==
Hello again! May I ask you about your opinion about exercises in wikibooks? Well, maybe I should first ask whether you intend to include exercises in the book on Church Latin? And if yes, what kind of exercises? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 20:06, 26 November 2008 (UTC)

I should give some background for my question. I'm discussing with Whiteknight whether the Quiz extension should be included in wikibooks [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Technical_Assistance#What_about_quizzes.3F here]. This might be relevant for you if you want to include exercises in the book on Church Latin. But even if you don't intend to include exercises, I would be interested in your opinion on this question. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 22:14, 26 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most consonants in Latin sound just like their English counterparts.  

*B sounds like B.
*D sounds like D.
*F sounds like F.
*L sounds like L.
*M sounds like M.
*N sounds like N.
*P sounds like P.
*Q sounds like Q.
*S sounds like S.
*T sounds like T.
*V sounds like V.
*X sounds like X.


That is most of the Alphabet.  Now for the letters that are a little funny.

C is weak and will change sound depending on the Vowel that goes after it.  If the vowel is A, O, or U, then it will be hard like in Cop.  If it is followed by E, I or Y, then it will change sound.  However, it will not change like it does on English to be that of S but rather it will take on the CH sound heard in English words like Church.

G similarly will be just G before A,O, U but will be the sound heard in Gem before E,I,Y. 

If C or G are not to change sound before E,I,Y, then an H will be inserted between Consonant and the vowel to indicate this fact.  

Ci = Chee

Chi = Kee

The H sound in Latin is very weak.  It is in fact almost silent.  Some chiors learn to pronounce it as a K sound in works like Mihi, or Nihil, but we will not be learning that in this book.  For this book, we just need to know that H sounds like English H but softer.  H is not Harsh in Latin.  

J does not make anything close to the sound that English J makes.  The J sound in English words like Jump would be written as G in Latin.  Giamp.  In Latin J makes the same sound as the consonant English Y.  In English you write &quot;yes&quot; but in Latin we write &quot;jes&quot;.  This point is of special importance as the name of Jesus in Latin is spelled the same as in English but pronounced differently.  We must also keep in mind that some people will not use the letter J at all and will revert to the letter I.  This is ok.  It still makes the same sound if we put the hook at the bottom or not.  Jesus in Latin is pronounced as Yehsoos.  

R in Latin is rolled and is not a semi-vowel.  Many writers misspelled it as L, as they were so close in sound.  The Latin R is somewhere between the letter D and the letter L in sound.  If you can get a copy of the old Batman TV show, find an episode where a black woman was playing Catwoman.  She has the perfect R sound.  If you can sound like her then you are saying your Latin R Perrrrrrfectly, but be careful, Adam West may come out of the bushes looking for his lost love.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since Turbo Pascal 1.0, the use of assembly code within Borland (currently Embarcadero) languages was quite easy.

In Delphi, simply put an assembly block between asm...end; within a code block, or you can declare a whole function procedure as '''assembler'''.

Global or local variables can be used normally, but of course they will work as pointers.

Examples:

&lt;code&gt;
function StrLen (S : Pchar ) : cardinal;
begin
  asm
    MOV   EDX, EDI
    MOV   EDI, EAX
    MOV   ECX,0FFFFFFFFh
    XOR   AL, AL
    REPNE SCASB
    MOV   EAX, 0FFFFFFFEh
    SUB   EAX, ECX
    MOV   EDI, EDX
  end;
end;
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;
function StrLen (S : Pchar) : cardinal; assembler;
asm
  MOV   EDX, EDI
  MOV   EDI, EAX
  MOV   ECX, 0FFFFFFFFh
  XOR   AL, AL
  REPNE SCASB
  MOV   EAX, 0FFFFFFFEh
  SUB   EAX, ECX
  MOV   EDI, EDX
end;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The nominative case is the case used in Latin to show the subject of a sentence.  It is also the base form of most words.  As such, nominative have wide array of forms.  Nouns in Latin will usually fall into one of five &quot;declentions&quot;, or groups, depending on how the sounds in the word change to show a different grammatical function in the sentence.  However, it is almost impossible to tell from just the nominative form which group the word belongs to.  It is also difficult in some situations to know what gender the word is.  

These difficulties are remedied in the following ways;

*Know your vocabulary.  If you know the word, and all its forms, then you have no problem.  If you don't know the word but know many words like it, then you can also make a very good guess.

*Know what the genitive looks like.  We are not studying the genitive case yet, but if you know what the genitive looks like, then you know which group the word goes in.  The dynamic between the Nominative and the Genitive is how we are able to make the groups in the first place.  

*Get your dictionary.  The nominative is the form used to list words in the dictionary.  In the dictionary, you will see the genitive form as well, telling you the group, and the gender.


Latin nouns normally are classed into five different groups.  Three of these groups contains words that have gender and words that do not have gender.  Latin words can be both singular and plural and the way to form the plural differs according to group and gender.  The basic grammatical rule for forming the plural is to take the genitive case and remove the genitive ending and replace the genitive ending with the plural ending.  This can be confusing for the beginner student so simplified example follow.

*AE group words can be masculine or feminine but most by far are feminine.  They can not be neuter.  Neuter words have no gender but all AE group words have gender.  The rule for forming the Plural in this group is to add the E sound to the word.  
*Puella - Puellae

*I group words can be masculine or neuter but cannot be feminine.  The masculine words follow one rule but the neuter words follow a different rule.  Masculine words add I to the end of the word but neuter words add A.  
*Masculine words
*Puer - Pueri
*Servus - Servi
*Vir - Viri
*Magister - Magistri
*Sometimes the masculine word just adds I and sometimes the original word has to change to add I.
*Neuter words
*Regnum - Regna
*In this group all neuter words replace the UM with A.  

*IS group words can be masculine, feminine or neuter.  This is the largest group of words in the Latin language.  All of words with gender add ES to the end of the word and all neuter words add A to the end. Sometimes the original word just adds ES but most of the time the original word has to change so that ES can be added.  Some words will appear to have no change if they already end in ES.  
*Gender words
*Mulier - Mulieres
*Homo - Homines
*feles - feles
*clavis - clavis
*Urbs - Urbes
*Neuter words
*corpus - corpora
*animal - animalia

US group words are few in number.  Most are masculine but a small number a feminine or neuter.  The gender words have no change in order to form the plural.  The neuter words add A to the end.
*Gender words
*fructus - fructus
*manus - manus
*neuter words
*genu - genua

EI group words are almost all feminine.  Only the word DIES is masculine and that is only half the time.  EI group words can no not be neuter.  These words have no change in forming the plural.
*res - res
*dies - dies
==New Words==

New words come into Latin all the time and one of the things people think and argue about is which group to put it in.  This for us really is needless.  As far as nominatives go, just say the word with nothing added to it and that can function perfectly well as the nominative case. For other cases, if you follow the rules of Group Three, everyone will understand.  

Keep in mind, many words like Domus, will jump from one group to another over time, or depending on who is saying the word, so don't worry about it.

1
:  Which of the following are propositions?

: (a) Buy Premium Bonds!

: (b) The Apple Macintosh is a 16 bit computer.

: (c) There is a largest even number.

: (d) Why are we here?

: (e) 8 + 7 = 13

: (f) ''a'' + ''b'' = 13


2
: ''p'' is &quot;1024 bytes is known as 1MB&quot;

: ''q'' is &quot;A computer keyboard is an example of a data input device&quot;.

: Express the following compound propositions as English sentences in as natural a way as you can.  Are the resulting propositions true or false?

: (a) p  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; q

: (b) p &amp;or; q

: (c) &amp;not;p



3
: ''p'' is &quot;''x'' &lt; 50&quot;;  ''q'' is &quot;''x'' &gt; 40&quot;.

: Write as simply as you can:

: (a) &amp;not;''p''

: (b) &amp;not;''q''

: (c) ''p''  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q''

: (d) ''p'' &amp;or; ''q''

: (e) &amp;not;''p''  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q''

: (f) &amp;not;''p '' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''q''


: One of these compound propositional functions always produces the output ''true'', and one always outputs ''false''.  Which ones?



4
: ''p'' is &quot;I like Maths&quot;

: ''q'' is &quot;I am going to spend at least 6 hours a week on Maths&quot;

: Write in as simple English as you can:

: (a) (&amp;not;''p'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q''

: (b) (&amp;not;''p'') &amp;or; ''q''

: (c) &amp;not;(&amp;not;''p'')

: (e) &amp;not;(''p'' &amp;or; ''q''):

: (f) (&amp;not;''p'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (&amp;not;''q'')


5
: In each part of this question a proposition ''p'' is defined.  Which of the statements that follow the definition correspond to the proposition &amp;not;''p''?  (There may be more than one correct answer.)

: (a) 
:''p'' is &quot;Some people like Maths&quot;.

: (i) &quot;Some people dislike Maths&quot;

: (ii) &quot;Everybody dislikes Maths&quot;

: (iii) &quot;Everybody likes Maths&quot;

: (You may assume in this question that no-one remains neutral: they either like or dislike Maths.)


: (b)
: ''p'' is &quot;The answer is either 2 or 3&quot;.

: (i) &quot;Neither 2 nor 3 is the answer&quot;

: (ii) &quot;The answer is not 2 or it is not 3&quot;

: (iii) &quot;The answer is not 2 and it is not 3&quot;


: (c)
: ''p'' is &quot;All people in my class are tall and thin&quot;.

: (i) &quot;Someone in my class is short and fat&quot;

: (ii) &quot;No-one in my class is tall and thin&quot;

: (iii) &quot;Someone in my class is short or fat&quot;

1
: Construct truth tables for:

: (a) &amp;not;''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''q''

: (b) ''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (&amp;not;''p'' &amp;or; ''q'')

: (d) (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'') &amp;or; ''r''


2
: Construct truth tables for each of the following compound propositions.  What do you notice about the results?

: (a) ''p'' &amp;or; (&amp;not;''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'')

: (b) ''p'' &amp;or; ''q''


3
: Repeat question 2 for:

: (a) ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''p'')

== Logic Exercise 3 ==

1 
:For each pair of expressions, construct truth tables to see if the two compound propositions are logically equivalent:

: (a)
: (i) ''p'' &amp;or; (''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''p'')
: (ii) ''p'' &amp;or; ''q''

: (b)
: (i) (&amp;not;''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'') &amp;or; (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''q'')
: (ii) (&amp;not;''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''q'') &amp;or; (''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'')


2
: Construct the truth table for each of the following expressions.  Try to find a simpler logical equivalent in each case:

: (a)
: &amp;not;''a'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''b'' &amp;or; (''a'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''c'')

: (b)
: (''a'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''b'') &amp;or; (''a'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''c'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; d) &amp;or; (&amp;not;''a'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''b'')


3
: Use the ''Laws of Logic'' or truth tables to simplify as far as possible:

: (a)
: &amp;not;(&amp;not;''a'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''b'')

: (b)
: (''a'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''b'') &amp;or; (''a'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''b'') &amp;or; (&amp;not;''a'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''b'')

: (c)
: (''q'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''p'') &amp;or; ''p''


4
: Use a truth table to show that the proposition ''p'' &amp;or; (''q'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''p'') is always true (T), whatever the values of ''p'' and ''q''.


5
: ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'' represent conditions that will be true or false when a certain computer program is executed.  Suppose you want the program to carry out a certain task only when ''p'' or ''q'' is true (but not both) and ''r'' is false.

: Using ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;or; and &amp;not;, write a statement that will only be true under these conditions.


6
: Use truth tables to show that:

:&amp;not;((''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''q'') &amp;or; (r &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''p'' &amp;or; &amp;not;''q''))) &amp;equiv; &amp;not;''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q''


7
: Use the laws of logical propositions to prove that:

:(''z'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''w'') &amp;or; (&amp;not;''z'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''w'') &amp;or; (''z'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; &amp;not;''w'') &amp;equiv; ''z'' &amp;or; ''w''

:State carefully which law you are using at each stage.

1
: (a) is not a proposition.  (It is a command, or imperative.)

: (b) and (c) are both propositions.

: (d) is not a proposition; it's a question.

: (e) strictly speaking is a propositional function, but many people would say it is a proposition.


2
: Noting that ''p'' is ''false'' (1024 bytes is known as 1KB) and ''q'' is ''true'', we have:

: (a)     &quot;1024 bytes is known as 1MB and a computer keyboard is an example of a data input device&quot;.  False.

: (b)     &quot;(Either) 1024 bytes is known as 1MB or a computer keyboard is an example of a data input device&quot;. True.

: The word Either here is optional; it doesn't have - and doesn't need - an equivalent symbol in Logic.

: (c) &quot;1024 bytes is not known as 1MB&quot;.  True.


3
: (a) ''x'' &amp;ge; 50

: (b) ''x'' &amp;le; 40

: (c) 40 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 50

: (d) ''x'' &lt; 50 or ''x'' &gt; 40.  This is true for all values of ''x''.

: (e) ''x'' &amp;ge; 50 (Note that we don't need to say, in addition, that ''x'' &gt; 40; this must be true whenever ''x'' &amp;ge; 50.)

: (f) ''x'' &amp;ge; 50 and ''x'' &amp;le; 40.  This can never be true, whatever the value of ''x''.


: So (d) is a [[../#Tautology|tautology]] – it's always true; and (f) is always false.


4
: (a) I don’t like Maths, but I’m going to spend at least 6 hours a week on Maths.

:(This sounds much more natural than &quot;I don’t like Maths, and I’m going to spend at least 6 hours a week on Maths.&quot;)

: (b) Either I don’t like Maths, or I’m going to spend at least 6 hours a week on Maths.

: (c) It’s not true that I don’t like Maths. (Or simply: I ''do'' like Maths.)

: (d) Either I don’t like Maths, or I’m not going to spend at least 6 hours a week on Maths.
: (It's not very easy to get a natural sounding sentence here. It probably helps to include the word &quot;Either&quot;, but it's not essential.)

: (e) It’s not true that either I like Maths or I’m going to spend at least 6 hours a week on Maths. Or, simply: I neither like Maths, nor am I going to spend at least 6 hours a week on Maths. 
: Alternatively, you can write the answer to (f), which is…

: (f) I don’t like Maths and I’m not going to spend at least 6 hours a week on Maths.

: (a) (ii)

: (b) (i) and (iii)

: (c) (iii)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== History ==
Myoglobin was the first protein whose structure was determined. In 1958, Max Perutz and John Kendrew determined the 3D structure of myoglobin by X-ray crystallography. Four years later, they both received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for this innovation.

== Structure ==
[[Image:MyoglobinCurve.JPG‎|‎right|180px|thumb|Myoglobin Binding Curve]]

Myoglobin is a monomeric protein that has 153 amino acids residues. It consists of eight α-helicies connected through the turns with an Oxygen binding site. It has a globular structure. Myoglobin contains a heme (prosthetic) group which is responsible for its main function (carrying of oxygen molecules to muscle tissues). Myoglobin can exist in the oxygen free form, deoxymyoglobin, or in a form in which the oxygen molecule is bound, called oxymyoglobin. Myoglobin is a protein found in muscles that binds oxygen with its heme group like hemoglobin. Heme group consists of protoporphyrin organic component and an iron atom located in its center. The heme group gives muscle and blood their distinctive red color. The organic component consists of four pyrrole rings that are linked by methine bridges. In addition, heme is responsible for the red color of the blood and muscle. Oxidation of the iron atom (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) is mainly responsible for the color of muscle and blood. At the center of protporphyrin, the iron atom is bonded to nitrogen atoms from four pyrrole rings. The iron atom can form two additional bonds, one on each side of the heme plane. These binding sites are called the fifth and sixth coordination sites. In myoglobin, the fifth coordination site is occupied by the imidazole ring from a histidine residue on the protein. This hisitidine is referred to as the proximal histidine. The sixth coordination site is available to bind oxygen. The iron atom in deoxymyoglobin lies about four angstrom out of the plane of the protoporphyrin plane because it is too big in that form to fit into the well defined hole. &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Heme b.png|250px|Heme group molecular structure]]

The normal oxidation state of an iron atom has a positive two charge (ferrous ion) instead of three charge (ferric ion) and it is too large to fit into the plane of protoporphyrin. Thus, an ferrous ion often 0.4A away from porphyrin plane. However, when iron oxidized from ferrous ion (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) to ferric ion (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), because the lost of one extra electron, forces between protons and electrons increases so that the electron cloud will penetrate more towards to the nucleus. As a result, the ferric ion (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) has a smaller size then ferrous ion (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and fits into the protoporphyrin plane when it attaches to an oxygen.&lt;br&gt;
When oxygen leaves the myoglobin, it leaves as dioxygen rather than superoxide. This is because superoxide can be damaging to many biological process, and in the leaving of superdioxide, the iron ion will be in the ferric state which stops biding oxygen. 
[[Image:tinomyoglobin.jpg|300px|The interaction between myoglobin and oxygen included the resonance of iron (II) ion with oxygen and iron (III) ion with superoxide ion]]&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Heme deoxy vs oxygenated.jpg|800px|Iron's slight orientation changes from deoxyhemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin]]

The distal histidine amino acid from the hemoglobin protein molecule further stabilizes the O2 molecule by hydrogen-bonding interactions.
[[Image:HEME + DISTAL HISTIDINE.jpg|800px|O2 stabilized by Distal Histidine]]&lt;br&gt;
Myoglobin is a protein molecule that has a similar structure and function to hemoglobin. It is a smaller monomer of polypeptide structure, a globular protein with amino acids and prosthetic heme group binds to proximal histidine group while a distal histidine group interact on the other side of the plane. It binds and stores oxygen without concerning cooperativity. Most importantly, it is the first protein structure to be studied.

Myoglobin follows the Michaelis-Menten Kinetic graph. (as seen from the graph above) It follows the Michaelis-Menten kinetics because it is a simple chemical equilibrium.

== Function ==
The binding affinities for oxygen between myoglobin and hemoglobin are important factors for their function. Both myoglobin and hemoglobin binds oxygen well when the concentration of oxygen is really high (E.g. in Lung), however, hemoglobin is more likely to release oxygen in areas of low concentration (E.g. in tissues). Since hemoglobin binds oxygen less tightly than myoglobin in muscle tissues, it can effectively transport oxygen throughout the body and deliver it to the cells. Myoglobin, on the other, would not be as efficient in transferring oxygen. It does not show the cooperative binding of oxygen because it would take up oxygen and only release in extreme conditions. Myoglobin has a strong affinity for oxygen that allows it to store oxygen in muscle effectively. This is important when the body is starve for oxygen, such as during anaerobic exercise. During that time, carbon dioxide level in blood streams is extremely high and lactic acid concentration build up in muscles. Both of these factors cause myoglobin (and hemoglobins) to release oxygen, for protecting the body tissues from getting damaged under harsh conditions. If the concentration of myoglobin is high within the muscle cells, the organism is able to hold the breath for a much longer period of time.

Myoglobin, an iron-containing protein in muscle, receives oxygen from the red blood cells and transports it to the mitochondria of muscle cells, where the oxygen is used in cellular respiration to produce energy. Each myoglobin molecule has one heme prosthetic group located in the hydrophobic cleft in the protein. The function of myoglobin is notable from Millikan's review (1) in which he put together an accomplished study  to establish that myoglobin is formed adaptively in tissues in response to oxygen needs and that myoglobin contributes to the oxygen supply of these tissues. Oxymyoglobin regulates both oxygen supply and utilization by acting as a scavenger of the bioactive molecule nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is generated continuously in the myocyte. Oxymyoglobin reacts with NO to form harmless nitrates, with concomitant formation of ferric myoglobin, which is recycled through the action of the intracellular enzyme metmyoglobin reductase. Flogel (2) conducted a study that showed how the interaction of NO and oxymyoglobin controls cardiac oxygen utilization.

== Disease ==
When muscle tissue is damaged, very large concentrations of myoglobin enters the kidneys. When this happens, myoglobin is then considered highly toxic and may contribute to acute renal failure. Muscle injury is commonly associated with the release of myoglobin, and is known to be the cause of heart attacks and many other myoalgia. Studies have shown that acute mycocardial infarction can be detected with the help of the monitoring of creatin kinase and troponin by electrocardiogram.

&lt;big&gt;'''Hemangioendothelioma'''&lt;/big&gt;


*Rare tumor
*Intermediate-grade malignant tumors, clinically behaving between benign hemangioma and malignant angiosarcoma. Some have rather benign course while others show much more malignant progression
*Typically occur in adults with roughly equal sex distribution
*Most common location is soft tissues, but have been described essentially anywhere in the body
*Symptoms depend upon location of the primary tumor
*Most common histologic type is epithelioid hmangioendothelioma (EHE)
*For isolated tumors, curative resection with negative margin should be performed
*Role of adjuvant RT is unclear, but is often considered
*Most common metastatic sites are lungs, liver, lymph nodes and bone
*Effectiveness of chemotherapy is unclear
*Most studies are small single institution series</text>

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: follwed → followed, preceeded → preceded, to to → to (2) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In Ecclesiastical Latin, certain letters are used together to create a sound that one letter by itself is not able to make.  An example of this in English is when we put an '''H''' after an '''S''' to create the '''SH''' sound as in Shopping.  Latin does a similar thing, but instead of an '''H''', we use a '''C'''.  However, '''SC''' will not change in all places.  As we saw with '''C''' and '''G''' before '''A,O,U''', when they did not change, so '''SC''' does not change sound before these letters.  Before the '''AOU''' letters, '''SC''' will sound like the '''SK''' in the English word Skip. 

However, before '''E,I,Y'''; just as '''C''' and '''G''' changed sound, so '''SC''' will change from an '''SK''' sound to the '''SH''' sound.  

So '''SCOPO''' will sound as '''SKOPO'''.  However '''SCINDO''' will sound as '''SHEENDO'''.  

This rule is simple to learn as all you need to is keep in mind that AOU and EIY are two different groups of vowels and C,G, and SC that go with them will change sound.  This rule also has implications when pronouncing certain words.

If there is an '''X''' followed by a '''C''' then which is then followed by EIY, then an interesting thing will happen.  The '''X''' will loose its sound of '''KS''' and will blend with the '''C'''.  If we break the '''X''' apart this is what we are really saying;

'''CSCE'''

This will sound not as '''KS CHEH''' but rather as '''K SHEH''' as in the capital letters in the following words.  '''neCK SHEll'''.  An example of when this happens is in the word '''EXCELSIS''' from the '''Gloria'''.  '''eKSHEllsees'''

The next combination we will look at is the '''GN''' combination.  It often sounded as the '''NY''' in the English word '''caNYon'''.  On very rare occasions, some people who have studied too much Greek will misspell this as '''GG''' in imitation of the Greek.  Please don't do this.

The next issue is not so much a blend that happens on purpose to create a sound not represented in the Alphabet but rather is a sound that happens by accident as a result of how people just naturally pronounce the words.  Since this is a naturally occurring case, the rules for when it happens and when it does not may seem odd at first.  

If the letters '''TI''' do not have an '''S''' before them and are followed by at least one more '''vowel''' then a slight '''s''' sound will happen between the '''T''' and the '''I'''.  Also, this does not happen if the '''TI''' begins the word.  So;

begins the word

'''Tiara''' - '''Tee Ahrah''' just as written

preceded by '''S'''

'''Constituere''' - '''KonSTEEtoo ehre''' just as written

not followed by at least one more vowel sound

'''Continens''' - '''KonTEEnens'''  just as written

But...

'''Continentia''' - '''konteenenTSEEa'''  not exactly as written when pronounced naturally


Most words that do this will be have it at the end and will end in things like '''tia''' or '''tio'''.  In English we have some of these as in '''action'''.  However, unlike English which changes the '''TI''' to a '''SH''' sound, in Latin just add a slight '''S'''sound after the '''T'''.  Some writers will misspell this as '''Z''', but you should avoid this practice as '''Z''' is reserved for words of Greek origin that have not been fully Latinized.  

The last bit to mention here are the vowel blends.  Most of the time, in a Latin word, all vowels will be pronounced distinct and separate from each other.  On rare occasions '''UI''' may be allowed to sound like English '''WEE''' but this is avoided.  More often we will allow the '''U''' to turn into a '''V''' sound to give us '''VEE'''.  

'''EU''' in many borrowed words will sometimes sound as '''JU''' but again, this is avoided and if you don't do it, you will be alright.

There are some vowel blends that are not avoided but in fact encouraged.  

'''AU''' will sound like the '''OU''' in the English word '''OUT'''.  This natural.

'''AE''' and '''OE''' will often just sound like '''E''', the open sounds before it being drowned out.  Some speakers will pronounce these as an '''E''' with just a slight '''I''' sound after but you don't have to do this.

Besides these, all vowels are to be pronounced distinct and separate from each other.

=Ruy Lopez, Zaitsev Variation=
White's move 11. a4 is by far the main line today. On his sixth move Black weakened his queenside with 6...b5, and White's move is the typical probe to target this point. Black meanwhile plays ...h6 to prevent the forced draw with 12. Ng5 Rf8 13. Nf3, as the more consistent 11...Bf8 12. Ng5 Re7 is very awkward for Black. After these moves White usually continues with the consistent Nb1-d2-g3 maneuver to the kingside.

What follows is very deep strategy infused with sharp tactics. Some eighteen moves in, a pawn sacrifice becomes part of a major line. For example, after the moves 12...Bf8 13. Bc2 exd4 14. cxd4 Nb4 15. Bb1 c5 16. d5 Nd7 17. Ra3! (ready to bring the rook to the kingside when the time comes) f5! (countering with an attack in the center. This move attacks the base of White's e4-d5 chain, and it is shown that his center is unstable. Fortunately, he has more than enough resources, as shown in practice, in the form of an attack on the king) 18. g4! and the pawn sacrifice is here. White forfeits the center, but a malicious g4-g5 advance breaking open lines on the kingside is imminent. If 18...fxe4 19. Nxe4 Bxd5 20. g5 practice has shown that White wins much more often than Black because of his kingside pressure. Nevertheless, the position is difficult to handle, and often results in decisive games. For this reason the main line is 18...f4 19. Nb3 g5 20. Bd2 Bg7 21. Nbd4 when White is better simply because he has more space and Black's light squares are weak.

A seemingly more active move is 15...bxa4?!, which simply weakens the queenside pawns. White would do well to follow Kasparov--Karpov, World Championship 1990 and play 16. Rxa4 a5 17. Ra3 Ra6 18. Nh2! g6 19. f3!! The point: White relieves all pressure on his center and allows him to proceed with building up of an attack at his leisure. Black found himself struggling to find play of any sort, and quickly succumbed after a nice combination: 19...Qd7 20. Nc4 Qb5 21. Rc3 Bc8 22. Be3 c6 23. Qc1 Kh7 24. Ng4 Ng8 25. Bxh6! Sacrificing a piece temporarily to effect control over the dark squares in Black's camp. 25...Bxh6 26. Nxh6 Nxh6 27. Nxd6 Qb6! 28. Nxe8 Qxd4+? (Although it takes a pawn with check, the fact is that it opens up the d-file. Later analyses revealed that the immediate 28...Qd8! was superior, although Black's position is still difficult.) 29. Kh1 Qd8 30. Rd1 Qxd8 31. Qg5! penetrating onto the d-file. There then followed the inevitable marshalling of White's forces for a dramatic kingside attack: 31...Ra7 32. Rd8 Qe6 33. f4 Ba6 34. f5! Qe7 35. Qd2 Qe5 36. Qf2 Qe7 37. Qd4 Ng8 38. e5! Nd5!? 39. fxg6+ fxg6 40. Rxc6 Qxd8 41. Qxa7+ Nde7 42. Rxa6 Qd1+ 43. Qg1 Qd2 44. Qf1 and Black resigned.

		&lt;td&gt;±&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	
&lt;/table&gt;

In this variation Black's queenside is weak and he lacks counterplay, as in Kasparov--Karpov, World Championship 1990.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The sentence pattern for this lesson will be as follows.

* '''NN GN ESSE'''

and 

* '''NN DN ESSE'''

The first, '''NN GN ESSE''' is not so hard to understand.  The genitive case is basically a noun pretending to be an adjective.  Most of the time it denotes possession but does have some other uses.  The above sentence pattern is not really equal to '''NN NA ESSE''' because the whole point of such a sentence is to inform us that the subject noun has the quality of the adjective.  However, in '''NN GN ESSE''', we are really saying just '''NN ESSE''' with the extra genitive tacted on as an after thought.  The genitive here is not so important to the sentence.  The Nominative Noun is much more important.

'''Currum matris est.'''   &quot;It's mom's car.&quot;

However, if we change the Genitive to a Dative we get; '''NN DN ESSE''' and this very strongly expresses the idea of possession.  The Dative is not just an extra idea added to the sentence but is unnecessary as the genitive is.  In the sentence pattern, the Dative is the most important word.  The very purpose of the sentence is to tell us TO WHO the thing in the nominative belongs.

'''Currum matri est.'''   Liturally this is &quot;Car ''to mom'' is.&quot;  But it has the force of &quot;The car BELONGS TO MOM (and no one else).&quot;  OR, &quot;The car is MOM'S, not mine, not yours, not Dad's, only MOM'S.&quot;

Interestingly, since Latin is a pro-drop language, which means that if the subject is understood already between speaker and listener it need not be expressed, we often find '''NN DN ESSE''' being expressed as '''DN ESSE'''.

'''Matri est.'''   &quot;It is for Mom.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Proteins are important macromolecules in living organisms because they are structurally. Therefore, they can take on essential roles in a wide variety of biological processes and functions. Protein structure can be described on several different levels. The primary structure of protein refers to the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chains. Different amino acids contain different functional groups.  The secondary structure of protein deals with the fact that polypeptide chains fold into a regularly repeating structure, such as an alpha-helix and beta-sheet. The tertiary structure of proteins gives the overall structural arrangement of one single subunit polypeptide chain. The quaternary structure of protein refers to the arrangement and interaction of several subunit polypeptide chains to form a protein molecule. The structural diversity and complexity of proteins enable them to perform a diverse variety of functions. A protein is made up of many amino acids through peptide bonds between a carboxyl group and an amino group of another adjacent amino acid. This makes the protein form long chains. Some proteins are known to function alone; however, there are many proteins that work together to form complexes (for example: ribosomes, lipids, nucleic acids, etc.). This creates functionality of cells, and organisms all together.  The main function of proteins depends on the amino acids that make up the protein as well as the way it folds.

Some of these functions are given below:\
[[Image:Antibody1.JPG‎‎|‎right|thumb|Antibody]

Antibodies are proteins that participate in the immune response by defending the body against antigens (foreign invaders). Antibodies travel through the blood stream and are utilized by the immune system to identify and defend against bacteria, viruses, and other foreign intruders. Certain antibodies destroy antigens by immobilizing them so that the white blood cells can destroy the antigens. An antibody is made up of 2 heavy and 2 light chains. The two chains are connected by disulfide bonds. There is a variable region and constant region. The variable region is the region where the antigens bind to. Because its variable, different antigens can bind to these regions. 

Contractile proteins are the proteins that involved in movement. They include myosin and actin, which participate in muscle contractions and movement. Actin filaments are the major components of the network. Other contractile proteins interact with these filaments in order to create structural rigidity and movement. Contractile proteins's structure and function are striated muscles and well characterized; thus,they contribute a great example of nonmuscle cells. Moreover, the interaction of contractile proteins of various cells may be unique. The study of contractile proteins in cells other than muscle has distinct difficulties. For example, the proteins are presented in a lower concentration than in muscle, and only a few cell types are obtainable for study in quantities comparable to muscle. Also, proteolysis and other detriments may be more severe in nonmuscle cells. Other example can be that the organization of contractile proteins is difficult to define in nonmuscle cells. Nevertheless, the ubiquity of contractile proteins and the importance of their intractions presages increase relevancy for physiology and medicine.


Structural proteins are the proteins that are generally fibrous and stringy. They are the most abundant class of proteins in nature. Their main function is to provide mechanical support. Examples of structural proteins can be keratin, collagen, and elastin. Keratins are found in hair, quills, feathers, horns, and beaks. Collagens and elastin are found in connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments. Collagen is recognized as the most abundant mammalian protein. Structural proteins such as collagen, fibronectin and laminin are utilized in cell culture applications as attachment factors. Sigma offers the most comprehensive collection of structural proteins for extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal research as well as tools for cell culture and material science applications.


Enzymes are the proteins that regulate biochemical processes. They are often called catalysts because they function to lower the activation energy of the reaction and thereby increases the rate of the reaction. Essentially, enzymes are able to do so because they can stabilize the transition state. Lactase and pepsin are examples of enzymes. Lactase is involved in the breakdown of lactose, which are present in milk. Pepsin, on the other hand, helps break down proteins in food. Enzymes are biological catalysts or assistants. Enzymes consist of various types of proteins that work to drive the chemical reaction required for a specific action or nutrient. The chemicals that are transformed with the help of enzymes are called substrates. In the absence of enzymes, these chemicals are called reactants.

Hormonal proteins are the proteins that act as signaling proteins, which help regulate biological activities in the body. Insulin, oxytocin, and somatotropin are examples of hormonal proteins. Insulin is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism by controlling the blood-sugar concentration. Oxytocin is responsible for stimulating contractions in women during childbirth. Lastly, somatotropin stimulates protein production in muscle cells.[[Image:Somatotropin 1HGU.png|thumb|Somatotropin|100px]]

Storage proteins are the proteins that act as storage for amino acids or specific ligands, such as biologically important metal ions. They include ovalbumin and casein. The former is present in egg whites while the latter is found in milk. Another example is myoglobin, which function as the storage of oxygen for tissues.

Transport proteins are the proteins that are responsible for moving molecules from one place to another. For example, the protein hemoglobin is responsible for the transport of oxygen in the blood. Another example is cytochromes, which acts as electron carrier proteins in the electron transfer chain.

Membrane proteins are the proteins that are found in biological membranes. They can either be peripheral or integral. They may act as biological markers or regulatory channels for ions and molecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Awakening from a Dream: Body Narration in the Sense of Micro-politics

Yang Xiaoyan


It was over ten years ago in Beijing that I first crossed paths with Liu Zheng and listened to him talk about photography. He struck me as an extremely conscientious and sincere young man, a human being who was almost too harsh on himself. Liu Zheng talked about the quality of photography, the responsibilities of photographers and the cruelty of the lens.  His methods of persuasion were soothing and convincing,  engaging in discussion, but ultimately nailing down conclusions with little room for doubt or debate.  His gaze fixed on you, words clearly spoken and eloquently organized, Liu Zheng cast a spell on his audience,  under which they felt compelled to listen attentively and reply earnestly. 


I learned that it was back then Liu Zheng engaged himself in his controversial “Fellow Countryman” series,  which was quite a sensation.  At that time,  documentary photography had become the trophy of most younger experimental photographers.  It had become so faddish that one's status as a photographer would be questioned if one didn’t include the topic in a conversation or have some work of the sort in one's portfolio.

Liu Zheng and I never had in-depth discussion that covered the subject, but it is possible that when we first met, I fell for the habit of labeling him a “documentary” photographer.  My direct impression was that through his lens, Liu Zheng tried to express a full set of visual concepts and a macro-existence of a reality that was Chinese. Liu Zheng hoped to create a presentation of a powerful, significant world of independence.  Just like the German photographer Sander, Liu Zheng wanted to make a profile of a nation.

But in time,  I realized this interpretation was flawed.  First of all,  throughout Fellow Countryman, Liu Zheng featured people with strangely distinguished facial structures. After carefully studying their visages, I realized that Liu Zheng had his own unique feeling towards images. And this dictated him in his choice of models.  It had nothing to do with the commonly understood idea of “Documentary Photography”. Liu Zheng wouldn’t find satisfaction in responses stirred by ordinary images; neither would he linger on the shallowness of novelty.  He was digging for the deeply hidden ''universal'' in all the irregular, irrelevant and irreplaceable images. Please pay attention to the word universal here. I need to emphasize here that in Liu Zheng’s decision-making,  universal doesn’t even exist. This is a concept too fake and too posed.  Universal exists on a hosting body. The details have been molded over and over again by the repeating course of history. Once embodied into different bodies of flesh, these details radiate awe-inspiring composure and style.

In his search for this composure and style, Liu Zheng even zoomed in on those drawing their last breaths. Their flesh carried the syndromes of naturalism and chanted grief over losing its grip on life.  He also examined bodies that were once exuberant and lively, but interrupted brutally by ugly accidents; corpses swollen and decomposed; the specimen of a deformed fetus.  He never shunned away from inevitable cruelty when he was challenged to look. Instead, he wanted the concept of vision to return to the state of being challenged to look. To him, this is the true nature of vision.

Liu Zheng’s lens stayed on the dead body of a young female: every trace of life drained.  Still and silent, a naked body with all the aesthetics traits lay in the morgue.  The delicate shadows of the image froze the rapid changes the body of the deceased was going through. Underneath the skin, there was an overly severe interrogation of watching. When my eyes  fixed on this photo, I came to understand what Liu Zheng strived to achieve here. I sensed his inner tension, a stress of life that could not be calmed or comforted, and a magical power released from the tension and stress. I can imagine how Liu Zheng held his breath in his practice of the responsibilities of the onlookers. Throughout the process, he never lost his sincerity and conscientiousness most vision workers did not have. Through his lens, he stared at the image of his choice before depressing the shutter release, then he must have closed his eyes and dealt with the muted waves crashing from the darkness of his heart. After all this, he led the waves into his lonely dark room and allowed them to flow into the dark red narrow spaces.

At some point, Liu Zheng went through a transition. He no longer continued adding to Fellow Countryman. The superficial explanation was this task had been “finished”.  In actuality, he had discovered a new concept.

To those who never understood him, his transition seemed to be so rapid that it was even a bit unbelievable. At this stage, Liu Zheng was not merely looking for objects. He was creating and manipulating them to visualize long-standing concepts. He set off to replicate classic Chinese legends and folklore that no one had previously imagined visualizing.  Through adequate regrouping and reshuffling of visions, he wanted to transform these tales into black humor-motiffed scenes that took place in the visions of daily life.

The “Pan Si Cave” series was an important work of this practice and marked a starting point. Eerily and aimlessly, the nudity of seven vulgar women demonstrated the absurdity-filled metaphors of classic literature.  When this story existed only in written form,  spread around as an anecdote in literature, nobody had savored the true meaning of the sense of vision. Once it was put into practice by Liu Zheng, it inspired a lot of irresponsible versions of replica. My curiosity was aroused.  When some replica had reached more resonant fame than Liu Zheng's works, I gained a more conscious knowledge of his practice. Liu Zheng works with the determination of no return. This is reflected in his indifference towards replica derived from his works. He has more important things to worry about. Then some meaningful works were listed as part of his art creation. It was a series of revolution themed works, such as Nan Jing Massacre, the Revolutionist, the Five Brave Warriors of Mt. Lang Ya, the Milk of the People, etc.

This series of works stated that Liu Zheng was no longer a photographer. His works had the piercing power into history. He transformed the once magnificent tragedies into ambiguous, mentally labyrinth-styled comedy.

After that, he came to a stop. It seemed that he was hibernating, waiting for an awakening.

To me, he was brewing another visual riot.

Now, this riot has become reality. Liu Zheng has named it “Awakening from a Dream”: elegant, traditional and poetic. In my humble opinion, the fundamental meaning of this riot is a desperate march towards the ultimate truth. Attempts to overthrow the present world of vision are made. To me, this desperate marching on of Liu Zheng is a brand new experiment on the narration of the body in the sense of micro-politics. It becomes even more so when he is facing the iron-clad regulation concerning the flesh. The marching is not just desperate. It is becoming an unprecedented soul agitating sound: clear, bright and shrill.

For over 30 years, the realm of vision has been trying out ways to establish a narration of the body. Invigorated by the essence of aesthetics, arts, spiritualism and vision, it seeks high and low for a legitimate presentation of the flesh which has been banned constantly. Pitiful, the more legal the presentation of the narration of body gets, the more vanished the true flesh become in the celebration and the noise of the art of vision. I think the aesthetics of flesh has murdered the narration of flesh. The aesthetics of flesh, in the most widely known sense, it’s to zoom out from the microcosmic to the macrocosmic. In the process, the focus is lost. Strictly speaking, the aesthetics of flesh is anti revolutionary practice. It fears all the acute social issues that are involved. To empower the flesh to become a powerful narration of the body, we need to put the flesh into a spacious political environment. Whatever is pretentious and staged are to be get rid of. The core of our daily action of staring should be honesty, intelligence and even abandonment. Furthermore, the order of the body needs to be restructured into an open, direct, microcosmically meaningful order.

I understand the audacious hardship Liu Zheng endures for his works. In the narration of the body, the difficulties don’t lay in the exquisite techniques or the rich layers of the shadows and lines. These two loom tremendous challenge on the photographers. But the most difficult part is to find suitable objects to portray. A sufficient communication is needed before encouraging your objects to respond accordingly to the requirements of the body narration. You need to bear it in mind that Liu Zheng’s body narration, despite its huge amount of work, fails to win the favor and fondness of either elite society or the common crowds. In this sense, Liu Zheng considers his latest practice “awakening from a dream”. It’s obvious that he has seen the multi-layered meanings related to the flesh.

Frankly speaking, our nation has not developed a set of body narration that possesses the strength to penetrate the reality. Our bodies were defined by the traditional rules first and then altered by the mortal aesthetics. The most extreme presentation was Lingci (an ancient Chinese torture in which a man tied up to a stake is submitted to a lingchi by an executioner, who throws the sliced pieces into a basket on his feet). The most public display is the execution square. The most humiliating blow is flogging with a stick. The most daily aesthetics is the “3-inch binded feet”. The most hypocritical expression is the currently ruling aesthetics. It could either be hiding behind a secret curtain to generate murky smiles of debauchery or be amputated mercilessly by the frightening knife of the executioner. Today, the concept of the body is always linked with aesthetics.  Then, the pair shamelessly roams all kinds of public functions and becomes subject to the touches of every type of worldly judgmental eyes. You are stung by this numb feeling until you lose sense of feeling eventually.

Liu Zheng hopes that he can rewrite about the body narration. His approaches may seem radical on the surface but deep inside he never loses the calmness. Because of the fine details of the shadows and lines, the fearlessness in the composure, the cutting edge of the images, the height of the spirit and the daring gaze in the microcosmic sense, Liu Zheng’s body narration has been elevated onto the level of visual politics. Just like awakening from a dream, his works make the world of the mortals tremble, fear, bellow and flee. Through his arts, Liu Zheng speaks to us that only when we stare with the most genuine attitude that our action of staring can obtain its full value.  Trembles, fears, bellows and attempts to escape only indicate how hypocritical we are.

There are no other options. We have to be honest and at ease if we don’t want to harbor anything hypocritical. Then we will stare, to stare at Liu Zheng’s “Awakening from a Dream”, a body narration in the sense of micro-politics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Contradictory material on the script==
The following material was in the article before I reorganized it. It seems contradictory and I wasn't able to verify any of it. I thought it best to bring it to the talk page where it can be improved and replaced in the article if necessary. There other problem though is that much of it is probably too complex for a Wikijunior section.  - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] ([[User talk:Taxman|talk]]) 13:17, 26 November 2008 (UTC)
:The Telugu alphabet is called &quot;Onamaalu&quot;. The word derived from &quot;Om namah shivaya&quot; the starting words in the prayer to Lord shiva. Between the 10th and 14th centuries, Shaivism (Hindus who believe Shiva as the supreme god) was more prevalent in Andhra Pradesh, the Telugu speaking land of India and the teachers used to start their lessons with a prayer to lord Shiva with &quot;Om namah shivaya siddam namaha&quot;. Gradually these words became O- na- maa-lu.

:The alphabet of telugu is called as &quot;Aksharamala&quot;. And this aksharamala is divided into three parts. 
:1)Atchulu
:2)hallulu
:3)samyuktaksharalu.
:&quot;Atchulu&quot; in telugu refers to the vowels in english. and &quot;hallulu&quot; refers to consonants in English. This Telugu aksharamala comprises of 56 letters. Achulu constitutes 15 letters and hallulu constitutes 38 letters and samyuktaksharalu constitutes 3 letters. every letter belongs to &quot;atchulu&quot; is called as &quot;atchu&quot;. And the letter belongs to hallulu is called as &quot;hallu&quot;. These hallulu(consonants) can be pronouced and written in different ways using some manipulations to the hallu. these manipulated hallus are called as &quot;guninthalu&quot; in telugu.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How have working relationships changed with the rise in mobility?}}

Becoming more and more dependent on IT and electronic communications, and driven by the benefit of saving office and travel costs, many companies have closed their offices and told their employees to be mobile workers. For these mobile workers, work is no longer just somewhere to go to, but something they do, wherever they are. This also raises a new managerial issue regarding how working relationships have changed with the increase in worker mobility.

==Definition==
Firstly let us look at the definition of working relationship. Working relationship is defined as &quot;an interpersonal relationship that is task-based, non-trivial, and of continuing duration&quot; (Gabarro, 1990, p. 81). This means that working relationship is interpersonal relationships, in that they are based upon the shared goal of task achievement.

==Relations with Management==
One major issue with respect to the working relationship in mobile workplace is managers who work with mobile workers must be results-oriented rather than process-driven. That is, they need to be comfortable seeing only what mobile workers get done and not what they're doing moment to moment. Another issue related to the working relationship in mobile workplace is mobile staff must form supportive relationships promptly. For example, mobile Working groups were more often made up of digital employees from all around the country, some times from all over the world, who never meet each other before. To work effectively, they must work in the bases of mutual support first, without any delay. Meanwhile they can develop relationship of affiliation and intimacy along with working.

==Worker Identification==
Other issues such as mobile workers feel a weakened sense of identification with their organizations all arise from the special feature of the mobile working. The feature of mobile workers is they work at anywhere any time. This means that managers can’t monitor employees’ work before their eyes. This may cause managerial problems such as loss management, over-management, and lack of support to workers

This feature also can cause problems between co-workers, because getting to know, trust, and become comfortable with one’s project team members may take time. This can reduce the productivity and efficiency. Particularly troubling is the loss of informal and spontaneous work-related discussion. Brainstorming and unplanned interactions with coworkers can no longer be taken for granted.

==Eliminating Drawbacks==
To strengthen the advantages and eliminate the drawbacks, managers must support the mobile workers mentally and technically without cramping their freedom and creativity. Managers may have to give up some controls but offer high level of trust, respect; Besides, they must pay close attention to communication styles and content; be able to empathize with workers whom they don’t see often in order to know when someone is under stress or is feeling isolated from the team; Furthermore, they must provide the up-date information about the organization to mobile workers in order to develop and maintain employees’ sense of organizational belonging and commitment.

To maximize the mobile working benefit, mobile workers must take more initiatives to maintain, nurture and enhance their relationship with one anther. Colleagues should develop the ability to establish mutual trust and respect; they should create the opportunity to engage in regular social interactions with their coworkers; they must be willing to be influenced, share important information, fulfill promises, and listen.

In addition to the above measures, mobile workers also should: 1) Be proactive in maintaining contact with their organizations. 2) Schedule informal lunches and formal meeting to increase face to face contacts. 3) Don’t restrict formal topics. Include some informal things such as family and kids in your talk. 4) Share photos, IT tips, jokes with others just like in the office.

==Future==
As the research firm IDC claims, the number of mobile workers is increasing faster than stationary workers and mobile workers are more productive. However, companies, managers, mobile workers need to pay special attention to managing the working relationship properly, in order to realize the benefits. Besides, research also shows that the personal face to face contact is critical in mobility. Like a mobile worker said, “No matter how much technology is available, we are people. We are not robots and we are not computer databanks.

== Wooden Reed Care and Bacteria ==

=== Introduction ===

Due to their natural composition, wooden musical [[reed (instrument)|reeds]] may hold bacteria or mold, which can affect one’s health and the quality of sound produced.  Some of the basic instruments that use wooden reeds include the [[clarinet]], [[saxophone]], [[oboe]], and [[bassoon]].  Proper care of reeds will extend their longevity and control bacterial growth.

=== Reed Care ===
===== Reed Preparation =====

Wooden reeds must be moistened prior to playing.  Many musicians place the reed in their mouths to moisten them with [[saliva]].  In preparing the reed for playing, water is less corrosive than saliva.  Soaking a reed in water for about five minutes is a good alternative to saliva.  It also reduces the chance of food particles damaging the reed &lt;ref&gt;Stambler, David. &quot;Single Reed Reed Basics.&quot; 2005. Penn State University.  http://www.capitolquartet.com/admin/pdf/Reedbasics.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, soaking reeds in already humid weather may cause them to become water logged; extreme environments can damage reeds.  They should not be kept too dry or too wet, or they will become warped &lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;Williams, Floyd. &quot;Reeds: How to Care for Them and How to Improve Their Repsonse.&quot; ''Australian Clarinet and Saxophone''. June 2003: 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Dark spots on new reeds are not an indication that the reeds are poor, but if the dark spots have formed after several uses, it may be an indication of mold growth.  Therefore, it is also suggested that one soak their reed in [[hydrogen peroxide]].  Five minutes a day is sufficient to keep the reed clean from [[bacteria]] and [[mold]].  It should also kill any salivary [[enzymes]] that may have collected on the reed while playing.  If hydrogen peroxide is not available, musicians need to be sure to rinse the reed in running water and then dry it before storing.

[[Image:Klarinet-jeziček.jpg|300 px|thumb|left|Reed Case]]

===== Reed Storage =====

Reed storage affects the reed life and may help or hinder bacterial and mold growth.  Putting a dirty reed in a reed case just allows mold and bacteria to grow in the case every time the reed is placed in it.  Mold can also grow if reeds are kept in a tightly sealed container in [[humidity|humid]] environments.  Every time the container is opened moisture is caught inside, allowing mold to grow &lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;/&gt;.  Storage in a cool, dry environment, like a refrigerator, helps to slow microbial growth &lt;ref name=&quot;Bryan&quot;&gt;Bryan, A. H. (1960). Band instruments harbor germs. Music Educators Journal, 46(5), 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;.  [[Light]] and [[ultraviolet]] radiation will not damage the reed structure unless exposure time is excessive or if radiation levels are high &lt;ref name=&quot;Casadonte&quot;&gt;Casadonte, Donald Jay The clarinet reed: An introduction to its biology, chemistry, and physics.  Diss. The Ohio State University, 1995. Dissertations &amp; Theses: Full Text. ProQuest. Harold B. Lee Library, Provo, Utah.  11 Jul. 2008 http://www.proquest.com/&lt;/ref&gt;.  A cool cabinet with a [[desiccant]], such as [[calcium sulfate]], can also serve as a good storage area. Not only do cooler environments discourage bacterial growth, but there are almost no harmful effects on a normal reed.  

Heat can have a damaging effect on the chemical authenticity of the reed.  Soaking the reed in nearly boiling water is not recommended for cleaning.  The [[hydrogen bonds]] begin to break down between 60 degrees C and 80 degrees C.  At 100 degrees C much of the molecular structure is lost.  Heating dry wood can also cause splitting &lt;ref name=&quot;Casadonte&quot;/&gt;.  When not being used, reeds should be kept covered.  There are many products available specifically for reed storage.

===== Personal Hygiene and Reed Care =====

Reed longevity is affected by the musician’s personal hygiene habits.  As many band directors encourage, eating prior to playing is not good for one’s instrument or for one’s own health.  Old food is a gold mine for bacterial growth, especially microbial flora.  Appropriately, one might [[toothbrush|brush their teeth]], [[Dental floss|floss]], and use [[mouthwash]], before and after playing to lower risks of illness &lt;ref name=&quot;Bryan&quot;/&gt;.  It should be realized that using a reed while sick with a [[Common cold|cold]] increases mucous discharge from the [[throat]] and [[lungs]] onto the reed.  This will more quickly strip [[hemicellulose]] from the reed.  Hemicellulose maintains the reed’s ability to hold water&lt;ref name=&quot;Casadonte&quot;/&gt;.  Using a reed while sick quickly decreases the reed’s ability to absorb water; this is irreversible damage.  Also, using a reed while sick increases the chance for reinfection.  It is common that musicians just use old spent reeds while ill to keep from damaging good reeds.

=== The effect of Saliva on Reeds ===

===== pH Levels =====

Normally, saliva is slightly [[acidic]] and has a [[pH]] less than 7, but it can vary between 6 and 8.  The pH inside the mouth depends on the salival flow rate because the higher the flow rate of saliva the more salival [[bicarbonates]] are present.  Bicarbonates in the saliva raise the pH inside the mouth.  When there is no or low saliva flow, also known as [[xerostomia]], the pH inside the mouth is around 6.  When salival flow rate is high the pH is about 8.  During a concert, if a musician is suffering from xerostomia, also known as dry mouth, the saliva pH is expected to be [[acidic]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Casadonte&quot;/&gt;.     

Nervousness in concert situations can also lead to xerostomia, but more importantly nervousness can cause [[Hyperventilation|rapid breathing]].  This increases [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ) flow out of the body and causes [[respiratory alkalosis]].  The decrease in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affects the amount of [[bicarbonates]] available.  Salivary bicarbonates are synthesized from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; available, the fewer bicarbonates can be synthesized; therefore, the pH drops&lt;ref name=&quot;Casadonte&quot;/&gt;. Under this condition it is wise to use salival flow stimulants.  Continually changing the pH environment the reed encounters damages the reed.  If the pH level inside the mouth can be kept at rehearsal level, the life of the reed will increase.

Consequently, the environment for regular rehearsal differs.  The musician may not be as nervous, and they might be holding their breath more to play.  Holding one’s breath increases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as [[respiratory acidosis]].  Therefore, saliva is expected to be more alkaline.   In a reeds life, it is more likely to face alkaline environments because rehearsals occur more often than concerts.  The alkaline environment increases the amount of hemicellulose stripped from the reed matrix &lt;ref name=&quot;Casadonte&quot;/&gt;.  Although hemicellulose is depleted, it is better for the reed to remain in an overall consistent environment.

===== Contaminants in Saliva =====

Even though salival pH decreases the hemicelluloses coating on reeds, it has little effect on the reed matrix compared to the contaminants found in saliva.  [[Amine]]s and [[glycoproteins]] have been found in the reed matrix:  salivary mucosins, Proline-rich Glycoproteins, alpha-amylases, peroxidase, Carbonic Anhydrase, Fucose-rich glycoproteins, Immunoglobulin, Kallikrein, Lactoferrin, and Fibronectrin&lt;ref name=&quot;Casadonte&quot;/&gt;.  

Oral bacterium already in one’s mouth removes the sugar containing components from glycoproteins in saliva.  This removal of sugar forms a [[precipitate]] or a non-soluble by product.  The protein precipitate formed in saliva is normally rich in [[calcium]] and low in  [[solubility]].  Also, [[alpha-amylase]] contains a significant level of [[sialic acid]].  When alpha-amylase combines with saliva, the enzymes [[hydrolyze]] and release the sialic acid, forming another water insoluble precipitate &lt;ref name=&quot;Casadonte&quot;/&gt;.  These two precipitates combine to form an impenetrable layer on the reed, which prevent the reed from fully hydrating.  In time, the reed will become stiff and brittle.

=== Types of Bacteria found in reeds ===

Streptococcal bacteria have been found living inside the walls of water-conducting [[xylem]] cells in spent reeds.  Streptococcal bacterium is a common bacterium that causes illness to the throat, including [[sore throat]] and [[strep throat]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Horaud&quot;/&gt;.  

Also the common bacterium, Staphalcoccus Epidermitis, completely covers the reed.  It is also found all over the mouth and hands on virtually everyone; therefore, it is innocuous.  Staphalcoccus Epidermitis is known as one of the bacteria which remove the sugars from saliva, which causes the deposition of sialic acid.  This type of bacteria becomes dormant in the absence of water&lt;ref name=&quot;Casadonte&quot;/&gt;.  Drying reeds before storing will help stop the growth of Staphalcoccus Epidermitis.

=== The Effect of Bacteria on Reeds ===

Bacterium affects the playability of the reed in three ways. First, it adds mass to the reed tip.  A bacterial coating actually dampens the vibrating reed, causing it to play at lower [[frequencies]].  Secondly, it reduces the reed’s range of motion and bending.  This will decrease the reeds ability to maintain sound.  Lastly, it changes the overall shape of the reed, which directly affects the [[tone]] quality&lt;ref name=&quot;Casadonte&quot;/&gt;.

=== The Effect of Reed Bacteria on the Body ===

The bacteria found covering reeds may cause [[respiratory]] infections such as [[colds]], [[influenza]], [[pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], herpes fibrilis ([[cold sores]]), and other rare diseases.  However, contact is necessary for the transfer of microbial infection.  The airborne organisms are known to be virtually harmless.  Infection will not spread between musicians unless there is contact with the bacteria &lt;ref name=&quot;Bryan&quot;/&gt;.

[[Image:Streptococcal pharyngitis.jpg|thumb|Streptococcal Pharyngitis|300 px]]

Specifically, streptococci can cause varying levels of infections from mild to life-threatening.  Starting in the 1980’s, [[group A streptococci]] have increased in prevalence and have been the cause of [[rheumatic fever]] and other invasive infections &lt;ref name=&quot;Horaud&quot;&gt;Horaud T., Bouvet A., Leclercq R., Montclos H. d. and Sicard M. ''Streptococci and The Host''. New York: Plenum Press. 1997: 255, 537.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[mucous membranes]] found in the [[nose]] and [[throat]] are primary sites for infection and transmission of group A streptococci &lt;ref name=&quot;Horaud&quot;/&gt;.  The mucus membranes are in direct contact with the reed during playing; therefore, if infection does occur it is likely it will derive from the group A streptococci.  

When group A streptococcal infects the throat, it is also known as [[streptococcal pharyngitis]], or strep throat.  Redness, trouble swallowing, swelling of regional [[lymph nodes]], and localized pain are common complaints of streptococcal pharyngitis.  [[Leukocytosis]], an abnormally high white blood level, is a common reaction to the infection.  Streptococcal pharyngitis is most prevalent during colder seasons.  Many marching bands play on cold nights at football games.  Exposing musicians to such weather and bacterium may increase the likelihood of infection&lt;ref name=&quot;Wannamaker&quot;&gt;Wannamaker, LW. &quot;Differences between streptococcal infections of the throat and of the skin. Part I.&quot; ''New England Journal of Medicine.'' 282 (1970): 23-31.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The bulletin board is for announcements rather than discussion of ideas, especially as nobody reads the bulletin board. Your &quot;announcement&quot; is I think better placed in the Reading Room ([[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects|here]]) where others can read and comment on it. I meant to move it last time, rather than just reverting without explanation, but it appears I didn't - sorry. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:16, 3 October 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Oxygen Binding Curve (Hemoglobin vs Myoglobin)==
Oxygen binding to iron in the heme group pulls part of the electron density from the ferrous ion to the oxygen molecule. It is important to leave the [[Structural Biochemistry/Myoglobin|myoglobin]] in the dioxygen form rather than superoxide form when the oxygen is released because the superoxide can be generated by itself to have a new form that gives negative effect on many biological materials, and also the superoxide prevents the iron ion from binding to the oxygen in its ferric state (Metmyoglobin). Superoxide and superoxide-derived oxygen species are so reactive compared to the stable O2 molecule that they could have a destructive effect both within the cell and in its environment.  A distal histidine residue in [[Structural Biochemistry/Myoglobin|myoglobin]]  regulates the reactivity of the heme group to make it more suitable for oxygen binding. It does this by H-bonding with the oxygen molecule; the additional electron density of the oxygen molecule makes the H-bond unusually strong and therefore even more effective as a stabilizing agent.

An oxygen-binding curve is a plot that shows fractional saturation versus the concentration of oxygen. By definition, fractional saturation indicates the presence of binding sites that have oxygen. Fractional saturation can range from zero (all sites are empty) to one (all sites are filled). The concentration of oxygen is determined by partial pressure. 

[[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|Hemoglobin]]'s oxygen affinity is relatively weak compared to [[Structural Biochemistry/Myoglobin|myoglobin]] 's affinity for oxygen.  [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|Hemoglobin]]'s oxygen-binding curve forms in the shape of a sigmoidal curve.  This is due to the cooperativity of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]]. As [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] travels from the lungs to the tissues, the pH value of its surroundings decrease, and the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that it reacts with increases.  Both these changes causes the [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] to lose it's affinity for oxygen, therefore making it drop the oxygen into the tissues.  This causes the sigmoidal curve for [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] in the oxygen-binding curve and proves it's cooperativity.

[[Image:oxygen binding curve.jpg]] [[Image:Oxygen binding curve with hemoglobin and myoglobin.jpg]]

This image shows [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]]'s oxygen binding affinity compared with [[Structural Biochemistry/Myoglobin|myoglobin]] 's affinity and the hypothetical curve that [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] would have to follow if it did not show cooperativity.  In this graph, you can see [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]]'s sigmoidal curve, how it starts out with a little less affinity than [[Structural Biochemistry/Myoglobin|myoglobin]], but comparable affinity to oxygen in the lungs.  As the pressure drops and the [[Structural Biochemistry/Myoglobin|myoglobin]]  and [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] move towards the tissues, [[Structural Biochemistry/Myoglobin|myoglobin]]  still attains it's high affinity for oxygen, while [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]], because of its cooperativity, suddenly loses it's affinity, therefore making it the better transporter of oxygen than [[Structural Biochemistry/Myoglobin|myoglobin]] .  The gray curve, showing no cooperativity, shows that to have the low affinity for oxygen needed in the tissues, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] would have started with a smaller affinity for oxygen, therefore making it less efficient in bringing oxygen in from the lungs.

==Oxygen Binding Curve for Hemoglobin==
In red blood cells, the oxygen-binding curve for [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] displays an “S” shaped called a sigmoidal curve. A sigmoidal curve shows that oxygen binding is cooperative; that is, when one site binds oxygen, the probability that the remaining unoccupied sites that will bind to oxygen will increase. 

The importance of cooperative behavior is that it allows [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] to be more efficient in transporting oxygen. For example, in the lungs, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] is at a saturation level of 98%. However, when [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] is present in the tissues and releases oxygen, the saturation level drops to 32%; thus, 66% of the potential oxygen-binding sites are involved in the transportation of oxygen.

Purified [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] binds much more tightly to the oxygen, making it less useful in oxygen transport. The difference in characteristics is due to the presence of 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate(2,3-BPG) in human blood, which acts as an allosteric effector. An allosteric effector binds in one site and affects binding in another. 2,3-BPG binds to a pocket in the T-state of [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] and is released as it forms the R-state. The presence of 2,3-BPG means that more oxygen must be bound to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] before the transition to the R-form is possible.

Other regulation such as the Bohr effect in [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] can also be depicted via an oxygen-binding curve. By analyzing the oxygen-binding curve, one can observe that there is a proportional relationship between affinity of oxygen and pH level. As the pH level decreases, the affinity of oxygen in [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] also decreases. Thus, as [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] approaches a region of low pH, more oxygen is released. The chemical basis for this Bohr effect is due to the formation of two salt bridges of the quaternary structure. One of the salt bridges is formed by the interaction between Beta Histidine 146 (the carboxylate terminal group) and Alpha Lysine 40. This connection will help to orient the histidine residue to also interact in another salt bridge formation with the negatively charged aspartate 94.  The second bridge is form with the aid of an additional proton on the histidine residue.

As carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells, it reacts with water inside to form carbonic acid, which drops the pH and stabilizes the T state.

[[Image:PH on hemoglobin.JPG]]

An oxygen-binding curve can also show the effect of carbon dioxide presence in [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]]. The regulation effect by carbon dioxide is similar to Bohr effect. A comparison of the effect of the absence and presence of carbon dioxide in [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] revealed that [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] is more efficient at transporting oxygen from tissues to lungs when carbon dioxide is present. The reason for this efficiency is that carbon dioxide also decreases the affinity of [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] for oxygen. The addition of carbon dioxide forces the pH to drop, which then causes the affinity of [[Structural Biochemistry/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] to oxygen to decrease.  This is extremely evident in the tissues, where the carbon dioxide stored in the tissues are released into the blood stream, then undergoes a reaction that releases H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the blood stream, increasing acidity and dropping the pH level.

==Use of Commons Images on Wikibooks==

Hi, I notice that you seem to have downloaded images from Commons, then uploaded them to Wikibooks with different file names. Creating duplicate images like this is discouraged. There really is no need to do this as you can reference a file directly at Commons - just include the file / image name as if it was held locally on Wikibooks. Also, when you have uploaded them, you haven't included license data so they may be deleted. Therefore, I'm going to find the original Commons images and change the articles to reference those instead. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:31, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Hero tab, like the heroes and heroins you will create, may look complicated at first, as if it was a monster itself and stand in the way of you creating your perfect game, but all in due time. We'll take this tab apart piece by piece.

==The Hero Area==
See the area on the far left? Those are your heroes and heroines! These are the characters that you can create and customize, down to the last detail. The two main functions this serves are as follows:

*It creates a list of all of your heroes and heroins, and allows you to select any of them for editing and customization.

*It also allows you to create more simply by increasing the array size.

;Array size: An array is the amount of a category you would like to exist. Many are limited to 5000 of any object, so use sparingly! Items such as switches, variables, items, heroes, and even some events are limited by the array size.

==Name, Title, and Character Graphics==
Now it's time to give your heroes and heroins some personality! These are the areas where, like in their names, allow you to change the name of your heroes/heroins, their titles, and what they'll look like during the course of the game. If you want someone to look like a ghost as they walk around, click &quot;Transparent&quot; next to their character sprite.

Under &quot;Battle Sprite&quot;, there will be the picture of some battle sprites, and a scroll bar. You will go over those options in the [[RPG_Maker_2003/Animations2|Animations 2]] page.

==Options, Crit Hit, Min and Max Level, and Class==
Such a big category of options! However, each is very basic and covers a minimal amount of options. The options area is a checklist, giving characters certain abilities, such as whether or not they can wield two weapons (Two Wpn), if they can't change equipment (Lock Eqp), if they can be controlled by artifical intelligence during battle (AI Control), or if they can have exceptional guarding abilities during battle (Mighty Grd).

The critical hit probability is exactly as it states; give them a chance to hit the enemies weakspot by changing the critical hit ratio. Want them to hit it a lot? Make the number lower. Is your hero/heroin really clumsy? Make it higher. Or, you can remove it completely.

The Minimum and Maximum Levels are the levels in which your characters are limited by. You can make them arrive in the game at a very high level, but not allow them to get much higher, or you can make them long lasting by giving them a low minimum level and a high maximum level. They are both limited at 1 and 99 as their lowest and highest.

The class is a different story though. This allows characters to be customized even more later in your games. If you feel one character is a soldier, give him/her that class. Don't worry though. You can have class changes later in the game.

==Base Statistics==
[[Image:RPG004.jpg|500|left]]Now we're getting into some of the more complicated messes. These are the curves that you can create that make a character's leveling curve unique. If you want to change the base of a curve, simply double click the graphs. You will now see several tabs, labeled by the names of the different stats you can change, and buttons on the right. A complicated looking graph will be situated on the left. 

Let's not worry about that right now. On the right, you'll see buttons labeled Outstanding, Above Average, Average, and Below Average. These are preset curves you can create for that specific character. Try clicking one of those buttons. See how the curve changes? You can use these to create general curves for characters, if you are kind of lazy.

Instead, this book suggests that you use the &quot;Specify Endpoints&quot; tab, and alter the &quot;Accelerate Growth&quot;. First, you start with the amount you want your level 1 character to have of that stat, and then do the same with what you want your level 99 character to have. After you specify that, change the growth. You can make it where the character grows fast sooner, but starts slowing down as he/she gets higher in level, or make the character a late bloomer, and get more powerful later in the game. It's up to you.

If you're not satisfied with the graph, you might have to make it manually. You can do this by selecting the Level on the right, and changing the Maximum __ in accordance with your wishes. This might become a bit tedious after a while, but if you really want to do it manually, no one is stopping you. It could also have a bigger pay off.

Instead of manually entering the numbers, you can also click on the graph itself. Try clicking on some spot above the first bar. It should rise to where you clicked. The number underneath the Maximum __ should also change. This could make the task easier, but accuracy becomes a problem, since you have to be situated exactly above the bar you want to change. Otherwise, you can change a different bar, and ruin the perfect graph you had going.

==Experience Curve==
This is even more complicated than the Base Statistics section above, and you must read this to understand how it works. You should see two tabs on the top of the new window after you click the &quot;Experience Curve&quot; button. One should say &quot;Total Experience&quot;, and display a large list of green numbers, three sliders on the bottom, and a graph on the right.The second tab should say &quot;Experience per Level&quot;, and instead of green numbers, should have a large list of blue numbers. 

Unlike the &quot;Base Stats&quot; section of the Hero tab, there is no way to manually change the numbers, but with the knowledge you'll gain here, you should be able to manipulate the numbers enough to get what you want.

===Primary===
First, start off with the &quot;Experience per Level&quot; tab. This will help you understand what is going on. Otherwise, you will get confused with the numbers being displayed on the other tab. Also, blue is a lot easier on the eyes than green.

Set the Tertiary and Secondary sliders to 0 and 1, respectively. Now, set Primary to any number. Do you see something? As you should, the first number on the list should be the primary number you chose, plus 1. This allows you to set a base for your curve. You will always have this number in the experience curve you choose.

===Secondary===
This one is what caused the extra numbers you saw in the Primary test. Notice how it starts with 1 on level 1, and then increases by 1 every level? That is what characterizes the secondary curve. Start with Primary on 300. Now set Secondary to 2. Now set it to 3. Do you see the pattern? It will increase by the number you set it to every time the character becomes the respective level.

This is true for any number you give it. If at level 1, (with Primary still at 300) it is 400, then at level 2, it should be 500. Can you guess what the Secondary curve is set at?If you guessed 100, then you are correct.

===Tertiary===
This is probably the easiest curve to change and understand. In the most simple of terms, it adds what number you give it to EVERY LEVEL. If you give it a number of 5, then 5 will be added to every number on the list. Try it out with Primary set to 300 and Secondary set to 300. Now change the Tertiary to any number you choose. Notice how the numbers change in the exact same way? That is how the Tertiary curve works.

==Starting Equipment==
Just as it states, the starting equipment is what the hero/heroin will start with at the beginning of the game. You can set the weapon, shield (this will be a second weapon if you chose Two Wpn in the options area), armor, helmet, and accessory of that particular hero/heroin.

You can change the kinds of equipment your hero/heroin can equip by changing them in the [[RPG_Maker_2003/Item|Item]] tab, which will be explained later.

==Unarmed Battle Animation==
This is what your hero's/heroin's punch or kick will look like when they are unarmed, or without weapons. You can select any of the premade animations, or create your own in the [[RPG_Maker_2003/Animations|Animations]] tab, which will be explained later.

==Skill Progression==
You know how certain RPGs, like Pokemon, have you gain skills or attacks as you gain levels? You can do the same here using the &quot;Skill Progression&quot; area. To add a skill, right click on where the first skill will be, and click on &quot;Edit&quot;. Now, you can choose any skill you want, and tell it on which level your hero/heroin will learn it.

You can add and edit skills in the [[RPG_Maker_2003/Skill|Skill]] tab, which will be talked about later.

==Condition Resist and Attribute Resist==
;Condition: a condition is what affects your character during a battle, and if specified, after a battle. These can range anywhere from poison, to sleep, to death.

;Attribute: an attribute is the type of an attack or spell. This includes, but is not limited to, sword attacks, fire spells, or even fire-attributed swords.

These lists allow your character to live during certain attacks and falter during others. Let's assume that your hero is from the mountains. He can be very resistant to earth-attributed spells and attacks, as well as being very resistant to being confused. However, he is weak to water-attributed attacks and spells and the berserk condition.

To make these conditions and attributes able to be resisted (or otherwise), simply click on the letter next to it. It ranges from A to E, E being very weak to that condition or attribute, and A being very resistant to it.

You can create more attributes and conditions in the [[RPG_Maker_2003/Attribute|Attribute]] and [[RPG_Maker_2003/Condition|Condition]] tabs, which will be discussed later.

That is the end of the discussion of the hero tab in the Database. If you are ready to move on, please proceed to the [[RPG_Maker_2003/Class|Class]] section, and learn about classes so you can further your RPG education!

My known internet name is BEANO, because of the fact I had really bad farts as a kid. It was like a weapon to me, since the gut-wrenching smell was good at keep my cousins from tackling me or doing anything little kids would do to others for fun. They would often make fun at me, saying that I needed to take the pill Beano, and the nickname eventually just stuck. People often call me that in place of my real name. I am currently 19 years old, and I live in Klamath Falls, Oregon. I grew up in Portland, Oregon and moved to Bend, Oregon in August 2001. Many people today would remember me as the little nerd from High Desert Middle School that fixed teachers' computers and solved network problems as an aide for the school administrator, or the short kid at BSH that took nerdy classes. I hung out with friends that many saw a nerdy, but friends that I saw that were great people who I still hang out with today. I currently work at Best Buy as a Geek Squad Agent. I am currently on O.S. and will be working there when I am not in school. It's a great job and I love it to death. 

I ran into Wikipedia my freshman year of High School, registered an account in 2005 and have been a member since. I started to get into fighting vandalism since around February 2007, and since then I have been getting more involved and more in-depth with Wikipedia. You may have seen me at least once somewhere, whether it's patrolling new pages and placing CSD tags, taking my part in discussions for AFD's, or giving users and IP's warnings for vandalism (and the like). It's kind of fun when you're bored and have nothing to do for the rest of the evening. Don't get me wrong, I didn't used to help maintain and expand Wikipedia. I went to a High School with five shared IPs that weren't static. I've had my laughs and fun times, but I decided to turn that foolish time around and do things the other direction. I have a username on this project because this username is a part of my SUL. You may not see me here as often, but I am working to expand my scope of work and eventually come out here to edit.

When I'm not working, hanging out with friends or in school, I'm on the computer playing some videogames. I Love shooters and RPG's. My favorite kind of videogames are Strategy games. Starcraft has been my ultimate favorite game for going on ten years now. The first CD I bought was months after its release, and it says on the CD that it is for &quot;Windows 95 / MAC&quot;. I can't wait till SC2! I was heavily involved in playing computer games. I have 6 level 20 characters on Guild Wars and all of the expansions, and played a lot of Counter Strike: Source, Team Fortress 2, and Call of Duty 4. I haven't played Guild Wars, CS:S, or TF2 since I started school. I'm trying to keep away from &quot;commitment requiring&quot; games so that I can focus on college and keep good grades. I'll be back to playing full-time in the summer... and maybe StarCraft 2 when it comes out :-)

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I graduated from Bend High School in 2007, and I am working and attending college. I am attending Oregon Institute of Technology|OIT with credits transferred from COCC. I am in a double major program (Computer Hardware Engineering / Computer Software Engineering) with a mathematics minor. Computers have always been my life and passion. At 5, I got my hands on my first computer. A Compaq computer with an old Pentium processor and 48MB of RAM. I played many old computer games... Rebel Assault II, Dark Forces, Starcraft, etc. At 9, I was already installing programs, upgrading Windows from 95 to 98, and teaching my parents how to do things they didn't know could be done with a computer. I built my first computer at 12 years old. It was just a Pentium II Processor, but it marked a lot of achievement for me since I did it on my own. I was a computer tech aide for two years at my Middle School, and for three additional years at my High School thereafter. I today, have a pretty decent machine built (see Computer Specs below). I have built many computers for others that wanted a custom built computer, and have been paid countless times for computer repair services.

===Computer Specs===

*Intel Core 2 Duo E6750
*Asus P5N-T Deluxe 780i motherboard
*4 GB Corsair XMS2 DDR2 RAM
*Nvidia GeForce 8800 GT 512MB X2 (In SLI Mode)
*Thermaltake a1 professional series fan
*Thermaltake armor case (Revision 1.0a)
*Antec 600 Watt PSU
*Windows Vista Ultimate
*Sony DVD-RW Drives X 2
*Floppy drive
&lt;i&gt;Any questions about my computer, or computers in general can be asked [[User_Talk:Beano|here]]. I don't mind helping people out that have problems.&lt;/i&gt;

      <comment>/* Sound it out */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==English to Latin==

This should be the first thing you do.  Find a random English sentence.  Any sentence is ok.  Then you should think about the sounds that exist within the sentence.  We are only concerned about sounds, not meaning at this point.  Your task is to rewrite the sentence writing only the sounds that are in it.  If the sentence has sounds in it that do not exist in the Latin language, change the sound to a sound, any sound, that is close.  For example, the most common word in the English language is the word &quot;the&quot;; however, the '''TH''' sound does not exist in Latin, so you have to change it to a sound that does exist in Latin, since keeping the ''TH'' spelling will not work as that will produce just a '''T''' sound.  A '''D''' sound is much closer and is probably what you should use.  Also, when you come across the '''a''' sound in English words like '''cat''' you should keep in mind that this sound does not exist in Latin so you will have to choose between a Latin '''A''' or a Latin '''E''' as the sound is somewhere between them.  

Here is an example.  

&quot;Billy went to the store to buy some apples.&quot;

The sounds that don't exist in Latin are as follows.

&quot;B'''i'''lly '''w'''ent to '''th'''e sto'''r'''e to buy some '''a'''pples.&quot;

And here is how it looks using only Latin letters and being spelled exaclty as it sounds.

&quot;Bili uent tu da (di) stor (stoa) tu bai sam apols (epols).&quot;


==Sound it out==

Remember that Latin is supposed to be spelled exactly as it sounds.  We do not memorize a spelling that does not match the pronunciation.  We memorize the pronunciation and that pronunciation controls the spelling.  So now that you have the basics and have even converted some English into just sounds, it is now time to see sounds written and for you to sound it out.  Don't be worried if you do not know what these words mean.  They are put here for you to see the sounds and to practice your pronunciation.  You can look the words up yourself later or just wait as we will cover this very often used prayer in a later lesson.  In this example, remember to pronounce the Latin '''A''' as the English short '''o''' sound, this seems to be the most common beginner mistake when saying this prayer.

'''Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto; sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper, et in saecula saeculorum.  Amen.'''


Note: the '''ae''' will sound as just '''e'''.  Also, unlike in English where a '''T''' followed by an '''r''' will create the '''ch''' sound, Latin does not do this.  The '''T''' and the '''R''' are individually pronounced.  If you blend these into a '''ch''' sound it means that you are not pronouncing your '''R''' correctly and need to listen to a cat '''purrrrrr''' for a bit to get the sound right.  If you pronounce your '''R''' correctly, then you will not feel the urge to blend the '''T''' and the '''R'''.  

This prayer is used very often in Catholic life when we pray the rosary, the psalms in the Liturgy of the Hours, and many other times as well.  Interestingly, it is not used in the Mass in its current form, but is still very common for any Catholic who maintains a private prayer life in addition to Mass.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How does fashion play a role in the mobile society?}}

In today’s fast paced consumer society, do we have to wait until fashion shows come out to know what’s in style? Is fashion limited to just clothing and clothing accessories or have designers found a new niche for profit making; something society is consuming at an astounding rate: the cellular phone?

We used to wait a year before the new clothing trends arrived to North America, from Europe.  Now, because of the Internet, as soon as a style comes out, everyone has access.  The market is open to us all.  We don’t all have to dress the same.  We can pick and choose from any style, anywhere in the world! We are all, well-informed customers.  And, we all want that new dress, that new bag, that new pair of shoes, right now, before it goes out of style in a few weeks.  Just as pressing to young and old alike, is getting that new top of the line cellular phone.

What started out as a convenient tool, for travelling business professionals, has become an indispensable part of our daily lives and a major fashion statement.  No longer do we purchase a cellular phone according to the best reception and best warranty features, or from the best-know supplier, but rather by its look and fashion accessories that accompany it, and by the Designer Name.

==Fashions for Phones==
That’s right, major cellular manufacturers have joined forces with major fashion designers to constantly come up with new and improved trend-setting cellular phones.  Motorola has teamed up with Bono, from U2 to design the Red phone.  LG has cooperated with Prada, Samsung with Versace and Giorgio Armani, and Nokia together with Ferrari have come up with a gorgeous Vertu mobile phone at a starting price of $25,400.  The Vertu comes in different collections, including the white diamonds, and colored diamonds models, the limited editions models, Racetrack Legends and Ferrari 1947, and a special summer collection, not to mention the luxury accessories that can also be purchased.  The Versace SGHE500 Versus, designed in collaboration with Samsung, comes with special software particularly designed for women to keep track of calorie intake and menstrual cycles, calculate BMI, check biorhythm, and also, amazingly, to check how different hairstyles would look on you.  And, why not, when the phone is turned off, the external screen turns into a mirror!

Fashion, the mobile society, and the cellular phone have become a complete package.  A boutique on the Champs Élysées, in Paris, carries only brand name designer cellular phones such as Prada, Giorgio Armand and Ferrari. Mobile phones have become a big fashion statement, but moreover, a symbol of status!

==Phones for Fashion==
In Japan, most people conduct their daily internet activities, such as e-mail, on-line shopping, paying invoices, through their mobile phones.  They can order clothes on their mobile phone through internet sites such as girlswalker.com, fashionwalker.com, or style.com, which lets you watch the runway shows live and place your orders instantly.

There seems to be no limit in sight as to how far or how luxurious our mobile fashion trends will go. Last June, a group of students from the Nairn Academy in Scotland won a contest by inventing a product they named Stitch; a device that enables barcodes on clothes to check if the item will fit, and it also comes with an internet program which lets shoppers see what that outfit would look like on them.

==Conclusion==
As human nature dictates, inventors and designers need to create, consumers need to buy, and business people need to make money.  And the circle continues and will continue!

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a textbook for that genre of literary fiction known as science fiction. In the first chapter we define the genre, mention the subgenres, and provide an overview of the entire history of science fiction. This introductory chapter will closely resemble the Wikipedia entry for Science Fiction. Until Chapter 1 is written we recommend you read the Wikipedia article in its place. Then, we delve more deeply into the subgenres of science fiction, giving each its own chapter or section, focusing especially on the authors whose work staked out the territory, followed by the authors who are writing in the subgenre and expanding its frontier. Bear in mind, many works are written in more than one subgenre at a time. For example, an author writing for young adults can also be writing in the Lost Worlds genre too. After that, we discuss science fiction efforts by nationality. There is a large quantity of good science fiction being written by authors in languages other than English. With the exception of Jules Verne, most English speakers would be challenged to name even one of these other authors. Since this is a textbook of the field of science fiction literature, we will conclude each chapter with a discussion questions section, suggest exercises that will help the science fiction student master the material in the chapter, and make lists for further reading for those interested in exploring a subgenre in greater depth.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

Just a quick observation:  you seem to be adding your work to the front contents page of [[Consumer Behavior in Travel and Tourism]] rather than the subpage for that section which can be found by clicking on the link [[Consumer Behavior in Travel and Tourism/GROUP 1: Attitudes towards visiting Hong Kong – application of the Theory of Reasoned Action]].

Brown Windsor soup is a hearty British soup that was popular during the Victorian and Edwardian eras.

==Ingredients==
*Variety of meat including [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]] and [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*Plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]]
*Vegetables including [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] and other root vegetables

==Procedure==

#Roll bite-sized pieces of lamb/mutton and beef in plain flour so they're well dusted, and brown in butter over a medium heat. The slow cooking process (and later pureeing) means cheaper cuts of meat can be used, if desired. 
#Stir in chopped vegetables - an onion, a potato and some root vegetables would be traditional - add beef stock and bouquet garni. Simmer on a low heat for an hour or two to allow everything to tenderise.
#Puree the soup. You can chill at this point and reheat when required, or eat it as it is.
#Just before serving, stir a good tablespoon of Madeira into the pot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is a continuation from [[../]].


== Conditional Propositions ==

''Example 8''

Discuss what Andy means when he says to Bernard: &quot;If you want some more coffee, there’s some in the pot&quot;.


What Andy probably means is simply &quot;There's some coffee in the pot, and if you want some, help yourself&quot;. Almost certainly, he doesn't really mean to imply that the presence (or otherwise) of the coffee in the pot is somehow dependent upon Bernard's desire for some. 
As you may have realised, we are sometimes very sloppy in our use of English! One of the things we need to do if we want to represent a sentence using logic symbols, is to work out what it really means.


=== The ⇒ IMPLICATION ===

''Example 9''

Suppose that

: ''p'' is &quot;The weather is warm&quot;; and

: ''q'' is &quot;I go swimming at lunchtime&quot;


Then we can represent the ''conditional'' proposition &quot;If the weather is warm, then I go swimming at lunchtime&quot; by the symbols:

: ''p'' ⇒ ''q''


So ⇒ means: &quot;if ... then&quot;, or &quot;implies (or means) that&quot;.


Other ways of saying the same thing are:

*: &quot;The weather is warm means that I go swimming at lunchtime&quot;

*: &quot;Whenever the weather is warm, I go swimming at lunchtime&quot;

*: &quot;The weather is warm only if I go swimming at lunchtime&quot;

Be careful with this last option, using the words &quot;only if&quot;. It can be a bit tricky. What it means is that if on a particular day I ''didn't'' go swimming at lunchtime, then the weather cannot have been warm on that day. It doesn't, of course, mean that my going swimming (or otherwise) ''determines'' the weather on that day!

=== Necessary and Sufficient Conditions ===

Suppose that last Tuesday I went swimming at lunchtime. Given ''p'' and ''q'' as above, and given also that ''p'' ⇒ ''q'', can you be sure that the weather was warm last Tuesday?


The answer is that, no, you can't. I might have gone swimming anyway, for some other reason.


Note, then, that ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' means that ''p'' is a ''sufficient'' condition for ''q''. It is not, however, a ''necessary'' condition: ''q'' can still be true without ''p''.


=== The truth table for ⇒ ===

Note that ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' is ''itself'' a proposition; i.e. it has a truth value - it may or may not be the case that if the weather is warm, I go swimming at lunchtime.


Now the value of the proposition ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' depends upon the combination of the values of ''p'' and ''q''. So we can construct its truth table:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| ''q''
| ''p'' ⇒ ''q''

Note in particular the (perhaps surprising) third line of this table! The fact is that ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' means that we cannot draw any conclusions about ''q'' if ''p'' is false. That is to say, if ''p is'' false, ''q'' may equally well be true or false without contradicting the truth of ''p'' ⇒ ''q''.

To put this another way, ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' is false only when ''p'' is T and ''q'' is F; i.e. a true statement cannot imply a false one.


To clarify this further, consider the statement above: &quot;If the weather is warm, then I go swimming at lunchtime&quot;. This says nothing about what happens when the weather is not warm: I may go swimming or I may not. The only time this statement is untrue is when the weather is warm, but I ''don't'' go swimming.

== Biconditional Propositions ==

As we have already noted, we often use English in a very imprecise way. Using ''Example 9'', suppose what I ''really'' mean to say is:

: If the weather is warm I go swimming at lunchtime, and if it’s not I don’t.

In this case ''p'' and ''q'' are either both true or both false: you can’t have one without the other. We could re-phrase this and say:

: I go swimming at lunchtime if and only if the weather is warm.


The phrase &quot;if and only if&quot; is represented by the symbol ⇔, and so we can say in this case:

: ''p'' ⇔ ''q''


In such a case as this, ''p'' is a ''necessary and sufficient'' condition for ''q''.


''Example 10''

''p'' is &quot;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9&quot;. Find a suitable statement ''q'' about ''x'' (rather than ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for which ''p'' ⇔ ''q'' is true.


''Solution''

If ''x'' = 3, then certainly ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9. So if ''q'' is &quot;''x'' = 3&quot;, then ''q'' ⇒ ''p'' is true, and this would make ''q'' a ''sufficient'' condition.


But is it necessary ''and'' sufficient? No, because 3 is not the only number whose square is 9. ''x'' = -3 would also make ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9.

: To ensure a necessary and sufficient ''q'', then, we would have to say:

: ''q'' is &quot;''x'' = ±3&quot;


=== Logically Equivalent ===

We have said that ''p'' ⇔ ''q'' means that ''p'' and ''q'' are either both true, or both false, and we can therefore say that in such a case they are [[../#Logically Equivalent Propositions|''logically equivalent'']].


=== The truth table for ⇔ ===

Since ''p'' ⇔ ''q'' means that ''p'' and ''q'' are either both true or both false, the truth table for ⇔ is: 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| ''q''
| ''p'' ⇔ ''q''
|-

|-

| F
| F
|-

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;


''Example 11''

By drawing up a truth table show that

: ''p'' ⇔ ''q'' ≡ (''p'' ⇒ ''q'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''q'' ⇒ ''p'')


''Solution''

The truth table for (''p'' ⇒ ''q'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''q'' ⇒ ''p'') is:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
| ''p''
| ''q''
| (''p'' ⇒ ''q'')
| &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

The output is T, F, F, T which is the same as the output for ''p'' ⇔ ''q'', and therefore

: ''p'' ⇔ ''q'' ≡ (''p'' ⇒ ''q'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''q'' ⇒ ''p'')


=== The ⇐ Notation ===

We sometimes use ⇐ to mean &quot;is implied by&quot;. So ''q'' ⇐ ''p'' is an alternative way of writing ''p'' ⇒ ''q'', and we could have written ''Example 11'' as:

: ''p'' ⇔ ''q'' ≡ (''p'' ⇒ ''q'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; (''p'' ⇐ ''q'')


== Logic Exercise 4 ==

Click the link for [[../Exercises#Logic Exercise 4|Logic Exercise 4]].


== Predicate Logic ==

So far, we have considered only ''Propositional Logic'', with statements like:

: ''p'' is &quot;All people with red hair have fiery tempers&quot;

: ''q'' is &quot;Joe has red hair&quot;

Given ''p'' and ''q'' as above and ''r'' is &quot;Joe has a fiery temper&quot;, we can write:

: ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''q'' ⇒ ''r''


If we want to make a statement about Brenda having red hair, and therefore a fiery temper, we should need further propositions, like this:

: ''s'' is &quot;Brenda has red hair&quot;

: ''t'' is &quot;Brenda has a fiery temper&quot;

and so:

: ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''s'' ⇒ ''t''

… and so on.


Each time we want to make a statement about another person having red hair, and therefore a fiery temper (which may or may not be true!), we shall need further propositions. A much better way of representing these ideas is to use '''''predicates''''' like this:

: ''redHair'' is the phrase &quot;... has red hair&quot;

(Notice that ''redHair'' is not a proposition. Why not?)


We can now use this predicate to form statements about anyone who has red hair; like this:

: ''redHair''(Joe) is &quot;Joe has red hair&quot;

: ''redHair''(Brenda) is&quot;‘Brenda has red hair&quot;

... and so on.


In the same way, we can define the predicate ''fieryTemper'' to stand for the phrase:

: &quot;... has a fiery temper&quot;


So the statement &quot;If Joe has red hair, then he has a fiery temper&quot; can be represented by:

: ''redHair''(Joe) ⇒ ''fieryTemper''(Joe)

and the statement &quot;If Brenda has red hair, then she has a fiery temper&quot; by:

: ''redHair''(Brenda) ⇒ ''fieryTemper''(Brenda)


=== Notation ===

We shall use single words or several words joined together, using upper- and lower-case letters as shown, to denote predicates.


The &quot;object&quot; to which the predicate applies - a person, number, or whatever - will be written in brackets following the predicate.


=== Negation ===

With ''redHair'' defined as above:

: ¬''redHair'' is &quot;... does not have red hair&quot;


== Logic Exercise 5 ==

Click the link for [[../Exercises#Logic Exercise 5|Logic Exercise 5]].


== Propositional Functions ==

If we want to talk about general, undefined, predicates, we shall use upper-case letters: ''P'', ''Q'', ..., and if we want a general, undefined, object, we shall use a lower-case letter: ''x'', ''y'', ...

So if ''P'' is &quot;... has property P&quot;, then ''P''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' has property P&quot;.

*: ''P''(''x'') can then be described as a '''''propositional function''''' whose predicate is ''P''.


A ''function'' has the property that it returns a unique value when we know the value(s) of any parameter(s) supplied to it. ''P''(''x'') is therefore a function since it returns a truth value which depends upon the value of its parameter, ''x''. 

For example, if ''American''(''x'') is the propositional function &quot;''x'' is an American&quot;, then ''American''(''x'') will return the value

: T if ''x'' = Bill Clinton; and the value

: F if ''x'' = HM The Queen

== Quantifiers ==

We now extend the ideas in ''Exercise 5'' above. Suppose we want to make statements like:

: (a) All of my friends are wealthy.

: (b) Some of my friends are boring.


The problem here is that we are making statements about my friends in general, without referring to a particular individual. So we need to define propositional functions as follows:

: ''friend''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' is a friend of mine&quot;

: ''wealthy''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' is wealthy&quot;

: ''boring''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' is boring&quot;


We can then write the two statements above as:

: (a) For all ''x'', ''friend''(''x'') ⇒ ''wealthy''(''x'')

: (b) For some ''x'', ''friend''(''x'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''boring''(''x'')


=== Notation: ∀ and ∃ ===

The symbol ∀ (called the ''universal quantifier'') stands for the phrase &quot;For all …&quot;

So we can write (a) above as:

: (a) ∀ ''x'', ''friend''(''x'') ⇒ ''wealthy''(''x'')


The symbol ∃ (called the ''existential quantifier'') stands for the phrase &quot;For some …&quot;

So we can write (b) above as:

: (b) ∃ ''x'', ''friend''(''x'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''boring''(''x'')


==== Plural or singular? ====

Note that, although statements (a) and (b) above use ''plural'' words – all, are, some, friends – when we symbolise them, the predicates and the variables are ''singular'': ''x is'' wealthy, ''x is'' boring, etc. It is important to realise, then, that ''x'' can stand for just ''one value at a time''. 

So the symbolic statement:

: ∀ ''x'', ''friend''(''x'') ⇒ ''wealthy''(''x'')

would be literally translated using singular words as:

: &quot;For each value of ''x'', if ''x'' is a friend of mine, then ''x'' is wealthy&quot;.

and

: ∃ ''x'', ''friend''(''x'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''boring''(''x'')

is more literally translated:

: &quot;For at least one value of ''x'', ''x'' is a friend of mine and ''x'' is boring&quot;.


To emphasise this, you might find it helpful to use the following as translations of the symbols:

: ∀ means &quot;For each (value of) ...&quot;

and

: ∃ means &quot;For at least one (value of) ...&quot;


We can now make our earlier statement that &quot;All people with red hair have fiery tempers&quot; using Propositional Function notation as follows:

: ''redHair''(''x'') is: &quot;''x'' has red hair&quot;

: ''fieryTemper''(''x'') is: &quot;''x'' has a fiery temper&quot;


Now &quot;All people with red hair have fiery tempers&quot; is re-written in the singular as:

: For each value of ''x'', if ''x'' has red hair, then ''x'' has a fiery temper.

In symbols, then:

: ∀ ''x'', ''redHair''(''x'') ⇒ ''fieryTemper''(''x'')


''Example 12''

Define suitable propositional functions and then express in symbols:

: (a) Some cats understand French.

: (b) No footballers can sing.

: (c) At least one lecturer is not boring.

: (d) I go swimming every sunny day.


''Solutions''

(a) Re-write in the singular: &quot;At least one cat understands French&quot;. So we shall need to define propositional functions as:

: ''cat''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' is a cat&quot;

: ''French''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' understands French&quot;

So there is at least one ''x'' that is a cat ''and'' understands French; or, in symbols:

: ∃''x'', ''cat''(''x'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''French''(''x'')


(b) Re-write in the singular: &quot;It is not true that at least one footballer can sing&quot;. So:

: ''footballer''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' is a footballer&quot;

: ''sing''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' can sing&quot;

In symbols, then:

: ¬ (∃''x'', ''footballer''(''x'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''sing''(''x''))


''Alternatively'', we might re-write &quot;No footballers can sing&quot; as &quot;For each ''x'', if ''x'' is a footballer, then ''x'' cannot sing&quot;. In symbols, then, this gives the equally valid solution:

: ∀ ''x'', ''footballer''(''x'') ⇒ ¬ ''sing''(''x'')


(c) This is already in the singular; so:

: ''lecturer''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' is a lecturer&quot;

: ''boring''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' is boring&quot;

So:

: ∃ ''x'', ''lecturer''(''x'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ¬ ''boring''(''x'')


(d) In this example, it is important to realise what the ''variable'' represents. In (a) to (c) the variable ''x'' has denoted an animal or a person. In the sentence &quot;I go swimming every sunny day&quot; it is the ''day'' that changes, and, with it, the weather and my going swimming. So we must form our propositional functions around a variable ''x'' that stands for a ''day''. Thus:

: ''sunny''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' is a sunny day&quot;

: ''swimming''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' is a day when I go swimming&quot;

Then, re-writing &quot;I go swimming every sunny day&quot; in the singular, we get:

: &quot;For each day, if it is a sunny day then it is a day when I go swimming&quot;

So, in symbols:

: ∀''x'', ''sunny''(''x'') ⇒ ''swimming''(''x'')

== Universe of Discourse ==

Many of the propositions in ''Exercises 5'' and ''6'' referred to 'my friends'. For example, consider the proposition: &quot;All of my friends are either wealthy or clever.&quot;

Using predicates, we can symbolise this as:

: ∀ ''x'', ''friend''(''x'') ⇒ (''wealthy''(''x'') ∨ ''clever''(''x''))


However, if we agreed that the variable ''x'' can only stand for one of my friends, then we could symbolise this more simply as:

: ∀ ''x'', ''wealthy''(''x'') ∨ ''clever''(''x'')


For a given propositional function ''P''(''x''), the '''''universe of discourse''''' is the set from which the value of ''x'' may be chosen. Defining a universe of discourse can simplify the symbolisation of propositional functions. If a universe of discourse is ''not'' defined, then we shall have to assume that ''any'' object or individual may be substituted for ''x''.


''Example 13''

Define, in each case, a suitable universe of discourse and predicates to symbolise:

:(a) Some students are hard-working or drink too much.

:(b) Everybody was hot and someone fainted.


''Solutions''

(a) Define the following:

: Universe of discourse = {students}

: ''hardWorking''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' is hard-working&quot;

: ''drink''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' drinks too much''

Writing in the singular: &quot;For at least one ''x'', ''x'' is hard-working or ''x'' drinks too much&quot;, we get:

: ∃ ''x'', ''hardWorking''(''x'') ∨ ''drink''(''x'')


(b) In the given sentence, the word &quot;everybody&quot; clearly doesn't mean everybody in the whole world, simply everybody in the story being recounted. So we can define as follows:

: Universe of discourse = {people in the story}

: ''hot''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' was hot&quot;

: ''fainted''(''x'') is &quot;''x'' fainted&quot;

Then, in the singular, we have &quot;For each ''x'', ''x'' was hot and for at least one ''x'', ''x'' fainted&quot;. So:

: ∀ ''x'', ''hot''(''x'') &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt; ∃ ''x'', ''fainted''(''x'')


== Two-place Predicates ==

The predicates we have looked at so far have been ''one-place predicates''. To convert each predicate into a proposition, we have had to supply a ''single'' object or individual - the value of a single parameter, if you like.

We can create predicates which require ''two'' objects (or parameter values) to be supplied to convert them to propositions. Such predicates are called '''''two-place predicates'''''.


''Example 14''

Consider the following predicates:

: ''greaterThan'' is &quot;… is greater than …&quot;

: ''loves'' is &quot;… loves …&quot;

: ''belongsTo'' is &quot;… belongs to …&quot;

Then the following are two-variable propositional functions:

: ''greaterThan''(''x'', ''y'') is &quot;''x'' is greater than ''y''&quot;

:''loves''(''x'', ''y'') is &quot;''x'' loves ''y''&quot;

: ''belongsTo''(''x'', ''y'') is &quot;''x'' belongs to ''y''&quot;


So, for example, the following are propositions:

: ''greaterThan''(5, 2) is &quot;5 is greater than 2&quot;

: ''loves''(Bob, Lizzie) is &quot;Bob loves Lizzie&quot;

: ''belongsTo''(This coat, Harry) is &quot;This coat belongs to Harry&quot;


=== Two-place Predicates and Quantifiers ===

With the predicates above, we can quantify over one variable:

: ∀ ''x'', ''belongsTo''(''x'', me) is &quot;Everything belongs to me&quot;

: ∃ ''x'', ''greaterThan''(2, ''x'') is &quot;2 is greater than something&quot;

: ∀ ''x'', ''loves''(Mary, ''x'') is &quot;Mary loves everyone&quot;


... or both variables:

: ∀ ''x'', ∃''y'', ''loves''(''x'', ''y'') is &quot;Everybody loves somebody&quot;

: ∃ ''x'', ∀ ''y'', ''loves''(''x'', ''y'') is &quot;Somebody loves everybody&quot;

: ∃ ''x'', ∃ ''y'', ''loves''(''x'', ''y'') is &quot;Somebody loves somebody&quot;

: ∀ ''x'', ∀ ''y'', ''loves''(''x'', ''y'') is &quot;Everybody loves everybody&quot;


== Negation of Quantified Propositional Functions ==

In Question 5 of [[../Exercises#Logic Exercise 1|Exercise 1]], we had to say which of several options represented the negation of a proposition. Let’s look at this again, using our ''Quantified Propositional Function'' notation.


''Example 15''

Consider the negation of the proposition

: &quot;All sheep are black&quot;.

The negation is: 

: &quot;It is not true that all sheep are black&quot;.

which is equivalent to:

: &quot;At least one sheep is not black&quot;.

If we define the universe of discourse as {sheep} and ''isBlack'' in the obvious way, then we can symbolise all this as follows:

: ¬ (∀ ''x'', ''isBlack''(''x'')) ≡ ∃ ''x'', ¬''isBlack''(''x'')


Now consider the proposition
: &quot;Some sheep are black&quot;.

The negation of this is:

: &quot;It is not true that some sheep are black&quot;

which is equivalent to:

: &quot;All sheep are not black&quot;

This can then be symbolised as:

: ¬ (∃ ''x'', ''isBlack''(''x'')) ≡ ∀ ''x'', ¬''isBlack''(''x'')


We can generalise what we have found here to any propositional function ''P''(''x''), as follows:

: ¬(∀ ''x'', ''P''(''x'')) ≡ ∃ ''x'', ¬ ''P''(''x'')

: ¬(∃ ''x'', ''P''(''x'')) ≡ ∀ ''x'', ¬''P''(''x'')

== Confusing ==

I don't know if this will be answered (not the best location) but I have to say that I found the Article Validation to be very confusing.  Only after reading this page twice did I finally realise that each drop-down box is for a different thing.  Until then I thought that you select your 'category' from the first box and then rate it according to Accuracy and Coverage.  I think a simple rating of 1-5 for each type of validation would be far easier to understand.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:21, 27 November 2008 (UTC)
:We ''do'' have a simple 0-4 rating for each of three criteria. Is that perhaps not what you meant?&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:49, 27 November 2008 (UTC)
::I'm confused with it too :-(.  Why can't I rate some categories 0?  If I select poor for one of the three then the button gets greyed out.  The only way I can rate something poor is if I rate all three poor which then ungreys the button and gives me a comment box. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 13:55, 27 November 2008 (UTC)
:::It seems that you can only leave a comment when you are rating positivly (i.e. you have to comment and say why you're being positive).  I think it would be very useful to be able to make comments for negative ratings (i.e. to say why you are being negative).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:16, 27 November 2008 (UTC)
::::The idea is that if it's bad you're not going to flag it. Why would you want to show a stable-but-bad version to anon users by default? However, I agree we should tweak things so comments can be added at any level. We should probably get a bunch of tweaks together over the next month and list them all together at bugzilla. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:25, 27 November 2008 (UTC)

== Adding comments ==

Furthermore why can I only add a comment when I say that the coverage is 'good'?  I want to always be able to add a comment.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:33, 27 November 2008 (UTC)
:That is something we should probably revisit. I definitely like the idea of leaving comments for flagging at any level (though of course not always necessary). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:49, 27 November 2008 (UTC)
:Thanks Mike (and for the above). Also how can one view comments left by other reviewers? --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:34, 27 November 2008 (UTC)

== Edit intervals ==

What are they? [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad.Irwin]] ([[User talk:Conrad.Irwin|talk]]) 14:26, 3 December 2008 (UTC)

:It's my understanding that an &quot;edit interval&quot; is a period of time that separates two edits (not necessarily consecutive edits).  In order for the user to qualify for automatic promotion to editor, the user's edit log must contain at least 15 non-overlapping edit intervals of at least 3 days each.  If I'm reading that right (from general remarks at mediawiki [[mw:Extension:FlaggedRevs#Automatic_user_promotion|'''here''']], and wikibooks settings [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs_Extension|'''here''']]), this criterion cannot possibly be satisfied in less than 45 days (3 times 15), so that the &quot;30 days since registration&quot; would never actually come into play under the settings we're now using.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 10:02, 4 December 2008 (UTC)

:: I'm curious, where are you getting your information that the spacing and benchmark settings refer to number of days as well, and that you should multiple spacing and benchmarking to calculating the amount of time needed to satisfy a requirement? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:04, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

:: On closer inspection of the FlaggedRevs page on MediaWiki, I think I see where you could be getting that info. I still don't see how spacing and benchmarking should be multiplied to get what the minimum amount of time needed is though. The description is a bit too vague or ambiguous for that. If its true though, I guess the settings should be changed to something like at least 4 edits that are at least 7 days apart &amp;mdash; that would take at least 28 days to do, which wouldn't be so bad. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:24, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

:::You mean '''5''' edits that are at least 7 days apart; that's the fencepost error I'd made.  If you make five edits, there are four intervals between them, hence at least 28 days.  I'm pretty sure that's the right way to interpret the '''benchmarks''' field (i.e., the number of edits rather than the number of intervals) because of the phrasing of the key passage in the sparse, terse documentation on that page:
::::The user must have at least X edits that are Y or more days apart, where X is the number of '''benchmarks''' and Y is the time '''spacing'''.
:::(emphasis mine).  I too was a bit frustrated at first by the lack of an explicit statement that the test requires ''each consecutive pair'' of benchmark edits to be at least Y days apart.  I wasn't ''quite'' satisfied with the common-sense approach, which is that either &quot;Y or more days apart&quot; means that every pair of benchmark edits must be Y days apart, in which case the minimum time to satisfy the test is Y times (X minus one) days, or the whole complicated test degenerates into &quot;edits were made on more than one occasion, with the two occasions separated by at least Y days&quot;.  So I hunted down some of the discussions that surrounded the creation of the extension.  (I'd have to hunt them down from scratch, now.)  It was &amp;mdash; as I recall &amp;mdash; clear from the discussion that the spacing/benchmarks criterion was originally meant to be a very strong criterion to make sure the user had devoted time to the project on a large number of separate occasions.  That means non-overlapping intervals.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:40, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

http://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/highlight.php?file=flaggedrevs.php

Where I come from, having one-fifth of recent changes on a widely edited public wiki is considered flooding and indicates that either the user isn't using the preview button or the user is editing so fast that he should have sought a bot flag first. If it is not the intent to encourage a user to flood in order to become eligible for &quot;editor tools&quot;, I would appreciate a clarification of this rule. --[[User:Damian Yerrick|Damian Yerrick]] ([[User talk:Damian Yerrick|talk]]) 02:37, 26 November 2009 (UTC)

By definition, you can set the number of edits, or days, that are &quot;recent&quot; in the list that you view; mine is set to one hundred over seven days, for instance. However, the meaning of &quot;recent&quot; as far as editor criteria go is different... though I can't now locate what that value is, I suspect that &quot;recent&quot; means &quot;within the past week&quot; for purposes of autopromotion.

:::::30 days is the upper limit for [[Special:RecentChanges]], so I'd figured that was probably the definition of ''recent'' for autopromotion.  I don't think I've ever been aware of a case where this criterion alone prevented autopromotion.

:::::As another aside, one often hears the claim on English Wikinews that they have an &quot;easy come, easy go&quot; attitude toward the editor bit, but in fact they don't use autopromotion, because the project's status with Google depends on editors' ability to enforce high publication standards &amp;mdash; greater ability than mere activity can imply.  So subjective judgments are required.  I think autopromotion, with some moderately nontrivial criteria, is legitimate ''here'', but that's because we're trying for a modest level of trust combined with a modest level of understanding of Wikibooks; with a higher threshold for either, we probably wouldn't be autopromoting, either.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:39, 26 November 2009 (UTC)

== Sighting and validating ==

Umm... is it true that an editor can only sight, and not validate? I'm an editor, and apparently I can validate (mark as level 3) &amp;mdash; check the history of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Chamber of Secrets|this page]], for instance. A reviewer can mark as level 4, which is one better than validate... but I don't know what it's called, because of course I can't do it.

: A sighted revision is any revision that has a consistent style, good or average accuracy, and has great coverage. I believe those are all within the range in which an Editor can review a page. So editors can sight pages and review pages. The only mention of &quot;validate&quot; that I was able to find at all in FlaggedRevs' documentation is in terms of Editors can spot check for nonsense/graffiti and Reviewers can spot check and proofread a page. I think both descriptions are based on what the default criteria used for reviewing pages are for FlaggedRevs. Wikibooks uses custom criteria for reviewing pages though. Editors on Wikibooks do the spot checking for nonsense/graffiti and proofreading instead. All a Reviewer on Wikibooks can do is say that a revision's style, accuracy and coverage is of &quot;featured&quot; quality, which is a reference to Featured Books. So I think &quot;validate&quot; is either meaningless on Wikibooks or just means that when an Editor reviews a revision of a page they have validated the revision. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:02, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

I've just [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Revision_review&amp;diff=1395613&amp;oldid=1395393 reverted] part of an earlier edit. I removed a section header titled &quot;Stable revisions&quot; that spanned the entire page, and bumped the sub-section headers. If a section really spans the entire page, then the page should probably be renamed to its title.

I wasn't sure what the most proper page name would be so I checked [[mw:Help:FlaggedRevs]] which states that stable revisions are only revisions of a certain limit. On Wikibooks that limit is currently at the lowest (sighting). It might be more useful to keep a more general title for this page in line with the help page currently being developed over at MediaWiki.org. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:57, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

== Merging {{bad link|Wikibooks:Editors}} and [[Wikibooks:Reviewers]] and moving to project namespace ==

These two project pages currently contain very little and are largely redundant with this page. I'd like to propose that we merge them in here.

Also, after going back and forth on this for a while, I think this page belongs in the project namespace as it is rather descriptive of the project than a description of how to do something on Wikibooks. If we need something on the latter, we could put it up at somewhere like &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Help:Reviewing modules]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or similar (though I think the drop-down boxes don't need much explanation apart from the annotation on this page).

The other current content of this page seems rather ambiguous in its allegiance; it might expand, in future, in a how-to direction.  However, the most substantive content of the other two pages is the list of autopromotion criteria, which is not how-to information, and if merged into this page would shift its center of gravity.

In fact I think the point is to make the help pages more relevant to Wikibooks' way of doing things. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:51, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

:: In reply to the last two comments (Pi zero @ 13:47 and Darklama above); I'm happy to leave this in the help namespace for the time being. The main thing is to have a useful page that users can find. I feel a bit as if I'm splitting hairs here (linking properly to the page is more important to users than which namespace it's in) but I'll still let my rationale follow.
:: I think about the project namespace not as being restricted to policies and guidelines, but for any page with normative information about the workings of Wikibooks (the PaGs are just the ones we need explicit community consensus for use in big impact discussiosn such as deleting content or blocking users). The namespace, on the other hand, guides users through processes or helps the solve specific problems.
:: In the case of this page, I'd say that it doesn't so much help users review pages (there is no discussion of how to use the interface, for example, nor do I think we need that) but the page does contain normative information designed to standardise the understanding and usage of this tool across editors and reviewers. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:58, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

:::I agree that the assessment criteria are normative, and I think I agree that normative material is best placed in project space.  So I guess I'm in favor of moving it to project space.  The content of the other two pages, now in project space, actually isn't normative, but it's also fairly small, and I suppose it could probably be made to sit comfortably here even if this page eventually evolves into a guideline (as I suspect it will, someday).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:29, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

:::I think this page helps people to understand how to use the tool to review pages through explaining the review criteria that Wikibooks uses. I think pages in the help namespace can describe norms, and there are some help pages that do this. I guess I'm not saying that the Wikibooks namespace is only for PaGs, so much as I am that I don't see the Help namespace as being limited to only certain kinds of help or information, and I don't see any particular need for this to go somewhere else. I've moved pages from the Wikibooks namespace to the Help namespace before because the pages seemed to fit better with the intent of the help namespace, and I think I've seen other people do the same for similar reasons. I guess differences in opinion over which namespace pages should go in could be another reason why the Help namespace has been in bad shape. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:33, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: They are, indeed, in bad shape. Another reason why I don't consider the existance of normative pages in the help namespace as setting any precedence. Could you explain your view of how best to logically seperate this overlapping Wikibooks-desrciptive content into these two namespaces? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:49, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

: I've just [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Revision_review&amp;diff=1406028&amp;oldid=1398139 merged the two]. I held off on moving it to the project namespace to give darklama more time to explain his view on the boundary between help and project. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:30, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

:: I'm not sure what that boundary is, I think figuring that out is a bit of a touch and go. Like for this case perhaps a clarification of the difference might be whether the page is descriptive of project norms or of the community's norms. Thinking about what is mostly in the project namespace, I think I would conclude that the project namespace is for things related to the community, like policies that the community is expected to follow, community discussions, how the community works, etc. verses content that describes Wikibooks, how Wikibooks works, how to do things on Wikibooks. I would say this page describes how to use a tool on Wikibooks, rather than about the community expectation of how the tool is to be used. Wikibooks:Media describes community expectations for instance while Help:Uploading_Images is more in the context of how to use the upload tool. Help pages might also be described as a means of helping people to understand what to do to meet the community's goals or how people can meet the community's goals, while pages in the project namespace describes the community's goals. I hope that helps explain where the boundary might be between help and project. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:00, 11 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The pace of engineering change provides a constant learning challenge for organizations in today’s competitive environment. Major aircraft manufactures are no stranger to either competition or change. This new global landscape has provided opportunities for emerging global engineering competencies. At a time when macro-economic forces and financial constraints make innovation-driven growth a more urgent imperative than ever before, Global businesses, government, workers and universities face an unprecedented acceleration of global change, relentless pressure for short-term results, and fierce competition from countries that seek an innovation-driven future for themselves. For the past 25 years, we have optimized our organizations for efficiency and quality. Over the next quarter century, we must optimize our entire global workforce for innovation.</text>

Hi Benjamin66,

There is a chapter in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Masonry|Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] dedicated to Masonry.  I drew most of the material from U.S. Navy training manuals (which are in the public domain).  Don't ask why the Navy needs masons - no clue.  But their training materials are second to none.  They are listed in the References section of my chapter.  Hope that helps! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:54, 27 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Randomized Evidence for Testis NSGCT'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Surveillance==
*'''MRC Trial TE08''' (1998-2003) -- 2 CT scans vs 5 CT scans
**Randomized. 414 patients, clinical Stage I NSGCT. Treated with orchiectomy. 10% high risk (LVI). Normal serum markers. Arm 1) 2 CT scans (3 and 12 months) vs. Arm 2) 5 CT scans (3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months). CT was chest/abdomen; all other investigations (CXR, serum markers) were same between arms
**'''2007''' PMID 17416851 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized Trial of Two or Five Computed Tomography Scans in the Surveillance of Patients With Stage I Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumors of the Testis: Medical Research Council Trial TE08, ISRCTN56475197—The National Cancer Research Institute Testis Cancer Clinical Studies Group.&quot; (Rustin GJ et al. J Clin Oncol. 2007 Apr 10; 25(11):1310-1315.) Median F/U 3.3 years
***Outcome: 2-year RFS 2-scan 79% vs. 5-scan 84% (NS). For pts with vascular invasion, relapse 63% to 67%. No pts relapsed with poor prognosis disease; intermediate prognosis relapse in 2 pts (5.6% of relapses) in 2 scan group and 1 pt (3%) in 5 scan group.
***First indication of relapse: markers 39%, abd CT 39%. 9 relapses were picked up by the 12 month CT scan.
***Conclusion: CT scans at 3 months and 12 months after orchiectomy reasonable options in low-risk patients. 12 month CT scan is necessary.

==Adjuvant Therapy==
*'''AUO AH 01/94''' (Germany)(1996-2005) -- RPLND vs. BEP 1 cycle
**Randomized. 382 patients, clinical Stage I NSGCT. Arm 1) retroperitoneal lymph node dissection vs. Arm 2) bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin (BEP) x1 cycle
**'''5-years; 2008''' PMID 18458040 -- &quot;Randomized phase III trial comparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection with one course of bleomycin and etoposide plus cisplatin chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of clinical stage I Nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors: AUO trial AH 01/94 by the German Testicular Cancer Study Group.&quot; (Albers P, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jun 20;26(18):2966-72. Epub 2008 May 5.). Median F/U 4.7 years
***Outcome: 2-year RFS surgery 92% vs. BEP 99% (HR 7.9, SS)
***Conclusion: One course of BEP is superior over RPLND in clinical Stage I disease</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Lost Worlds subgenre of science fiction are those works that pertain to the discovery of lost civilizations or lost worlds. The genre grows directly out of the adventure story Lost World genre antecedents popular just before World War I, such as H. Rider Haggard's works and Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan and John Carter series. However, to cross the line into the science fiction genre, the story must at minimum take place in a projected future or make use of technology (usually to reach the lost world) not available to our civilization.

The quintessential example of this genre of fiction is most of Anne McCaffrey's work, particularly her meticulously envisioned Dragonrider series, which takes place on a planet known as Pern, which was colonized but then largely forgotten by a future Earth. McCaffrey's series centers on this lost world's struggles to survive a menace that visits them for fifty years of every 250, and the society that evolved to confront the challenge.

Other important authors who have created and expanded on lost worlds of their own include the following:

* [[w:Alan_Dean_Foster|Alan Dean Foster]] - [[w:The Dig (novel)|The Dig]]
* Brian M. Stableford - lost worlds encountered by the Daedelus Mission
* Gayle Greeno - Methuen 
* Ursula K. Le Guin - Hainish
* Larry Niven - Argos, Smoke Ring, and Ymir
* Jack Vance - Tschai, Cadwal
* David Drake - Bellevue, Hafardine, Cantilucca
* Joan D. Vinge - Tiamat 
* Robert L. Forward - Gargantua
* Andre Norton - Pax / Astra

      <text xml:space="preserve">Proteases are enzymes that accelerate the hydrolysis of peptide bonds. In essence, proteases break up proteins into smaller peptide fragments. Proteases generally promote the hydrolysis of a peptide by activating a nucleophile, polarizing the peptide carbonyl and stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate. Protease like all enzymes are very specific so recognizes side chain to know where to cleave.

==Mechanism of Action==
Proteases generally activate a nucleophile, which will in turn attack the carbon of the peptide bond. The electrons in the carbon-oxygen double bond migrate onto the oxygen as the nucleophile attaches itself. This tetrahedral intermediate is a high energy intermediate and the protease will generally have a way to stabilize this intermediate. The intermediate will then decompose, usually releasing the two peptide fragments.

The 4 main class of proteases are: [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Serine Proteases|Serine Proteases]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Cysteine Proteases|Cysteine Proteases]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Aspartyl Proteases|Aspartyl Proteases]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Metalloproteases|Metalloproteases]]. All four classes of proteases utilize either use a different nucleophile or a different way to activate the nucleophile. Serine and cysteine proteases use a catalytic triad to activate the side chain of either a serine or cysteine. Aspartyl proteases use an aspartic acid residue to activate a water molecule and another aspartic acid residue to align the peptide for attack. Metalloproteases use a metal ion to activate a water molecule.

Stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate is generally accomplished by parts of the proteins that aren't the active site. A common method is the use of an oxyanion hole. An oxyanion is a part of the protease which will encompass the tetrahedral intermediate. Within this hole, hydrogen bonding between the NH groups of the protease and the negatively charged oxygen of the protein will stabilize the intermediate.

==Specificity of Proteases==
An amazing feature of proteases is their preference for cleaving the peptide bond associated with a specific amino acid. This preference is a result of the active site's location within the protease's structure. The active site is generally in a cavity of the protein. The type of amino acid residues within the pocket will determine the preference of the proteases. Protease can also break ester bonds.

[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin]] has a deep cavity made up of mostly hydrophobic residues, thus Chymotrypsin has a preference to cut peptide bonds of amino acids with large hydrophobic side chains such as tryptophan and phenylalanine. Elastase has bulky valine residues within the cavity, thus Elastase has a preference to cut peptide bonds of amino acids with small side chains. Trypsin has a aspartate residue, which has a negatively charged side chain, at the bottom on the cavity. Thus Trypsin has a preference to cut peptide bonds of amino acids with positively charged side chains.

Enzyme inhibition by DIPF: serine 195's Hydrogen can bind with Fluoride from DIPF and inhibit its nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of peptide it wants to cleave.

==Protease Inhibitors==

The conversion of a zymogen to a protease through the cleavage of one peptide bond is an accurate way to switch on certain enzymatic activities. The following activation step is irreversible. Therefore a different mechanism is required to stop proteolysis with the help of specific protease inhibitors. There are several important drugs that serve as protease inhibitors. These inhibitors are specific for one enzyme and do not interfere in the production of other proteins in the body. For example, the inhibitor Indinvar is specific for the HIV protease because the interaction of water and the enzyme is not possible in other aspartyl proteases. 

Captopril is an inhibitor for the metalloprotease antiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This inhibitor helps in the regulation of blood pressure in the body. 

There are several HIV protease inhibitors used for the treatment of AIDS. The HIV protease is an aspartyl protease that cleaves multidomain viral proteins into their active forms. Indinavir is an inhibitor that structurally resembles peptide substrate of HIV protease by mimicking the tetrahedral intermediate. In the active site, indinavir adopts a conformation that is similar to the twofold symmetry of the enzyme. Two flexible flaps of the HIV protease's active site fold down on top of the bound inhibitor. The central alcohol interacts with the two aspartate residues of the active site. Plus, the inhibitor's two carbonyl groups are hydrogen bonded to a water molecule (this is not seen in the molecule below), which is also hydrogen bonded to a NH group in each of the flaps.

[[Image:HIV protease-indinavir complex.jpg|thumb|(Left) The HIV protease is shown with the inhibitor indinavir bound at the active site. (Right) The drug has been rotated ti reveal its approximately twofold symmetric conformation.]]

====Enzymatic Trypsin Inhibitor====

Another example of a protease inhibitor is known as '''Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor'''. It is a 6 kilodalton protein and inhibits trypsin by binding very strongly to the active site of trypsin. The trypsin and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex is very stable in that it has a dissociation constant of about 0.1 pM (standard free energy of -75 kJ/mol). THis means that the complex cannot be dissociated into its denatured state with common denaturing agents such as 8 M Urea or 6 M guanidine hydrochloric acid. Because pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is a very effective substrate, the complex that it forms with trypsin is extraordinarily stable. Also, analysis by X-rays reveal that the inhibitor lies in the active site in such a position that the lysine-15 side chain of the inhibitor interacts with an aspartate side chain of trypsin in the active site. Additionally, many hydrogen bonds between the main chain of trypsin and the inhibitor further stabilize the trypsin - pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex. 

After binding to the active site of trypsin, pancreatic trypsin inhibitor does not change its structure, which means that the inhibitor is preorganized into such a structure that is complementary to the enzyme's active site. This is seen by the slow rate of cleavage of the peptide bond between lysine-15 and alanine-16. Overall, this inhibitor is more like a substrate and its inherent structure is extremely complentary to the enzyme's active site that it binds really tightly and is turned over slowly. 

The amount of physiologically available trypsin is greater than the amount of trypsin inhibitor. Since trypsin activates other zymnogens, inhibitors of trypsin needs to exist to prevent small amounts of trypsin from starting a mistakenly activated cascade. 

====α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Antitrypsin (α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-antiproteinase)====

'''α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Antitrypsin''' is a 53 kilodalton plasma protein protease inhibitor. It protects tissues from digestion by elastase, which is a secretory product of white blood cells that engulf bacteria. α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Antitrypsin inhibits elastase much better than it inhibits trypsin. Similar to pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Antitrypsin blocks the action to target enzymes by almost irreversibly binding to the enzyme active sites. 

α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Antitrypsin is a physiologically important inhibitor because without it, excess elastase destroys alveolar walls in the lungs by digesting connective-tissue proteins. This condition is called emphysema, in which people with this condition have difficulty breathing. People with emphysema must breathe harder than normal in order to exchange the same amount of oxygen as people without emphysema due their damaged alveoli. Cigarette smokers are more likely to develop emphysema because smoke oxidizes methionine-358 to methionine sulfoxide (see figure) of the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Antitrypsin inhibitor, which is an essential residue for binding elastase. The insertion of a single oxygen into the resulting methionine sulfoxide of the protein, which changes the inhibitor's affinity for elastase is a great example of the importance of structural biochemistry and the role it plays throughout physiological processes.

      <comment>/* Specific cases of Carbonic Anhydrase */ removal of &quot;is&quot; to correct grammatical error</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
A carbonic anhydrase, or carbonate dehydratase, is a type of enzyme that rapidly catalyzes the conversion of carbon dioxide into a proton and the bicarbonate ion (HCO3-). This reaction is rather slow in the absence of the anhydrase catalyst, as the reaction with the enzyme takes place typically ten thousand to one million (10^4-10^6) times per second. The active site by which the enzyme binds contains a zinc ion (Zn2+), by which the pKa is lowered and allows for nucleophilic attack on the carbon dioxide group. In humans, this reaction mechanism is vital in maintaining pH balance and in transporting carbon dioxide out of the tissues and into the lungs. Carbon dioxide hydration needs a buffer because a buffer as we mentioned before can work as an acid or a base and in this case the buffer helps enzyme to reach its highest catalytic rate. In some cases, the active site of carbonic anhydrase is inaccessible to bulky buffers, interfering with efficient proton transfer.   In response, carbonic anhydrase II developed a proton shuttle made up of a histidine residue that removes an H+ from the bound water molecule, activating its nucleophilicity, and then transfers the proton to the edge of the protein (allowing the buffer to easily remove it). Therefore the reaction uses both [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Acid-Base Catalysis|'''acid-base catalysis''']] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Catalytic Strategies/Metal Ion Catalysis|'''metal ion catalysis''']] strategies.

[[File:phcarbonica.jpg|right|thumb|Effect of pH on carbonic anhydrase activity]]

==Structure==

[[Image:tina_carbonic_anhydrase.jpg|thumb|Structure of Carbonic Anhydrase|left]]In carbon anhydrase, as well as all biological systems, the zinc atom is in the +2 state.  The zinc is bound to four ligands, three of its coordination sites are occupied by the imidazole rings of three histidine residues and a fourth is occupied by a water molecule.  This active site is located in a cleft near the center of the enzyme.

==Function==
[[Image:tinocarbonicacid.jpg|thumb|Mechanism of carbon dioxide converted to carbonic acid|left]]Carbonic anhydrase is a catalytic enzyme specific to accelerating the formation of carbonic acid from carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O):

&lt;big&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⇌ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

It is important to note that the carbonic anhydrase does not shift the equilibrium of the reaction but rather helps the equilibrium be reached much quicker, allowing for its high velocity yield of product. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dissociate in blood, which gives this equilibrium:

&lt;big&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ⇌ H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Carbonic anhydrase has been known to catalyze one million reactions per second. Also note that Carbonic acid readily dissociates into H+ and bicarbonate since it is a more stable compound.

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Carbonic_anhydrase.gif‎|Carbonic_anhydrase.gif|thumb|400px]]

pH affects carbonic anhydrase in a sigmoidal fashion. The higher the pH, the more active the enzyme is (since it is in the optimal conditions for deprotonation). 

1) The binding of zinc lowers the pKa of water from 15.7 to 7, generating a hydroxide ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;-&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to attack carbon dioxide. zinc releases a proton from a water molecule to generate this hydroxide ion. pH decreases as a result from the decrease in the pKa. According to Le Chatelier's principle, this drives the reaction towards deprotonation.

2) The carbon dioxide substrate binds to the enzymes active site and is positioned for optimal interaction.

3) The hydroxide ion (being a great nucleophile) attacks the carbonyl of carbon dioxide, converting it to bicarbonate ion  through the nucelophilic attack. Oxygen on the carbon dioxide molecule forms an intermediate bond with the Zn metal during the conversion process.


4) The enzyme is regenerated and the bicarbonate ion is released. The enzyme is ready for another reaction to occur. This regenerative ability of this enzyme allows for this reaction to be highly efficient and kinetically fast to constantly process carbon dioxide within the blood cells.

==The role of zinc==
Zinc's role in carbonic anhydrase is to facilitate the water to create a proton H+ and a nucleophilic hydroxide ion.  The nucleophilic water molecules attack the carbonyl group of carbon dioxide to convert it into bicarbonate. This is obtained through the +2 charge that the zinc ion has, which attracts the oxygen of water, deprotonates water, thus converting it into a better nucleophile so that the newly converted hydroxyl ion can attack the carbon dioxide. 

Water naturally deprotonates itself, but is its a rather slow process and not in large quantities. Zinc deprotonates water by providing a positive charge for the hydroxide ion. Zinc alone cannot deprotonate water fast enough to reach the 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; per second rate that it has been measured, however, the proton is donated temporarily to the surrounding amino acid residues, which will later be given to the environment, while allowing the reaction to continue and not slowing down the process.
Metal ions are good because it increases the reactivity of the chemicals and can create strong bonds.
Zinc is able to help the deprotonation of water by lowering the pka of water. Binding of water to zinc lowers the pka of water from about 15.7 to 7. This means more water molecules are now able to deprotonate at a lower pH than normal, and this makes it easier for water to turn into a hydroxide ion which is a better nucleophile.

== Specific cases of Carbonic Anhydrase == 

Carbonic Anhydrase can be used when carbon dioxide in the tissue diffuses into the human red blood cells. The Carbon Dioxide (CO2) reacts with water to form carbonic acid. Typically this reaction is catalyzed by Carbonic Anhydrase. 

CO2 --enter red blood cell---&gt; CO2 + H2O ---catalyzed by Carbonic Anhydrase--&gt; H2CO3

A case of reducing the activity of carbonic anhydrase is found in a class of drugs used to treat glaucoma, neurological disorders, and ulcers.  There are different types including methazolamide and brinzolamide.  The mechanism of these vary from one type to the next, but they all inhibit the enzymatic activity of carbonic anhydrase.

== About UNISDR Regional Office for Asia &amp; Pacific ==
With over 50% of the total world disasters, the Asia and Pacific Islands region represents the widest and most disaster prone continent in the world, beyond Africa, with a regular and increased frequency of typhoons, tsunamis, floods, droughts, fires and other natural hazards. Despite the wealth of expertise, knowledge and know-how in disaster risk reduction, the increasing population growth, widespread poverty, environmental degradation, rising pollution and wild human settlements keep increasing the vulnerabilities of most communities in Asia and the Pacific Islands, thereby creating a favorable terrain to allow the above natural hazards to transform invariably into devastating disasters wiping out all human lives and economic lifelines on their way, and setting back years of continued development efforts.

In December 2004, the tragic tsunami in the Indian Ocean has heightened the level of awareness of the communities in Asia and the Pacific about the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into national development planning and reminded them of the need to work together in a coordinated manner to respond to the threat of disasters.

In that spirit, as a direct follow-up to the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (January 2005, Kobe, Japan) and at the request of the 168 UN Member States grouped together on the occasion, the UNISDR established a regional presence to cover the whole Asia and Pacific Islands region. The UNISDR regional Unit for Asia and the Pacific was set up in June 2005 in Bangkok, Thailand, hosted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).

The UNISDR Asia &amp; Pacific is currently divided into two separate bodies:

(i) A regional unit, based in Bangkok, Thailand, which covers the whole Asia and Pacific Islands region. It includes a Senior Regional Coordinator and a Regional Programme Officer, as well as two local support staff

(ii) A sub-regional liaison office for Central Asia, based in Dushanbe, Tajikistan and covering Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, is coordinated by a Junior Professional Officer

== Our Mandate ==
The core mandate of the UNISDR Asia &amp; Pacific includes awareness-raising activities in disaster risk reduction, including the promotion of the World Disaster Reduction Campaign and the annual UN Sasakawa Award for Disaster Reduction, advocacy through policy formulation, the dissemination of guidelines to assist in the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), promote the establishment of national platforms for disaster risk reduction, enhance networking and partnership-building to contribute to an effective culture of safety and protection of all communities in the Asia and Pacific Islands region.

Three specific areas of focus have been identified to guide the work of the UNISDR Asia and the Pacific. They include:

(i) The promotion of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) throughout the whole Asia and Pacific Islands region and the forging of partnerships at the regional level to facilitate its implementation, with the effective operational support and expertise of members of the UNISDR Asian Partnership on Disaster Reduction (IAP) and other relevant players.

(ii) The follow-up and strengthening of the projects carried out under the United Nations Flash Appeal for the Indian Ocean Tsunami Early Warning System (IOTWS), including an increased cooperation and coordination with relevant technical partners and the donor community. (iii) The development of an effective information management system with comprehensive databases, the maintenance of a regional website, the production of a bi-annual publication “Disaster Reduction in Asia and the Pacific - UNISDR Informs”, the dissemination of regional highlights promoting regional partners’ initiatives and relevant events among other.

The UNISDR Asia and Pacific Islands works through a growing network of national platforms to mobilize governmental actions in disaster risk reduction as well as directly with the governments in the region, as mandated though the HFA, to assist them in identifying their priorities and in formulating their national action plan on disaster risk reduction towards its integration in national development plans. It also makes an effective use of regional partners’ networks at the national level, in particular the UN Country Team members, to facilitate the effective implementation of DRR strategies.

== Introduction to the Publication ==
[[Image:Climate_Resilient.gif|thumb|right|Cover]]
This Primer is a tool for city governments in the East Asia Region to better understand how to plan for climate change impacts and impending natural disasters through sound urban planning to reduce vulnerabilities.

It gives local governments information to actively engage in training, capacity building, and capital investment programs that are identified as priorities for building sustainable, resilient communities.

== Our Mandate ==
The core mandate of the UNISDR Asia &amp; Pacific includes awareness-raising activities in disaster risk reduction, including the promotion of the World Disaster Reduction Campaign and the annual UN Sasakawa Award for Disaster Reduction, advocacy through policy formulation, the dissemination of guidelines to assist in the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), promote the establishment of national platforms for disaster risk reduction, enhance networking and partnership-building to contribute to an effective culture of safety and protection of all communities in the Asia and Pacific Islands region.

Three specific areas of focus have been identified to guide the work of the UNISDR Asia and the Pacific. They include:

(i) The promotion of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) throughout the whole Asia and Pacific Islands region and the forging of partnerships at the regional level to facilitate its implementation, with the effective operational support and expertise of members of the UNISDR Asian Partnership on Disaster Reduction (IAP) and other relevant players.

(ii) The follow-up and strengthening of the projects carried out under the United Nations Flash Appeal for the Indian Ocean Tsunami Early Warning System (IOTWS), including an increased cooperation and coordination with relevant technical partners and the donor community. (iii) The development of an effective information management system with comprehensive databases, the maintenance of a regional website, the production of a bi-annual publication “Disaster Reduction in Asia and the Pacific - UNISDR Informs”, the dissemination of regional highlights promoting regional partners’ initiatives and relevant events among other.

The UNISDR Asia and Pacific Islands works through a growing network of national platforms to mobilize governmental actions in disaster risk reduction as well as directly with the governments in the region, as mandated though the HFA, to assist them in identifying their priorities and in formulating their national action plan on disaster risk reduction towards its integration in national development plans. It also makes an effective use of regional partners’ networks at the national level, in particular the UN Country Team members, to facilitate the effective implementation of DRR strategies.

== Introduction to the Publication ==
[[Image:Living_Risk.gif|thumb|right|Cover]]
While the world has witnessed a drop in the number of deaths per year due to disasters over the past ten years, more people are being affected and economic costs are escalating more than ever.

Earthquakes are inevitable, but death in an earthquake is not. Floods are a fact of life, but they need not wash away health, hope and livelihoods. Living with Risk - a global review of disaster reduction initiatives is intended for people who have an interest in and practice disaster risk management and sustainable development. It provides guidance, policy orientation and inspiration, as well as serving as a reference for lessons on how to reduce risk and vulnerability to hazards and to meet the challenges of tomorrow.

Natural hazards can affect anyone, anywhere. People are threatened by hazards because of their social, economic and environmental vulnerability, which must be taken into account if sustainable development is to be achieved. Disaster risk reduction therefore concerns everyone, from villagers to heads of state, from bankers and lawyers to farmers and foresters, from meteorologists to media chiefs.

Living with Risk: A global review of disaster reduction initiatives brings to light the urgent need for action to be taken – and the people who are doing so – towards building sustainable societies in an increasingly disaster-prone world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Competitive Inhibitors''' belong to the category of enzymes known as reversible inhibitors. Reversible inhibitors dissociate the enzyme-inhibitor complex as soon as possible. They are inhibitors that bind directly to the active site of an enzyme, however they can also bind between an enzyme and a substrate. The competitive inhibitor competes with the substrate to bind to the enzyme. A competitive inhibitor mimics the substrate, competing for the active site. A competitive inhibitor can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration. The excess amount of substrate can negate the competitive inhibitor and the maximum velocity is ultimately unaffected.
Competitive inhibitors are effective because oftentimes they are structural analogs of the substrate that the enzyme binds, that is why the inhibitor is able to bind to the active site of the enzyme and compete with the original substrate.

Competitive inhibitors bind to the active sites of an enzyme and decrease the  amount of binding of the substrate or ligand to enzyme. The result is that the Km is increased and Vmax remains the same. Ultimately, the chemical reaction can be reversed by increasing concentration of substrate.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;big&gt;E + S → ES → E + P&lt;/big&gt;　　　vs.　　　&lt;big&gt;EI −&lt;/big&gt;(S comes in and replace I)&lt;big&gt;→ ES → E + P&lt;/big&gt;

(an equilibrium reaction also occurs at the same time: E + I ⇌ EI)

where E is the enzyme, I is the inhibitor, ES is the enzyme-substrate complex, P is the product, and EI is the enzyme-inhibitor complex. 

Note: All the arrows also represents the reversible reactions. However, the reaction tends to proceed towards the right in the formation of products. Notice that there isn't any ESI formation. This means that the enzyme cannot bind to both the substrate and the inhibitor.

[[File:Competitive kinetics.PNG|thumb|Competitive kinetics]]

* Competitive inhibition is reversible when enough substrate is present, meaning that the amount of inhibition depends on the concentration of inhibitor as well as the concentration of the substrates.
 
* This inhibition makes the maximum rate of enzyme kinetics unchanged, but K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, Michaelis constant*, increases.

The Michaelis constant (Km) is:

1) the yield of the substrate concentration at the velocity of the half of the maximum velocity, or

2) half of the substrates at the maximum velocity. [Which is not true in most of the cases, but it is beyond of our discussion in this class and will be discussed in graduate school's courses]

The picture shows a double-reciprocal plot of V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and [S].  The x-intercept is equal to -1/K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; while the y-intercept is 1/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  The slope of the line is K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  Thus, the plot shows that there is an increase in K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and no change in V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Michaelis-Menten equation becomes
V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;= Vmax[S]/ aKm + [S]
Where a = 1 + [I]/KI  and   KI = [E][I]/[EI]

Competitive inhibitors can also be used to find the active site of an enzyme. N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-asparate, also known as PALA, is a competitive inhibitor which blocks the binding of Aspartate transcarbanoylase to its active site. PALA stabilizes the R state.  

Penicillin-based antibacterials are examples of materials that compete at the active site of an enzyme in an inhibitory fashion.  In general, penicillin drugs are used medicinally as antibiotics in the treatment of many bacterial infections; moreover, penicillin drugs derive their antibacterial action due to the fact that they bind irreversibly to bacterial glycopeptide transpeptidase.  When unchecked, bacterial infections proliferate, in part, because of their ability to construct cell walls.  A key enzyme in the synthesis of bacterial cell walls is transpeptidase.  This enzyme plays a critical role in the cross-linking of peptidoglycan strands.  Penicillin drugs inhibit the ability of transpeptidase to perform this crucial task.  Without the cell wall, bacteria are unable to proliferate, which means the bacteria are essentially destroyed.  Mechanistically, in the initial stage of the inhibitory action of penicillin-based drugs, the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the nitrogen atom in the β-lactam ring of the penicillin cleaves.  The resulting electrophile is attacked by the newly formed alkoxide ion on the serine residue to form an ester, which results in the final product: a penicilloyl-enzyme complex between glycopeptide transpeptidase and penicillin.  It is noteworthy to mention that this complex is stable indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction of Penicillin==

Penicillin is an antibiotic agent that was earliest discovered and used widely. This antibiotic agent was derived from the Penicillium mold. Since antibiotics released by fungi and bacteria act as a natural substances that inhibits other organisms, it is then a chemical warfare on a microscopic scale.  Penicillian is used to treat variety of infections and micro-organism. 

==History of Penicillin==
[[File:Alexander Fleming.jpg|thumb|Alexander Fleming]]
Penicillin was first noticed in 1896 by Ernest Duchesne, a French medical student. Then in 1928, it was re-discovered by Alexander Fleming, a bacteriologist, who worked the London's St. Mary's Hospital. During Fleming's work at the hospital, he noticed a Staphylococcus plate culture that was contaminated by a blue-green mold. At the mean time, the colonies of bacteria that was next to the mold were dissolved. With much curiosity, Fleming began to grew the mold in a pure culture; as a result, he found that it formed a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. From the observations and experiments, Fleming named the substance penicillin, and Fleming published the results in 1929.

In 1938, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and Norman Heatley continued the research of penicillin at Oxford University. During that period of time, the three scientist and their staff developed methods for growing, extracting, and purifying penicillin to prove its value as a drug.

Then during the World War II (1939–1945) period, penicillin became very useful. In 1941, the research and production of penicillin moved to the United States. It was to protect the progress and production of penicillin from bombings in England. More and more work began on the growing of mold to make penicillin in large quantities for thousands of soldiers. When the amount of people dying began to grow, the interest in penicillin also grew in laboratories, universities, and drug companies. Scientist at that time knew that they were in a race against death, and since this infection was able to kill a wounded soldier through a small wound.

== Penicillin as an Inhibitor ==
'''Penicillin kills bacteria by interfering with the ability to synthesize cell wall. The bacteria lengthen, but cannot divide. Eventually the weak cell wall ruptures.'''

Penicillin irreversibly blocks bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibiting the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links. Penicillin covalently binds to the enzyme transpeptidase that links the peptidoglycan molecules in bacteria, it inhibits the molecule so that it cannot react any further and cell wall cannot be further synthesized.  The cell wall of the bacterium is weakened even further because the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers bacterial cell wall hydrolysis and autolysins, and destroys pre-existing peptidoglycan. Penicillin makes a great inhibitor because of its four membered beta lactam ring, which makes it especially reactive. Penicillin acts as a suicide inhibitor by binding with the transpeptidase enzyme it inactivates itself. 

Gram positive bacteria are the most sensitive and susceptible to penicillin because Gram positive bacteria only have murein (peptidoglycan) layer. Gram negative bacteria are usually more resistant to penicillin because they have multiple membrane layers, which allows them to still retain a cell wall even though they have lost their murein layer to penicillin. Penicillin can be used to treat Gram positive bacteria such as ''streptococcus pneumoniae'', ''staphylococcus aureus'', ''enterococcus'', ''clostridium tetani'', and ''listeria monocytogenes''. Penicillin cannot be used to treat gram negative bacteria such as ''neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, pseudomonas, legionella, escherichia coli'', ''helicobacter pylori'' (stomach ucler), ''borrelia burgdorfeli'' (lyme disease), ''treponema pallidium'' (syphilus), and ''chlamydia trachomatis''. 

Some bacteria have developed resistance to beta-lactams. These bacteria contain beta-lactamases, a broad class of enzymes with a serine residue that cleaves the reactive beta lactam ring through an [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Catalytic Triad|acyl-enzyme intermediate]]. Augmentin, a drug that contains both a beta-lactam (typically amoxicillin) and clavulanic acid (a beta-lactamase inhibitor), is often prescribed to overcome drug resistant strains. Clavulanic acid works by competitive inhibition.

==Types of penicillin==
===Benzylpenicillin===
[[Image:Penicilling.png|thumb|Benzylpenicillin]]&lt;br&gt;
Benzylpenicillin, commonly known as penicillin G, is known as the gold standard penicillin. It is given by a method of non-oral administration (parentally) because it is unstable in the hydrochloric acid of the stomach. Because the drug is given parenterally, tissue concentrations of penicillin G can be achieved in larger levels than is possible with other types of penicillin, like phenoxymethylpenicillin. These higher concentrations become increased antibacterial levels or activities.

Uses for benzylpenicillin include:

*Cellulitis
*Bacterial endocarditis
*Gonorrhea
*Meningitis
*aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess
*Community-acquired pneumonia
*Syphilis
*Septicemia in children

===Phenoxymethylpenicillin/penicillin V===

Phenoxymethylpenicillin is the orally active form of penicillin. It is less frequently used than benzylpenicillin, and is mostly used in conditions when high tissue is not required. However, it is the first choice when it comes to treating odontogenic (relating to the teeth) infections.

===Procaine===

Procaine benzylpenicillin (rINN), also known as procaine penicillin, is a combination of benzylpenicillin with the local anaesthetic agent procaine. It is absorbed into the circulation by means of deep intramuscular injection. It is used when prolonged low concentrations of benzylpenicilin are needed, and mostly used in veterinary environments as well as dental offices.
The common trade name for procaine is Novocain which is typically administered to patients at the dentist office before undergoing minor surgery.  It is metabolized in the blood plasma by an enzyme called pseudocholinesterase.  Procaine replaced cocaine as a local anesthetic due to the severe side effects caused by cocaine.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Procainemodel.png|Procain
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Benzathine===
Benzathine benzylpenicillin (rINN), also known as benzathine penicillin, is absorbed into the circulation slowly by intramuscular injection like procaine penicillin, but then it is hydrolysed to benzylpenicillin in vivo. It is the number one drug choice when prolonged low concentrations are required and appropriate. It allows for antibiotic action to be prolonged over two to four weeks following just one dose.

Other examples of penicillin include amoxcillin, ampicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and temocillin. Amoxcillin and ampicillin are the most common penicillins that are prescribed by doctors because they are used to treat common infections such as throat infections.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Benzathine.svg|Benzathine
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Side effects==

Just like any other drug on the market, penecillin may cause unpleasant side effects for patients taking it.  Some of the side effects are commonly found on patients using penicillin are: diarrhea, hypersensitivity, nausea, rash, neurotoxicity urticaria, seizures. Pain and inflmmation at the injection site is also common for the partenterally administered pencillin types. 
3% to 10% of the population are allergic to penicillin.  Usually when allergic to one type of penicillin, you are allergic to the entire family of penicillin antibiotics.  The problems mentioned about diarrhea and nausea tend to go away for most patients after a few doses of the drug.  If further symptoms occur, however, the drug should not be taken anymore.  Physicians say that any drug that interferes with cellular growth, in this case the cell wall, can have severe side effects on a large population of patients.

==Penicillin allergy==
Penicillin and related antibiotics can cause an allergic reaction in some people. Although, not all adverse reactions to penicillin are a sign of an allergic reaction. True allergic reactions involve the immune system and can cause signs and symptoms that range from an annoying rash to a life-threatening reaction or anaphylaxis with low blood pressure and trouble breathing. β-lactam antibiotic can end up causing allergic reactions to about 10% of the patients. However, even though penicillin are very commonly reported in allergy cases, but less than 20% of those reports are truly allergic. But it is definitely a drug that can cause major, severe reactions. 

It isn't clear why some people develop penicillin allergy while others don't. Treating an allergic reaction may require taking medications or emergency care in serious cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

An Incompetitive inhibitor is an inhibitor that only binds to the enzyme-substrate complex. The formation of its binding site only forms when the enzyme and the substrate have interacted amongst themselves. The uncompetitive inhibition does not work when additional substrates are trying to be involved. The enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex does not produce any product.  

'''E + I -&gt; (incoming S) EI + S -&gt; ESI -X-&gt; E + P'''

[[Image:uncompetitiveinhibitor.jpg|frame|250px|'''Uncompetitive Inhibitor''']]

Uncompetitive inhibitor binds to enzyme-substrate complex to stop enzyme from reacting with substrate to form product, as such, it works well at higher substrate and enzyme concentrations that substrates are bonded to enzymes; the binding results in decreasing concentration of substrate binding to enzyme, Km, and Vmax, and increasing binding affinity of enzyme to substrate.

'''E + I -&gt; (through S) ES + I -&gt; E + P'''

where E is the enzyme, I is the inhibitor, ES is the enzyme-substrate complex, and P is the product. 

This binding of the substrate modifies the structure of the enzyme making the inhibitor-binding site available. Uncompetitive inhibition decreases the maximum velocity as well as the K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;. K,&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is the concentration of the substrate when the velocity is half of the maximum velocity based on the Michaelis-Menten Kinetics Model.  Both V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; are reduced by equal amounts.  V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; will still be reduced even though the enzyme-substrate binding is enhanced because there are ESI complexes being formed. ESI complexes inhibit the formation of the product. An uncompetitive inhibitor will lower the K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and create a better enzyme-substrate binding because it only binds to ES complex. But the ES complex is constantly being depleted as the inhibitor binds, producing ESI complexes. Therefore, to maintain the equilibrium between ES and ESI complexes and following Le Chatelier's Principle, the reaction shifts toward more ES formation where it will bind more substrate to the enzymes to create more ES. Ultimately, this leads to a lower K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;. A reduced K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; indicates a better enzyme-substrate binding because the enzyme can reach half its maximum velocity with less substrate concentration. In a sense, enzyme-substrate binding is very efficient because the enzyme and substrate have a high affinity and interact strongly.

==Kinetics of Uncompetitive Inhibitors==


[[Image:Reaction scheme uncompetitive enzyme inhibition.svg|250px|]]
[[Image:kinteticsuncompetitiveinhibitor.jpg|250px|]]

The first image depicts the basic theory behind uncompetitive inhibition and demonstrates what the inhibitor does to inactivate the enzyme and prevent it from forming the product. The second image shows what happens when the concentration of inhibitor is increased while enzyme concentration is constant. This hows how the V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of the enzyme decreases as the concentration of inhibitor goes up.
 
==Double-Reciprocal Plot of Uncompetitive Inhibition==

[[Image:UNCOMPETITIVE.jpg|500px|Double-Reciprocal Plot of Uncompetitive Inihibition]]

The picture shows a double-reciprocal plot of V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and [S].  The x-intercept is equal to -1/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; while the y-intercept is 1/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  The slope of the line is K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  Thus, the plot shows that K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is decreased and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is also decreased.

The Michaelis-Menten equation becomes:

&lt;math&gt;\ 1/V_o=\frac{K_m}{V_{max}[S]}+\frac{1+[I]/K_i}{V_{max}}&lt;/math&gt;

As demonstrated in this equation, slope of the equation will be effectively the same as demonstrated by &lt;math&gt;\frac{K_m}{V_{max}[S]}&lt;/math&gt; but the y-axis on the double-reciprocal plot moves up by &lt;math&gt;{1+[I]/K_i}&lt;/math&gt; and as a consequence the shift causes the new line to be parallel to the original.

'''Noncompetitive inhibitor''' can bind to an enzyme with or without a substrate at different places at the same time. It changes the conformation of an enzyme as well as its active site, which makes the substrate unable to bind to the enzyme effectively so that the efficiency decreases. A noncompetitive inhibitor binds to the enzyme away from the active site, altering the shape of the enzyme so that even if the substrate can bind, the active site functions less effectively.  Most of the time, the inhibitor is reversible. However, this inhibition decreases the turnover number, meaning the rate of reaction decreases. As the inhibitor binds to the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex, it reduces the concentration of enzyme available for proper catalysis.  Fewer functional enzymes leads to fewer available active sites and thus a smaller Vmax. Unlike [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Competitive Inhibitor|competitive inhibition]], raising [S] (substrate concentration)is pointless with noncompetitive inhibition.
[[File:Noncompetetiveinhibition.png|thumb| Noncompetitive inhibitor binds at different site on enzyme]]
A noncompetitive inhibitor binds to a different site that is not the active site of the enzyme and changes the structure of the enzyme; therefore, it blocks the enzyme from binding to substrate, which stops enzyme activity. Thus, it decreases the rate of the chemical reaction of enzyme and substrate, which can not be changed by increasing concentration of substrate; the binding decreases Vmax and has no change on the Km of the chemical reaction.

'''E + I − (through a substrate) →  ES + I → E + P'''   

'''ES + I ⇌ ESI → NR (no reaction)'''

where E is enzyme, I is inhibitor, ES is enzyme-substrate complex, P is product. ESI is the molecule after the inhibitor is bound to the enzyme-substrate complex. ESI cannot form any products, so the later reaction is not allowed (or, no reaction).

[[File:Noncompetitive kinetics.PNG|thumb|Noncompetitive kinetics]]

Based on the Michaelis-Menten Model, K&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;M&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, the concentration of the substrate when the velocity is the half of the maximum velocity (or half of the substrates at maximum velocity), remains same, but the maximum velocity is decreased.

[[Image:noncompetitive.jpg|475px]]

The picture shows a double-reciprocal plot of V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and [S].  The x-intercept is equal to -1/K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; while the y-intercept is 1/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  The slope of the line is K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  Thus, the plot shows that there is no change in K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is decreased. In relation to the original plot, the x intercept stays constant while the y intercept increases along with the slope.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Thanks for your interest in contributing to [[K-12 School Computer Networking|the book]].  If you are enrolled in Dr. Terrill's Telecommunications, Distance Learning, and Collaborative Interchange course, please use the guidelines on this page to help you submit your Wikibooks assignment.  All other contributors, please feel free to contribute to this on-going project.  The developers only ask that you keep with the conventions established throughout this work and use appropriate discretion when editing others' work.

==Getting Started==

Before the specifics, it's important to go over a little Wikibooks introductory information.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikibooks This article] provides some of that background information.  In short, Wikibooks is a site very much like its sister project, Wikipedia, except that Wikibooks is designed to host (you guessed it) books.  As this site consists of 100% open-content, you should always remember to site all your sources, link to (rather than post directly) content that you suspect is copyrighted, and take care not to otherwise infringe on people's copyrighted information.  

To help you with this effort, Wikibooks has a network of volunteer experts called administrators.  A couple of them are [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] and [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]].  If you have questions, contacting these admins or [[User:PbakerODU|Pete]] is a great way to get them answered in a timely (and usually accurate) fashion.

The next step toward getting started in Wikibooks might be signing up for a free Wikibooks account.  This gives you a username and allows people like administrators and Dr. Terrill to track you according to a username you devise rather than your computer's IP address (a long series of numbers attached to every computer).

'''How to create a free Wikibooks account'''

&lt;li&gt;	Go to the website: www.wikibooks.org 
&lt;li&gt;	Click on “English.”
&lt;li&gt;	Click on “Log in / Create an account” in the top right hand corner.
&lt;li&gt;	Click on “create an account” in the Log In box.
&lt;li&gt;	Follow the directions to create an account.
&lt;li&gt;	Now you have a username and password. 
&lt;li&gt;	Every time you visit Wikibooks, MAKE SURE YOU LOG IN.
&lt;li&gt;    You'll know that you are logged in if your username appears in the top right corner of the screen where &quot;Log in / Create an account&quot; used to appear.

You might have noticed that there are a few tabs at the top of each Wikibooks page.  Explanations of these pages are below.

== Types of Pages in the Wikibook ==

'''Module'''

The module pages are the main content pages of the book. To contribute to or edit a module page click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top of the window, make your changes, and save the page. Make sure you are signed in to Wikibooks whenever you do this.

'''Discussion'''

The discussion pages are where we &quot;discuss&quot; the content located on the module pages. To get to the discussion page click on the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top of the window. Once you are on the dicussion page, you can contribute to or edit it by clicking on the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab, making changes, and saving it. Again, make sure you are signed in to Wikibooks whenever you do this.

'''Edit this Page'''

Clicking &quot;edit this page&quot; allows you to make additions and edits to whatever page you are currently viewing. When you click on it a window of text will appear. Scroll down to find the spot where you want to add or change something, make your change, and click &quot;Save&quot;. Make sure you are signed in to Wikibooks whenever you do this.  Additionally, you can use the &quot;edit this page&quot; function to figure out how any contributor got a module page to look a certain way.  Clicking &quot;edit this page&quot; will display all the Wiki code an author employed to get a page to look a particular way.  At the top of each editing window, you'll see a small tool bar that will allow you to format text, create links and perform other tasks.

'''History'''

The history page allows you to see which users have made contributions to the page you are reading and what was involved in each contribution. Every time a user makes a change and saves it, it is recorded in the history. You can follow the directions on the history page to compare various versions of the page.  The history function allows all pages against undesirable edits or vandalism (which occurs ''very'' rarely).  Since each version of each page is saved indefinitely, it just takes a click or two to restore any article to a previous edition.

==Dr. Terrill's Expectations==

Before we get into your articles, it is important for you to know what Dr. Terrill is expecting out of your articles.  You can find some information on this topic in our Blackboard site within the Course Introduction document.  As always, contact Dr. Terrill or [[User:PbakerODU|Pete]] ([[User talk:PbakerODU|talk]]) 02:26, 3 December 2008 (UTC) with any questions.

==Posting An Article==

Now that you know all about Wikibooks and have your very own account (you're logged in, right?), you can begin thinking about your Wikibooks article.  Dr. Terrill has generously allowed each of you to come up with any topic at all dealing with the Chapter 25 topic--Distance Learning.  Some of you have already posted your topics on this Chapter's module page.  Good work.  The next step is turning this topic into a real &quot;page&quot; where you can actually post content.  

To do this, just go to [[K-12 School Computer Networking/Chapter 25|Chapter 25's module page]] and follow the example set by Ted Barco.  You'll see that his link begins with two open-brackets &lt;nowiki&gt;[[, then includes &quot;K-12 School Computer Networking&quot; followed by a slash /, then the chapter number, then Ted's topic--&quot;Developing Faculty in the Information Age: Insights from Academia&quot;, then a vertical line | (everything that appears after the vertical line will appear, while that preceding the vertical line remains invisible), then the complete title that viewers will see--&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Developing Faculty in the Information Age: Insights from Academia -- Ted Barco''', &lt;nowiki&gt;and finally two close-brackets ]].  

The final product you'll see on the editing page before you click &quot;Save page&quot; looks like this [[K-12 School Computer Networking/Chapter 25/Developing Faculty in the Information Age: Insights from Academia|'''Developing Faculty in the Information Age: Insights from Academia -- Ted Barco'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

''Please note'', if you click &quot;edit this page&quot; you'll see &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt; and &lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Using these codes lets me show you how to construct links without actually creating these links.

==Helpful Hints==

'''Formatting Conventions'''

Some of you may not be comfortable writing your articles from scratch here in Wikibooks.  Please be advised that, because Wikibooks code is similar to HTML code, formatting conventions you create in Microsoft Word and other word processing programs may not transfer over to Wikibooks successfully.

'''Open Office'''

Dr. Terrill told me that Open Office (the open-source equivalent to Microsoft's Word program) allows one to save documents directly to a Wiki-friendly format.  I have not personally played with this function yet, but I will as soon as I get to my own machine (where I can download Open Office).  After that, I'll be sure to get you more information on this topic.  For now, you can download Open Office from [http://www.openoffice.org/ openoffice.org].

'''Other Good Things to Check Out'''

I have been working with Wikibooks for a couple of years now, and during that time I've helped to develop a few textbooks written by undergrads at [http://www.odu.edu '''Old Dominion University'''].  You can check these books out at the links below:

[[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education|Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]]

[[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment|Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]]

'''Featured Books'''

Besides these books, there are a number of great Wikibooks that you can use for inspiration.  Find out all about lots of these at the [[Wikibooks:Featured books|Featured Books]] page.</text>

      <comment>/* Interspecies Relations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The story that centers on aliens has long been a staple of science fiction. Perhaps the most famous and earliest work in this subgenre was H. G. Wells' 1898 novel ''War of the Worlds'' where invaders from Mars ravage the British countryside for a good time. After invading our humble world, many aliens want to occupy and rule it, usually to strip Earth's resources. Apparently, we aren't doing that fast enough. Sometimes aliens are not portrayed as hostile, but simply different. These aliens, whether individuals or societies, grok that it's better to get along with us Earthlings, and often enlighten, or advance us in our development. Another alien subgenre of science fiction spends little time revealing the aliens to us, but instead focuses on our reaction to learning &quot;We are not alone.&quot; The changes we as individuals or as a society undergo forms the basis of the story. Think of Spielberg's movie: ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''. This subgenre is called the First Contact story. The one final subgenre for the alien tale is the Interspecies Relations story. Sometimes aliens interact with humankind not to conquer or to benefit us, but rather for mysterious purposes of their own. The catch-all category for this subgenre, when one of the other three don't fit, is the Interspecies Relations subgenre. 

Examples of prominent authors and some of their works in each of these four subgenres of the alien subgenre of science fiction are the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Who goes first? ==

Nowhere in either this page or the wikipedia article seems to indicate which player moves first.  I'm guessing Gold, but it's not clear from this book. --[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] ([[User talk:Irrevenant|talk]]) 09:02, 28 November 2008 (UTC)

Yep, Gold goes first.  [[User:Fritzlein|Fritzlein]] ([[User talk:Fritzlein|talk]]) 15:33, 27 December 2008 (UTC)

== Rule variations ==

I know these are the official rules described here, but we've played it quite a lot with these rules (originally these were tried because someone read the rules too quickly, I assume. Or maybe at that time the rules weren't available, who knows)
* pushing/pulling only takes one move in total, that is, it's in a sense &quot;free&quot; to grab an enemy piece and drag it along or push it out of way
* frozen pieces aren't unfrozen by friendly pieces

These rules work fine too; the consequence of the first change is that the game turns more aggressive and more pieces get dropped. The second one makes it harder to run a rabbit through without clearing a way for it.

Is there a story about how exactly the official rules got fixed? Has there been a lot of playtesting / simulation / revisions?

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; SIZE=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“The fundamental issue is not of new versus old education, but a question of what anything must be to be worthy of the name education.” John Dewey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Introduction==  

In 2004, the US Department of Education polled over 160,000 K-12 students to determine their perspectives relative to their current and anticipated use of technologies in the classroom (USDE, 2004){4-5}.  From the analysis of those student responses a picture of learner expectations emerged that today’s teachers and their enabling staff may be unprepared to meet.

             &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFB5D;border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; SIZE=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Every student would use a small, hand-held wireless computer that is voice activated.  The computer would offer high-speed access to a kid-friendly Internet, populated with websites that are safe,designed specifically for use by students with no pop-up ads.  Using this device, students would complete most of their in-school work and homework, as well as take on-line classes both at school and home.  Students would use the small computer to play mathematics-learning games and read interactive e-textbooks.  In completing their schoolwork, students would work closely and routinely with an intelligence digital tutor and tap a knowledge utility to obtain factual answers to questions they poise.  In their history lessons, students could participate in 3-D virtual reality-based historic reenactments.” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Though K-12 students may have a crystal clear vision of the role of technology in the future, the application of such emerging technologies is neither as linear nor as predictive as one would imagine.  History suggests the role of technology in education may be shaped more by the social and cultural context in which that technology evolves than the technology itself (Nye, 2006){53-57}.  Thus in considering teacher or faculty development, a technical coordinator must not be blinded by a narrow belief in technological determinism as viewed through the eyes of their students.  On the contrary, the aim of faculty development should be to efficiently educate and train today’s teachers such that they can confidently approach tomorrow’s technology in context with the curricula that it supports.  In support of such a broad theme this section explores some basic technological principles; introduces some relevant trends within the field, and finally offers insights from academia that may be helpful for the K-12 technical coordinator charged with aligning technology with teaching and learning.

==Technology as Lever for Distance Learning==

Dr Arthur Chickering, famous for his work in area of student development, proposed seven principles that form a reasonably good foundation from which to build, employ, and, in turn, harmonize technology as a lever for successful integration within a distance learning program (Chickering, 1996){1-2}.  Chickering states good technological practice:

   • encourages contact between teachers and students
   • develops cooperation among students
   • uses active learning techniques
   • gives prompt feedback
   • emphasizes time on task
   • communicates high expectations
   • respects diverse talents and ways of learning

Built upon a broad and clearly defined foundation of good technological practice, derived through benchmarking and alignment to some established standard (state, regional, or national accrediting criteria), a faculty development program can start to envision the unique needs of its constituents.  

== Some General Trends To Consider ==

But given such principles what kind of tomorrow should a faculty developmental program prepare for?  The future is always hard to predict, but at the end of the day those charged with developing faculty have to have a vision and design their programs around that vision or else risk the dilemma Alice faced when chatting with the Cheshire Cat in Alice and Wonderland.

         &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFB5D;border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; SIZE=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alice asked “Which way I ought to go from here?  That depends a good deal on where you want  to get to,” said the Cat.  “I don’t much care where. Then it doesn’t matter which way you go” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Technical coordinators care which way they take their faculty and have to plan for the future based on some shared sense of tomorrow.  Thus one of the early steps in any developmental program is an environmental scan to determine what trends await the faculty and whether developmental changes are required to assure the faculty competencies in place today will meet the anticipated needs of tomorrow.  In 2003, researchers from Brigham Young University (Howell, 2003){1-14} proposed 32 trends that affect distance learning; eight of which are shown below:

   1.  The need for faculty development is growing  
   2.  Instruction is becoming more learning centered, non-linear, and self-directed  
   3.  There is a growing demand for accountability in teaching and learning
   4.  Academic emphasis is shifting from course completion to competency development  
   5.  Technology devices are becoming more universal and ubiquitous  
   6.  Funding challenges are the top IT concern for many schools
   7.  The distinction between distance and local education is disappearing 
   8.  There is an increasing need for strategies that exploit the capabilities of technology

==Insights from Academia==

Understanding future trends, as noted above, is only one component of a much broader and overarching framework required to develop faculty.  Once an environmental scan is conducted a technical coordinator should also consider how any new technology should be employed.  Such alignment is absolutely critical given that history suggests that “faculty development has often adopted a scattershot approach which awarded money to early adopters to pursue their personal technology interests”…even though these programs failed to … “tie faculty development to anything more than general improvements in the use of technology or simply increasing the number of faculty who use technology in instruction” (Agee, 2003){2). So where should the technical coordinator begin? Again academia offers some insights.  1n 1998, George Mason University (GMU) implemented a Technology Across the Curriculum initiative.  This initiative had three major focus areas (Agee, 2000){6}:

  1.	Ensure technology was focused on learning and integrated with the academic content
  2.	Set up a programmatic rather than an episodic approach to technology integration.
  3.	Provide adequate support for students and faculty to use the technology for both problem solving and product creation.

Armed with the vision of these three focus areas, GMU then set about aligning technology and the curricula.  In doing so GMU staffers created 10 technology goals reinforced by supporting skills/competencies that students would need to master within the curricula (Agee, 2000){7}.  The faculty were then charged with aligning their courses with the technology goals and integrating technology into the curricula to facilitate student learning.  GMU’s technology goals are listed below: 

      1. Electronic collaboration	                  6.  Use of databases to manage information
      2. Electronic document creation	                  7.  Use of e-tools to analyze data
      3. Electronic presentation	                  8.  Use of geographic information systems to handle data
      4. Use of e-tools for research and evaluation	  9.  Familiarity with legal, ethical, and security issues
      5.  Use of spreadsheets to manage information	  10.  Working knowledge of IT platforms

By linking technology to the curriculum, GMU was able to design a developmental approach that seamlessly and systematically integrated technology with learning and teaching while providing a roadmap for faculty development.  Although environmental scans and systematic developmental approaches are important, they are but two, though arguably central components, within an overarching framework that the technical coordinator should consider. 

                      Framework For Faculty Development (FD) in an Information Age

  1.	Get leadership buy-in for a systematic FD program. 
  2.	Employ a faculty development specialist either part-time or full-time.
  3.	Determine the sufficiency of investment (time, money, manpower, technology) in FD.
  4.	Conduct an environmental scan to get a sense of what factors shape your school’s future. 
  5.	Envision and describe the role of technology in the school’s curriculum.
  6.	Conduct a needs assessment to determine the gap between where the curriculum is today and where it needs to be tomorrow     
          relative to technology.
  7.	Craft specific faculty developmental competencies that will help fill the curriculum gap.
  8.	Create faculty training objectives that align to those developmental competencies.
  9.	Establish a long-term faculty development plan that harmonizes the training objectives not only with the curricula but also 
          with manpower, money, equipment, facilities, and culture
 10.	Get leadership and faculty buy-in to the overall plan and execute 

Within such a framework, another key to implementing FD learning solutions is differentiating between when objectives (step 8) require training solutions and educational solutions to achieve the required competencies; training and education are not the same

                  &lt;u&gt;Training&lt;/u&gt;                                         &lt;u&gt; Education&lt;/u&gt;

            -- Applied knowledge and proficiency               -- Search for understanding
               developed through experience and practice          --- Often no approved solution
               -- Reproduce exactly what was taught            -- Shapes what you think and feel
               -- Right or wrong                                  -- Degrees of interpretation
            -- Applied learning without variation                 -- Allows generalization beyond what was taught
            -- Instructor as the director                      -- Instructor as a guide


Most new developmental programs will require awareness and education, followed later by specific training on e-learning tools that are relevant to an instructor or an emerging course.  A short list of some of those e-learning tools currently in use by category is shown below (Lee, 2006) {22-23}

       &lt;u&gt;One to One&lt;/u&gt;                                 &lt;u&gt;One to Many&lt;/u&gt;                            &lt;u&gt;Many to Many&lt;/u&gt;

       E-mail                                      Static web pages                       Content Management System
       
       Instant messaging                           Dynamic content web pages              News server

       Voice over IP                               RSS                                    Forum discussions

       Friend of a Friend (FOAF)                   Blogs                                  Chat

                                                   Podcast                                Games
                     
                                                   E-portfolio                            Wikis

From an education perspective it may make sense to expose faculty to such a wide variety of tools and their potential, but it would not makes sense to attempt to train faculty on any such tool that is not relevant to the curriculum or the student it supports.  GMU’s program succeeded because it harmonized education and training directly to the curricula, the learning needs of the students, the hiring interests of their potential employers, and, in turn, the teaching needs of the faculty.  Many others schools, colleges and universities have faculty development programs that are similarly finding their future in an information age.  Whatever combination of education and training is used to develop the faculty, it would benefit the technical coordinator to learn the contextual lessons from others in the field such as Virginia Tech (VT) whose Faculty Development Institute (FDI) is widely recognized as a benchmark.  Below find five lessons learned from FDI (Moore, 2003){5}that are relevant to technical coordinators today.

  -- Faculty don’t care about technology for its own sake…it must provide some benefit to the learning environment.
  -- Faculty must be trained to integrate new technology…training must be ongoing and specifically designed for their campus.
  -- Faculty must have access to sufficient technical support staff.
  -- Faculty must have sufficient time and funding to risk integrating technology in their courses.
  -- Faculty must have strong endorsement from their departments to pursue technology integration.

In considering such lessons researchers from the University of North Carolina (UNC) add that most instructors have “little time to devote to developing new teaching strategies” associated with distance learning” (Henshaw, 2003){184}.  Further their research suggests that successful implementation of computer based teaching strategies is “more likely to occur iteratively over a number of semesters.”  Consistent with the finding of iterative learning, UNC set up a three tract program to systematically develop faculty to use and be better stewards of technology (Henshaw, 2003){185}.  

   -- Tract One:    Introducing Instructional Technology in a Course  
   -- Tract Two:    Enhancing the Use of Instructional Technology in a Course 
   -- Tract Three:  Applying Advanced or Emergent Instructional Technologies

The UNC and GMU programs reinforces the premise that context matters and, as such, large infusions of money tied to quick training technology-based learning solutions will not guarantee results and, in many cases, may simply exacerbate the underlying developmental problem.  Armed with some basic principles, a general sense of the future, a realistic sense of timing, an implementation framework and an approach that aligns technology with the curriculum, and informed by some simple lessons a technical coordinator can begin to design a faculty development program efficient and impactful.

==Conclusion==

This section laid out a framework for faculty development that was built upon seven pedagogical principles that provide focus for those charged with coordinating the digital landscape of tomorrow. Upon those principles, trends were presented followed by a 10 part faculty development framework that may help shape and support systematic faculty development efforts going forward.  That framework is, in turn, continuously informed by lessons learned from those who have previously worked in the field to include faculty and staff at GMU, VT, and UNC.  In the end, technology offers an institution another thread, tool or technique that contributes to more meaningful and “connected” learning; a long established ideal once entrusted to Anglican administrators of yesterday, but passed through time to the technical coordinators of today, who in collaboration with their faculty developers, will shape how we teach and learn tomorrow.

=== Summary of grammar topics ===
A summary of the grammar topics discussed in the podcast. But:
*Readers would still have to listen to the podcast for the actual explanations.
*Many grammar features are already summarized by the vocabulary lists.
*Some grammar topics are mentioned in the lesson index. 
*Specifying grammar topics will often use vocabulary which is challenging for readers. Thus this summary might do more harm than good.

=== More images and links ===
More images and more links to Wikipedia.
*Makes sense on some pages, on others there is a problem with the layout.
*Links to Wiktionary.
*Every Spanish word could be hyperlinked to the entry in the Wiktionary; thus, the layout wouldn't change at all. 
*Makes a lot of sense to me. 
*But this will take some time. Currently my priority are additional lessons.

=== Grammar overview ===
A grammar overview about regular, irregular, and reflexive verb conjugation in present tense and imperative; personal pronouns (subject, direct object, indirect object, reflexive) 
*Makes a lot of sense but it would be best to include example lines from the dialogues and link to the specific lessons; thus, it might be better to wait until more lessons are included
*This grammar overview should also include very basic topics such as gender and number of nouns, articles, and adjectives. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:05, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

=== Common phrases ===
A page with very common phrases
*How should this be organized? There are probably not enough suitable lines to fill a reasonable large hierarchy of topics.
*Should anything be explained on this page? Or should the page just link to the lessons? In this case: shouldn't this functionality be offered by the table of contents sorted by &quot;main topic&quot;? If there are explanations: how would they differ from the ones on the lesson page? 
*Another problem is that many of the common phrases are only mentioned by Liliana; thus, additional audio clips would be necessary. But then the whole structure would be less clear. 
*Let's give up the idea of a page with common phrases. The dialogue index and the lesson index sorted by &quot;main topic&quot; cover most of the offered functionality. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:05, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

=== Forums ===
A forum page for discussions and comments by readers for each lesson
*The usual &quot;discussion&quot; page is for discussions of co-authors, it's not a very good place for discussions of readers. (Of course, there is some overlap.)
*This appears to be a very good idea (although I'm not sure whether or when readers will actually use it).--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:20, 14 November 2008 (UTC)
*Done.--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 20:30, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

=== Dialogue index ===
A index of dialogue lines: audio player, Spanish text (collapsible), English translation (collapsible), link to lesson (maybe number of words, number of line)
*Could be used to test listening and translating from Spanish to English and vice versa, in particular for non-newbies users
*Helps readers to find lessons with new vocabulary/idioms/phrases --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 22:20, 16 November 2008 (UTC)
*Done. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 21:57, 17 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

Liliana and JP teach us the basics of flirting — Latino style! Well, or maybe the girl is just practising Spanish... who knows? In any case, our keyword is: '''soltero''' — single (for “dudes”).

{{SbcIntroductionSpanishPod}}
This lesson is full of useful phrases: how to ask for a phone number, how to give one's phone number, how to say that you are going to call, etc. Moreover, Liliana and JP discuss differences between continents and generations with respect to phoning. And all that in just 13 minutes! The keyword had to be a bit shorter than usual: '''móvil''' – mobile.

In this lesson, JP and Liliana teach us how to ask what's wrong, how to express homesickness, how to give an advice, and how to approve of an idea. Well, not all possibilities but enough to get us started. The keyword is '''extraño''' – I miss.

== E-Book Authors ==

Wikibooks isn't the only resource on the web to find high-quality free ebooks. There are dozens of other large sites that offer them, and thousands of personal websites where authors offer up a book or two that they've written personally. Many people write books for a variety of reasons. Some people like to share the knowledge they've gathered. Some people like to help others. Some people are tired of answering questions from, and choose to put all the information in one place to answer all the questions at once. Regardless of the motivation, writing a book can be hard work, and maintaining it over time even more so. Donating  a book you've written to Wikibooks can be a great move for many reasons:

# If your book is already freely available, Wikibooks and the [[GFDL]] license insures that it will always remain free. If your book is not yet free, you should always consider releasing it under a free license so other people can benefit from it.
# Save yourself the bandwidth. Wikibooks servers are free to use and are completely supported by donations to the Wikimedia Foundation.
# Save yourself the trouble. Server configurations hassles? DNS issues? Denial of service attacks? The Wikimedia Foundation employs a number of server technicians and software developers who deal with the technical headaches so you don't have to.
# Wikibooks has hundreds of authors, editors, illustrators, and other contributors who can edit your book and keep it up-to-date. Tired of getting emails from readers with corrections and suggestions? Put it on Wikibooks and let them fix it themselves.
# Wikibooks has print on demand publishing. Put your book on Wikibooks, create a [[Help:Collection]] from it, and have a few copies printed up. 
# Benefit from the Wikimedia Foundations massive integration. Your book can use material from Wikimedia Commons, import content from Wikipedia, and be used in a classroom through Wikiversity. That's just the start!

There are lots of reasons why existing e-books should be donated to Wikibooks, we hope you agree!

== Donating Books ==

If you've decided to donate a book to Wikibooks, you need to satisfy a few conditions first. There are a number of rules, requirements, and policies that must be followed to help keep Wikibooks a valuable high-quality free resource. If you have a book to donate, and need any help with it, you can always ask at the [[WB:RR|Reading Room]]. We also have a comprehensive list of policies on this issue listed at [[WB:DONATE]].

The first step is to make sure your book satisfies [[WB:WIW|Wikibooks inclusion criteria policy]]. Wikibooks is not a general purpose ebook host and books that do not conform to this policy may be deleted from Wikibooks. In short, here is a list of major requirements for books on Wikibooks:

# The book should be non-fiction, and usually should be academic.
# The book should use a '''neutral point of view'''.
# The book should not contain original research on a topic that has not been well-studied.
# The book should be instructional. It should not just be a listing of facts and figures, or a series of unrelated articles.
# Wikibooks is for textbooks, not for dictionaries, news reports, blogs, or other types of media.
# The book should be released under the [[GFDL]].

=== The GFDL and Copyright Issues ===

The biggest hurdle to most donations is copyright issues. Wikibooks and all the books on it are licensed under the GFDL. The GFDL is a copy-left license with two major provisions:

# All authors to the book should be properly attributed.
# All edits to the book must be released under the GFDL also. Therefore, all future versions of the book that are derived from the one on Wikibooks will always be released under the GFDL.

If you are an author of a book and you own the copyright to it, you can grant Wikibooks a license to use the book under the GFDL, and you can also grant other licenses to other people for it as well. As the copyright holder, you can grant as many licenses to use the material as you want. However the version at Wikibooks, and all future revisions of that version, will always be available under the GFDL. If the book is on Wikibooks, you can still host a copy on your own website, and you can print and sell the book too. You can also allow other websites to use your book under a different license too, if you want.

It's important to realize that once you grant Wikibooks a license to use your book under the GFDL, you can not take it back. The license is a contract, and you cannot break the contract unless Wikibooks violates the license in some way. Some authors want to put their book onto Wikibooks for a trial period, and then ask to have it taken down again. This cannot happen, once the book is on Wikibooks, it is there to stay. Be certain you want to donate the book to Wikibooks, because it cannot be undone afterwards.

If you are not the sole author of the book, or if you are not the originator or owner of all images in the book, you cannot donate it to Wikibooks without the permission of all copyright holders.

== Converting to Wikitext ==

Wikibooks uses Wikitext for its content, not LaTeX, or HTML, or DOCBOOK, or any other kind of markup or formatting. The biggest technical challenge to uploading a book to Wikibooks is that the book must be converted to Wikitext first, and then uploaded. This can be very difficult to do by hand, but several users have created tools and bots to help make the work easier. Ask for help at [[WB:TECH]].</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Laryngeal toxicity'''&lt;/big&gt;
*Lower dose to higher volume around larynx appears worse than higher dose just to glottis
*There are no good NTCP studies for larynx. Western Ontario data suggests at most 50 Gy. MSKCC routinely constrains mean to 30-35 Gy (see PMID 17241750 below)
*Laryngeal dose is much less with half-beam IMRT and matched low anterior field with laryngeal block compared with whole-field IMRT. Given this, consideration should be given to matched IMRT field with low anterior field and laryngeal block in appropriate clinical situations


'''''Treatment Toxicity'''''
*'''Western Ontario''' 
**'''2001''' PMID 11801970 -- &quot;Vocal function following radiation for non-laryngeal versus laryngeal tumors of the head and neck.&quot; (Fung K, Laryngoscope. 2001 Nov;111(11 Pt 1):1920-4.)
***Retrospective. 13 patients with early glottic tumors and 17 patients with non-laryngeal tumors evaluated. Vocal function assessed with acoustic analysis, aerodynamic measurements, and videostroboscopy. Voice Handicap Index self-assessment. Mean dose laryngeal group 61 Gy vs. non-laryngeal group 50 Gy
***Outcome: Non-laryngeal group had worse outcome in all measures
***Conclusion: Patients treated with wide-field RT for non-laryngeal tumors have significantly worse vocal function (subjective and objective) compared with early glottic cancer patients
**'''2001''' PMID 11771040 -- &quot;Effects of head and neck radiation therapy on vocal function.&quot; (Fung K, J Otolaryngol. 2001 Jun;30(3):133-9.)
***Retrospective. 30 patients, normal larynx, incidental RT, and NED &gt;1 year. Videostroboscopic, aerodynamic, and acoustic analyses. Voice Handicap Index self-assessment. Comparison to age- and gender- matched controls
***Outcome: Significant difference in many parameters. Voice acoustics worse at 50 Gy. Significant voice handicap in 27%. Younger patients greater handicap. Voice quality worsened with time.
***Conclusion: Significant objective and subjective changes in vocal function in normal larynx with &quot;incidental&quot; irradiation


'''''Treatment Planning'''''
*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering; 2007''' PMID 17241750 -- &quot;Choosing an intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique in the treatment of head-and-neck cancer.&quot; (Lee N, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Aug 1;68(5):1299-309. Epub 2007 Jan 22.)
**Planning comparison. 6 common H&amp;N cases (nasopharynx, base of tongue, tonsil, supraglottic, hypopharynx, unknown primary). Extended whole-field IMRT (EWF-IMRT) vs split field IMRT with low anterior field (SF-IMRT)
**Outcome: Target coverage comparable. Organs at risk comparable, except larynx if target volumes were not close
**Conclusion: Different approach suggested based on clinical scenario. Typically, split-field IMRT for nasopharynx and oropharynx. If glottic larynx is a target (larynx, hypopharynx, and unknown primary), or if gross disease extends inferiorly close to glottic larynx, prefer whole-field IMRT

*'''MD Anderson; 2005''' PMID 15978743 -- &quot;Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of cancers of the head and neck: comparison of split-field and whole-field techniques.&quot; (Dabaja B, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Nov 15;63(4):1000-5. Epub 2005 Jun 22.)
**Planning comparison. 13 patients with early-stage oropharynx. Whole-field IMRT (WF-IMRT) compared with half-beam IMRT matched to anterior beam (HB-IMRT). Planning per RTOG 0022
**Outcome: PTV coverage comparable. Mean dose to OAR comparable, except larynx (WF-IMRT 47 Gy vs. HB-IMRT 18.7 Gy)
**Conclusion: Acceptable plans with either approach. WF-IMRT has advantage if uncertainty about match line is a concern. HB-IMRT can achieve much lower larynx doses

*'''University of Florida; 2004''' PMID 14999801 -- &quot;Unnecessary laryngeal irradiation in the IMRT era.&quot; (Amdur RJ, Head Neck. 2004 Mar;26(3):257-63; discussion 263-4.)
**Review. IMRT dose much higher with IMRT than standard anterior low-neck field
**Conclusion: Lateral opposed fields should not be extended to include larynx to avoid matching fields through lymphadenopathy. IMRT fields should not include normal larynx when laryngeal dose would be substantially lower with shielded anterior low-neck field</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General information ==
Cofactors, mostly metal ions or coenzymes, are inorganic and organic chemicals that assist enzymes during the catalysis of reactions. Coenzymes are non-protein organic molecules that are mostly derivatives of vitamins soluble in water by phosphorylation; they bind [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Apoenzyme and Holoenzyme|apoenzyme]] to proteins to produce an active [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Apoenzyme and Holoenzyme|holoenzyme]]. Apoenzymes are enzymes that lack their necessary cofactor(s) for proper functioning; the binding of the enzyme to a coenzyme forms a holoenzyme. Holoenzymes are the active form of an apoenzyme.[[Image:Human_xylulose_reductase_holoenzyme.png|thumb|holoenzyme|200px]]

[[Image:PDB_1y6i_EBI.jpg|thumb|cofactor|200px]]
'''Cofactors''' can be '''metals''' or '''coenzymes''', and their primary function is to assist in enzyme activity. They are able to assist in performing certain, necessary, reactions the enzyme cannot perform alone. They are divided into coenzymes and [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Prosthetic Group|prosthetic groups]]. A '''holoenzyme''' refers to a catalytically active enzyme that consists of both '''apoenzyme''' (enzyme without its cofactor(s)) and cofactor. There are two groups of cofactors: metals and small organic molecules called coenzymes.  Coenzymes are small organic molecules usually obtained from vitamins.  '''Prosthetic groups''' refer to tightly bound coenzymes, while '''cosubstrates''' refer to loosely bound coenzymes that are released in the same way as substrates and products. Loosely bound coenzymes differ from substrates in that the same coenzymes may be used by different enzymes in order to bring about proper enzyme activity.

Enzymes without their necessary cofactors are called apoenzymes, which are the inactive form of an enzyme. Cofactors with an apoenzyme are called a holoenzyme, which is the active form.


'''General formula''' 

[[Image:Enzymes.JPG]]

==Metal cofactors==
Metal ions are known as the common cofactors. In some enzymes, the function as a catalyst cannot be carried out if a metal ion is not available to be bound the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]]. In daily nutrition, this kind of cofactor plays a role as the essential trace elements such as: iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), cobalt (Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), copper (Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), zinc (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), selenium (Se&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), and molybdenum (Mo&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;). For example, Mg2 is used in glycolysis. In the first step of converting glucose to glucose 6-phosphate, before ATP is used to give ADP and one phosphate group, ATP is bonded to Mg2 which stabilizing the other two phosphate groups so it is easier to release only one phosphate group without resonate with other two.  In some bacteria such as genus Azotobacter and Pyrococcus furiosus, metal cofactors are also discovered to play an important role. An example of cofactors in action is the zinc-mediated function of carbonic anhydrase or the magnesium-mediated function of restriction endonuclease.

==Coenzyme==
A coenzyme is a small, organic, non-protein molecules that carries chemical groups between enzymes. It is the cofactor for the enzyme and does not form a permanent part in the enzyme's structure. Sometimes, they are called cosubstrates and are considered substrates that are loosely bound to the enzyme.  In metabolism, coenzymes play a role in group-transfer reactions, such as ATP and coenzyme A, and oxidation-reduction reactions, such as NAD+ and coenzyme Q10. Coenzymes are frequently consumed and recycled. Chemical groups are added and detached continuously by an enzyme. ATP synthase enzyme phosphorylates and converts the ADP to ATP, while Kinase dephosphorylates the ATP back to ADP at continuous rates as well. Coenzyme molecules are mostly derived from vitamins. They are also commonly made from nucleotides such as adenosine triphosphate and coenzyme A.

Through further research in coenzyme activity and its binding effect on the enzyme, more can be revealed about how the enzyme changes conformationally and functionally. An example is of the MAPEG group of integral membrane enzymes. These enzymes are crucial in the catalytic transformation of lipophilic substrates, which are involved in arachidonic acid derived messengers production and xenobiotic detoxification. Through use of a bound detergent to mimic a MAPEG enzyme's cofactor, glutathione, a new active site specific for lipophilic substrate is revealed; thus, further studies can reveal how these substrates bind to this second form of the enzyme &lt;ref&gt; von Heijne G, Douglas R: Membranes:reading between the lines. Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2008, 18:403-405&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Important Coenzymes==

=== NADH === 
[[Image: NAD+ phys.svg|250px|'''NAD''']]

nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is a coenzyme derived from vitamin B3. NAD+ is capable of carrying and transferring electrons and functions as oxidizing agent in redox reactions. It also works as a substrate for DNA ligases in posttranslational modification, where the reaction removes acetyl groups from proteins. Furthermore, in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, NAD+ oxidizes glucose and releases energy, which is then transferred to NAD+ by reduction to NADH. NADH later on unloads the extra electron through oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP, which is the energy source humans use every day. In addition to catabolic reactions, NADH is also involved in anabolic reactions such as gluconeogenesis, and it also aids in the production of neurotransmitters in the brain. 
=== FADH === 
[[Image: flavin adenine dinucleotide.png|250px|'''FAD''']]

flavin adenine dinucleotide is a prosthetic group that, like NADH, functions as a reducing agent in cellular respiration and donates electrons to the electron transport chain. 
===Quinone===

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:orthobenzoquinone.svg|1,2-Benzoquinone
Image:P-Benzochinon.svg|1,4-Benzoquinone
Image:Anthraquinone acsv.svg|Anthraquinone
&lt;/gallery&gt;

compounds that have fully conjugated aromatic rings to which two oxygen atoms are bounded as carbonyl groups (i.e. diketones). Quinone’s structure gives them the ability to form substances with colors. They exist as pigments in bacteria, fungi, and certain plants, and give them their characteristic colors. In addition, they are used to manufacture different color dyes for industrial purposes. In biological systems, they serve as electron acceptors (oxidizing agents) in electron transport chains such as those in photosynthesis and aerobic respiration. Many natural or synthetic quinines show biological or pharmacological activities, and some event show antitumoral activities.

===CoA===
[[Image: Coenzym A.svg|250px|'''FAD''']]

coenzyme A, synthesized from pantothenic acid ATP, functions as acyl group carriers to transport functional groups such as acetyl (acetyl-CoA) or thioesters in metabolic reactions like fatty acid oxidation (synthesis of fatty acids) and citric acid cycle (cellular respiration). It also transfers fatty acids from cytoplasm to mitochondria. In addition to its transporter role in metabolism, CoA is also an important molecule in itself. For instance, CoA is an important precursor to HMG-CoA, an important enzyme in the metabolic synthesis of cholesterol and ketones. Furthermore, it contributes the acetyl group to the structure of acetylcholine, which is an important neurotransmitter responsible for inducing muscle contraction.

==Common Coenzymes==
===Vitamin A===
Vitamin A is subdivided into two molecules, Vitamin A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (retinol) and Vitamin A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (dehydroretinol). Retinol is the most active and common form.  Vitamin A has a large conjugated chain which serves as the reactive site of the molecule. Unlike most cofactors, Vitamin A undergoes a sequence of chemical changes (oxidations, reductions, and isomerizations) before returning to its original form. The ability for Vitamin A's electrons to travel from &amp;pi to &amp;pi* orbital makes it a good candidate molecule for trapping light energy. Consequently, Vitamin A is responsible for transferring light energy to a chemical nerve impulse in the eyeball. Vitamin A is also used for growing healthy new cells such as skin, bones, and hair. It maintains the lining of the urinary tract, intestinal tract, and respiratory system. Additionally, Vitamin A is required for the reproductive functions such as the growth and development of sperm and ovaries.

===Vitamin C===
Also known as absorbic acid, it Vitamin C is quite abundant in most plants and animals excluding primates, guinea pigs, bats, and some birds.  Despite human's inability to synthesis absorbic acid, it is an essential in many biosynthetic pathways such as synthesizing collagen. Deficiency leads to a disease called ''Scurvy''. Vitamin C helps regulate the immune system and relieve pain caused by tired muscles. It also is needed in the manufacture of collagen and norepinephrine. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant which can enhance the immune system by stimulating white blood cells in the body. Vitamin C also helps to benefit the skin, teeth, and bones.

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
[[Image:Vitamin_b1.JPG|thumb|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|100px]]
Also named ''Thiamine'' or Thiamine diphosphate (TPP), Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a cofactor for oxidative decarboxylation both in the Kreb's Cycle and in converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (an important molecule used in the citric acid cycle of metabolism). It is widely available in the human diet and particularly potent in wheat germ and yeast. It's functionality results from a thiazole ring which stabilizes charge and electron transfer through resonance.

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
[[Image:Vitamin_b2.JPG|thumb|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|100px]]
Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is known as riboflavin. Vitamin B2 is the precursor of Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) which are coenzymes used to oxidized substrates. FAD contains riboflavin and adenine. FMN contains riboflavin that is why it is called mononucleotide. 

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;===
[[Image:Vitamin_b3.jpg|thumb|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|100px]]
Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is Niacin or nicotinic acid with the formula C5H4NCO2H. Vitamin B3 is a precursor to NADH, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADPH which are coenzymes found in all living cells. NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are oxidizing agents. NADH and NADPH are reducing agents.

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;===
[[Image:Pyridoxal_phosphate-b6.JPG‎|thumb|Pyridoxal_phosphate|100px]]
Vitamin B6 is precursor to coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) which is required in certain transformation of amino acids including transamination, deamination, and decarboxylation. 

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;===
[[Image:Vitamin_b12.JPG|thumb|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;|100px]]
Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the name for a class of related compounds that have this vitamin activity. These compounds contain the rare element cobalt. Humans can not synthesis B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and must obtain it from diet. Enzymes that catalyze certain rearrangement reaction required B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; or its derivatives.

===Vitamin H===
Also named ''Biotin'', Vitamin H is a carboxyl carrier; it binds CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and carries it until the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is donated in carboxylase reactions.  It is water soluble and important in the metabolism of fatty acids and the amino acid Leucine. Deficiency leads to dermatitis and hair loss, thus making it a popular ingredient in cosmetics.

===Vitamin K===
[[File:Vitamin K1.png|thumb|Vitamin K|100px]]
Vitamin K is needed for the process of clotting of blood and Ca&lt;small&gt;2+&lt;/small&gt; binding. Vitamin K can be synthesized by bacteria in the intestines. Vitamin K is needed for catalyzing the carboxylation of the γ-carbon of the glutamate side chain in proteins.

==Non-enzymatic cofactors==

Cofactor is also used widely in the biological field to refer to molecules that either activate, inhibit or are required for the protein to function. For example, ligands such as hormones that bind to and activate receptor proteins are termed cofactors or coactivators, while molecules that inhibit receptor proteins are termed corepressors.

The coactivator can enhance transcription initiation by stabilizing the formation of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme enabling faster clearance of the promoter.

The corepressor can repress transcriptional initiation by recruiting histone deacetylases which catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues. This increases the positive charge on histones which strengthens in the interaction between the histones and DNA, making the latter less accessible to transcription.

      <comment>/* Temeperature affect on catalytic activity of enzymes */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Enzymes are macromolecules that help accelerate (catalyze) chemical reactions in biological systems. This is usually done by accelerating reactions by lowering the transition state or decreasing the activation energy.

[[File:Enzyme decreases the activation energy.png|thumb|Enzyme decreases activation energy]]

Some biological reactions in the absence of enzymes may be as much as a million times slower.  Virtually all enzymes are proteins, though the converse is not true and other molecules such as RNA can also catalyze reactions. The most remarkable characteristics of enzymes are their ability to accelerate chemical reactions and their specificity for a particular substrate. Enzymes take advantage of the full range of intermolecular forces ([[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Van der Waals interaction|van der waals interactions]], polar interactions, [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic interactions]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]]) to bring substrates together in most optimal orientation so that reaction will occur. Also, enzymes can be inhibited by specific molecules by called competitive, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive inhibitors.  

Catalysis happens at the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|'''active site''']] of the enzyme. It contains the residues that directly participate in the making and breaking of bonds. These residues are called the catalytic groups. Although enzymes differ widely in structure, specificity, and mode of catalysis a number of generalizations concerning their [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]]s can be made:

'''1.''' The [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]] is a three dimensional cleft or crevice formed by groups that come from different parts of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] sequence - residues far apart in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] sequence may interact more strongly than adjacent residues in the sequence.

'''2.''' The [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]] takes up a relatively small part of the total volume of an enzyme. Most of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] residues in an enzyme are not in contact with the substrate, which raises the question of why enzymes are so big. Nearly all enzymes are made up of more than 100 [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] residues. The &quot;extra&quot; [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] serve as a scaffold to create the three dimensional [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]] from the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] that are far apart in the primary structure. In many proteins the remaining [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] also constitute regulatory sites, sites of interaction with other proteins, or channels to bring the substrate to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]]s.

'''3.''' [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|Active site]]s are unique microenvironments. In all enzymes of known structure, substrate molecules are bound to a cleft or crevice. Water is usually excluded unless it is a reactant. The nonpolar microenvironment of the cleft enhances the binding of substrates as well as catalysis. Nevertheless, the cleft may also contain polar residues. Certain of these polar residues acquire special properties essential for substrate binding or catalyis. 

'''4.''' Substrates are bound to enzymes by multiple weak interactions. Stated above

'''5.''' The specificity of binding depends on the precise defined arrangement of atoms in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]]. Because the enzyme and the substrate interact by means of short-range forces that require close contact, a substrate must have a matching shape to fit into the site. However, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]] of some enzymes assume a shape that is complementary to that of the substrate only after the substrate is bound. This process of dynamic recognition is called induced fit. 

Enzymes are highly specific and may require cofactors for catalysis. A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound bound to a protein; there are 2 types of cofactors: Metals and organic/metalloorganic (which are derived from vitamins). An example of a metal cofactor is zinc and the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, tightly binds the zinc at the active site. The process involves binding water to carbon dioxide and deprotonating it into carbonic acid. Then the carbonic acid becomes a bicarbonate ion due to the displacement of water.

Catalysts can fasten the reaction speed by lowering the activation energy (not the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]]) of the process. The [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]] is a location on the enzyme which has complementary shape to the substrate. It is also where the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] with a complementary charge, polarity and shape to the ligand are.

The enzyme function and catalysis result from the ability to stabilize the '''[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]]''' in a chemical reaction.  The [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]] is the highest energy species in a reaction. It is a transitory molecular structure that is no longer the substrate but is not yet the product. It is the most seldom occupied species along the reaction pathway. The difference in free energy between the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]] and the substrate is called the Gibbs free energy of activation or simply the activation energy. 

Thus we can see the key to how enzymes operate: Enzymes accelerate reactions by decreasing the activation energy. The combination of substrate and enzyme creates a reaction pathway whose [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]] is lower than that of the reaction in the absence of the enzyme. Because the activation energy is lower more substrate molecules have the energy required to reach the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]].  

It is important to note that enzymes have evolved specifically to recognize the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition states]] of chemical reactions. Therefore, enzymes do not bind to any reactive species before the species have actually begun to react; enzymes only recognize and bind the ''[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition states]]'' of such species. In fact, if enzymes were to bind to the reactants of a reaction &quot;on sight&quot;, or immediately, this would result in an even higher activation energy than before! For this reason, enzymes recognize only the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]] and bind to reactive species only when this high-energy state has been achieved. The fact that enzymes can recognize structures as specific and short-lived as [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition states]] is a testament to their incredible specificity and efficiency.
 
Each enzyme is optimized for a particular reaction [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]]. This ensures that enzymes will not compete with each other and hinder cellular reactions instead of help them. Enzyme inhibition occurs when the activity of a given enzyme is disrupted or interrupted in some fashion. Inhibitors can be molecules that have a similar shape, structure, or charge to the substrate in question so that the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]] of an enzyme will &quot;mistake&quot; the inhibitor for the substrate. This affects the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate, as well as the rate of the overall reaction. Several types of inhibition can occur in the cell; more detailed explanations on these can be found in the corresponding sections. 

Because of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]]s, enzymes are highly specific catalysts. These catalysts are governed by the ability to lower the free energy of thermodynamics to overcome [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition states]]. The Michaelis-Menten Model describes the kinetic properties of many enzymes.

The interaction between the substrate and the enzyme helps accelerate the reaction, and the specificity of enzymes result in minimal side reactions.

It is of great importance to note that an enzyme cannot alter the laws of thermodynamics and consequently cannot alter the equilibrium of the reaction. The amount of product formed for a reaction utilizing an enzyme is always equal to the amount of product form of the same reaction occurring in the same reaction mixture without the enzyme. The enzyme just allows the reaction to reach its equilibrium faster. The equilibrium position is a function only of the free-energy difference between reactants and products.

6. Enzymes only alter reaction rate, not the reaction equilibrium.
Enzyme cannot alter the laws of thermodynamics; therefore, it cannot alter the equilibrium of a chemical reaction.
Enzyme is present, the amount of products form faster compared with enzyme is absent. 
Enzyme is only accelerating the reaction rate, not shipping the position of equilibrium (free energy, delta G)

==Lock and Key Model==
The &quot;lock and key&quot; model was first proposed by an organic chemist named Emil Fischer in 1894. In this model, the &quot;lock&quot; refers to an enzyme and the &quot;key&quot; refers to its complementary substrate. Each enzyme has a highly specific geometric shape that is complementary to its substrate. In order to activate an enzyme, its substrate must first bind to the active site on the enzyme. Only then will a catalytic reaction take place. However, like a lock and a key, the enzyme and substrate shape must be complementary and fit perfectly. Designed by evolution the active site for enzymes is generally highly specific in its substrate recognition and has the ability to distinguish between stereoisomers.

[[File:Lock and key model.png]]

==Induced Fit==
According to the Lock and Key Model, the geometric shape of both enzymes and substrates can not be changed as they are both predetermined. Thus, the binding of the substrate to the enzymes active site does not alter the shape of the enzyme. While this theory helped explain the specificity of the enzyme, it does not explain the stability of the transition state for it would require more energy to reach the transition state complex. Thus the induced fit model was proposed in which enzymes like proteins are flexible. The concept of induced fit is that when a substrate binds to the active site of an enzyme, there is a conformational change and structural adaptation that makes this binding site more complementary and tighter. In essence the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site but instead the macromolecules, weak interaction forces, and hydrophobic characteristics on the enzyme surface mold into a precise formation so that there is an induced fit where the enzyme can perform maximum catalytic function.
[[File:Induced fit diagram.svg]]

==Transition State Theory==
[[Image:Enzyme catalysis delta delta G.png|thumb|250px|right|Stabilization of the transition state by an enzyme.]]
Transition state theory states that in an enzyme catalysis, the enzyme binds more strongly to its &quot;transition state complex rather than its ground state reactants.&quot; In essence, the transition state is more stable. The stabilization of the transition state lowers the activation barrier between reactants and products thus increasing the rate of reaction or enzymatic activity as this will favor the increase of formation of the transition state complex.

In the transition state theory, the mechanism of interaction of reactants is irrelevant. However, the colliding molecules that take place in the reaction must have sufficient amount of kinetic energy to overcome the activation energy barrier in order to react. In  many cases, temperature, pH, or enzymes can be changed to facilitate the stabilization of the transition state as well as statistically increasing the probability for molecules colliding and forming the transition state complex. For a bimolecular reaction such as Sn2, a transition state is formed when the two molecules’ old bonds are weakened and new bonds begin to form or the old bonds break first to form the transition state and then the new bonds form after. The theory suggests that as reactant molecules approach each other closely they are momentarily in a less stable state than either the reactants or the products.

==Methods==
#Some catalysts provide a charge to a molecule to make it more attractive to  other reactants. Acids are an example for this kind of catalyst. They give the reacting species a positive charge to attract the negative or partially negative reactant, increasing the chance for the two species to collide and react.
#Some catalysts increase the local concentration of reactants so that they are more likely to collide.
# Some catalysts may modify the shape of one reactant to be more susceptible to other molecule.

==Enzymatic Strategies and Examples==
1. Covalent Catalysis - Through the course of catalysis, a powerful nucleophile is temporarily attached to a part of the substrate.  The nucleophile is contained in the active site.  A proteolytic enzyme chymotrypsin is an excellent example of this strategy. It is a substrate forming a transient covalent bond with residues in the active site or with a cofacter, which adds additional intermediate and reduce the energy of later transition.

2. General Acid/Base Catalysis - Water often acts as a donor or acceptor, but in Acid/base catalysis, the molecule which donates or accepts a proton is NOT water.  This strategy incorporates base and acid catalysis to shorten reaction times. In the case of Chymotrypsin, the enzyme uses a histidine residue as a base catalyst to enhance the nucloephilicity of serine analogous to how histidine residue in carbonic anhydrase facilitates the removal of a proton from a zinc bound water molecule to yield hydroxide.
     
3. Catalysis by approximation - In this method, reactions favored by bring together the two substrates to a single binding surface on enzymes.  The two substrates are brought together to one area and this increases the rate of the reaction. NMP kinase for example, brings tow nucleotides together to improve the transferring of phosphoryl groups.
     
4. Metal Ion Catalysis - Metal ions can be involved as a catalyst in many different ways.  Zinc can help the formation of a nucleophile.  It makes the pka of water change from approximately 14 to 7, which allows it to be protonated at neutral pH.  It can also stabilize negative charges by acting as an electrophile in a complex.  Metal ions are also used to increase the binding energy of substrates, holding them together. A metal ion may also serve as a bridge between the enzyme and substrate acting as a cofactor in cases of NMP kinases.

== Catalytic Mechanisms ==

1. Proteases (chymotrypsin and trypsin): are any enzyme that conducts proteolysis (protein catabolism) by hydrolysis of the peptide bonds lining amino acids together in the polypeptide chain.

Sample Experiment: Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Applying Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) &amp; Oligonucleotide Primers that contains the desired mutation in a newly synthesize strand, engineering a mis-match during first cycle DNA can develop a mutation.

2. Carbonic Anhydrase (metalloenzymes)
These enzymes catalyzes the rapid interconversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate and protons, a reversible reaction that occurs rather slowly in the absence of catalyst.

3. Restriction Endonucleases (BamHI)
It is a restriction enzyme that cleaves double stranded DNA at specific recognition nucleotide sequences (restriction site).

4. Nucleaside Monophosphate Kinases (NMP Kinase)
These enzymes transfer phosphate groups from high energy donor molecule (ATP) to specific substrates (phosphorylation).

== Enzyme's Cofactors for Activity ==
[[Image:Succinate Dehydrogenase 1YQ3 Electron Carriers Labeled.png|thumb|right|300px|The [[succinate dehydrogenase]] complex showing several cofactors, including [[Flavin group|flavin]], [[Iron-sulfur protein|iron-sulfur center]]s and [[heme]].]]

The catalytic activity of enzymes depends on the presence of small molecules called cofactors. The role of the catalytic activity varies with the enzyme and its cofactors. In general, those cofactors can execute chemical reactions which cannot be performed by the standard 20 amino acids. An enzyme without cofactor is called apoenzyme, however the one with completely catalytically active is called holoenzyme.

Cofactors can be divided into two individual groups: Metal and Coenzymes. Metals are important for enzymes because they are molecular assistants that play a vital role in some of the enzymatic reactions that fuel the body metabolism. They also act to stabilize the shapes of enzymes. For example, iron helps the protein hemoglobin transport oxygen to organs in the body and copper helps superoxide dismutase in sopping up dangerous free radicals that accumulate inside the cells. Coenzymes are small organic molecules that often derived from vitamins. Coenzymes can be either tightly or loosely bound to the enzyme. Tightly bound ones are called prosthetic groups, while loosely bound coenzymes are like substrates and products, bind to the enzyme and get released from it. Enzymes that use the same coenzymes often perform catalysis by the similar mechanisms.

The classification of an enzyme is shown within the table as it's class and the type of reduction the enzyme goes through.  An example of a name is glucose phosphotransferase. In this reaction ATP transfers one of its phosphates to glucose: ATP + D-glucose -&gt; ADP + D-glucose 6-phosphate. Since this process &quot;transfers&quot; a phosphate group to glucose, it is within the classification of transferases, hence the name &quot;glucose phosphotransferase.&quot; Since many enzymes have common names that do not refer to their function or what kind of reaction they catalyze, a enzyme classification system was established. There are six classes of enzymes that were created with subclasses based on what they catalyze so that enzymes could easily be named. Depending on the type of reaction catalyzed, an enzyme can have various names. These classes are Oxidoreductases, Transferases, Hydrolases, Lyases, Isomerases, and Ligases. This is the internation classification used for enzymes. For example, a common oxidoreductase is dehydrogenase. Dehydrogenase is known as an enzyme that oxidizes a substrate and transferring protons.  Enzymes are normally used for catalyzing the transfer of functional groups, electrons, or atoms. Since this is the case, they are assigned names by the type of reaction they catalyze. This allowed for the addition of a four-digit number that would precede EC(Enzyme Commission) and each enzyme could be identified. The reaction that an enzyme catalyzes must be know before it can be classified.

Oxidoreductases catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions where electrons are transferred. These electrons are usually in the form of hydride ions or hydrogen atoms. When a substrate is being oxidized it is the hydrogen donor. The most common name used is a dehydrogenase and sometimes reductase will be used. An oxidase is referred to when the oxygen atom is the acceptor.

Transferases catalyze group transfer reactions. The transfer occurs from one molecule that will be the donor to another molecule that will be the acceptor. Most of the time, the donor is a cofactor that is charged with the group about to be transferred.

Hydrolases catalyze reactions that involve hydrolysis. This cases usually involves the transfer of functional groups to water. When the hydrolase acts on amide, glycosyl, peptide, ester, or other bonds, they not only catalyze the hydrolytic removal of a group from the substrate but also a transfer of the group to an acceptor compound. These enzymes could also be classified under transferaes since hydrolysis can be viewed as a transfer of a functional group to water as an acceptor. However, as the acceptor's reaction with water was discovered very early, it's considered the main function of the enzyme which allows it to fall under this classification.

Lyases catalyze reactions where functional groups are added to break double bonds in molecules or the reverse where double bonds are formed by the removal of functional groups.

Isomerases catalyze reactions that transfer functional groups within a molecule so that isomeric forms are produced. These enzymes allow for structural or geometric changes within a compound. Sometime the interconverstion is carried out by an intramolecular oxidoreduction. In this case, one molecule is both the hydrogen acceptor and donor, so there's no oxidized product. The lack of a oxidized product is the reason this enzyme falls under this classification. The subclasses are created under this category by the type of isomerism.

Ligases are used in catalysis where two substrates are litigated and the formation of carbon-carbon, carbon-sulfide, carbon-nitrogen, and carbon-oxygen bonds due to condensation reactions. These reactions are couple to the cleavage of ATP.

== Kinetics ==
The study of the rates of chemical reactions is called kinetics, and the study of the rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions is called enzyme kinetics. A kinetic description of enzyme activity will help us understand how enzymes function. 
For example, the rate V is the quantity of A that disappears in a specified unit of time. It is equal to the rate of the appearance of P, or the quantity of P that appears in a specified unit of time.

A -----&gt; P

The rate V is the quantity of A that disappears in a specified unit of time. It is equal to the rate of the appearance of P, or the quantity of P that appears In a specified unit of time. 

V = ∆A/∆T = ∆P/∆T

If A is yellow and P is colorless, we can follow the decrease in the concentration of A by measuring the decrease in the intensity of yellow color with time. Consider only the change in the concentration of A for now. The rate of the reaction is directly related to the concentration of A by a proportionality constant, k, called the rate constant.

V = k[A]

==The Michaelis-Menten Model==
The Michaelis-Menten model is used to describe the kinetic properties of many enzymes. 
In this model, an enzyme(E)combines with a substrate(S)to form an enzyme-substrate(ES)complex, and proceed to form a product(P)or to dissociate into E and S.

[[File:Michaelis-Menten-Vereinfachung.svg|250px|Michaelis-Menten Vereinfachung]]

The rate of formation of product,V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, can be calculated by the Michaelis-Menten equation:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{v_0} =  \frac{K_M + [S]}{V_\max [S]}  = \frac{K_M}{V_\max} \cdot  \frac{1}{ [S]} + \frac{1}{V_\max}.&lt;/math&gt;

V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the reaction rate when the enzyme is completely saturated with substrate. K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is the Michaelis constant, which is the substrate concentration at the half of the maximum reaction rate. The kinetic constant k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; isa called the turnover number, which is the number of substrate molecules converted into produce per unit time at a single catalytic site when the enzyme is saturated with substrate. It often count for most enzyme between 1 and 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;per second. 

Allosteric enzymes is an important class of enzymes. Its catalytic activity can be regulated. It has multiple active sites which display co-operativity, as evidenced by a sigmoidal dependence of reaction velocity on substrate concentration. We also find that K max is the substrate concentration in which the overall reaction rate at that particular time is half of V max. V max on the other hand, is the maximum reaction rate in which the active site is completely saturated with substrate. As a result of this physical characteristic, we see that no matter how much substrate is consequently added, the relative rate of the reaction remains unchanged as additional substrate do not contribute to any kinetic interaction with binding the active site. The affinity also eventually does not change as more substrate is increased and the reaction goes towards equilibrium.

==Replicative DNA polymerase==
There have been studies of the three multi-subunit DNA polymerase enzymes in the nucleus. This provides insights into the mechanism of the replication machinery in eukaryotic cells. The first DNA polymerase structure to be solved by crystallography was the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. This crystallization revealed a structure that was likened to the palm, fingers, and thumb of a right hand. Studies of the Klenow fragment showed that DNA was bound within the cleft and that the fingers and thumb architecture is conserved in many of the polymerase families. The polymerase active site residues are located in the palm domain. The fingers are important for nucleotide binding, and the thumb domain binds the DNA.

Proofreading removes the mismatched nucleotide and extension continues.]]

'''Conclusion'''
Enzymes speed up the reaction. They can increase the reaction rates by a factor of 10^6 or more. Some of the enzymes require the cofactors for activity. The cofactors include vitamin-derived organic molecules (coenzymes), and metal ions. The enzymes' other tasks include decreasing the free energy of activation of chemical reactions. The first step in catalysis is forming an enzyme substrate complex. Besides, the substrates are recognized by enzymes is accompanied by conformational changes at active sites.

==Temperature affect on catalytic activity of enzymes==
In general as one increases the temperature the catalytic activity of an enzyme increases, which is the classical model and understanding of temperature affect on catalytic activity. Though,  the classical model has been discovered to be a questionable depiction of how temperature really affects the catalytic activity of enzymes. The new model, the equilibrium model, has been studied by Roy M. Daniel and Micahel J. Danson and gives a new understanding of how temperature affects the catalytic activity of enzymes. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Classical Model''' &lt;br /&gt;
The classical model depicts the effects of temperature on an enzyme. Mainly depicts that as one increases temperatures the catalytic rate increases exponentially and the amount of active enzyme will decrease because of denaturization. The classical model does not show if there is an optimal temperature at which, catalytic activity is at the max. &lt;br /&gt;
Equation representing the classical model: Vmax= kcat[E0]e-kinact􏰀t  &lt;br /&gt;
'''Equilibrium Model''' &lt;br /&gt;
In the equilibrium model, it introduces an inactive form of the enzyme that is reversible to be active. The new factor of reversibility between active and inactive form of enzymes is temperature dependent where the amount of enzyme is. 
The equation describing the amount of active enzyme at any point,  [Eact] = ([E0]-[X])/( 1+ Keq)
In this context inactive enzyme does not mean the enzyme is denatured, all it means is that the active site has been changed just enough to the point where the enzyme can not bind to the substrate, hence it is reversible.  &lt;br /&gt;
The model shows a optimal temperature where enzyme activity would be the greatest, which is different from the classical model. It takes into account the variation Vmax with time and temperature and also includes the factor of four parameters; G*cat, G*inact, Heq and Teq. This model is currently used to best describe the evolution of the enzyme’s active site due to temperature and also best explain the effect of temperature on enzymes. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Key difference between the two models''' &lt;br /&gt;
The classical model is temperature dependent and doesn’t depict an optimal temperature for catalytic activity.  &lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Equilibrium model versus Classical Model.jpg|thumb|left|This graph depicts the differences between the two model. The classical model, green, shows that catalytic activity increases exponentially as temperature increases, while the equilibrium model, purple, depicts an optimal temperature where catalytic activity is greatest and temperature as which catalytic activity is very low.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''active site''' is the part of an enzyme that directly binds to a substrate and carries a reaction. It contains '''catalytic groups''' which are amino acids that promote formation and degradation of bonds. By forming and breaking these bonds, enzyme and substrate interaction promotes the formation of the transition state structure. Enzymes help a reaction by stabilizing the transition state intermediate. This is accomplished by lowering the '''energy barrier''' or '''activation energy'''- the energy that is required to promote the formation of transition state intermediate. The three dimensional cleft is formed by the groups that come from different part of the amino acid sequences. The active site is only a small part of the total enzyme volume. It enhances the enzyme to bind to substrate and catalysis by many different weak interactions because of its nonpolar microenvironment. The weak interactions includes the Van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions. The arrangement of atoms in the active site is crucial for binding spectificity. The overall result is the acceleration of the reaction process and increasing the rate of reaction. Furthermore, not only do enzymes contain catalytic abilities, but the active site also carries the recognition of substrate. 

The enzyme active site is the binding site for catalytic and inhibition reactions of enzyme and substrate; structure of active site and its chemical characteristic are of specific for the binding of a particular substrate. The binding of the substrate to the enzyme causes changes in the chemical bonds of the substrate and causes the reactions that lead to the formation of products. The products are released from the enzyme surface to regenerate the enzyme for another reaction cycle.

==Structure==

The active site is in the shape of a '''three-dimensional cleft''' that is composed of amino acids from different residues of the primary amino acid sequence. The amino acids that play a significant role in the binding specificity of the active site are usually not adjacent to each other in the primary structure, but form the active site as a result of folding in creating the tertiary structure. This active site region is relatively small compared to the rest of the enzyme. Similar to a ligand-binding site, the majority of an enzyme (non-binding amino acid residues) exist primarily to serve as a '''framework''' to support the structure of the active site by providing correct orientation. The unique amino acids contained in an active site promote specific interactions that are necessary for proper binding and resulting catalysis. Enzyme specificity depends on the arrangement of atoms in the active site. '''Complementary shapes''' between enzyme and substrate(s) allow a greater amount of '''weak non-covalent interactions''' including electrostatic forces, Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. Specific amino acids also allow the formation of hydrogen bonds. That shows the uniqueness of the microenvironment for the active site.

To locate the active site, the enzyme of interest is crystallized in the presence of an analog. The analog’s resemblance of the original substrate would be considered a potent competitive inhibitor that blocks the original substrates from binding to the active sites. One can then locate the active sites on an enzyme by following where the analog binds.

''Active Site vs. Regulatory Site''

An enzyme, for example ATCase, contains two distinct subunits: an active site and a regulatory site. The active site is the catalytic subunit, whereas the regulatory site has no catalytic activity. The two subunits on the enzyme was confirmed by John Gerhart and Howard Schachman by doing the ultracentrifugation experiment. First, they treated the ATCase with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate to react with the sulfhydryl groups and dissociate the two subunits. Because the two subunits differ in sizes with the catalytic subunit being larger, results of centrifuging the dissociated subunits showed two sedimentations compared to the one sediment of the native enzyme. This proved that ATCase, like many other enzymes, contain two sites for substrates to bind.

==Models==
There are three different models that represent enzyme-substrate binding: the lock-and-key model, the induced fit model, and transition-state model.

The '''lock-and-key model''' was proposed by Emil Fischer in 1890. This model presumes that there is a perfect fit between the substrate and the active site—the two molecules are complementary in shape. Lock-and-key is the model such that active site of enzyme is good fit for substrate that does not require change of structure of enzyme after enzyme binds substrate 

[[Image:Lock-and-key model.JPG]]

The '''induced-fit model''' involves the changing of the conformation of the active site to fit the substrate after binding. Also, in the induced-fit model, it was stated that there are amino acids that aid the correct substrate to bind to the active site which leads to shaping of the active site to the complementary shape. Induced fit is the model such that structure of active site of enzyme can be easily changed after binding of enzyme and substrate.  

[[Image:Induced-fit model.JPG]]

The binding in the active site involves hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions and temporary covalent bonds. The active site will then stabilize the transition state intermediate to decrease the activation energy. But the intermediate is most likely unstable, allowing the enzyme to release the substrate and return to the unbound state.

The '''transition-state model''' starts with an enzyme that binds to a substrate. It requires energy to change the shape of substrate. Once the shape is changed, the substrate is unbound to the enzyme, which ultimately changes the shape of the enzyme. An important aspect of this model is that it increases the amount of free energy.

==Overview==

A binding site is a position on a protein that binds to an incoming molecule that is smaller in size comparatively, called ligand.

In proteins, binding sites are small pockets on the tertiary structure where ligands bind to it using weak forces (non-covalent bonding).  Only a few residues actually participate in binding the ligand while the other residues in the protein act as a framework to provide correct conformation and orientation. Most binding sites are concave, but convex and flat shapes are also found.

A ligand-binding site is a place of the mass chemical specificity and affinity on protein that binds or forms chemical bonds with other molecules and ions or protein ligands. The affinity of the binding of a protein and a ligand is a chemically attractive force between the protein and ligand. As such, there can be competition between different ligands for the same binding site of proteins, and the chemical reaction will result in an equilibrium state between bonding and non-bonding ligands. The saturation of the binding site is defined as the total number of binding sites that are occupied by ligands per unit time.

The most common model of enzymatic binding sites is the induced fit model. It differs from the more simple &quot;Lock &amp; key&quot; school of thought because the induced fit model states that the substrate of an enzyme does not fit perfectly into the binding site. With the &quot;lock &amp; key&quot; model it is assumed that the substrate is a relatively static model that does not change its conformation and simply binds to the active site perfectly. According to the induced fit model, the binding site of an enzyme is complimentary to the transition state of the substrate in question, not the normal substrate state. The enzyme stabilizes this transition state by having its NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; residues stabilize the negative charge of the transition state substrate. This results in a dramatic decrease in the activation energy required to bring forth the intended reaction. The substrate is then converted to its product(s) by having the reaction go to equilibrium quicker.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Properties that Affect Binding'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

*'''Complementarity''':Molecular recognition depends on the tertiary structure of the enzyme which creates unique microenvironments in the active/binding sites. These specialized microenvironments contribute to binding site catalysis.

*'''Flexibility''':Tertiary structure allows proteins to adapt to their ligands (induced fit) and is essential for the vast diversity of biochemical functions (degrees of flexibility varies by function)

*'''Surfaces''':Binding sites can be concave, convex, or flat. For small ligands – clefts, pockets, or cavities. Catalytic sites are often at domain and subunit interfaces.

*'''Non-Covalent Forces''':Non-covalent forces are also characteristic properties of binding sites. Such characteristics are: higher than average amounts of exposed hydrophobic surface, (small molecules – partly concave and hydrophobic), and displacement of water can drive binding events.

*'''Affinity''': Binding ability of the enzyme to the substrate (can be graphed as partial pressure increases of the substrate against the affinity increases (0 to 1.0); affinity of binding of protein and ligand is chemical attractive force between the protein and ligand.

=Enzyme Inhibitors=
==Overview==
Enzyme inhibitors are molecules or compounds that bind to enzymes and result in a decrease in their activity. An inhibitor can bind to an enzyme and stop a substrate from entering the enzyme's active site and/or prevent the enzyme from catalyzing a chemical reaction. There are two categories of inhibitors.
#'''Irreversible Inhibitors'''
#'''Reversible Inhibitors'''

Inhibitors can also be present naturally and can be involved in metabolism regulation. For example. negative feedback caused by inhibitors can help maintain homeostatis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors include proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This is useful in eliminating harmful enzymes wuch as proteases and nucleases.

Examples of enzymes include poisons and many different types of drugs.

==Irreversible Inhibitors==
'''Irreversible inhibitors''' covalently bind to an enzyme, cause chemical changes to the active sites of enzymes, and cannot be reversed. A main role of irreversible inhibitors include modifying key amino acid residues needed for enzymatic activity. They often contain reactive functional groups such as aldehydes, alkenes, or phenyl sulphonates. These electrophilic groups are able to react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts. The amino acid components are residues containing nucleophilic side chains such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups such as amino acids serine, cysteine, threonine, or tyrosine.

[[Image:Irreversible inactivation2.svg|center|300px|Kinetics of Irreversible Inhibitor]]

First, irreversible inhibitors form a reversible non-covalent complex with the enzyme (EI or ESI). Then, this complex reacts to produce the covalently modified irreversible comple EI*. The rate at which EI* is formed is called the inactivation rate or kinact. Binding of irreversible inhibitors can be prevented by competition with either substrate or a second, reversible inhibitor since formation of EI may compete with ES.

In addition, some reversible inhibitors can form irreversible products by binding so tightly to their target enzyme. These tightly-binding inhibitors show kinetics similar to covalent irreversible inhibitors. As shown in the figure, these inhibitors rapidly bind to the enzyme in a low-affinity EI complex and then undergoes a slower rearrangement to a very tightly bound EI* complex. This kinetic behavior is called slow-binding. Slow-binding often involves a conformational change as the exzyme &quot;clams down&quot; around the inhibitor molecule. Some examples of these slow-bindinginhibitors include important drugs such as methotrexate and allopurinol.

==Reversible Inhibitors==

'''Reversible inhibitors''' bind non-covalently to enzymes, and many different types of inhibition can occur depending on what the inhibitors bind to. The non-covalent interactions between the inhibitors and enzymes include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and ionic bonds. Many of these weak bonds combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to substrates and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors generally do not undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or dialysis.
[[Image:DFMO mechanism.png|center|Example of a reversible inhibitor forming an irreversible product.]]

There are three kinds of &lt;cap&gt;reversible inhibitors&lt;/cap&gt;: '''competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive/mixed inhibitors'''. 
*'''Competitive inhibitors''', as the name suggests, compete with substrates to bind to the enzyme at the same time. The inhibitor has an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds to. This type of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentrations of substrate, out-competing the inhibitor. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate.
Competitive inhibitor binds to active site of enzyme and decreases amount of binding of substrate or ligand to enzyme, such that Km is increased and Vmax not changed. The chemical reaction can be reversed by increasing concentration of substrate.
[[Image:comp.jpg|center|frame|60px|Competitive Inhibitor]]

*'''Uncompetitive inhibitors''' bind to the enzyme at the same time as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice-versa. This type of inhibition cannot be overcome, but can be reduced by increasing the concentrations of substrate. The inhibitor usually follows an allosteric effect where it binds to a different site on the enzyme than the substrate. This binding to an allosteric site changes the conformation of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.
Uncompetitive inhibitor binds to enzyme-substrate complex to stops enzyme from reacting with substrate to form product, as such, it works well at higher substrate and enzyme concentrations that substrates are bonded to enzymes; the binding results in decreasing concentration of substrate binding to enzyme, Km, and Vmax, and increasing binding affinity of enzyme to substrate.
[[Image:uncomp.jpg|center|frame|60px|Uncompetitive Inhibitor]]

* '''Non-competitive inhibitors''' bind to the active site and reduces the activity but does not affect the binding of the substrate. Therefore, the extent of inhibition depends on the concentration of the substrate.
Noncompetitive inhibitor binds to other site that is not active site of enzyme that changes structure of enzyme; therefore, blocks enzyme binding to substrate that stops enzyme activity and decreases rate of chemical reaction of enzyme and substrate, which can not be changed by increasing concentration of substrate; the binding decreases Vmax and not changes Km of the chemical reaction. 
[[Image:Noncomp.jpg|center|frame|60px|Noncompetitive Inhibitor]]

===Quantitative Description of Reversible Inhibitors===
[[Image:Reversible inhibition.svg|center|left|300px]]
Most reversible inhibitors follow the classic Michaelis-Menten scheme, where an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate(S) to form an enzyme-substrate complex (ES). km is the Michaelis constant that corresponds to the concentration of the substrate when the velocity is half the maximum. Vmax is the maximum velocity of the enzyme.
[[Image:Michaelis-Menten saturation curve of an enzyme reaction.svg|600px|Reaction Rate vs. Substrate]]
*'''Competitive inhibitors''' can only bind to E and not to ES. They increase Km by interfering with the binding of the substrate, but they do not affect Vmax because the inhibitor does not change the catalysis in ES because it cannot bind to ES.

*'''Uncompetitive inhibitors''' are able to bind to both E and ES, but their affinities for these two forms of the enzyme are different. Therefore, these inhibitors increase Km and decrease Vmax because they interfere with substrate binding and hamper catalysis in the ES complex.

*'''Non-competitive inhibitors''' have identical affinities for E and ES. They do not change Km, but decreases Vmax.

==Spam on wikimedia projects==

Wiki spam is often thought of in it's more blatant form. Unwanted links with keywords such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Sifl_and_Olly_Show&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=240472241 eBay!] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tadalafil&amp;diff=197939489&amp;oldid=197939151 Cialis!], but that blatant form is actually comparatively rare on wikimedia projects. If you're interested in learning about combating spam on your own MediaWiki installation (which often takes this more blatant form), refer to the earlier section: [[MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook/Spam and Spammers]]

On wikimedia projects &quot;spam&quot; is instead defined as the ''behaviour'' or pushing links inappropriately, and this can take far more subtle forms. For example it is entirely possible that the domain redcross.org could be ''spammed'' (though the domain itself is not spammy). Domain owners will often be outraged (understandably so) that their reputation has been damaged by ''someone else'' spamming the domain.

Adding external links to an article or user page for promotional purposes is disruptive, and is considered to be spam. Although the specific links may be allowed under some circumstances, repeatedly adding links will in most cases result in all of them being removed.  It is the behaviour in placing the links rather than the content of the site that may cause concerns.

As Wikimedia projects use [[w:nofollow|nofollow-tags]] adding a link to one of them doesn't alter the search engine ranking.

==Detecting spam==

==One-wiki spam==

==Cross-wiki spam==
Cross-wiki spam means that a certain link has been added to multiple projects, normally by a single user, a set of [[w:Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|SPAs]], or an IP range. In this case the URL might be blocked (blacklisted) on a global level, meaning that it can't be added to any Wikimedia project. [[m:global blocking|Global IP blocks]] may be placed to augment the blacklisting, for example, when malicious spammers rapidly switch domains, or abuse lag time on the blacklist.

==Combating spam==
===Method 1: Revert and remove the spam===
===Method 2: block the user(s)===
When one or a few users or IPs are adding spam links, they can simply be blocked.

For [[#Cross-wiki spam|cross-wiki spam]], global accounts may be locked where possible, and short [[m:global blocking|global IP blocks]] can be considered in severe cases. [[#Method 4: blacklist the domain(s)|Blacklisting]] is the main method of combating cross-wiki spam.

===Method 3: page protection===
When one or several pages are targeted by a spammer, they can be semi-protected to stop anonymous and new users from editing, or full-protected if established accounts are involved. however, blocking is preferable unless the spammer is making new accounts to spam the wiki, since page protection affects legitimate users as well as the spammer.

===Method 4: blacklist the domain(s)===
====Local blacklist====
Each Wikimedia project has a local blacklist and a local whitelist, for example [[:en:MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist]] and [[:en:MediaWiki:Spam-whitelist]]. The former can be used to disallow linking to certain domains on a certain project only. The latter is a means to be able to link to domains on the global blacklist, or to exclude certain documents on a server, while all other documents on that server can not be linked to.

Addition and removal of links can most often be discussed on the local talk page. Before blacklisting all other measured should be explored such as blocking the user or IP or protecting the page.  However where this is not sufficient local blacklists should be used whenever possible to manage blocking of external links; the global blacklist should only be used for widespread cross-wiki link placement, where other local options are not effective.  The list may also be used for sites that simply are not suitable for whatever reason if there is consensus.

==== Global blacklist ====
There is a global blacklist [[m:Spam blacklist|on Meta]]. This is a list of domains that have been placed excessively, or which are deemed completely unhelpful to any project, and are therefore blocked on all Wikimedia projects, i.e. you can't link to one of the listed entries from any Wikimedia project. For a domain to be globally blacklisted it generally has to be excessively linked on multiple projects. If it's only added to a single project generally the link should be blacklisted locally (some [[#Exceptions|exceptions exist]]).

Addition and removal of links can be discussed on [[m:Talk:Spam blacklist]].

===== Exceptions =====
Some links are generally blacklisted on meta, even if the abuse has only been to one project, or when the link has not been used abusively yet:
# URL-shorteners/redirect sites (like e.g. tinyurl) as these can be used to circumvent blacklisting of other domains, and it is totally unnecessary to use these (as one can link to the original document directly).
# Sites which drop viruses, Trojan horses, etc. etc. on the users computer, in other words, links which, when clicked on, are a threat to the computer the user is on.  Blacklisting of these sites is generally temporarily, until the problem has been resolved.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">English forms negatives in the Simple Present using ''not''.

The verb ''to be'' is special.  Here is the negative form for it.
* I am from Canada. - I am ''not'' from Canada.
* She is from Finland. - She is ''not'' from Finland.
* She is from Finland. - She is''n't'' from Finland
* She is from Finland. - She's ''not'' from Finland.

All other verbs use ''don't (do not)'' or ''doesn't (does not)'' to form negatives:
* I play football. - I ''do not'' play football.
* I play football. - I ''don't'' play football.
* She likes jazz. - She ''does not'' like jazz.
* She likes jazz. - She ''doesn't'' like jazz.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Talking about time is important to be able to speak English well but it can be confusing because of different sayings and formats for time in different countries.

For example, in the USA it is very rare for people to use the 24 hour clock (e.g. 18.30) when speaking or writing.  The 24 hour clock is often used in the United Kingdom and Ireland but not often in spoken English.

==Asking for the time==

*What's the time?
*What time is it?
*Do you have the time? / Have you got the time?

==Giving the time==
*(12.00, 00.00) It's 12 o'clock / It's 12 / It's 12 (o'clock) in the morning / evening
*(12.05, 00.05) It's five past twelve / It's 12 'oh' 5 / It's five past twelve (in the morning/afternoon) / It's five after twelve

      <text xml:space="preserve">This material is intended for those who are just starting to learn Japanese.  The material in this section is comparable to the material learned in the first semester of a Japanese course in college.  It includes about 700 vocabulary words and around 100 kanji.

You will need to learn the entire [[Japanese/Kana|kana]] before starting the lessons in this section.  This book is written using Japanese scripts and while one can learn Japanese from material written in [[Japanese/Japanese_writing_system#Latin_alphabet|romaji]] this book agrees with the view that learning the Japanese scripts along with the language is more useful and ultimately provides a deeper understanding of the language.

Please consider [[../../Using_This_Book |contributing]] to this level. You needn't even have completed it; only that you have something useful to share.  It can be simple improvements of prose, new sections or full lessons.  Your help is invaluable to improving and expanding this wikibook.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page acts as the home for both [[EDUC 2201]] Instructional Technology  and [http://http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Educational_Technology EDUC 6305] Advanced Instructional Technology, a (3) hour graduate course. The focus is on integrating technology into learning, and learning with technology. The content of the course will involve a combination of a variety of instructional methods including, self paced, group work,  reflection on how people learn and the role that technology plays in the learning process.  A central theme will be how technology is being incorporated into traditional direct instructional strategies or conversely how technology is transforming the teaching and learning processes. There is a heavy emphasis on the International Society for Technology in Educations National Educational Technology Standards for Teachers ISTE NETS-T   and the Interstate New Teachers Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC) principles. In addition the coursework should be considered within the Partnership for the 21st Century Skills framework (see graphic below).

This course provides a practical forum for teachers, corporate trainers, and other educators to investigate how the Internet and multimedia applications can be used to support education. Progression through the course will advance from usability and design issues, to development and publication of personally developed educational products.

This course is about technology integration into learning--our learning and our students' learning. Throughout the course there will be opportunities to explore how you learn new skills, new information and how you create new knowledge. We will explore online learning, project-based learning, modeling, thinking in a context, community-based learning and teaching strategies that transfer more responsibility to the learner. You will be able to chose from a broad range of technology tools to enhance your learning individually and in small groups.

Ideally, your work and effort in this class should be mindful of how your improved skills may improve the lives and learning of children. However, the focus of the course work should be on your own personal learning. Those who understand their own learning make better teachers. Since knowledge is context-specific and learning is a socially embedded process of negotiation and acculturation.

# [[Communication Tools]]
# [[Visual Literacy]]

These classes will be treated like a research and development facility or art studio in which we collaborate, engage in discussion and learn to use specific software packages when a &quot;teachable moment&quot; occurs. Face to face sessions will concentrate on basic skills required for success in this class namely the Web, FTP, email, and Blackboard. Asynchronous sessions will be spent, discussing the assigned readings and current events. There will also be opportunities to solve student problems. 

The backbone technology in the course is the Internet. We will be using the Web, FTP, email, reference materials, and other software to support our learning, on-line class discussions, for constructing web pages and other instructional materials. Students in this course will work individually and collaboratively, so each can pursue his or her own interests and utilize individual talents while at the same time contributing to our collective learning community

&lt;big&gt;'''EORTC Hodgkin's Disease Trials'''&lt;/big&gt;


==H1 (1964-71)== 
&lt;div id=&quot;H1&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- div id allows target links to &quot;H1&quot; instead of &quot;H1 (1964-71)&quot;, e.g. [[Radiation Oncology/Hodgkin/EORTC#H1]] --&gt;
*Purpose: can Velban improve on RT alone?
*288 pts (mostly supradiaphragmatic, but a few infradiaphragmatic). Stage I-II. No laparotomy. All pts received mantle field (if supradiaph.) or inverted Y (if infra). 
**Randomized to 1) no further treatment, or 2) weekly Velban x 2 years
*Results:
**''Preliminary'': PMID 5074778, 1972 (No abstract) &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomized study of irradiation and vinblastine in stages I and II of Hodgkin's disease. Preliminary results.&quot; Eur J Cancer. 1972 Jun;8(3):353-62. 
**PMID 116855, 1979 (No abstract) &amp;mdash; &quot;Long-term results of the E.O.R.T.C. randomized study of irradiation and vinblastine in clinical stages I and II of Hodgkin's disease.&quot; Tubiana M et al. Eur J Cancer. 1979 May;15(5):645-57.
**PMID 2462943, 1989 &amp;mdash; &quot;Toward comprehensive management tailored to prognostic factors of patients with clinical stages I and II in Hodgkin's disease. The EORTC Lymphoma Group controlled clinical trials: 1964-1987.&quot; Tubiana M et al. Blood. 1989 Jan;73(1):47-56.
***At 15 yrs, DFS 60% (RT+VLB) vs 38% (RT alone). OS 65% vs 58%, N.S. 
*Comments: Suggests that salvage treatment was more efficient in the RT alone group. High incidence of relapse in the para-aortic region suggests a need to explore or treat this area.


==H2 (1972-76)== 
&lt;div id=&quot;H2&quot;&gt;
*Purpose: compare splenectomy and spleen irradiation
*300 pts. Stage I-II (supradiaphragmatic). Based on prelim. results of H1. 
**Randomized to 1) staging laparotomy + splenectomy, followed by mantle field RT and para-aortic RT, 2) mantle + PA + spleen (i.e. subtotal nodal irradiation). 
**Pts with MC or LD histologies randomized to 1) Velban alone, or 2) Velban + procarbazine for 2 yrs. 
*Results:
**PMID 7021162, 1981 (No abstract) &amp;mdash; &quot;Five-year results of the E.O.R.T.C. randomized study of splenectomy and spleen irradiation in clinical stages I and II of Hodgkin's disease.&quot; Tubiana M et al. Eur J Cancer. 1981 Mar;17(3):355-63. 
**PMID 2462943, 1989 &amp;mdash; &quot;Toward comprehensive management tailored to prognostic factors of patients with clinical stages I and II in Hodgkin's disease. The EORTC Lymphoma Group controlled clinical trials: 1964-1987.&quot; Tubiana M et al. Blood. 1989 Jan;73(1):47-56.
***At 12 yrs, DFS 68% (STNI) vs 76% (lap-STNI). OS 77% vs 79%.  With positive staging lap, DFS 56% vs 83% for negative lap. However, no difference in OS according to staging lap, 80% vs 76%.  Pts with MC and LD histology who received chemo had DFS 85% vs 65%, but OS not different, 75% vs 80%.
*Comments: Effective salvage treatment makes survival equivalent. Showed that laparotomy had no therapeutic benefit.


==H5 (1977-82)== 
&lt;div id=&quot;H3&quot;&gt;
*Purpose: Risk-adapted therapy. Based on prior studies (H1 + H2) it was known that pts with favorable risk factors could receive RT alone. Staging lap was used to confirm this favorable risk group who would receive RT alone. It was not known if mantle alone or mantle + PA should be given. Pts with unfavorable risk factors, despite a negative staging lap, were at high risk for relapse, and would be randomized between RT alone and combination therapy.
*CS I-II supradiaphragmatic. 494 total pts. Divided into two groups based on prognostic indicators (based on analysis of H1 and H2 trials). Favorable group included all of the following: age &lt;= 40, ESR &lt;= 70, LP or NS histology, CS II (without mediastinal involvement) or CS I. 
**Favorable group, '''H5F''' (n=237): Underwent staging laparatomy. If negative lap (n=198;84%) received RT alone, randomized to mantle vs mantle+PA, 40 Gy each. If Lap+ (n=39) randomized similarly as H5U.
**Unfavorable group, '''H5U''' (n=257+39): No staging lap. Randomized to total/subtotal nodal irradiation (TNI/STNI) vs. mantle + chemo sandwich therapy: MOPPx3 -&gt; mantle RT 35 Gy -&gt; MOPP x 3.
*'''H5-Favorable''' -- Mantle 40 Gy vs Mantle + PA 40 Gy
**Randomized. 198 patients, favorable (age &lt;=40, ESR &lt;=70, LP/NS, Stage I or Stage II without mediastinal involvement), negative staging laparotomy. Arm 1) Mantle RT 40 Gy vs Arm 2) Mantle RT + PA RT (T11-L4) 40 Gy
**'''1988''' PMID 2578012 -- &quot;Clinical stages I and II Hodgkin's disease: a specifically tailored therapy according to prognostic factors.&quot; (Carde P, J Clin Oncol. 1988 Feb;6(2):239-52.) Median F/U 5.3 years
***Outcome: 6-year RFS mantle 74% vs mantle+PA 72% (NS); 6-year OS 96% vs 89% (NS)
***Conclusion: In surgically staged patients, more limited RT (mantle alone) is sufficient
*'''H5-Unfavorable''' -- TNI/STNI 40 Gy vs MOPP-Mantle RT 35 Gy-MOPP
**Randomized. Two subsets of patients. H5F lap+: 39 patients, favorable, but positive staging laparotomy. H5U: 257, unfavorable profile (at least one unfavorable characteristic age &gt;40, ESR &gt;70, LP/NS, STage II bulky), but no staging laparotomy. Arm 1) Total Nodal Irradiation 40 Gy with 2-3 week rest; STNI allowed in female &lt;40 vs Arm 2) MOPP x3 -&gt; mantle RT 35 Gy -&gt; MOPP x3
**'''1988''' PMID 2578012 -- &quot;Clinical stages I and II Hodgkin's disease: a specifically tailored therapy according to prognostic factors.&quot; (Carde P, J Clin Oncol. 1988 Feb;6(2):239-52.) Median F/U 5.3 years
***Outcome (H5F lap+): 6-year RFS TNI/STNI 53% vs chemo-RT 100% (SS); 6-year OS 95% vs 88% (NS)
***Outcome (H5U): 6-year OS TNI/STNI 82% vs chemo-RT 89% (SS)
***Conclusion: Improved outcome with combined chemo-RT over comprehensive RT alone

==H6 (1982-88)== 
&lt;div id=&quot;H6&quot;&gt;
*Purpose: Is laparotomy necessary? Compare ABVD vs MOPP for unfavorable.
*'''EORTC H6-Favorable''' (1982-1988) -- staging laparoscopy + Mantle RT vs clinical staging + STNI
**Randomized. 262 patients, favorable prognosis (1-2 nodal areas, no bulky disease, no B symptoms and ESR &lt;50, B symptoms and ESR &lt;30). Arm 1) No staging laparotomy, Mantle + PA RT 40 Gy vs Arm 2) Staging laparotomy (-), Mantle RT 40 Gy
**'''1993''' PMID 7693881 -- &quot;&quot;Clinical staging versus laparotomy and combined modality with MOPP versus ABVD in early-stage Hodgkin's disease: the H6 twin randomized trials from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Lymphoma Cooperative Group.&quot; (Carde P, J Clin Oncol. 1993 Nov;11(11):2258-72.) Median F/U 5.3 years
***Outcome: In patients undergoing lap, 33% found lap (+). 6-year FFP laparoscopy + Mantle 83% vs Mantle + PA 78% (NS); 6-year OS 89% vs 93% (NS)
***Conclusion: No difference between surgical staging + mantle vs clinical staging + STNI
*'''EORTC H6-Unfavorable''' (1982-1988) -- MOPP x6 + Mantle RT vs ABVD x6 + Mantle RT
**Randomized. 316 patients, unfavorable prognosis (at least one of: &gt;2 nodal areas, bulky, B-symptoms, elevated ESR). No surgical staging. Arm 1) MOPP x6 + Mantle RT vs Arm 2) ABVD x6 + Mantle RT
**'''1993''' PMID 7693881 -- &quot;&quot;Clinical staging versus laparotomy and combined modality with MOPP versus ABVD in early-stage Hodgkin's disease: the H6 twin randomized trials from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Lymphoma Cooperative Group.&quot; (Carde P, J Clin Oncol. 1993 Nov;11(11):2258-72.) Median F/U 5.3 years
***Outcome: 6-year FFP MOPP 76% vs ABVD 88% (SS); 6-year OS 85% vs 91% (NS) 
***Toxicity: Less fertility problems for ABVD (in both men and women).
***Conclusion: In combination with mantle RT, ABVD superior to MOPP

==H7 (1988-93)== 
&lt;div id=&quot;H7&quot;&gt;
*Purpose: can involved field radiotherapy + chemo give equivalent results to STNI + chemo? Goal of reducing treatment toxicity
*Two randomized trials: favorable disease (prognostic score 1-5) and unfavorable disease (prognostic score &gt;=9). Please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Hodgkin/Overview|Overview]] for further information
*'''EORTC H7-Favorable''' -- STNI vs EBVP x6 + IFRT
**Randomized. 333 patients with Stage I supradiaphragmatic HL, favorable (prognostic score 1-5). No staging laparotomy. Arm 1) STNI alone (36 Gy uninvoled, 40 Gy involved fields) vs. Arm 2) EBVP x6 cycles + IFRT (36-40 Gy)
**'''2006''' PMID 16754934 &amp;mdash; &quot;Combined-modality therapy for clinical stage I or II Hodgkin's lymphoma: long-term results of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer H7 randomized controlled trials.&quot; (Noordijk EM, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jul 1;24(19):3128-35.) Median F/U 8.7 years
***Outcome: 10-yr EFS STNI 78% vs. EBVP+IF 88% (SS). OS similar at 92%. 
***Conclusion: Combined chemo + IFRT is superior STNI alone
**'''1997''' &lt;u&gt;ASTRO Abstract&lt;/u&gt; -- &quot;Combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is advisable in all patients with clinical stage I-II Hodgkin's disease. Six-year results of the EORTC-GPMC controlled clinical trials 'H7-VF', 'H7-F' and 'H7-U'.&quot; (Noordijk EM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1997; 39(2):S173
***Very favorable group (female, age &lt;40, stage IA, NS/LP histology, ESR &lt;50) treated with Mantle only, without PA field
***Outcome: 6-year RFS 73%, OS 96%
***Conclusion: Relapse rate unacceptably high in these clinically staged patients; arm closed
*'''EORTC H7-Unfavorable''' -- EBVP x6 + IFRT vs MOPP/ABV + IFRT
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to worse outcome in EBVP arm.'' 389 patients with Stage I supradiaphragmatic HL, unfavorable (prognostic score &gt;=9). No staging laparotomy. Arm 1) EBVP x6 + IFRT 36-40 Gy vs. Arm 2) MOPP/ABV x6 + IFRT 36-40 Gy
**'''2006''' PMID 1675493 &amp;mdash; &quot;Combined-modality therapy for clinical stage I or II Hodgkin's lymphoma: long-term results of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer H7 randomized controlled trials.&quot; (Noordijk EM, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jul 1;24(19):3128-35.) Median F/U 8.7 years
***Outcome: 10-yr EFS EBVP 68% vs. MOPP/ABV 88% (SS). OS 79% vs 87% (SS). Low control rate in irradiated areas
***Conclusion: EBVP is inferior to MOPP/ABV, IFRT with poor chemo not sufficient in these patients with high tumor burden
*Comment (PMID 17989384): Three major conclusion: 1) clinical staging is sufficient for stratifying early stage disease, 2) chemotherapy followed by IFRT should be standard treatment, and 3) duration of chemotherapy should be adapted to severity of the disease

==H8 (1993-1999)== 
&lt;div id=&quot;H8&quot;&gt;
*Two randomized trials: favorable disease (risk score 1-5) and unfavorable disease (risk score &gt;=9)
*'''EORTC H8-Favorable''' -- MOPP-ABV x3 + IFRT vs STNI
**Randomized. 542 patients, Stage I-II supradiaphragmatic HD, favorable (Prognostic score using EORTC H7 criteria 1-5). Arm 1) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|MOPP-ABV]] x3 cycles + IFRT vs. Arm 2) STNI alone
**'''2007''' PMID 17989384 -- &quot;Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation in early-stage Hodgkin's disease.&quot; (Ferme C, N Engl J Med. 2007 Nov 8;357(19):1916-27.). Median F/U 7.7 years
***H8-F Outcome: 5-year EFS MOPP-ABV + IFRT 98% vs. STNI 74% (SS); 10-year OS 97% vs. 92% (SS)
***Conclusion: For favorable disease, MOPP-ABV x3 cycles + IFRT is superior to STNI
*'''EORTC H8-Unfavorable''' -- MOPP-ABV x6 + IFRT vs MOPP-ABV x4 + IFRT vs MOPP-ABV x4 + STNI
**Randomized, 3 arms. 996 patients, Stage I-II supradiaphragmatic HD, unfavorable (Prognostic score using EORTC H7 criteria &gt;=9). Arm 1) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|MOPP-ABV]] x6 cycles + IFRT vs. Arm 2) MOPP-ABV x4 cycles + IFRT vs. Arm 3) MOPP-ABV x4 cycles + STNI. RT dose CR 36 Gy, PR 40 Gy
**'''2007''' PMID 17989384 -- &quot;Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation in early-stage Hodgkin's disease.&quot; (Ferme C, N Engl J Med. 2007 Nov 8;357(19):1916-27.). Median F/U 7.7 years
***Outcome: 5-year EFS 84% vs. 88% vs. 87% (NS); 10-year OS 88% vs. 85% vs. 84% (NS)
***Conclusion: Best strategy for unfavorable disease is MOPP-ABV x4 cycles + IFRT


==H9 (1998-2004)== 
&lt;div id=&quot;H9&quot;&gt;
*Two randomized trials: favorable disease and unfavorable disease 
*'''EORTC H9-Favorable''' (1998-2004) -- IFRT 36 Gy vs IFRT 20 Gy vs No RT
**Randomized. ''Arm 3 stopped early due to &gt;20% of failure.'' 783 favorable Stage I-II patients enrolled, 619 achieved CR(u) on EBVP x6 and were randomized. Arm 1) 36 Gy IF-RT Arm vs. 2) 20 Gy IF-RT vs. 3) no RT. Arm 3 stopped early due to high recurrence (&gt;20%).  
**'''2005''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=34&amp;abstractID=30245 ASCO abstract] -- &quot;First results of the EORTC-GELA H9 randomized trials: the H9-F trial (comparing 3 radiation dose levels) and H9-U trial (comparing 3 chemotherapy schemes) in patients with favorable or unfavorable early stage Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL).&quot; (Noordijk, EM ASCO 2005). Median F/U 2.7 years
***Outcome: 4-year EFS 36 Gy 87% vs 20 Gy 84% vs. no RT 70% (SS). 4 yr OS 98% in all arms.
***Conclusion: In favorable patients in CR after 6 cycles of EBVP, omission of IFRT leads to unacceptable failure rate; 20 Gy provides comparable control as 36 Gy
*'''EORTC H9-Unfavorable''' (1998-2002) -- ABVD x6 vs ABVD x4 vs BEACOPP x4
**Randomized. 808 patients, unfavorable Stage I-II.  Arm 1) ABVD x 6 vs. 2)ABVD x 4 vs. 3) BEACOPP x 4 followed by 30 Gy IF-RT in all arms.  
**'''2005''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=34&amp;abstractID=30245 ASCO abstract] -- &quot;First results of the EORTC-GELA H9 randomized trials: the H9-F trial (comparing 3 radiation dose levels) and H9-U trial (comparing 3 chemotherapy schemes) in patients with favorable or unfavorable early stage Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL).&quot; (Noordijk, EM ASCO 2005). Median F/U 2.7 years
***Outcome: 4-year EFS ABVD x6 94% vs ABVD x4 89% vs BEACOPP x4 91% (NS); 4-year OS 96% vs 95% vs 93% (NS). 
***Toxicity: Higher with BEACOPP
***Conclusion: Similar early EFS with reduction of ABVD cycles to 4; BEACOPP similiar but more toxic


==H10 (ongoing)== 
&lt;div id=&quot;H10&quot;&gt; [http://www.hematologiegroningen.nl/protocollen/download/?id=917 H10 Protocol] - &quot;The H10 EORTC/GELA randomized Intergroup trial on early FDG-PET scan guided treatment adaptation versus standard combined modality treatment in patients with supradiaphragmatic stage I/II Hodgkin's lymphoma.&quot;
*Favorable: randomized to:

**Experimental: ABVD x 2, then PET. If PET negative, then ABVD x 2 additional cycles (total 4) without RT. If PET positive, switch to escalated BEACOPP x 2 + INRT 30 Gy (+6 Gy boost for residual)
*Unfavorable: randomized to:
**Standard arm: ABVD x 4 + INRT 30 Gy (w/wo 6 Gy boost). PET after 2 cycles.
**Experimental: ABVD x 2, then PET. If PET negative, then ABVD x 4 additional (total 6) without RT. If PET positive, BEACOPP x 2 + INRT 30 Gy (w/wo 6 Gy boost)

**1137 pts. Favorable pts (441): 85.8% had negative early PET. 9 events (Experimental group) vs 1 event (Standard).  1-yr PFS 94.9% vs 100% (SS).
**Unfavorable pts (683): 74.8% had negative early PET. 16 events vs 9.  1-yr PFS 94.7% vs 97.3% (SS).
**&quot;Concluded it was unlikely that we would show noninferiority in the final results for the experimental arm and advised stopping random assignment for early PET–negative patients.&quot;
**Conclusion: &quot;On the basis of this analysis, combined-modality treatment resulted in fewer early progressions in clinical stage I/II HL, although early outcome was excellent in both arms. The final analysis will reveal whether this finding is maintained over time.&quot;

**Randomized. 376 patients, Stage I-II, no risk factors (large mediastinal mass, extranodal lesions, massive splenic disease, elevated ESR, 3+ involved areas). Involved field RT 40 Gy. Arm 1) EFRT 40 Gy vs Arm 2) EFRT 30 Gy. No chemotherapy
**'''2001''' PMID 11387364 -- &quot;Low-dose radiation is sufficient for the noninvolved extended-field treatment in favorable early-stage Hodgkin's disease: long-term results of a randomized trial of radiotherapy alone.&quot; (Duhmke E, J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jun 1;19(11):2905-14.) Median F/U 7.2 years
***Outcome: 7-year RFP 40 Gy 78% vs 30 Gy 83% (NS); 7-year OS 91% vs 96% (NS). Worse outcome (RFS 72% vs 84%) with protocol violations
***Conclusion: 30 Gy dose adequate for clinically noninvolved areas


*'''HD7''' (1993-1998)
**Randomized. 650 patients, Stage IA-IIB without risk factors. Treated with 1) RT alone vs. 2) ABVD x 2 cycles + RT RT same in both arms, given as EFRT 30 Gy + IFRT 10 Gy
**'''2007''' PMID 17606976 -- &quot;Two cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine plus extended-field radiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone in early favorable Hodgkin's lymphoma: final results of the GHSG HD7 trial.&quot; (Engert A, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 10;25(23):3495-502.). Median F/U 7.2 years
***7-year outcome: no difference in survival (92% vs. 94%, NS), but significant difference in DFS RT alone 67% vs. CRT 88% (SS). Treatment relapse more successful for RT only arm
***Second malignancies: no difference, 0.8% per year, highest in older patients &amp; B-symptoms
***Conclusion: Combined modality more effective than EF-RT alone


*'''HD8''' (1993-98) -- COPP/ABVD x2 cycles plus EFRT vs IFRT
**Randomized. 1064 patients, with early stage unfavorable HD. Clinical stages I-II with 1 or more risk factors, as well as stage IIIA without risk factors. Risk factors were large mediastinal mass, extranodal, massive splenic involvement, elevated ESR, or more than 2 lymph node groups. IIB may have only elevated ESR or more than 2 lymph node groups but no other risk factors. Treated with COPP / ABVD x 2 cycles, then randomized to Arm 1) EFRT 30 Gy vs. Arm 2) IFRT 30 Gy. A 10 Gy boost to bulky disease. Supradiaphragmatic EF RT was a mantle + PA + splenic hilum / spleen. Subdiaphragmatic EF RT was an inverted Y plus mini-mantle.
**'''2003''' PMID 12913100 &amp;mdash; &quot;Involved-field radiotherapy is equally effective and less toxic compared with extended-field radiotherapy after four cycles of chemotherapy in patients with early-stage unfavorable Hodgkin's lymphoma: results of the HD8 trial of the German Hodgkin's Lymphoma Study Group.&quot; (Engert A, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Oct 1;21(19):3601-8.) Median F/U 4.5 years
***Outcome: 5-year FFTF EFRT 86% vs. IFRT 84% (NS), 5-year OS EFRT 91% vs. 92% (NS). No difference in CR, PFS, relapse rate, death, and second neoplasm
***Toxicity: Nause/vomiting, pharyngitis, GI toxicity, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia worse in EFRT arms
***Conclusion: RT volume reduction from EFRT to IFRT produces similar results and less toxicity

***Toxicity: Secondary malignancy 5.7% vs 6.6% vs 6.0%
***Conclusion: Significant improvement for escalated BEACOPP. Results challenge ABVD as a standard of care


*'''HD10''' (1998-2002) -- 2x2: ABVD x2 vs ABVD x4; IFRT 30 Gy vs 20 Gy
**Randomized, 2x2. 1131 patients. Stage I-II without risk factors. Randomization #1) ABVD x4 cycles vs ABVD x2 cycles, and randomization #2) IFRT 30 Gy vs IFRT 20 Gy

*'''HD11''' (1998-2003)
**Randomized. 1395 pts. Unfavorable disease (CS I or IIA with at least one of the risk factors: (a) large mediastinal mass, (b) extranodal disease, (c) elevated ESR, or (d) ≥ 3 nodal areas; or IIB with risk factors c and/or d.) BEACOPP x4 cycles vs. ABVD x4 cycles. IFRT 30 Gy or 20 Gy.

***ABVD x4 + 30 Gy IFRT (FFTF5 85%, OS5 94%, PFS5 87%) = BEACOPP x4 + either 30 (FFTF5 87%, OS5 ~95%, PFS5 ~88%) or 20 Gy IFRT (FFTF5 ~87%, OS5 ~95%, PFS5 87%). 
***ABVD x4 + 20 Gy IFRT was inferior (FFTF5 81%, OS5 ~94%, PFS5 ~82%). 
***More severe toxicity: BEACOPP &gt; ABVD (WHO 3/4 = 73.8% v 51.5%; P&lt;.001).  More severe toxicity: 30 Gy v 20 Gy (CTC 3/4 = 12.0% v 5.7%; P&lt;.001).

***CR was obtained in 94%, did not differ between arms. 5-yr FFTF estimate 85%. BEACOPP more effective than ABVD if followed by 20 Gy RT (difference in 5-yr FFTF 5.7%). No difference seen between BEACOPP and ABVD when 30 Gy used (1.6%). After BEACOPP, 20 Gy not inferior to 30 Gy; after ABVD, inferiority of 20 Gy could not be excluded (4.0%). 
***Conclusion: &quot;A reduction of RT dose from 30Gy to 20Gy IF-RT seems to be justified only in combination with Bbas [BEACOPP], but not with a less effective chemotherapy such as 4xABVD. Patients will benefit from an intensified CT such as Bbas only in combination with 20Gy IF-RT but not with 30Gy IF-RT.&quot;

      <comment>/* Lattice enthalpy */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Lattice enthalpy is the enthalpy change when one molecule of an ionic crystal is formed from its constituent ions in their gaseous state at standard conditions (101kPa pressure and 298K temperature).
== Lattice enthalpy ==
Lattice enthalpy is simply the change in Enthalpy associated with the formation of one mole of an ionic compound from it's oppositely charged ions in their standard states under standard conditions. 

e.g. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(g) + 2Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(g) ---&gt; MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s)ΔH&lt;sub&gt;latt&lt;/sub&gt; = -2526 kj mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Image:Lattice-enthalpy-NaCl-3D-ionic.png|300px]]

Therefore:
* The enthalpy change will always be exothermic (negative)
* A more negative value shows greater electostatic attraction and therefore a stronger bond in the solid

'''Definition: The enthalpy change when 1 mole of an ionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions under standard conditions'''

Lattice enthalpy cannot be measured because gaseous ions do not combine directly to form a compound.

== Born-Haber cycles ==
As lattice enthalpy cannot be measured, another way of working out lattice enthalpy values is needed. To do this we must show the complete pathway for the reaction, including lattice enthalpy (Route 2 below) and compare this to the enthalpy change of formation (Route 1). We can do this because Hess's law states: 

enthalpy change of formation = atomisation enthalpies + electron affinity + lattice enthalpy

[[Image:BornHaberLiF.PNG]]

The lattice enthalpy is step 5 in route 2 of the example. First the elements must be atomised and ionised in steps 1-3:

Step 1 - Atomisation of solid Lithium to the gaseous state

'''Definition: ΔH&lt;sub&gt;at&lt;/sub&gt;The standard enthalpy change of atomisation of an element is the enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms are formed from the element in its standard state.'''

Step 2 - Ionisation of gaseous Lithium atoms to 1+ ions

'''Definition: ΔH&lt;sub&gt;i.e.&lt;/sub&gt;The standard enthalpy change accompanying the removal of one electron from an atom in the gas phase.'''

Step 3 - Atomisation of fluorine gas (Hint: fluorine still needs to be atomised here even though it is gaseous because it is an Fl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule)

Step 4 - Electron affinity of fluorine. This is basically making the gaseous fluorine atoms into ions by adding an electron.

'''Definition: ΔH&lt;sub&gt;ea1&lt;/sub&gt;The first electron affinity is the enthalpy change when one electron is added to each gaseous atom in one mole, to form one mole of 1- ions.'''

Step 5 - Lattice enthalpy! can now be worked out. The easiest way to understand how the cycle works is to remember that route 1 and route 2 are equal. So using Hess's law (as above) lattice enthalpy can be calculated when the other values are known.

Things to watch out for:
* Ions requiring two additions or subtractions of electrons e.g. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; 
For these use the values for each, DO NOT simply double the first value.
* Ionic solids that have more than one of a single ion e.g. MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Also try and learn the definitions because these are easy marks.

== Trends in Lattice enthalpy ==
There are two factors that affect the lattice enthalpy of an ionic compound:
* The size of the ions 
* The charge of the ions
This is because these are also the factors that affect charge density. Charge density of an ion will determine it's &quot;attracting power&quot; and therefore the greater the charge density of the ions, the greater the electrostatic forces between them.
So a larger ion will decrease the charge density and a more higly charged ion will increase the charge density.

== Thermal decomposition of group 2 carbonates ==
The Group 2 carbonates MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; all react in the same way when heated:
[[File:Carbonate-ion-localised-2D.png|thumb|A Carbonate ion|200px]]
MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) ---&gt; MgO(s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) ---&gt; CaO(s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) ---&gt; SrO(s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) ---&gt; BaO(s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)


The decomposition temperatures for these reactions are as follows:

MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 350 °C

CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 832 °C

SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1340 °C

BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1450 °C

[[Image:Polarisationcarbonate.PNG|thumb|Polarisation of carbonate ion|300px]]

A trend of increasing temperature down the group is evident. This may seem confusing because the magnesium cation is the smallest and they all have the same charge. Magnesium therefore has the greatest lattice enthalpy and the greatest attraction to the carbonate ion. However, this does not result in a higher decomposition temperature - the stronger pull of a smaller cation combined with the diffuse electron cloud of a carbonate ion causes much more polarisation of the carbonate ion to occur.

The change of shape is where the electrons are pulled onto one of the Oxygen atoms causing distortion in the carbonate ion. This change in shape reduces strength and causes the carbonate to break up when heated. 

Magnesium Oxide is a particularly favourable product due to its high lattice enthalpy, this contributes to the ease of decomposition of magnesium carbonate and is why magnesium oxide is used as a refractory lining.

== Questions ==

1.Explain why the lattice enthalpy of NaBr is much less exothermic than MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

2.How is Hess's law used to work out lattice enthalpy from born-haber cycle?

3.What are the factors affecting lattice enthalpy?

4.What is the definition of 1st electron affinity?

5.What is the trend in decomposition temperatures of group two carbonates? why is this?

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a locally compact Hausdorff space and let &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; be a positive linear functional on &lt;math&gt;C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there exists a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-field &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; containing all Borel sets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a unique measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; such that 

#&lt;math&gt;\Lambda f=\displaystyle\int_Xfd\mu&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;f\in C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mu(K)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; for all compact &lt;math&gt;K\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;
#If &lt;math&gt;E\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)=\inf\{\mu(V)|E\subset V,V\text{ open}\}&lt;/math&gt;
#If &lt;math&gt;E\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)=\sup\{\mu(K)|E\supset K,K\text{ compact}\}&lt;/math&gt;
#The measure space &lt;math&gt;(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is complete

'''Proof'''

Recall the Urysohn's lemma:

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a locally compact Hausdorff space and if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is open and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact with &lt;math&gt;K\subset V&lt;/math&gt; then 

there exists &lt;math&gt;f:X\to [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f\in C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;f(K)=\{1\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{supp} f\subset V&lt;/math&gt;. This is written in 

short as &lt;math&gt;K\prec f\prec V&lt;/math&gt;

We shall first prove that if such a measure exists, then it is unique. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\mu_1,\mu_2&lt;/math&gt; are measures that satisfy (1) through (5)

It suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;\mu_1(K)=\mu_2(K)&lt;/math&gt; for every compact &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be compact and let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given. 


By (3), there exists open &lt;math&gt;V\subset X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;V\supset K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mu_1(V)&lt;\mu_1(K)+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Urysohn's lemma implies that there exists &lt;math&gt;f\in C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K\prec f\prec V&lt;/math&gt;

(1) implies that &lt;math&gt;\mu_2(K)\leq\displaystyle\int_Xfd\mu_2=\Lambda f=\int_Xfd\mu_1&lt;/math&gt;. But &lt;math&gt;\mu_1(V)&lt;\mu_1(K)+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;\mu_2(K)&lt;\mu_1(K)+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. We can similarly show that &lt;math&gt;\mu_1(K)&lt;\mu_2(K)+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mu_2(K)=\mu_1(K)&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is open in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\mu(V)=\sup\{\Lambda f|f\prec V\}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;V_1\subset V_2&lt;/math&gt; are open , then &lt;math&gt;\mu(V_1)\leq\mu(V_2)&lt;/math&gt;


If &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; then define &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)=\inf\{\mu(V)|E\subset V,V\text{ open}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_F=\{E\subset X|\mu(E)&lt;\infty,\mu(E)=\sup\{\mu(K):K\subset E,K\text{ compact}\}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\{E\subset X|E\cap K\in\Sigma_F \text{ for all }K\text{ compact in } X\}&lt;/math&gt;

monotonicity of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is obvious for all subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;


Let &lt;math&gt;E\subset X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)=0&lt;/math&gt;

It is obvious that &lt;math&gt;E\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; which implies that &lt;math&gt;E\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, we have that &lt;math&gt;\{X,\Sigma,\mu\}&lt;/math&gt; is complete. 

===Step 1===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\{E_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; then, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mu(\bigcup E_i)\leq\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_i)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof'''

Let &lt;math&gt;V_1,V_2&lt;/math&gt; be open subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. We wish to show that &lt;math&gt;\mu(V_1\cup V_2)\leq \mu(V_1)+\mu(V_2)&lt;/math&gt; 

Let &lt;math&gt;g\in C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g\prec (V_1\cup V_2)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\text{supp }g=K\subset (V_1\cup V_2)&lt;/math&gt;. By Urysohn's lemma we can find &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h_i\prec V_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_1+h_2=1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h_i\in C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;h_ig\prec V_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_1g+h_2g=g&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;


As &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a linear functional &lt;math&gt;\Lambda f\leq\Lambda g&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;f\leq g&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Lambda g=\displaystyle\int_Xh_1gd\mu+\int_Xh_2gd\mu\leq\mu(V_1)+\mu(V_2)&lt;/math&gt;


By definition, &lt;math&gt;\mu(V_1\cup V_2)=\inf\{\Lambda g|g\prec V_1\cup V_2\}&lt;/math&gt;


If &lt;math&gt;\{E_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of members of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, there exist open &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; such that given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\mu(V_i)&lt;\mu(E_i)+\frac{\epsilon}{2^i}&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;E=\bigcup E_i\subset\bigcup V_i=V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is open. Let &lt;math&gt;f\prec V&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mu(V)\geq \mu(E)&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\mu(V)&lt;\Lambda f&lt;/math&gt;


Thus &lt;math&gt;\mu(V)\leq\sum\mu(V_i)\leq\sum\mu(E_i)+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

===Step 2===
If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact, then &lt;math&gt;K\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu(K)=\inf\{\Lambda f:K\prec f\}&lt;/math&gt;


'''Proof'''

It suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;\mu(K)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; for every compact &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\alpha&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K\prec f&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}=\{x:f(x)&gt;\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is open and &lt;math&gt;K\subset V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, by Urysohn's lemma, there exists &lt;math&gt;g\in C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K\prec g\prec V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, and hence, &lt;math&gt;\alpha g\leq f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition &lt;math&gt;\Lambda g\geq \mu(K)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu(K)\leq\frac{1}{\alpha}\Lambda f&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\Lambda f&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\mu(K)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and hence, &lt;math&gt;K\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;


Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be

By definition, there exists open &lt;math&gt;V\supset K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mu(K)&gt;\mu(V)-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;


By Urysohn's lemma, there exists &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K\prec f\prec V&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt;\mu(V)\geq\Lambda f&lt;/math&gt;, that is 

&lt;math&gt;\mu(K)&gt;\Lambda f+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, &lt;math&gt;\mu(K)=\inf\{\Lambda f:K\prec f\}&lt;/math&gt;

===Step 3===
Every open set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; satisfies 

&lt;math&gt;\mu(V)=\sup\{\mu(K):K\subset V,K\text{ compact}\}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is open and &lt;math&gt;V\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu(X)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;V\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;


'''Proof'''

Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be open. Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\mu(V)&lt;/math&gt;. It suffices to show that there exists compact &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mu(K)&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. 

By definition of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;f\in C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f\prec V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda f&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;K=\text{supp}f&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously &lt;math&gt;K\subset V&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; be open such that &lt;math&gt;K\subset W&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;F\prec W&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\Lambda f\leq\mu(W)&lt;/math&gt;, further &lt;math&gt;\Lambda f\leq\mu(K)&lt;/math&gt;


Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mu(K)&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
===Step 4===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\mu(E_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;E=\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}E_i&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_i)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof'''

If &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, by step 1, we are done. 

If &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)&lt;/math&gt; is finite then, &lt;math&gt;E\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; and hence, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is countably additive on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;


Suppose, &lt;math&gt;K_1,K_2&lt;/math&gt; are compact and disjoint then &lt;math&gt;K_1,K_2\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;K_1\cup K_2\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;


Claim: &lt;math&gt;\mu(K_1\cup K_2)=\mu(K_1)+\mu(K_2)&lt;/math&gt;


As &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a locally compact Hausdorff space, there exist disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;K_1\subset V_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K_2\subset V_2&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, by Urysohn's lemma, there exists &lt;math&gt;g\in C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g\prec K_1\cup K_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda g\leq \mu(K_1\cup K_2)+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;\text{supp}fg=K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K\prec fg&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K\prec (1-f)g&lt;/math&gt;


Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mu(K_1)+\mu(K_2)&lt;\Lambda g\leq\mu(K_1+K_2)+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Assume &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Given &lt;math&gt;E_i\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;, there exists compact &lt;math&gt;H_i\subset E_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mu(H_i)&gt;\mu(E_i)-\frac{\epsilon}{2^i}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;K_N=H_1\cup H_2\cup\ldots H_N&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously, &lt;math&gt;K_N&lt;/math&gt; is compact. 

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)\geq \mu(K_N)=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^N\mu(H_i)\geq\sum_{i=1}^N\mu(E_i)-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

and hence, &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)\geq\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_i)&lt;/math&gt; By step 1, we have &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)\leq\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_i)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_i)&lt;/math&gt;
===Step 5===
If &lt;math&gt;E\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; then there exists &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; compact and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; open with &lt;math&gt;K\subset E\subset V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu(V\setminus K)&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;


'''Proof'''

&lt;math&gt;(V\setminus K)&lt;/math&gt; is open. As &lt;math&gt;E\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;, there exist compact &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and open &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K\subset E\subset V&lt;/math&gt; with 

&lt;math&gt;\mu(V)-\frac{\epsilon}{2}&lt;\mu(E)&lt;\mu(K)+\frac{\epsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;\mu(V\setminus K)&lt;\mu(V)&lt;\mu(E)+\frac{\epsilon}{2}&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; (by step 4)

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mu(V\setminus K)&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

===Step 6===
&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; is a field of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof'''

Let &lt;math&gt;A,B\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given.

There exist compact &lt;math&gt;K_1,K_2&lt;/math&gt; and open &lt;math&gt;V_1,V_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K_1\subset A\subset V_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K_2\subset A\subset V_2&lt;/math&gt; with 

&lt;math&gt;\mu(V_1\setminus K_1),\mu(V_2\setminus K_2)&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;


Write &lt;math&gt;A\setminus B=(V_1\setminus K_1)\cup (K_1\setminus V_2)\cup (V_2\setminus K_2)&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;K_1\setminus V_2&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subsetof &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; , it is compact


Then, &lt;math&gt;\mu(A\setminus B)\leq\mu(V_1\setminus K_1)\cup \mu(K_1\setminus V_2)\cup \mu(V_2\setminus K_2)=\mu(K_1\setminus V_2)+2\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

thus, &lt;math&gt;\mu(A\setminus B&lt;/math&gt; is finite and hence, &lt;math&gt;A\setminus B\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;

Now write &lt;math&gt;A\cup B=(A\setminus B)\cup B&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;A\cap B=A\setminus(A\setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;

===Step 7===
&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-field containing all Borel sets


'''Proof'''

Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be closed

Then, &lt;math&gt;C\cap K&lt;/math&gt; is compact for every &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; compact

Therefore &lt;math&gt;C\cap K\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;C\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; (by definition) and hence, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; has all closed sets. In particular, &lt;math&gt;X\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;


Let &lt;math&gt;A\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;A^c\cap K\subset K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A^c\cap K=K\setminus(K\setminus A)&lt;/math&gt; and hence, &lt;math&gt;A^c\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;A=\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A_i\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;

We know that &lt;math&gt;A_i\cap K\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; for every compact &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;B_1=A_1\cap K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_n=A_n\cap K\setminus(B_1\cup B_2\ldots\cup B_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;A\cap K=\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\mu(B_i)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and hence, &lt;math&gt;A\cap K\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;

===Step 8===
&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_F=\{E\in\Sigma:\mu(E)&lt;\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof'''

Let &lt;math&gt;E\subset \Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;E\cap K\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt; for every compact &lt;math&gt;K\subset X&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let &lt;math&gt;E\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists open &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;E\subset V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu(V)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;V\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;. Further, there exists compact &lt;math&gt;K\subset V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mu(V\setminus K)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;E\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;E\cap K\in\Sigma_F&lt;/math&gt;, that is, there exists compact &lt;math&gt;H\subset E\cap K&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;\mu(E\cap K)&lt;\mu(H)+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, &lt;math&gt;E\subset (E\cap K)\cup (V\setminus K)&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\mu(E)\leq\mu(H)+2\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary, we are done.

===Step 9===
For &lt;math&gt;f\in C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda f=\displaystyle\int_Xf d\mu&lt;/math&gt;


'''Proof'''

Without loss of generality, we may assume that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is real valued.

It is obviuos from the definition of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda f\geq \displaystyle\int_Xfd\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;K=\text{supp}f&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, &lt;math&gt;f(K)&lt;/math&gt; is compact. and we can write &lt;math&gt;f(K)\subset [a,b]&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=\{a=y_0&lt;y_1&lt;\ldots&lt;y_n=b\}&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-fine partition of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;E_i=\{x\in X|y_{i-1}&lt;f(x)&lt;y_i\}\cap K&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact, &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; is measurable for every &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and hence, &lt;math&gt;K=\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^nE_i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mu(E)=\inf\{\mu(V)|V\supset E,V\text{ open}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, we can find open sets &lt;math&gt;V_i\supset E_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mu(V_i)&lt;\mu(E_i)+\frac{\epsilon}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;y_i+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in V_i&lt;/math&gt;


We know that if compact &lt;math&gt;K\subset V_1\cup V_2\cup\ldots \cup V_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; open then there exists &lt;math&gt;h_i\in C_c(X)&lt;/math&gt; wiht &lt;math&gt;h_i\prec V_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^nh_i=1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, there exist functions &lt;math&gt;h_i\prec V_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^nh_i=1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^nh_i(x)f(x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;


By step 2, we have &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mu(K)\leq\sum_{i=1}^n\Lambda h_i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h_if&lt;(y_i+\epsilon)h_i&lt;/math&gt; on each &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda f=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n\Lambda h_if\leq\sum_{i=1}^n\Lambda h_i(y_i+\epsilon)=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i+\epsilon)\Lambda h_i+\Lambda\sum_{i=1}^n|a|h_i\right)-\Lambda\sum_{i=1}^n|a|h_i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i+\epsilon+|a|)\Lambda h_i-\Lambda\sum_{i=1}^n|a|h_i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\leq\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i+\epsilon+|a|)\left(\mu(E_i)+\frac{\epsilon}{n}\right)-\Lambda\sum_{i=1}^n|a|h_i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^ny_i\mu(E_i)+\sum_{i=1}^n\epsilon\left(\mu(E_i)+\frac{\epsilon}{n}+\frac{|a|}{n}\right)\leq\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\epsilon)\mu(E_i)+\sum_{i=1}^n\epsilon\left(2\mu(E_i)+\frac{\epsilon}{n}+\frac{|a|}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\leq\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i)\mu(E_i)+\sum_{i=1}^n\epsilon\left(2\mu(E_i)+\frac{\epsilon}{n}+\frac{|a|}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


As &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary, we have &lt;math&gt;\Lambda f\leq \displaystyle\int_Xfd\mu&lt;/math&gt; which completes the proof.

==Use, Limitations, Parameters and Options==
----

===Use===
----

The template has one parameter: Content; unformatted text for the box.  
The default state produces a pale blue band across the page for a centered Courier text entry; it is useful to emphasise a single code line.   '''It also works in wrapped text, unlike a &lt;nowiki&gt;div&lt;/nowiki&gt; template.''' 

The code to call the template into use is just:  
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{blockwrap|The code line to display goes here...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; }}
A typical application looks like this:

[[image:Gerbera_pink.jpg|200px|left]]
text here...
{{blockwrap|1=&lt;nowiki&gt;[[image:Gerbera_pink.jpg|200px|left|border]] is the image line.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
More text here...

Notice that the box displays correctly in the wrapped text, unlike the page-wide, div-based version, ''block''.   
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
===Limitations===
----
It is not possible for the parameter text to start with a wikitext heading, (&lt;nowiki&gt;==Heading==&lt;/nowiki&gt;); use the HTML form instead, (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heading&lt;/h2&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.

A Wikitext table will not render at all well.   Use an HTML table instead and avoid having the table at the start of the parameter.

At times which are not yet clarified, using the ''named'' parameter form, (&lt;nowiki&gt;1= The parameter text...&lt;/nowiki&gt;), works well when the ''unnamed'' equivalent,(&lt;nowiki&gt;The parameter text...&lt;/nowiki&gt;)  does not.      

===Options===
----
;background:   background color, pale blue
;color:   font color, black
;ff:   font family or face, Courier
;fs:   font size, 10pt
;ta:   text alignment, center
;lh:   line height, 1.4em

The defaults produce a pale blue band in the page for a centered text entry.

1. Na+ has larger radius than Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

Br- has larger radius than cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

Na+ has lower charge than Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

Therefore Stronger attraction between MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ions

2. rearrange:

enthalpy change of formation = atomisation enthalpies + electron affinity + lattice enthalpy

3. The size of the ions 
The charge of the ions 

4. The first electron affinity is the enthalpy change when one electron is added to each gaseous atom in one mole, to form one mole of 1- ions

5. Increasing temperature down group, this is because down the group, ionic radius increase, so charge density decrease, so thermal stability increases down the group.

Distorted ion breaks down more easily

      <comment>/* Helmet */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic gear ==
=== Shoes ===
Climbing shoes should be tight, but not cause pain. Entry level shoes will have flatter soles, while those that arch are meant for more skilled climbers.

=== Chalk ===
Just as in certain types of gymnastics, rock-climbers typically use chalk (in fact usually magnesium carbonate) for drying their hands to prevent slipping. Chalk comes in three general forms; blocks, powder inside balls of cloth, and liquid.

Blocks of chalk tend to cruble and make a mess so some gyms don't allow their use. Liquid chalk is a mixture of powdered chalk with a volatile liquid which evaporates in a matter of seconds, leaving a relatively long lasting coating of chalk. Chalk balls are probably the most common of the three.

=== Helmet ===
Some climbers use a helmet to protect themselves in high falls, or from falling rocks and other objects.

== Top-roping ==
=== Harness ===
Unless when bouldering, climbers are usually secured with a rope which is attached to the climber's harnesses, a webbed belt that fits around one's waist and thighs. The belayer will typically also wear a harness to which the belay device is attached, using the belayer's weight as an anchor.

=== Rope ===
=== Carabiners and webbing ===
You will need a few for the anchors.

== Lead-climbing ==
=== Quickdraws ===
These are pairs of carabiners connected with webbing. These are clipped into anchors bolted into the face of the rock.

=== Removable protection ===
On traditional lead climbes where there are no bolts, protection devices are secured in places such as cracks by the lead, and cleared by the second. These include:
* Aluminum or steel nuts
* Hexagonal-shaped chocks
* Slings
* Spring loaded camming device
* Tricams

== The basic idea ==
A vector is a mathematical concept that has both magnitude and direction.   Detailed explanation of vectors may be found at the Wikibooks module [[Linear Algebra/Vectors in Space]]. In physics, vectors are used to describe things happening in [[w:space|space]] by giving a series of quantities which relate to the problem's [[w:coordinate system|coordinate system]].

A vector is often expressed as a series of numbers.  For example, in the two-dimensional space of real numbers, the notation (1, 1) represents a vector that is pointed 45 degrees from the x-axis towards the y-axis with a magnitude of &lt;math&gt; \sqrt 2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Commonly in physics, we use '''position vectors''' to describe where something is in the  space we are considering, or how its position is changing at that moment in time. Position vectors are written as summations of '''scalars''' multiplied by '''unit vectors'''. For example:

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \hat{i} + b \hat{j} + c \hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
where a, b and c are scalars and &lt;math&gt;\hat{i}, \hat{j}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt; are ''unit vectors'' of the [[w:Cartesian|Cartesian]] (René Descartes) coordinate system. A unit vector is a special vector which has magnitude 1 and points along one of the coordinate frame's axes. This is better illustrated by a diagram.

A vector itself is typically indicated by either an arrow: &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;, or just by boldface type: '''v''', so the vector above as a complete equation would be denoted as:

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{v} = a \hat{i} + b \hat{j} + c \hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The magnitude of a vector is computed by &lt;math&gt; |\vec{v}| = \sqrt{\sum_i(x_i^2)}&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, in two-dimensional space, this equation reduces to:
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
For three-dimensional space, this equation becomes:

==Using vectors in physics==

Many problems, particularly in mechanics, involve the use of two- or three-dimensional space to describe where objects are and what they are doing. Vectors can be used to condense this information into a precise and easily understandable form that is easy to manipulate with mathematics.

Position - or where something is, can be shown using a '''position vector'''. Position vectors measure how far something is from the '''origin''' of the reference frame and in what direction, and are usually, though not always, given the symbol &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;. It is usually good practice to use &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; for position vectors when describing your solution to a problem as most physicists use this notation. 

Velocity is defined as the '''rate of change of position with respect to time'''. You may be used to writing velocity, v, as a scalar because it was assumed in your solution that v referred to speed in the direction of travel. However, if we take the strict definition and apply it to the position vector - which we have already established is the proper way of representing position - we get:

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \frac{da}{dt}\hat{i} + \frac{db}{dt}\hat{j} + \frac{dc}{dt}\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, we note that the unit vectors are merely notation rather than terms themselves and are in fact not differentated, only the scalars which represent the vector's components in each direction differentiate.

Assuming that each component is not a constant and thus has a non-zero derivative, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\vec{v} = a' \hat{i} + b' \hat{j} + c' \hat{k}&lt;/math&gt; where a', b' and c' are simply the first derivatives with respect to time of each original position vector component.

Here it is clear that velocity is also a vector. In the real world this means that each component of the velocity vector indicates how quickly each component of the position vector is changing - that is, how fast the object is moving in each direction.

= Vectors in Mechanics =
Vector notation is ubiquitous in the modern literature on solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, biomechanics, nonlinear finite elements and a host of other subjects in mechanics.  A student has to be familiar with the notation in order to be able to read the literature.  In this section we introduce the notation that is used, common operations in vector algebra, and some ideas from vector calculus.

== Vectors ==
A vector is an ''object'' that has certain properties.  What are these properties?  We usually say that these properties are:
* a vector has a magnitude (or length) 
* a vector has a direction.  

To make the definition of the vector object more precise we may also say that vectors are objects that satisfy the properties of a [[w:Vector space|vector space]].

The standard notation for a vector is lower case bold type (for example &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt;).

In Figure 1(a) you can see a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; in red.  This vector can be represented in component form with respect to the ''basis'' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2\,&lt;/math&gt;) as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{a} = a_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_2 \,
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_2\,&lt;/math&gt; are ''orthonormal unit vectors''. Orthonormal means they are at right angles to each other (''orthogonal'') and are unit vectors.  Recall that ''unit vectors'' are vectors of length 1.   These vectors are also called ''basis'' vectors.  

You could also represent the same vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; in terms of another set of basis vectors (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}_1,\mathbf{g}_2\,&lt;/math&gt;) as shown in Figure 1(b). In that case, the components of the vector are &lt;math&gt;(b_1,b_2)\,&lt;/math&gt; and we can write
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{a} = b_1 \mathbf{g}_1 + b_2 \mathbf{g}_2 \, ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;
Note that the basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}_2\,&lt;/math&gt; do not necessarily have to be unit vectors.  All we need is that they be ''linearly independent'', that is, it should not be possible for us to represent one solely in terms of the others.

In three dimensions, using an ''orthonormal basis'', we can write the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{a} = a_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_3 \,
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_3\,&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to both &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_2\,&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the usual basis in which we express arbitrary vectors.
&lt;!--|[[File:VectorBasis.png|thumb|center|400px|Figure 1: A vector and its basis.]]--&gt;

== Vector Algebra Operations ==
Some vector operations are shown in Figure 2.
&lt;!--[[File:VectorOperations.png|thumb|center|400px|Figure 2: Vector operations.]]--&gt;

=== Addition and Subtraction ===  
If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; are vectors, then the sum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; is also a vector (see Figure 2(a)).

The two vectors can also be subtracted from one another to give another vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Multiplication by a scalar ===  
Multiplication of a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; by a scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; has the effect of stretching or shrinking the vector (see Figure 2(b)).

You can form a unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat\mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; that is parallel to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; by dividing by the length of the vector &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{b}|\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;
    \hat\mathbf{b} = \frac{\mathbf{b}}{|\mathbf{b}|} ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Scalar product of two vectors ===
The ''scalar'' product or ''inner'' product or ''dot'' product of two vectors is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = |\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}|\cos(\theta)
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the two vectors (see Figure 2(b)).

If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; are perpendicular to each other, &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi/2\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{b}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The dot product therefore has the geometric interpretation as the length of the projection of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; onto the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat\mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; when the two vectors are placed so that they start from the same point.

The scalar product leads to a scalar quantity and can also be written in component form (with respect to a given basis) as
:&lt;math&gt;
    {\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{b}} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 = \sum_{i=1..3} a_i b_i~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

If the vector is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensional, the dot product is written as
:&lt;math&gt;
    {\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{b}} = \sum_{i=1..n} a_i b_i~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

Using the Einstein summation convention, we can also write the scalar product as 
:&lt;math&gt;
    {\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{b}} = a_i b_i~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

Also notice that the following also hold for the scalar product
  
#&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{b}} = {\mathbf{b}}\cdot{\mathbf{a}}&lt;/math&gt; (commutative law).
#&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{a}}\cdot{(\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c})} = {\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{b}} + {\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{c}}&lt;/math&gt; (distributive law).

=== Vector product of two vectors ===
The ''vector'' product (or ''cross'' product) of two vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; is another vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}\,&lt;/math&gt; defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{c} = {\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}} = |\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}|\sin(\theta) \hat{\mathbf{c}}
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{c}}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\,&lt;/math&gt; in the right-handed sense (see Figure 3 for a geometric interpretation)

&lt;!--[[File:VectorCross.png|thumb|center|400px|Figure 3: Vector product of two vectors.]]--&gt;

In terms of the orthonormal basis &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2,\mathbf{e}_3)\,&lt;/math&gt;, the cross product can be written in the form of a determinant
:&lt;math&gt;
    {\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}} = 
       \begin{vmatrix}
         \mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \mathbf{e}_3 \\
          a_1  &amp; a_2   &amp; a_3 \\
          b_1  &amp; b_2   &amp; b_3
       \end{vmatrix}~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

In index notation, the cross product can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
    {\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}} \equiv e_{ijk} a_j b_k ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the Levi-Civita symbol (also called the permutation symbol, alternating tensor).

== Identities from Vector Algebra ==
Some useful vector identities are given below.
  
# &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}} = - {\mathbf{b}}\times{\mathbf{a}}&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}} = {\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}} + {\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{c}}&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{a}}\times{({\mathbf{b}}\times{\mathbf{c}})} = \mathbf{b}({\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{c}}) - \mathbf{c}({\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{b}})&lt;/math&gt; ~.
# &lt;math&gt;{({\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}})}\times{\mathbf{c}} = \mathbf{b}({\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{c}}) - \mathbf{a}({\mathbf{b}}\cdot{\mathbf{c}})&lt;/math&gt; ~.
# &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{a}} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;~.
# &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{a}}\cdot{({\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}})} = 
{\mathbf{b}}\cdot{({\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}})} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;~.
# &lt;math&gt;{({\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}})}\cdot{\mathbf{c}} = {\mathbf{a}}\cdot{({\mathbf{b}}\times{\mathbf{c}})}&lt;/math&gt;~.

== Vector Calculus ==
So far we have dealt with constant vectors.  It also helps if the vectors are allowed to vary in space.  Then we can define derivatives and integrals and deal with vector fields. Some basic ideas of vector calculus are discussed below.

== Derivative of a vector valued function==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; be a vector function that can be represented as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{a}(x) = a_1(x) \mathbf{e}_1 + a_2(x) \mathbf{e}_2 + a_3(x) \mathbf{e}_3\,
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar.

Then the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{d\mathbf{a}(x)}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}
      \cfrac{\mathbf{a}(x+\Delta x) - \mathbf{a}(x)}{\Delta x} = 
      \cfrac{da_1(x)}{dx} \mathbf{e}_1 + \cfrac{da_2(x)}{dx} \mathbf{e}_2 + \cfrac{da_3(x)}{dx} \mathbf{e}_3~.
  &lt;/math&gt;
Note: In the above equation, the unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; ''(i=1,2,3)'' are assumed constant.&lt;br&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; are two vector functions, then from the chain rule we get
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \cfrac{d({\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\mathbf{b}})}{x} &amp; = 
       {\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\cfrac{d\mathbf{b}}{dx}} + {\cfrac{d\mathbf{a}}{dx}}\cdot{\mathbf{b}} \\
    \cfrac{d({\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}})}{dx} &amp; = 
       {\mathbf{a}}\times{\cfrac{d\mathbf{b}}{dx}} + {\cfrac{d\mathbf{a}}{dx}}\times{\mathbf{b}} \\
    \cfrac{d[{\mathbf{a}}\cdot{({\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}})}]}{dt} &amp; = 
       {\cfrac{d\mathbf{a}}{dt}}\cdot{({\mathbf{b}}\times{\mathbf{c}})} + 
       {\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\left({\cfrac{d\mathbf{b}}{dt}}\times{\mathbf{c}}\right)} + 
       {\mathbf{a}}\cdot{\left({\mathbf{b}}\times{\cfrac{d\mathbf{c}}{dt}}\right)}
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Scalar and vector fields ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\,&lt;/math&gt; be the position vector of any point in space.  Suppose that 
there is a ''scalar function'' (&lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt;) that assigns a value to each point in space. Then 
:&lt;math&gt;
    g = g(\mathbf{x})\,
  &lt;/math&gt;
represents a ''scalar field''.  An example of a scalar field is the ''temperature''.  See Figure4(a).
&lt;!--[[File:VectorField.png|thumb|400px|Figure 4: Scalar and vector fields.]]--&gt;

If there is a ''vector function'' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt;) that assigns a vector to each point in space, then
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{a}(\mathbf{x})\,
  &lt;/math&gt;
represents a ''vector field''.  An example is the ''displacement'' field.  See Figure 4(b).

== Gradient of a scalar field ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi(\mathbf{x})\,&lt;/math&gt; be a scalar function.  Assume that the partial derivatives of the function are continuous in some region of space.  If the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\,&lt;/math&gt; has coordinates (&lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, x_3\,&lt;/math&gt;) with respect to the basis (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \mathbf{e}_3\,&lt;/math&gt;), the ''gradient'' of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}{\varphi} = \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x_1}~\mathbf{e}_1 + 
                     \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x_2}~\mathbf{e}_2 + 
                     \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x_3}~\mathbf{e}_3 ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;
In index notation,
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}{\varphi} \equiv \varphi_{,i}~\mathbf{e}_i ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;
The gradient is obviously a ''vector'' and has a direction.  We can think of the gradient at &lt;u&gt;a point being the vector perpendicular to the level contour at that point&lt;/u&gt;.

It is often useful to think of the symbol &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}{}&lt;/math&gt; as an operator of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}{} = \frac{\partial }{\partial x_1} ~\mathbf{e}_1 + 
              \frac{\partial }{\partial x_2} ~\mathbf{e}_2 + 
              \frac{\partial }{\partial x_3} ~\mathbf{e}_3 ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

== Divergence of a vector field ==
If we form a scalar product of a vector field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})\,&lt;/math&gt; with the &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}{}&lt;/math&gt; operator, we get a ''scalar'' quantity called the 
''divergence'' of the vector field.  Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{\mathbf{u}} = \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_1} + \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_2} + \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_3} ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

In index notation,
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{\mathbf{u}} \equiv u_{i,i} ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{\mathbf{u}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}\,&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''divergence-free'' field.

The physical significance of the divergence of a vector field is the rate at which some ''density'' exits a given region of space.  In the absence of the creation or destruction of matter, the density within a region of space can change only by having it flow into or out of the region.

== Curl of a vector field ==  
The ''curl'' of a vector field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})\,&lt;/math&gt; is a ''vector'' defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times{\mathbf{u}} = \det
       \begin{vmatrix}
         \mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \mathbf{e}_3 \\
         \frac{\partial }{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial }{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{\partial }{\partial x_3} \\ 
         u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3 \\
       \end{vmatrix}
  &lt;/math&gt;

The physical significance of the curl of a vector field is the amount of rotation or angular momentum of the contents of a region of space.

== Laplacian of a scalar or vector field ==
The ''Laplacian'' of a scalar field &lt;math&gt;\varphi(\mathbf{x})\,&lt;/math&gt; is a ''scalar'' defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \nabla^2{\varphi} := \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{\boldsymbol{\nabla}{\varphi}} = \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial x_1} + 
     \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial x_2} + \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial x_3}~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

The Laplacian of a vector field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})\,&lt;/math&gt; is a vector defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \nabla^2{\mathbf{u}} := (\nabla^2{u_1}) \mathbf{e}_1 + (\nabla^2{u_2}) \mathbf{e}_2 + (\nabla^2{u_3}) \mathbf{e}_3 ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

== Identities in vector calculus ==
Some frequently used identities from vector calculus are listed below.
  
#&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{\mathbf{a}} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{\mathbf{b}}&lt;/math&gt;~.
#&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times{(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times{\mathbf{a}} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times{\mathbf{b}}&lt;/math&gt;~.
#&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{(\varphi\mathbf{a})} = {(\boldsymbol{\nabla}{\varphi})}\cdot{\mathbf{a}} + \varphi (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{\mathbf{a}})&lt;/math&gt;~.
#&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times{(\varphi\mathbf{a})} = {(\boldsymbol{\nabla}{\varphi})}\times{\mathbf{a}} + \varphi (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times{\mathbf{a}})&lt;/math&gt;~.
#&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{({\mathbf{a}}\times{\mathbf{b}})} = {\mathbf{b}}\cdot{(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times{\mathbf{a}})} -                 {\mathbf{a}}\cdot{(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times{\mathbf{b}})}&lt;/math&gt;~.

== Green-Gauss Divergence Theorem ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})\,&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous and differentiable vector field on a body &lt;math&gt;\Omega\,&lt;/math&gt; with boundary &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;.  The ''divergence theorem'' states that 
:&lt;math&gt;
    {
    \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot{\mathbf{u}}~dV = \int_{\Gamma} {\mathbf{n}}\cdot{\mathbf{u}}~dA
    }
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the outward unit normal to the surface (see Figure 5).

In index notation,
:&lt;math&gt;
    \int_{\Omega} u_{i,i}~dV = \int_{\Gamma} n_i u_i~dA
  &lt;/math&gt;

I initially tagged one of these stand-alone pages created by 128.82.64.* for [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deletion]]. Then, on a closer look, I began to feel as  if some of these subjects themselves could be notable. Since I am not sure whether these biographies should be deleted or transwikied to Wikipedia, I've decided to list them here. &lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ravichandar84|My coffee shop]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 09:03, 30 October 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}} I [[Talk:History of the ODU Art Department|chatted]] with [[User:Rnickle|Rnickle]] about this and am convince that once cleaned up, these chapters will be a good fit for Wikibooks.  They were intended to be chapters to [[Oduart]] (which has been renamed [[History of the ODU Art Department]]).  As a student project, they are planning to document the history of their art department, starting with current faculty and working backwards.  I am convinced that the situation will improve. They are in the process of moving the chapters where they belong.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:36, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

This book advocates the murder of human beings.  I don't think it should have a home here. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:30, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

* &lt;s&gt;'''Delete''' --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:30, 4 November 2008 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt; This work is no longer recognizable as the original I nominated. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:53, 6 November 2008 (UTC)
* [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' Cannibalism is a valid subject to cover and this page was just created today. Needs time to see if this is going to go anywhere and going to involve into a serious book or not before any decision is made. In the mean time NPOV should be encouraged and attempts should be made to help move this in the right direction. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:41, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' IMO, the &quot;How to&quot; pretty much eliminates the possibility of NPOV.  Step one gives advice on how to kill someone (bribe the police first, use a hammer or an ax, choose the victim carefully).  I don't think this has any hope of rehab. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:52, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
*While one could have a textbook ''about'' cannibalism, the argument that ''How to practise cannibalism'' is a valid topic for a textook is not convincing. Some how-tos are valid textbook topics, however this one is not. The difference lies in the whether a reputable educational institution (defined very loosely) would ever have a course on this subject. Unless the scope of the book changes such that it is a text ''about'' cannibalism, this is [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''not''' the type of content Wikibooks was intended to host. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:03, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
*: Wikibooks has an entire [[Subject:How-tos|How to]] section of books which many of which probably wouldn't be taught in a course. How to practice cannibalism sounds fine if it were to cover the risks and dangers involved in practicing cannibalism, ways that cannibalism is practice in different parts of the world, why people practice cannibalism, how to properly cut and prepare the meat, etc. for example. How would this be inappropriate in the light of books like &quot;How to solve the Rubik's Cube&quot; or &quot;Drugs:Fact and Fiction&quot;, or the recipe for &quot;Magic Brownies&quot;? I think some sort of warning or disclaimer should also be required, but if this can develop properly it should be allowed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:35, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
*::The principle I described says there is ''not'' any problem with [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction]], nor [[How to solve the Rubik's Cube]], nor [[Cookbook:Magic Brownie]], so I'm not sure how that constitutes a rebuttal. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:42, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
*:::Do you know of any reputable educational institution that would have a cooking class that would teach how to make magic brownies, would teach how to use drugs socially, or would have a course on how to solve the Rubik's Cube? Also Wikibooks is for instruction manuals and self learning, not just for books that cover material that might be covered in a reputable educational institution. While I would never be interested in practicing cannibalism myself, other people might, and it might be ok for them to do so in certain parts of the world, just like social drug use and eating magic brownies might be ok in some parts of the world. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:54, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
*:::: Step one in the book is to bribe the police.  That pretty much implies that the book won't be used where cannibalism is legal.  Further, I seriously doubt that the practice is legal ''anywhere.''  But IANAL. I assume the next book that passes a vfd (if this one does) will be called &quot;How to Rape Babies.&quot; Step one, bribe the police.  Step two, choose the victim carefully, etc.  IMO, this contributor is not making a serious effort to make a scholarly contribution.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 20:37, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
* [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' -- Book designed just to make a point and is inappropriate for Wikibooks.  Seems like simple trolling to me, or some way to make WB a forum. [[User:Bastique|Bastique]] ([[User talk:Bastique|talk]]) 20:39, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
* [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' If this book is allowed, it could encourage all sorts of offensive material. There could come a point when the kinds of institutions we would like to use our books would blacklist the whole site. Freedom of speech is a fine thing, but there are plenty of other places on the internet to cater for special interests. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 00:59, 5 November 2008 (UTC)
*&lt;s&gt; '''Delete'''. Wikibooks is censored by community concensus, and this is precisely the kind of lousy material that I hope the community decides to censor. This book has no academic benefit as is. A book about the history and culture of cannibalism would make an interesting case study about sociology, anthropology, and psychology, but this book is not that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:12, 5 November 2008 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
*'''Comment''' This book isn't a week old (i didn't realize that earlier), so I'm not going to vote to delete it yet. It's our policy (and I submit that it is a good one) that we don't delete books that are newer then 7 days, so hopefully all this criticism will help that book improve to meet our standards. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:56, 5 November 2008 (UTC)
*: '''Comment''' This is material was created today, which means it has hardly had a chance to develop into anything beneficial yet. There shouldn't be need to rush, it can always be deleted later if it proves to not be developed any further into something academical. I think because this was brought up here and not simply speedy deleted suggests that someone may have either had some doubts or someone previously disagreed, so some time should be given to see what happens. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:30, 5 November 2008 (UTC)
*: '''Comment''' I like the concept of timeout but we could argue that every speedy tag on the grounds of no meaningful content on similarly recent creations could then require the same safenet. The VFD already provides a timeout (and a warning to the editors to take action), so no special protection is needed, if there is an interest on the content (even by the editors) the discussion it will generate will guarantee time for reshaping and reanalysis.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:07, 5 November 2008 (UTC) 
*::There are very specific criteria for speedy deletions, and a page satisfying those criteria can be deleted by an admin, at their discretion, at any time. If a page does not meet those criteria, or if an admin is not certain about it, it can be listed here on VfD after 1 week. We give them a week so that authors can work to make pages acceptable if they do not start out acceptable. A number of voters here have suggested that a book about cannibalism would be acceptable in certain circumstances, so this author should have the opportunity to take this feedback and bring the book up to a higher level of quality to avoid deletion. No book is perfect when it is first created, and a discerning eye is needed to see what books have potential to become acceptable with time, and which books do not. This book does have some potential, if only a small amount. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:52, 5 November 2008 (UTC)
*:::That is more or less what I said. The criteria does not cover every instance and the definition of meaningful content is highly personal and therefore open to bias, in any case I was referring to the need of a protection timeout of the content even if you are free to do so, I don't see it a needful or a valid argumentation to keep something, the existing processes already provides time for corrections in case there is no meaningful content (like this case). What has been said is that the topic has merit and shouldn't be the reason or a valid motivation to the deletion, having expectation that the original author is interested in that, examining what already was written there, is being extremely optimistic, I would put my opes on a new contributor but even then we would mostly get a valid stub.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:24, 5 November 2008 (UTC)     
:&lt;del&gt;'''Keep'''&lt;/del&gt; I agree with Darklama that the topic is justifiable. I think the two camps on this can actually come together, but the poor state of the book doesn't make it easy. I didn't see much use in the material there. This book was created as a joke, and while I think the subject does deserve to be treated (properly) here at Wikibooks, the content wasn't useful.
: I decided that supporting dribble on principle wasn't a productive stance in light of how strongly some Wikibookians are offended by this sort of material. I went to the page and rewrote the intro before proceeding to trim the useless content. Well, before I knew it, I'd deleted the whole text. There was pretty much nothing of the original content to be saved.
: I would happily support a book on [[Cannibalism]] and would find a treatise on it interesting (by coincidence I watched a documentary about a Japanese man's quest for truth and justice for the execution and cannabalisation of fellow soldiers during food shortage when stationed in South-East Asia). The stub that was nominated for deletion bore no such useful material. I'm currently considering changing my vote to '''delete''' on the grounds that the book has ''no meaningful content''.
: I would like to ask those in favour of that to change their votes accordingly so that we can get this over and done with without making this discussion into a long-winded discussion about censorship. There are better venues and test-cases for that purpose. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:04, 5 November 2008 (UTC)
:: &lt;del&gt;'''Delete''' No meaningful content.&lt;/del&gt; --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:31, 5 November 2008 (UTC)
:: [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' The nominated book has been replaced with meaningful conent. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:34, 6 November 2008 (UTC)

* &lt;s&gt;'''Delete'''&lt;/s&gt; - Even if the subject could be interesting as mentioned, another name should be selected. The stub does incentive killing, and the content is unscientific almost in breach of NPOV, most of it is unusable (but the concept of a real book on the subject would be interesting indeed...). If no one makes any changes to it until the discussion is closed, I think it serves no propose. If the content does improve I'll revise my position.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:00, 5 November 2008 (UTC)
* [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' - Now we have a proper stub. But a rename is in order.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:07, 6 November 2008 (UTC) 

*[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' - as I've already voted delete; please take a look at the creators deleted contributions as well as his username, which seems to be a nod to the fictional cannibalistic anti-hero Hannibal Lector of ''Silence of the Lambs''.  I am fairly certain this work has no useful purpose whatsoever and is only here to push the envelope.  It's point-making to an extreme.  [[User:Bastique|Bastique]] ([[User talk:Bastique|talk]]) 19:32, 5 November 2008 (UTC)
*: [[Special:DeletedContributions/HannibalStrikes]]
*: I agree. This book has been completely rewritten and does not even resemble the content created and nominated. If people are committed to writing a decent book on cannabalism, then it should be moved to a better title. I suspect people might have better things to do with their time; in which case we should probably just delete this. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:07, 6 November 2008 (UTC)
*:: I don't think there should be any immediate need for someone to show an interest in this work, anyone can come along at anytime and easily improve it in its current form easily. I think this is a good stub now rather than meaningless content. Perhaps bring this up for deletion again in a few months if interest does not materialize and people still feel this should be deleted? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:20, 6 November 2008 (UTC)
*::: I agree that the book has been turned into a reasonable stub. I'm just still a little annoyed by it's origins. Why didn't we just delete this for the meaningless crap that it was and create a new book from scrap. Just like {{User|HannibalStrikes}}'s [[How to hunt tigers]] book, this one should have been speedily deleted.

The traditional recipe for Liverpool Scouse, also known as &quot;lobscouse&quot;:

==Ingredients==

* A cheap cut of lamb, or in earlier days, mutton (such as breast or forequarter)
* A little oil
* Chopped onions
* Carrots
* Water or meat stock
* Potatoes

==Method==

* Remove the meat from the bone (if needed) and dice it.
* Warm a little oil in a large saucepan.
* Add the meat, and brown it.
* Add the chopped onions, carrots, and water or meat stock, and as many potatoes as possible.

The sauce is not thickened, and it is usual to serve with preserved beetroot or red cabbage and white bread with butter. An even more impoverished variety of this dish is 'blind Scouse', which features no meat.</text>

==Recipe 1==
Note: Finely chopping the dates helps make a really gooey cake - but some people prefer to chop the dates roughly, so that they're more obvious in the finished pudding.
===Ingredients===
====For the cake====
* 250g self-raising flour
* 100g unsalted butter, room temperature
* 250g caster sugar
* 2 large or 3 medium eggs
* 250g dates (without stones), finely chopped
* 300ml water
* 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
* 1 teaspoon vanilla essence
====For the toffee sauce====
* 400 ml whipping cream
* 2/3 cups dark, soft brown sugar (e.g. muscovado)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla essence
* 375g unsalted butter

===Method===
* Preheat oven to 180ºC/360ºF.
* Cream together the butter, sugar and vanilla. You can do this by beating it in a bowl with a wooden spoon for about 5 minutes, taking care to break up the crystals and smooth the mixture out as much as possible. Or do it using an electric blender if you prefer.
* Add the eggs, one at a time, beating in after you've added each egg.
* Fold in the flour.
* Now, bring the water to the boil and add the dates. Add the bicarb and immediately take the pan off the heat. Let it cool slightly, then add to the mixture.
* Pour the mixture into a greased cake-tin (make sure you use one with enough room for the cake to rise!).
* Bake in the oven for 40 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean.
* Remove from the oven and set aside to cool a little while you make the sauce.
* To make the sauce:
** Mix the four ingredients in a saucepan.
** Heat gently, stirring often to make sure that the mixture doesn't separate.
** Once the mixture looks like a smooth sauce and is nice and warm, it's ready. Don't allow it to bubble.
* Divide the cake into portions and poke holes all over the top with a skewer or chopstick.
* Pour the sauce over the top of the cake, making sure it gets in the holes.

Serve with cream, custard, or ice-cream.

==Recipe 2 (without dates)==
===Ingredients===
====For the cake====
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
* 1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
* 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup chopped toasted walnuts

====For the toffee sauce====
* 1 cup whipping cream
* 2/3 cups sugar
* 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter

===Method===

* Preheat oven to 350 F.
* Sift dry ingredients together. 
* Cream butter, sugar and eggs together. 
* Combine wet and dry ingredients, mixing just until blended. Mix in walnuts. 
* Pour batter into 8x8 buttered pan and bake until skewer comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
* Meanwhile, make the toffee sauce:
** Combine half of cream with sugar and butter in heavy large saucepan. 
** Boil over medium-high heat until mixture thickens slightly and is deep golden, stirring constantly, about 10 minutes. 
** Remove from heat; cool 5 minutes. 
** Gradually whisk in remainder of cream (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir over low heat until mixture is smooth.
* Poke warm cake all over with a chopstick or the handle of a wooden spoon and pour half of toffee sauce over, making sure it soaks into all parts of the cake. Let sit for at least 30 minutes.

Serve warm, topped with remaining toffee sauce and creme fraiche or unsweetened whipped cream.

Makes about 9 servings.

==Beginner's Guide Issues==
When I look at the PDF file of the Beginner's guid, it only goes to the beginning of &quot;Introducing the Bezier Curve&quot; and then there's a blank page and that's it. That's only a total of 140 pages. What happened to the rest? Has anyone else had this issue? --[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DotDarkCloud DotDarkCloud] 26:24 GMT -3:30 September 15th 2007
--
Yes, I have the same issue with the PDF of the ''Noob to Pro'' Beginner Tutorials. It's now 12 Jan 2008--four months following the original post on this topic. Hello?
--[[User:Seajasonq|Seajasonq]] ([[User talk:Seajasonq|talk]]) 20:07, 12 January 2008 (UTC)

STILL an issue a year later! Who can fix this?

== I'm back ==

I've decided I'd like to return to work on Noob to Pro for awhile. I have a very specific vision for this book and I would like to get back to making it happen. There's two kinds of people I need right now: editors and content-contributors (authors).  I'd like to organize the ranks and hand out some specific tasks/duties. Let me know what you're interested in doing and I'll get you started. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:00, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

:I would be willing to try to clean up the table of contents and clean up the naming scheme used for this book. In theory that should help improve the orginization of the book. I tend to be bias twords having the table of contents on a seperate page from the other information included so its more like a traditional book in that its seperated from the rest of the contents. That would be one of the things I would do if its acceptable. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:03, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

::Great!  Sounds like you're interested in editorship work!  The book sure does need some help in page-naming and TOC organization.  I'm open to your suggestions on TOC, but I have some very particular requirements for page names... I want them to be fun!  I would like key points introduced in the tutorials to be listed in the TOC as well, after the name of the page and completion icon.

::Take a look at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Team]] and put your name in there under Editors.  Add the tasks you're working on and assign yourself to them.  What you propose to do could have major impacts on the entire book, so please explain to me exactly what changes you would like to make in detail.

::--[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 17:08, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

::: Actually when it comes to page names, I was just talking about fixing any inconsistencies in how they are named. I don't really have any major name changes in mind that I can think of. Just making sure that &quot;All Are Like This&quot;, since just a few &quot;Are like this instead&quot;. Having key points of each chapter listed on the table of contents sounds fine to me, I just wonder if a chapter that introduces what the other chapters are about might be better? That way the table of contents isn't too big. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:11, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

: I'm here to help, There are some pages that need some cleaning and some pages that need some deleting (like the creating a volcano page needs either deletion or major reform). I'll get right on track and fix the disgusting animation page, and I might need to add more pages such as lattices and I might even use a whole page for IPO curves(they're better than you think). Let's get this rollin! --[[User:Danthemango|Danthemango]] April 2007

: I can help (some). I was a noob that went through this book, learning much, but still seeing the room for improvement. For example, I skipped some of the modelling tutorials because I found that I got a lot of the noobish commands by then. Maybe it is just that I am a quick learner. By now I am not a noob (only a semi-noob). While I may not be up to the challenge of overhauling the entire modelling section, I can still help edit here and there.

== The torrent link is dead ==

Just that. It would be nice to put back a working torrent link, and maybe an Azureus magnet link. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:69.157.251.37|69.157.251.37]] ([[User talk:69.157.251.37|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/69.157.251.37|contribs]]) 04:13, 29 January 2007.&lt;/small&gt;

: I have removed the dead torrent link. My average bandwidth usage for hosting the PDF file is only 13 GB a month (about 130 downloads each day), so it isn't really necessary to maintain a torrent. [[User:Nivix|Nivix]] 06:55, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

== pdf-link dead ==

I've been trying to download the &quot;Noob to Pro&quot;-pdf yesterday and today. Without being successful. The reason maybe that nivix.net is not online for at least I can not access it.

If everybody desperately needs a PDF copy of these tutorials, we could create a PDF from the printable page in something like PDFCreator.--[[User:DTR|DTR]] 15:00, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

I've made one if you want to use it: [[:Image:Blender 3D Noob to Pro - Beginner Tutorials.pdf]] -- [[User:Kitsune07|Kitsune07]] 13:52, 14 April 2007

== Wow... someone gutted this book. ==

There seems to be a very big problem with people taking out detail from these pages. I was so enchanted with the manual that I found here in december 2006. Now, it's really a much easier pathway for a newbie - but a pathway which doesn't lead very far into the mountains and valleys of learning the interface. Think about how a college textbook in a college is written - it has a lot of detail packed into the pages, for a reason. Even though it's harder to read, there is more inherent value when there's more detail. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:205.201.201.42|205.201.201.42]] ([[User talk:205.201.201.42|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/205.201.201.42|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

:You're probably referring to the work I'm doing in transferring tutorials to a more visual approach with lots of screenshots and such.  I pulled out a lot of stuff to yes, make it easier for beginners, and will teach the more detailed stuff in later tutorials where it's more appropriate and when it's needed.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 15:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

:: While, I'm not sure what could be done to improve this book, I do agree that this book use to be better back when I downloaded the single page version for a friend sometime last year. However I do have some thoughts that might help. I think the first chapter should be a walkthrough of blender showing what all blender has to offer and can be used for, and to help familiarize readers with the interface. The various tutorials should probably be unified to work towards creating one thing which requires use of all that blender has to offer, but which can be broken up into chapters of related tools or features to create parts of that one thing, so that by the time readers have finished the book, a firm grasp of how to create anything that can be achieved. This approach might minimize some duplications and allow chapters to build on one another more easily and allow readers to build on whats already been covered rather then having to start over if they are trying to following the examples. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:48, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

== Layout and Reading Flow ==

I'm editing the Interface section and noticing that the caption blocks sometimes make it difficult to keep track of the main point. For example, the sections on Blender Units and the Active Window, while related and important, interrupt reading flow and may impact comprehension. I think moving these and the introductory blocks off the image and making them body text would help clarify the examples as only the relevant text blocks will be directly overlaid. I think it would also make the examples more &quot;at a glance&quot; useful when reviewing, as I often did when I first read this book. [[User:Winterbourne|Winterbourne]] 07:07, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:I'm the one that changed those to the visual approach, and I've gotten a bit of feedback similar to yours.  I think I'm going to have to go back to the body/paragraph format and use the image/text combos to highlight important parts of the interface.  Unfortunately I don't have any time now as I am preparing for Siggraph, so I will have to come back and fix this sometime later. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:39, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

::I'll start on the process, as I have some time this month. [[User:Winterbourne|Winterbourne]] 03:29, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

== Consistency with Templates &amp; Guidelines == 

Is there a template available for tutorials? (Either specifically for this book, or for all of Blender?) There appear to be many different styles in effect based on what each of the author's think, which makes reading a little tricky. Guidelines would help too, as  it will force authors to follow a particular style, and avoid adding unnecessary extras --[[User:Spxza|Spxza]] 15:07, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

== Source code ==
Is the part of source code of Blender that actually draws the images on the screen available in [[w:C (programming language)|C]]? I'd be interested to download it. --[[User:212.149.219.120|212.149.219.120]] 12:19, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

== Respectful Request ==

If you don't understand something please use the discussion page to make comments or requests. It is impolite and a waste of another reader's time to mark up the tutorial with things like &quot;Noob Note&quot; and &quot;Readers Comment.&quot; While one instance is insignificant multiply each inappropriate little note by the time it takes to read them, by the number of tutorials done, and it adds up.

==Awesome book==

I really think this book shows how great wikibooks is.  Keep up the good work.
:Yeah! I actually thought I would never get into blender but this book helps a lot, thx!

==Deletions Running Rampant==
In addendum to the above &quot;someone gutted this book&quot; I'd like to point out a LOT of pages have had illustration images removed without care or cause other than the fact that the picture had no copyright tags on them. I have found in a few cases where images had such tags, but were removed anyway. I can fully understand some policies involved with copyrighted imagery, but in many cases these were simple ''screenshots of the Blender interface'' where some very vital information such as settings for a tutorial or example were displayed. As I had said in another discussion, people need to adopt better fuzzy logic when it comes to removing images that have no copyright information tags on them. Otherwise what happens is that an author uploads an article, formats, edits, works very hard on it, and then just leaves and forgets about it only rarely checking in on things. Then along comes someone who decides due to &quot;policy&quot; that the images have to be deleted. Suddenly everything is gone and the entire article has been disrupted and its carcass is left to rot. The end-users who wish to peruse this information are all inconvenienced and left frustrated because information is missing. I highly suggest adoption of better policies when it comes to this. --[[User:Tybee|Tybee]] 04:39, 25 October 2007 (UTC)

== PDF Link suggestion ==

I think the PDF links are a bit obscure - they should be labeled differently, otherwise there's nothing visual to distinguish between those 3 identical links..

:I added which section they contain in the label, but by doing that it cuts out the file size. People can click on info to see both section and file size, so it just depends on what is more important to more people, seeing section name without having to mouse over the link, or seeing size to gauge how long it will take to download or how big each section is compared to the others. Is there a way to show both section and size? [[User:Ikarsik|Ikarsik]] 08:42, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

:added the printables and PDFs to each section, with the PDFs showing size. redundant but yea. [[User:Ikarsik|Ikarsik]] 08:50, 28 November 2007 (UTC)


== Deleting a Page ==
The Die Easy page in the begining modeling tutorials needs to be deleted. I don't know how to delete a page, could someone do it. [[User:TwistedWeasel|TwistedWeasel]] ([[User talk:TwistedWeasel|talk]]) 02:00, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

== The &quot;Building a House&quot; page is out of order ==

The page ordering with the &quot;next page&quot;/&quot;previous page&quot; buttons at the top does not correspond to the TOC page for the book.  Specifically the &quot;Building a House&quot; page is out of order.  I would fix it myself but I'm not sure where the correct place for it is. -[[User:AndrewBuck|AndrewBuck]] ([[User talk:AndrewBuck|talk]]) 06:17, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

 Done [[User:TwistedWeasel|TwistedWeasel]] ([[User talk:TwistedWeasel|talk]]) 18:36, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

== Deleting the Die Easy page ==
I opened the die easy page for deletion. It has been rewritten for blender 2.44, and the page now contains no useful information. Please discuss this on the page [[/Die Easy|Die Easy (to be deleted)]] [[User:TwistedWeasel|TwistedWeasel]] ([[User talk:TwistedWeasel|talk]]) 19:07, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

== Left a note ==

I left a question under one of the tutorials.  Here is a link to the discussion page:

* [[Talk:Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Creating_Basic_Water_animation | Creating Basic Water animation]]

== What about a modeling/animation/etc troubleshooting page? ==

When I say troubleshooting I'm not refering to blender functionality and/or bugs. I'm refering to creating a separate link in the table of contents in which blender users could gather information on how to solve common problems while modeling, using subsufs, animating, texturing, etc. There are some known solutions that I've been trying to find in the web and I couldn't. I'll wait for other opinions.

EDIT: Well, I found one right here, but is mixed with other stuff that is unrelated to:

== Proposed rename... ==

I propose we change the name of this book. Please see [[Wikipedia:Newbie#Noob]]. --[[User:Remi|Remi]] ([[User talk:Remi|talk]]) 02:20, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

That's actually an inaccurate description of the term. Noob is just a phonetic spelling of newb, which is a shortening of newbie. It's relation to the word boob for denoting idiocy is coincidental, but since it fits the picture, it's believable, when really it's as good as a backronym. Yes, noob and n00b have negative connotations, but to the same extent as calling someone &quot;green&quot;. It means inexperience, and it's the inexperience that's negative, and since the purpose of this book is to allow one's self to overcome inexperience, it's not inappropriate as a title.

== Python Scripting or BGE? ==

After a little more knowledge of the coding for Blender with Python, I was going to start a similar, but more extensive, version of the Platformer Game Design series replacing all logic board processes used to make the first ones with Python code, then showing how to add such things as enemies with a simple AI routine. However, I don't know if the logic board and python scripting are both considered part of the Blender Game Engine or not. One one hand, you toggle on script links and whatnot in the logic section, they interact at other points, and Python scripts, except when executed manually from Blender, perform in the same environment as the logic and physics. So you'd think they were someone of the same entity, that being the game engine as a whole. In addition, at least one python-using article already exists in the BGE section. Question is, should I add the proper articles to the Blender Game Engine section as before, add them to the Advanced Tutorials; Python Scripting section, make a subsection of the Python Scripting section for game scripting tutorials, or perhaps start a BGE section in Advanced Tutorials? If not continuing in the old BGE section, should I move the other python-containing articles while I'm at it?

Also, I'd like to point out that I added some useful information to do with generating vertices, faces, etc., with Python to the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Python Scripting/Procedural object creation|procedural object creation]] article. [[User:LokiClock|Loki Clock]] ([[User talk:LokiClock|talk]]) 18:58, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

:Adding a python section to the book is a great idea, since good BGE python tutorials seem to be so scarce.  I'm in favour of just extending the BGE tutorial section, since BGE Python is completely different from Blender scripting Python.  I've been thinking about adding an introduction to BGE Python, although if I did, it would be assume a basic knowledge of Python (as there are great tutorials out there already [http://www.swaroopch.com/byteofpython/]).  Anyways, keep up the good work with your platformer tutorials.--[[User:Malaz|Malaz]] ([[User talk:Malaz|talk]]) 01:22, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

::Okay. I've created the first article, which, while incomplete, still contains some information that took me hours to discover and is most basic to video game production. If anyone objects, I suppose it can all be moved later on. [[User:LokiClock|Loki Clock]] ([[User talk:LokiClock|talk]]) 11:38, 11 March 2008 (UTC)

== New PDF Propasal ==

I am currently working on a New Pdf for the Beginner Tutorials Section. It uses the [[Image:PDF_template.sxw]]
Now This wikibook is quite book so a single effort is close to impossible. I would like to propose a section for this. Users can commit to a section then Those sections will be merged together to make a single file.  This way keeping the Pdf updated to the changes to the wiki will be as easy as just merging files together in OpenOffice.--[[User:Darkfire|Darkfire]] ([[User talk:Darkfire|talk]]) 18:48, 9 June 2008 (UTC)
:I would be willing to make a basic pdf from a latex source based upon the wiki. I agree, the current pdf format is awful its just been printed to file, and making it into a little latex document wouldnt be too big a task (repetative mind). If anyone supports I shall go ahead.

== Troubleshooting Chapter ==

You know I myself have been thinking more and more about this subject, and the more I've thought about it, the more it makes sense -- there is a difference between learning how to enact a subject, and having a problem with a subject. Now, I really appreciate this book -- I've been using it for well over a year, and now I have learned enough to sign on and become one of the books authors; I've even contributed a few pages myself -- however, I've felt more and more that this book can teach you how to do something, but doesn't deal with the subject of helping users that run into problems with certain subjects. So this is what I'm proposing; an entire chapter devoted to Troubleshooting. We can have a &quot;bucket page&quot; that Blender-students simply make a headline and question, and Authors or even other students can easily categorize (cut and paste) into appropriate troubleshooting pages and sections within the Chapter. I would have just gone ahead and done it, but I think adding a whole new Chapter like this, this big, would have been disrespectful to other Authors and Users, so what's your opinion on it &quot;Blender 3D: Noob To Pro&quot;-Users?--[[User:bullercruz1|Jeremy Buller]]([[User_talk:bullercruz1|talk]]), 00:55 August 1st 2008 (UTC)

==Introduction==
In chapter ''Wave Equation and Green's function''[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aeroacoustics/Wave_Equation_and_Green%27s_function], we mentioned that the motion of small amplitude acoustic waves in fluids is governed by the wave equation. In this chapter we intend to formally prove this statement.

== Linear Acoustic Waves in an Ideal Fluid at Rest ==
Let's start from the governing equations of fluids motion, namely conservation of mass (continuity) and momentum (Navier-Stokes). 

The continuity equation for a compressible fluid is 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial (\rho v_i)}{\partial x_i} =0 &lt;/math&gt;

Navier-Stokes equation[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier-Stokes_equations] is also given by 

&lt;math&gt;\rho\left[\frac{\partial v_i} {\partial t} + v_j \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}\right]=-\frac{\partial }{\partial x_j} (p\delta_{ij} + \sigma_{ij}) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the Kronecker delta[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta] and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the viscous stress tensor. For the time being let's assume that we are dealing with wave propagation of an ideal (inviscid) fluid  at rest. Later, we will extend our analysis to consider the moving, viscous fluid.
Further assume that the motion of acoustic waves cause small amplitude fluctuations such that the instantaneous density, pressure, and velocity components at any point can be written as

&lt;math&gt;p=p_0+p'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \rho_0 +\rho'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_{i}=0+v'_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; are the mean pressure and density, respectively, which are independent of time and position. It should be noted that mean velocity has been set to zero, because we have assumed that the fluid is at rest. Substituting these quantities in the conservation of mass and momentum, and neglecting second and higher order fluctuation terms, we obtain 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho'}{\partial t}+\rho_0\frac{\partial v'_i}{\partial x_i}=0&lt;/math&gt;

and 

&lt;math&gt;\rho_0\frac{\partial u'}{\partial t}-\frac{\partial p'}{\partial x_i}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Now let's take the space derivative of the linearized momentum equation and subtract it from the time derivative of the linearized conitinuity equation to obtain

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \rho'}{\partial t^2}-\frac{\partial^2 p'}{\partial x_i\partial x_i }= 0&lt;/math&gt;.

We can obtain the pressure fluctuation from a Taylor expansion

&lt;math&gt;p'=\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\right)_{s}\rho'+\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial s}\right)_{\rho}s'&lt;/math&gt;

Since we assumed that the fluid is inviscid and fluctuations are small in amplitude, it is safe to assume that the motion of acoustic waves does not generate entropy and is an isentropic process[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isentropic]]. Thus, 

&lt;math&gt;p'=\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\right)_{s}\rho'=c_0^2\rho'&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \rho'}{\partial t^2}-c_{0}^2\frac{\partial^2 \rho'}{\partial x_i\partial x_i }=0&lt;/math&gt;.

which is our celebrated wave equation. Exactly similar equations can be obtained for pressure and velocity fluctuations as well. It is interesting to note that the acoustic perturbations propagate at speed 

&lt;math&gt;c_{0}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\right)_{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the famous speed of sound [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound].

== Velocity Potential and Wave Equation ==
In the previous section we obtained a wave equation in terms of denisty fluctuation. An alternate formulation can be obtained in terms velocity potential[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_Potential]. 

Taking the curl of linearized momentum (Euler) equation, and noting that the curl of a gradient is zero, we obtain 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\mathbf{\nabla\times v'}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which means '''vorticity [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorticity] is constant in time.''' If we consider the initial vorticity to be zero, the velocity vector can be written as the gradient of a potential function at any moment of time

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v'}(x,t) = \mathbf{\nabla}\Phi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;

The linearized continuity and momentum equation can be used then to obatin

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \Phi(x,t)}{\partial t^2}-c_{0}^2\nabla^2 \Phi(x,t) =0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p'=-\rho_0\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\rho'=p'/c_{0}^2&lt;/math&gt;

===2...Nc6===
A good second move for black, 2...Nc6 keeps most options open for black including the possibility of transposition into the English four knights variation after 3.Nf3. Black must choose how to develop after this move, for instance more often than not white will fianchetto his light squared bishop and pursue a q-side attack in those cases it may be desirable to play f5, since the pawn duo on f5 and e5 along with a knight on f6 more often than not will present a formidable front with good counterplay possibilities vs a q-side attack by white. However as in most k-side pawn attacks black should be careful not to overextend these pawns as doing so might get them restrained and then destroyed by white, effectively putting black on the defensive.  

Aside from the English four knights the main option for white is to prepare a q-side attack by playing the bishop to g2, the king´s knight to e2 and the rook to b1, different move orders are possible but the idea is the same: to achieve a beneficial pawn break on d4( ideally exchanging blacks e pawn for example: e3,Ne2,d4 and after black takes the d pawn white recaptures with his e pawn effectively increasing his power on the center and q-side while at the same time weakening black´s counterplay ) and/or to support a pawn advance to b4( a3 and Rb1 are good moves for this purpose). Using the subsequent spatial advantage on the q-side while neutralizing black´s counterplay on the opposite wing does require some skill however and white is best advised not to neglect his k-side in favor of an all out q-side attack and to seek the restraint and destruction of black´s f and e pawns for example after 3.g3 f5 4.e3 Nf6 5.Nge2 Bb4 6.Bg2 0-0 7.0-0 d6 8.d4 +/= and should black push his e pawn to e4 white can undermine it with f3 and get an open file for the rook on f1 on the process

[[Image:Acorn squash stuffed with pilaf and topped with cheese.jpg|thumb|300px|Stuffed acorn squash topped with gruyère]]

==Ingredients==

*1-4 [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]], depending on size (red kuri, blue hubbard, acorn, or other round-ish winter squash)
*1.5 cups [[Cookbook:Rice Pilaf|rice pilaf]] mix
*almond oil
*0.5 cups slivered almonds
*1 small yellow onion, diced
*1 red bell pepper (optional)
*garlic (3-4 cloves)
*1 cup cheese (gruyère or appenzeller)
*olive oil
*salt
*black pepper
*red chile pepper flakes

==Procedure==
====Roast the squash====
Cut off the top of the squash and dig out the soft insides and seeds.  Throw away the insides and seeds.  Coat the squash, inside and out, with a thin layer of olive oil.  Salt and pepper the inside.  Place in a 350°F oven and roast until a fork easily pierces the flesh (about 30-45 minutes).

====Prepare the stuffing====

While the squash is roasting, prepare the stuffing.  Heat 1/4 cup almond oil in a large pot.  Add the slivered almonds, some red pepper flakes, and a little salt and saute the almonds until lightly browned and fragrant.  Add the onion and continue to saute until translucent, at which point you should add the garlic and red bell pepper and saute for 1-2 more minutes.  Mix in the rice pilaf mix, coating the mixture with the almond oil.  Stir this around until the rice is hot and lightly toasted (3-5 minutes, or less).  Add 2.5 cups water or broth and bring it to an open boil.  Cover the pan and turn down the heat to let it simmer until the rice is cooked (about 30-45 minutes).  Salt and pepper to taste.

====Stuff the squash====
When the rice is done, pour it into the roasted squash.  Grate the cheese on top.  Broil a few minutes until the cheese is bubbly and toasty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General information ==
'''Sickle cell anemia''' is a genetically inherited disease in which the people who suffer from this disease develop abnormally shaped red blood cells - an elongated shape like a '''sickle''' instead of the normal spherical shape of hemoglobin - which decrease its affinity to oxygen. Sickle cell anemia is a disease that are passed down from family members in which the red blood cells form an abnormal sickle shape instead of the round (doughnut) shape. A more in depth look at the red blood cells show that the hemoglobin in the affected cells form large fibrous aggregates, resulting from their sickle shape. This shape then clogs capillaries and prevent blood flow, causing poor circulation and leading to higher risks for stroke, organ damage, and bacterial infections. Anemia is caused by the fact that the sickle shaped cells are not retained in circulation for as long as normal blood cells do, and the bone marrow, where the cells are produced, cannot keep up to speed with making new cells. Sickle cell is usually a deadly heritable disease which primarily is associated with those of African descent. The main difference between those affected with sickle cell anemia is that when the hemoglobin is deoxygenated the hemoglobin bends to the &quot;sickle&quot; shape. The oxygenated hemoglobin actually is the same as those oxygenated hemoglobin in normal people. &lt;ref name=&quot;hemoglobin&quot;&gt;[http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/blood/narrative/page3.html hemoglobin], October 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The hemoglobin mentioned has two parts: the heme and the globin. The heme is contains the iron which is used to transport the oxygen through the blood stream. The globin is a complex protein that keeps the hemoglobin in a liquid like state. &lt;ref name=&quot;hemoglobin&quot;&gt;[http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/blood/narrative/page3.html hemoglobin], October 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;


[[Image:Sickle cell.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sickle cells versus regular red blood cells, the colors do not actually vary, but a lighter red is used for the regular cells to indicate the difference. The sickle shape of the cells makes them less effective in transporting oxygen, and increases the likelihood of forming life threatening clots.]]

== Symptoms and Effects ==
-The most well known symptom is anemia-- the delay of healing and growth as well as the affecting the oxygen flow to the rest of the body. This often results in paleness, weakness, and tiredness.
-Other symptoms include jaundice, or yellowing, of the skin, mouth, and eyes caused by the deposits of bilirubin from the excess of dead sickle cells before the liver filters them out. 
-Enlargement, scarring, and damage to the spleen if the sickle cells pool there.
-Acute chest syndrome, if the sickle cells occur in the chest, this can lead to lung damage.
-Sickle crisis, caused by sickle cells clustering in blood vessels and constricting the flow of blood. This results in pain, swelling, and possibly death.
The symptoms do not usually occur until after the age of four. Some others symptoms are shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, paleness, fatique, or yellowing of the eyes and skin. [Pubmed Health].

Complications of Sickle cell anemia:

Different parts of the body are effected by sickle cell anemia in different ways.  For instance, “hand-foot syndrome” can either effect the hands or the  feet or the two simultaneously.  For infants, this is often the first sign of sickle cell disease.  This occurs when the small vessels in the hands and/or feet are blocked by sickle cells.  The result of this process can lead to fever, pain in the bones, and/or swelling on the surface of the hands and/or feet.  

Another  complication of sickle cell anemia is “Splenic Crisis.”  This occurs when the spleen becomes to large due to an overload of sickle cells flowing into it.  In this case, the cells clog the spleen and disrupts it usual function, which is to fight infections by filtering out abnormal red blood cells.   Without the spleen’s normal function, the overload soon leads to a shrinkage of the spleen.  The only way to correct this abnormality is by undergoing blood transfusion.  In addition, the spleen is the most vital organ in the body in fighting infections.  Without its proper function,  infections can occur that would have the ability to kill a person in a matter of days.  For young children, pneumonia is the most common infection caused by sickle cell disease. 

Acute chest syndrome is very similar to pneumonia and is a life threatening condition caused by sickle cell disease.   This occurs when sickle cells flow into the lungs and cause symptoms such as fever and chest pains.   When lung damage is extended over a long period of time, pulmonary arterial hypertension is the result.  The symptoms include irregular breathing patterns and  high blood pressure. 


Sickle cell disease can have a major effect on the growth and puberty of children.  Basically, children with this disease experience a shortage in red blood cells, which causes their growth rate to decrease relative to a child without the disease.  When these children become adults, they are usually thinner and smaller in comparison to the average adult.  
Besides, people with sickle cell anemia may have some symptoms of infections as the following: bone infection, gallbladder infection, lung infection, urinary infection, delayed growth and puberty, or even painful joints caused by arthritis. [Pubmed Health]. 

Two forms of stroke can also occur as a result to sickle cell disease.  One form of stroke happens when sickle cells flow into the brain and block blood vessels. The second form of stroke occurs as a result of the first case; bursting blood vessels.  If death isn’t the result of this complication, then a person may experience learning disabilities or paralysis. 

Vision can also be effected by sickle cell disease.  In order to have clear vision, our small blood vessels have to have the ability to transport oxygen into our eyes.  If the small blood vessels become blocked by sickle cells, the thin layers of the retina become damaged.  Since the retinas are responsible for sending images of what we see to our brain, without this function, blindness is the result. 

“Gallstones” is a complication that is the result of the release of hemoglobin from a dead red blood cell.  In addition, stones may from in the gallbladder due to the overload of  a compound called, bilirubin.  When fattening meals are consumed, one may experience discomfort in the right side of the belly, right shoulder, or between the shoulder blades.  Nausea, vomiting, sweating, and chills can also occur.  

For people between the ages of ten and fifty, ulcers on the legs may form. They are treatable, but reoccurring.  

One of the most serious, but rare complications of sickle cell disease is multiple organ failure, when three major organs fail.  This will cause serious effects in a person’s mental state, like tiredness and general loss of interest in everyday activities. Fever is also common.

Treatment:

Due to the crisis known as vaso-occlusive, people with sickle cell disease experience painful episodes.  There are, however, various types of treatment available.  One type of treatment, used for children with sickle cell disease, is folic acid and penicillin.  This treatment requires that the patient take 1mg of folic acid every single day for life. As a result of the undeveloped immune system the patient must then take penicillin  daily by the age of five.  

For children, bone marrow transplants help to suppress this severe disease. 

Hydroxyurea is a drug that has the ability to reactivate fetal hemoglobin, which can extend the lifetime for a person living with sickle cell anemia. This drug has also been used in chemotherapy.  

Currently, gene therapy is being researched as a possible treatment for these disease.   Also, the use of phytochemicals, like nicosan.

Overall, people with sickle cell anemia need to have their treatment continuously and nonstop. In order to get a better treatment, they must seek help from their health care providers and also from clinics that are in charge of sickle cell anemia disease. At the hospital or clinics, patients can receive treatments for sickle cell anemia such as blood transfusion, pain medicines, lots of fluids, and antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections. However, some people might need to do dialysis or kidney transplant, surgery for the eye, or even the wound care for leg ulcers. [Pubmed Health].

== Cause of disease ==
By investigating the amino acid sequence of the hemoglobin of affected cells, scientists have shown that there is a single substitution of valine for glutamate in position 6 of the β-chain of hemoglobin that results in this disorder. The mutated hemoglobin is called S-hemoglobin, for sickle cell anemia. When hemoglobin is in its T-state, the additional valine residues bind to a hydrophobic area on other S-hemoglobin molecules, forming a chain of hemoglobin that in turn pulls the red blood cell into its signature sickle shape.  This dangerous effect only occurs on hemoglobin in its deoxygenated state because oxygenated hemoglobin has the R conformation, which covers the hydrophobic patch that the extra valine binds to. People who have this disease must have inherited this mutation from both parents as it is a recessive trait. A recessive trait means that the disease will only be expressed if both of the individual's alleles code for that trait. To summarize, sickle cell anemia results from the aggregation of mutated deoxyhemoglobin molecules, where aggregation is caused by interation between Val 6 on a beta chain of one Hb molecule and a hydrophobic patch (formed by Phe 85 and Val 88) on a beta chain of another deoxygenated hemoglobin molecule.

Diagnosis: 

Hb levels are usually high for people effected by sickle cell anemia.  Hyposplenism may appear on a blood film analysis. 

Induction of sickle cells can be promoted by the addition of sodium metabisulfite on a blood film. A “sickle cell solubility test” can also be used to detect the presence of sickle hemoglobin.

Gel electrophoresis can be used to detect abnormalities in hemoglobin.

== Sickle cell disease in Africa ==
[[File:Sickle cell distribution.jpg|left|thumb|The distribution of Sickle cell disease in Africa.]]
[[File:Malaria distribution.jpg|right|thumb|The distribution of Malaria in Africa.]]
1/100 of West Africans suffer from sickle cell anemia, and a much larger percentage of the population has the sickle cell trait in comparison to other regions in the world. The mosquito-borne protozoan ''Plasmodium falciparum'', infect erythrocytes, which cause them to adhere to capillary walls and block blood flow to vital organs. The reason of the high probability of West Africans having sickle cell anemia is because of the common disease reign the region, malaria. Individuals who carry the sickle cell anemia gene are found to be more resistant to malaria due to the effect of ''Plasmodia'' has on infected erythrocytes.  ''Plasmodia'' lowers the intracellular pH in erythrocytes by roughly 0.4, which causes hemoglobin to favor deoxyhemoglobin formation.  Deoxyhemoglobin has a higher tendency for sickling, which creates a tendency for infected erythrocytes to be removed by the spleen.  Furthermore, sickling also mechanistically disrupts erythrocyte adhesion to capillary walls.  

As a result, individuals who carry this trait have resistance to malaria.  Individuals who are even heterozygous have an adaptive advantage to homozygous individuals who do not carry sickle cell anemia and are unable to seek proper medical treatment.  Therefore, the sickle cell trait is extremely common in West Africa, where malaria is also a big factor, contributing to the death toll.

== Importance of Sickle Cell ==
With the sickle cell disorder, Linus Pauling was the first to propose and observe the direct connection between the variation of one single amino acid squence that can result in a sickle shaped red blood cell.Therefore, Sickle Cell studies are important in studying genetically linked diseases. Linus Pauling was able to propose this thought due to his background in studying atoms and his eventual journey through medicine. His diverse academic background gave him a unique viewpoint to which he advanced immunology. Much of his studies were based on normal and abnormal hemoglobin cells. Pauling later went on to write Sickle Cell Anemia, A Molecular Disease, in 1949. In his later years, Pauling used his research on hemoglobin to for social, political and scientific endeavors. &lt;ref name=&quot;pauling&quot;&gt;[http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/blood/narrative/page1.html pauling], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A page torn out of a library book that Harry finds clutched in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s petrified fist, helps Harry determine that the monster which has been roaming the school and petrifying students is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]]. Harry and Ron decide that they need to tell this to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. While waiting for her in the Staff Room, they hear an announcement that all students are to return to their dormitories. The boys decide to hide in a wardrobe in the Staff Room. Listening through the door, they hear that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] has been captured and taken into the Chamber of Secrets, and they hear that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]] has been assigned the task of hunting down the monster, as he has boasted that he knows where it is. He weakly goes off &quot;to prepare&quot;.

Later, when Harry and Ron visit Professor Lockhart's office, they find him frantically packing up all his possessions. When they question him as to why he is packing, he explains that he had never actually done the difficult adventures he writes about completing in his books. He says &quot;less photogenic&quot; people had done them, and he had simply written about them. He isn't magically strong enough to do all the things in those books, but he excels in performing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|memory charms]]. He casts those on the people who had done the things he writes about, so that they wouldn't awkwardly and publicly recall having done what Lockhart claimed to do. This would expose him as a fake. He then turns on Harry and Ron with his wand raised, Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]] him, and Ron catches Lockhart's wand and throws it out the window. At both Harry and Ron's wand-point, Lockhart precedes the two students to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.

There, Myrtle confirms that she was the one who had died the last time the chamber was opened. She indicates a sink where she saw big yellow eyes, which is the last thing she remembers alive. Harry notices a small snake etched on the side of the faucet, and speaks to it in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]. The sink opens, revealing a deep shaft which Lockhart reluctantly enters followed by Ron and Harry.

At the bottom of the shaft, they find a chamber littered with small bones which leads to a large tunnel. Lockhart, Harry and Ron walk down the tunnel, deeper into the Chamber of Secrets. In the tunnel, they find the skin of a serpent which is twenty feet or more long. Lockhart pretends to faint in shock, then seizes Ron's wand from him unexpectedly. In an attempt to make Harry and Ron forget that he is a fake, and why they need to be in the Chamber of Secrets, Lockhart fires a memory charm at the boys. Ron's broken wand explodes and backfires, hitting Lockhart with the rebounding charm. A large piece of the ceiling falls in the explosion, separating Harry from Ron and Lockhart. Harry, on the side which leads further into the Chamber of Secrets, proceeds alone, leaving Ron to clear the fallen rocks as best he can. Harry goes through another door and into a chamber dominated by a giant statue, with Ginny lying unconscious at its feet. Letting go of his wand, Harry approaches her and kneels next to her, attempting to revive her.

A student walks out of the shadows, picks up Harry`s wand off the floor, and introduces himself as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]. He says that he had really wanted to meet Harry, and that Ginny had been writing in his diary, telling him all about the wonderful Harry Potter. As Ginny had poured out her emotions to Tom, Tom had slowly put some of his soul into Ginny. He planned to use her life force to return. He wonders, though, how as an infant, Harry had managed to defeat Voldemort. Harry asks why Tom would care about Voldemort, Tom says that he is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], existing as a memory through the ancient diary. The letters of his name, Tom Marvolo Riddle, can be re-arranged to spell &quot;I am Lord Voldemort&quot;.

Harry is noticing that Tom's outline, which had initially been somewhat fuzzy, is becoming firmer as time goes by, and knows that if he doesn't act quickly, Tom will become fully real and Ginny will die. To Tom's statement that Voldemort is the greatest wizard who ever lived, Harry retorts that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] is greater. When Tom says that Dumbledore has been driven from the school by Tom's memory, Harry says Dumbledore is not as distant as Tom might think. A burst of beautiful music interrupts them, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]], Dumbledore's pet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|Phoenix]], appears and drops the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] at Harry's feet.

Tom now releases the Basilisk, which tries to attack Harry. Fawkes pecks out its eyes, blinding it and preventing it from using its stare to petrify or kill Harry. Tom coaches the Basilisk to attack Harry by smell. Harry puts on the Sorting Hat, asks for help, and something in the hat hits him in the head. Harry finds that it is a sword, and as the Basilisk strikes, Harry stabs upwards through the roof of its mouth and into its brain, killing it. However, Harry is, in turn, stabbed by one of the Basilisk's fangs, and can feel its venom working.

As the world begins to darken, Fawkes lands beside Harry and starts weeping. Though Tom jeers at him, Harry feels the effects of the venom receding, and recalls Dumbledore's words about phoenixes: &quot;their tears have healing powers.&quot; As Tom realizes what is happening, he fires a quick curse at Fawkes with Harry's wand. Fawkes flies away, and as Tom is preparing a killing curse, Fawkes drops the diary that was lying next to Ginny at Harry's side.

Harry plunges the venomous, broken Basilisk fang into the diary. Instantly, with a thin scream, Tom vanishes, and the diary, with a hole burned through it, leaks a veritable ocean of ink. Ginny wakes up, and she and Harry make their way back to the tunnel with the fallen ceiling. Ron has forced a way through it, and carried by Fawkes, Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart fly up the shaft, and return to the bathroom. Fawkes leads them to Professor McGonagall's office, where Harry tells what has happened to a very relieved Professor McGonagall, Professor Dumbledore, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]].

== Notable Consequences ==

Several of the consequences of this particular duel are not revealed until much later in the series, and so are covered in the Greater Picture area of this topic.

We learn that Lord Voldemort's name originally had been Tom Marvolo Riddle, and that Marvolo had been his grandfather's name. We will later learn that Voldemort had tried to conceal this name, to prevent discovery of the place where he had hidden an object of value, in his grandfather's house.

Ron's damaged wand, when it exploded, caused Lockhart's memory charm to revert upon himself, so Lockhart has lost almost all of his memory. It seems he cannot even reliably remember his own name. In some ways, this seems just retribution for his over-use of the memory charm and his claiming of other people's achievements.

By finding the Chamber and determining who had actually opened it, Harry allows Dumbledore to secure the release of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]].

Harry mentions to Dumbledore that he is unsure if he is in the correct House. He says that the Sorting Hat had suggested that he would do well in Slytherin house, and Riddle had mentioned a number of curious similarities between them. Dumbledore asks Harry why the Sorting Hat had placed him in Gryffindor, and Harry glumly replies that it is only because he had asked it to. Dumbledore says that is exactly right, and goes on to say that &quot;It is our choices, Harry, that show who we truly are, far more than our abilities.&quot; He then shows Harry the sword that the Sorting Hat had presented to him, and the name on it: Godric Gryffindor. &quot;Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry.&quot;

It is in this same discussion that we first have it suggested to us that a part of Voldemort had ended up in Harry when Voldemort had tried to kill him and been killed himself. Dumbledore suggests that this is the source of Harry's ability in Parseltongue.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] appears at the school to protest Dumbledore's reinstatement as Headmaster, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] comes with him. Dobby, seeing the diary, suggests through charade behind Lucius' back that Lucius had put the diary in with Ginny's textbooks. Harry mentions this, and Lucius demands that he prove it. Dumbledore says that with the diary destroyed, it can never now be proved, but if any other of Voldemort's personal possessions do turn up, surely Arthur Weasley will be interested in linking them back to Lucius.

In the guise of giving the diary back to Lucius, Harry manages to get Lucius to accidentally throw a sock at Dobby. Having been given clothes, Dobby is now free, and no longer need take orders from the Malfoys. Dobby immediately protects Harry from Lucius' curse. Dobby may protect Harry again, now that he is a free elf and can choose what orders to follow.

== Analysis ==

While the main theme of the series is the fight against prejudice, the action of the series revolves around Voldemort, his history, and the battle between him and the &quot;right-thinking&quot; Wizarding world as personified by Harry and Dumbledore. It is in the Chamber of Secrets that we first meet Voldemort as an actual person, in this case as a boy of perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old, and learn something about how his mind works. In his disregard for Ginny and Harry, his dismissal of the school's teachers from fifty years before, and his arrogance, we can see that he seems significantly lacking in human feelings. His sole drive is power; he seems to care nothing for people as individuals, rather seeing them only as tools for his own advancement. This exposure to Voldemort greatly assists our understanding of the enemy Harry is facing, and we can assume it will assist Harry's understanding of Voldemort later in the series.

It remains a mystery why Harry and Ron take Lockhart along with them for the attempt to defeat the Basilisk. Harry and Ron have heard him state that he is a fraud, and Ron has thrown his wand out the window of his office, which arguably is another bad decision given the state of Ron's own wand. Without his wand, Lockhart would be even less use than he has already turned out to be. Perhaps they still harbor some belief in his abilities, as mentioned in his many supposed autobiographical books, or perhaps they simply feel the need of an older and more experienced wizard. One could argue, however, that the best course for Harry and Ron would have been to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] Lockhart, to keep him from interfering, and then proceed on their own. This might have proven fatal for Ron, however; as he was caught by the falling ceiling, there was only Harry for the Basilisk to focus on. It is likely, given his performance in the earlier stages of this book, that Ron would have frozen and been unable to use any defensive magic, and quite likely would have been killed instantly when the Basilisk appeared.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

We will find out later that the diary was actually a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], likely the second one that Tom Riddle had made. Professor Dumbledore, of course, recognizes it immediately by its effects on Ginny, and we learn later that this disturbs him. This Horcrux was designed to be found, and was placed in the school as a weapon; this is not the sort of thing you do with something that represents a person's immortality. This led Dumbledore to the conclusion that Riddle had created at least one other Horcrux, but until quite late in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|the sixth book]], he had no idea how many there might be, though he had suspicions of what at least two of them were.

We will also find out that Harry had, by pure blind luck, happened upon one of an extremely few ways of destroying a Horcrux: Basilisk venom. Horcruxes, being embodied bits of soul, are virtually indestructible, and no ordinary magic can harm them, just as no ordinary physical or magical assault can harm the soul in a living person. Basilisk venom is extraordinary magic, and there are no known cures for it apart from Phoenix tears, which are hardly ordinary magic, given the scarcity of phoenixes. In the course of the seven books, six Horcruxes will be destroyed; five of them will be destroyed either directly or indirectly by Basilisk venom, and one by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]]. A seventh soul fragment, having some of the effects of a Horcrux but not actually having been locked to an artifact by the appropriate charm, will be destroyed by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|the killing curse]].

Harry, Ron, and Hermione will, in the final book of the series, accept the mission of finding and destroying the remaining Horcruxes. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|Late in that book]], Ron, aware that there is a deceased Basilisk in the Chamber, will re-open the Chamber by mimicking Harry's use of Parseltongue. He and Hermione will destroy one of the Horcruxes there, and Ron will bring Basilisk fangs back when he returns, to assist with the destruction of any other Horcruxes that they find.

The thing of value that Tom had hidden in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/House of Gaunt|his grandfather's house]] was, of course, a Horcrux. Once [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]] and his son [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin]] were safely out of the way, Tom had hidden the first Horcrux he made in the remains of their house. Dumbledore later found it there and destroyed it. It is when Voldemort is thinking of the places that his Horcruxes were concealed that we learn that he had been trying to conceal the name of his Wizard ancestor, in order to keep that hiding place secure.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Having been taken to a cemetery by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] sees his companion, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], murdered, and then is forced to watch as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] returns to life. After summoning his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], and describing how he has come back, Voldemort releases Harry and they duel. Harry and Voldemort cast spells at the same instant, and the result is a dome of light surrounding the two of them, and several of Voldemort's past victims appearing as shades or ghosts. The ghosts cluster around Voldemort as Harry breaks the connection between their wands, and Harry runs for Cedric's body and the Triwizard trophy. The Triwizard Trophy, again acting as a Portkey, returns Harry to Hogwarts.

== Event Details ==

As the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] comes to a close, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] agree to touch the Triwizard Trophy at the same instant, thus closing the Task with a draw between the two of them. The trophy, however, is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]], which transports Harry and Cedric to a graveyard. As a mysterious figure approaches the boys carrying something, Harry's scar pains him so greatly that he drops his wand. The approaching person [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kills]] Cedric, and binds Harry to a nearby gravestone.

Leaving what he was carrying near Harry, the person, who Harry now recognizes as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], walks out of Harry's vision. The bundle which Pettigrew had placed near Harry is about the size and shape of an infant, but is unspeakably evil in appearance. Pettigrew now brings a large stone cauldron and creates a fire under it. To this cauldron he adds bones from the grave under Harry's feet, and his own hand in which he cuts off as Harry watches. He also slits Harry's arm with a knife, and adds some of Harry's blood which he caught in a phial to the cauldron. He then places the evil bundle in the cauldron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], re-animated, emerges.

Ignoring Pettigrew's suffering, Voldemort uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] on Pettigrew's arm to summon his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. Some he tortures for daring to suppose him gone forever, Pettigrew, for his loyalty, he rewards with a new, magically strong silver hand to replace the one he cut off. In answer to a question from a Death Eater speaking with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]'s voice, Voldemort explains where he had been, how he had survived, and how he had arranged for Harry's presence. He then directs Pettigrew to release Harry and give him his wand back.

Voldemort asks if Harry understands how to duel. &quot;First, we bow,&quot; and Voldemort forces Harry to bow. Voldemort then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Curses]] Harry, to show how it is done. Harry, knowing that the next curse of Voldemort's will be the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing curse]], ducks behind a gravestone. There, he decides that he would rather die standing than hiding, and stands to face Voldemort, attempting to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarm]] Voldemort just as Voldemort speaks the Killing Curse.

Instantly, Harry's and Voldemort's wands are joined by a band of golden light, and the two combatants are lifted into the air and set down some distance away from the jeering Death Eaters, as a dome of light forms around them. Harry's wand is heating up and vibrating dreadfully. Harry notices some beads of light on the link between the two wands, and something tells him that they should not reach his wand. Concentrating, he forces them away from his wand tip and towards Voldemort's. As the first bead of light is forced into it, Voldemort's wand screams, and the [[Muggles' Guide to  Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|shade]] of Cedric emerges.

Confused, the Death Eaters mill around the outside of the dome, asking what they should do; Voldemort, looking fearful, tells them to stay away, while the shade of Cedric wanders around the inside of the dome. Harry, still concentrating on the link between the wands, forces more beads into Voldemort's wand. Each bead results in another scream, fiercer vibration, and the appearance of another shade: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|an elderly Muggle]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]], and Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|father]]. The shades speak to Harry, telling him that when the link between the wands breaks, they will remain for a few seconds; they will cluster around Voldemort, giving Harry time to escape. The shade of Cedric asks that Harry take his body back to his parents.

At the signal, Harry jerks his wand upwards, breaking the link, and the golden dome vanishes. Harry sees the shades gathering around Voldemort, and runs, dodging through the headstones, to where Cedric's body lies. Once there, he [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|summons]] the Cup, which takes him, with Cedric's body, back to the Third Task maze.

In the confusion following Harry's return, Harry is taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]]'s office. There, Moody questions him about what had happened while he was away from the school. Harry becomes concerned as Moody's questions seem to be more about Voldemort's interactions with the Death Eaters, than about Voldemort's return; and finally, Moody reveals that he is a Death Eater, and that he plans to kill Harry to gain greater glory in Voldemort's eyes. As Moody is preparing for the wand strike, however, the door is broken down, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] Moody, then enters the room along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. Moody, who has apparently forgotten his dose of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice potion]], transforms into his real shape, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]]. Snape provides [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|a truth potion]], and Barty reveals the details of the plot that found Harry entered into the Triwizard Tournament, and the planning that had gone into Voldemort's return.

Dumbledore then takes Harry to his own office, where, with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] present for support, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]] providing healing tears, Harry relates the events of the duel. Dumbledore seems pleased that Voldemort had used Harry's blood for his reanimation, but does not say why.

Having heard Harry's story, Dumbledore then takes Harry to the Hospital Wing, and tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] that he needs a long and dreamless sleep.

== Notable Consequences ==

Cedric Diggory dies. This is likely to haunt Harry; we can see already that Harry feels responsible for having brought Cedric into harm's way.

Voldemort returns to the living. He announces himself to all his Death Eaters, and to Harry, who carries the news to Dumbledore. We guess now, and it will be confirmed later, that Dumbledore is the last person Voldemort would want to know of his return, and thanks to Harry, Dumbledore had known about it within hours, where Voldemort would have wanted to stay completely under cover for at least another year. This revelation will hasten Voldemort's timetable, and may cause him to make some errors in his planning.

We learn for certain where Lucius Malfoy's allegiances lie. We also learn of the existence of Barty Crouch, Jr., and of his covert actions over the year just past.

The unexpected effect generated by Harry's and Voldemort's wands seems to scare Voldemort. Voldemort has only once before had the Killing Curse fail, and then the effect is nothing like what he is seeing tonight; and with his fear of death, his victims coming back out of his own wand to haunt him must be absolutely petrifying. Additionally, Harry seems able to force Voldemort's wand to do things against Voldemort's will; could this mean that Harry is the stronger Wizard?

Dumbledore seems pleased that Voldemort had used Harry's blood to re-create himself, though he does not explain why.

Cornelius Fudge is revealed to be a politician, interested only in retaining the power he has, rather than in dealing with the threat that is present. By denying the evidence given him by Dumbledore, Harry, and Snape, Fudge clearly sets the stage for the official Ministry stance in the next book, which the author has said is quite consciously modeled on the government of Britain's actions under Neville Chamberlain.

Harry has won the Triwizard Tournament and so receives the prize money. This is more than a little embarrassing for him, as he can't imagine being entitled to more than half of it in any event, and not even that much as his entering the Tournament has resulted in Cedric's death. He tries to give it to Cedric's parents, but they refuse it. This will leave Harry with a large amount of money that he doesn't want and can't use.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 22|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], Dumbledore had said, &quot;You think the dead that we have loved, ever truly leave us?&quot; Harry meets the shades of his parents in this episode, which in some manner reassures him that his parents are not gone, but have merely moved on.

== Analysis ==

It is a characteristic of heroic fiction like the Harry Potter series that the hero and the villain should face each other multiple times over the story arc, with each exhibiting more power each encounter until the final one. In most heroic fiction, the hero is defeated and has to recover from his initial defeat, thus creating the upward arc of his powers. In the Harry Potter series, the villain was defeated off-stage initially, and has to recover, while the largely powerless hero has to literally grow into his strength. This minor difference makes Harry's maturing and increasing power seem organic, a natural consequence of his growing up physically, and avoids the plot contrivance of an initial battle which the hero loses but somehow survives.

A key component of this ongoing increase in power is that the hero's strength, and thus the villain's, must be tested. Throughout the series, there will be encounters between Harry and Voldemort, to illustrate that their abilities are increasing at approximately equivalent rates. In this particular instance, we see that Harry is now certainly strong enough to stand against a re-embodied Voldemort, but that it is a very close-run thing.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Cedric's death will make the school [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]] visible to Harry. This will alarm him; they are not the most prepossessing of beasts at any time, and Harry will wonder whether these are Dark creatures, and whether their visibility to him, and not to either Ron or Hermione, is a sign of him going insane. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]'s reassurance that she also can see them will hardly be reassuring to Harry, given Luna's evident eccentricity.

As mentioned, the Triwizard prize will leave Harry with money he doesn't want. Harry will give this to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] as seed money for their joke shop. The joke shop, and the magical items that Fred and George invent to sell there, will have a moderately important role to play in later books.

Dumbledore later says that, in fact, during the battle in the cemetery, Harry was a stronger wizard than Voldemort, because, while Voldemort saw death and feared it, Harry saw death and was ready for it. Harry being ready to die, if need be, gave him strength that Voldemort could not draw upon. This will be unexpected to the reader, who at this point is still fixated on Dumbledore as being &quot;the only one he [Voldemort] ever feared;&quot; the revelation that Harry was actually the stronger wizard at this point will be something of a surprise when it is made, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|in the final book]].

The effect of Harry's wand on Voldemort's will result in Voldemort spending significant time trying to find a wand that can defeat Harry's. He will, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|the seventh book]], chase a possibly mythical wand, the so-called Deathstick. As part of this process, Voldemort will have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]] kidnapped, will borrow Lucius Malfoy's wand and have it destroyed in his hand, and will hunt down the wandmaker [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]], the evil magician [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]], and end up at Dumbledore's tomb hunting the wand.

As a result of Harry's wand apparently independently destroying Malfoy's wand in Voldemort's hand, Harry will similarly place an almost mystical weight on his own wand, and will become despondent when it is destroyed accidentally.

We will learn later that Harry's faith in his own wand, and Voldemort's fear of it, are justified. As Harry was the stronger wizard in their duel, some of Voldemort's wand's power, and in fact some of Voldemort's power, will have transferred to Harry and his wand. However, Dumbledore will tell Harry that this power would only be exerted against Voldemort and the wand he carried. Harry's wand will have not only recognized Voldemort's wand as its kin, by way of the matching wand cores, but will have recognized Voldemort as Harry's kin, by their shared blood. Because of this, Harry's wand will apparently act independently to some degree to prevent Voldemort from attacking Harry again. We see this in the opening chapters of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. Here, without his willing it, Harry's wand takes action against Voldemort and the wand he is holding, which was Lucius Malfoy's. We also see that the strength in Harry's wand is proof only against Voldemort, as it is, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 17|later in that same book]], accidentally destroyed by a spell cast by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]].

Readers may have gathered by this point that the protection that Harry has at the house at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] is because of the blood relation between his mother, who sacrificed herself for him, and Harry's Aunt [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia]]; this will not be formally stated until near the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. Later, we will learn that by taking Harry's blood to reanimate himself, Voldemort had extended this protection, making it impossible for Harry to die by Voldemort's hand while Voldemort lived.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Enzymes are proteins that can accelerate biochemical reactions. They can transfer energy forms. Their functions of catalyze are very specific. They only catalyze certain reactions and when certain substrates are present. They usually do not have side products. It is important to understand that enzyme only fasten the reaction but not change the reaction equilibrium. In other words, with the presence of the enzyme, the reaction proceed thousands times faster, but the amount of final products are the same as without the presence of the enzyme.

The catalytic activity usually depends on the presence of cofactors, which is not a protein. An enzyme is called apoenzyme if it is not bound to cofactors; An enzyme is called holoenzyme if it is bound to cofactors. Cofactors are divided into two groups: metal and coenzymes. Metal cofactors can catalyze in many ways. They can ease the formation of nucleophiles, stabilize intermediates, and link enzymes and substrates. Coenzymes are small organic molecules. They can be bound to enzymes tightly or loosely. They are called prosthetic groups if they are bound to enzyme tightly. 
There are several strategies that enzymes use to catalyze specific reactions.

1. '''Covalent catalysis''' involves a an active site with a reactive group (substrate). The active site contains a reactive nucleophilic group that attacks the substrate through covalent forces. Although the covalent interactions are temporary, the substrate is bound to the enzyme during the course of catalysis. See mechanism of the proteloytic enzyme [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Enzyme_Catalytic_Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin Chymotrypsin] for example of this strategy.

2. '''General acid-base catalysis''' involves acid base reactions that do not occur with water. Other molecules undergo proton accepting or donating.

3. '''Catalysis by approximation''' involves bringing two distinct substrates in close proximity which can increase the reaction rate considerably. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Enzyme_Catalytic_Mechanism/Nucleoside_Monophosphate_Kinase Nucleoside Monophosphate Kinase].

4.''' Metal ion catalysis''' involves metal ions that allow the formation of nucleophilles or electrophilles that can help the reaction occur in a faster pace.

==The Nature of Enzyme Catalysis== 

1. '''Specific acid or base catalysis''' 
Enzymes are able to deprotonate or protonate a substrate by using hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion. 

2. '''General acid or base catalysis'''
It is similar from the specific acid or base catalysis, the reaction rate can be increased by adding or removing a proton. 

3. '''Charge neutralization'''
when a substrate is charged when it is bound to the enzyme, other residues of the opposite charge around the enzyme can help to maintain the binding

4. '''Nucleophilic catalysis'''
Many enzymes binds substrates with covalent bonding. Enzymes always are nucleophilic. Substrates are electrophilic. Therefore, the enzymes attack the electrophilic center of substrates. This reaction is very rapid. 

5. '''Electrophilic catalysis'''
The enzyme reaction can be catalyzed by removing the electron. 

6. '''Bond strain''' 
There are different types of binding in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction present such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic interactions. When substrates bind on the active site of enzymes, their structures may not be exactly complementary to the site. These different types of binding energy contribute the binding. Further, it helps the substrates bind enzyme more tightly. 

7. '''Environmental effects'''
When the substrates bind the enzyme, other solvent or molecules can affect the bonding reaction. The reaction can be accelerated or deaccelerated.

==Transition State Theory==

The transition state theory is used to learn about relationships between a structure and the reactivity that is involved with it. To make it simpler, reagent collisions are not included in the analysis, instead the only reagents that the transition state theory deals with are the ones located at ground state. Also, the transition state theory includes the unstable components that are in the reaction. In the transition state, chemical bonds are made and they are broken. Therefore, an easy way to calculate the rate of the reaction is to assume that the reagents at the ground state are in equilibrium with the transition state, thus the concentration of the transition state is easily determined using equilibrium constants (K). Once you have the concentration of the transition state, multiply it by the composition of the reaction and you will have obtained the reaction rate. Finding the rate of the reaction is extremely important in calculating the reactivity of substrates.

To understand how enzyme working, we can start from free energy (G). The free energy difference between substrates and products is called free-energy difference (∆G). If ∆G is negative, the reaction is exergonic and it occurs spontaneously. If ∆G is positive, the reaction is endergonic and it requires additional energy to make it happen. It does nothing to the rate of th reaction, but for an enzyme catalyzed reaction, we can tell if it is spontaneous or it additional energy is needed from the value of ∆G. 

In the process of an enzyme catalyzed reaction, there is a transition state before the product is formed. The difference between the substrate and the transition state is called activation energy. The use of enzyme is to lower the activation energy, so that the products can be formed more easily.  

There is a region for binding in enzyme. It is called the active site. Enzymes bring the substrate into an enzyme-substrate complex. The substrates are bound to the active site. There are two models of this kind of binding. They are Lock-and-Key Model and Induced-Fit Model. In the Lock-and-Key Model, the substrate acts like a key and the enzyme acts like a lock. Since they have highly specificity, they have the perfect complementary shapes to each other.  In an Induced-Fit Model, the enzyme is flexible. In other words, it can change its shape to match the shape of the substrate.

==General acid-base catalysis==

A general acid-base catalysis is a reaction that transfers a proton to or from another molecule. In structural biochemistry, the components that can carry a proton are substrates, cofactors, and amino acids. The reaction rate in this particular catalysis is dependent on the concentration of the proton carrier. In specific acid-base catalysis the reaction rate is independent of the concentration of the catalyst.

One example of a general acid-base catalysis is the hydrolysis of an ester. To catalyze such a reaction, the rate constant must be increased, as well as the concentration of the acid or the base by keeping a constant pH and a constant ratio of acid:base forms of the catalyst. To find out whether the catalyst is an acid or a base, increase the rate of the reaction. In the case of the hydrolysis of an ester the rate of the reaction increase is proportional to the amount of basic catalyst, therefore a base catalyst is used in this reaction. The rate of the reaction is also proportional to the catalyst’s strength. Acid-base catalysis helps stabilize the transition state. For example Ester Hydrolysis by water, the transition state is stabilized by a general base or acid. It can be stabilized by an acid group acting as a partial proton donor for carbonyl oxygen of the ester. The basic group in turn acts as a proton acceptor that stabilizes the transition state.

Example: proteases like chymotrypsin

==Metal Ion Catalysis==

Metal ion catalysis involves metal ions that form a nucleophilic hydroxide ion at neutral pH by activating a bound water molecule, therefore stabilizing the negative charges that are formed. At a pKa of 7, metal-bound water is extremely susceptible to nucleophilic attack. One example of a metal ion catalysis is the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Carbonic Anhydrase|carbonic anhydrase]] mechanism in which the carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the hydration of CO2.

Another example: restriction endonucleases like BamHI and EcoRV

==Covalent Catalysis==

The types of enzymes that usually form covalent intermediates are [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Serine Proteases|serine proteases]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Cysteine Proteases|cysteine proteases]], protein kinases and phosphatase, and pyridoxal phosphate-using enzymes. An essential step in covalent catalysis is creating a covalent intermediate. A covalent intermediate encourages the reaction along to the transition state, which then in turn helps to speed-up the reaction. The formation of the covalent intermediate initiates a burst in the reaction rate followed by a decrease when the intermediate decomposes and proceeds to steady state. An example of a covalent catalysis is the Schiff base formation. The Schiff base forms by condensing a carbonyl compound with an amine.

==Approximation of Reactants==

There are two characteristics of enzyme-substrate binding that increase the rate of the reaction. The first is that the binding brings together substrates and the reactive groups on the active site of the enzyme. The second factor is that the enzyme active site is extremely specific in the substrates that it will bind to, therefore making the reaction as efficient as possible. Also, when the substrates bind to the active site, it causes a decrease in entropy. A decrease in entropy increases the order to the system, therefore making the reaction more favorable. The proximity effect describes the orientation and movement of the substrate molecules when binding to enzyme active sites. The orbital steering hypothesis states that just because a substrate and an enzyme active site are in close proximity does not mean that a catalysis reaction will occur. This is because the enzyme must guide or “steer” the substrate into the active site in a specific orientation in order for the reaction to actually occur. Over time, the “steering” has evolved and become more efficient.

Other requirements for such a reaction to occur is it needs a change in solvation, it needs to overcome Van der Waals forces and also changes in electronic overlap. In order for these requirements to occur, orientation effects and induction of strain are needed.

Example: NMP kinase

==Isomerase==

An isomerase is an enzyme that catalyses the structural rearrangement of isomer. Isomerases catalyze isomerization changes within a single molecule when isomers are equal or roughly equal in bond energy, and so they interconvert relatively freely. There are many kinds of isomerase depending on changing of structure of the molecule. For example, triose phosphate isomerase is an enzyme that catalyses an aldo sugar- Dihydroxy acetone phosphate - to the keto-sugar -Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by intramolecular oxidation-reduction. First, Glutamate 165 protonates the hydrogen of carbon 1 while Histidine 95 donates a proton to the oxygen atom which bonded to carbon 2. This process is forming the enediol intermediate. Later, Glutamate donated back the hydrogen, but for carbon 2 and Histidine 95 now removes hydrogen from O-H bonding with Carbon-1. This step is forming the product-Glyceraldyhyde 3-phosphate

      <text xml:space="preserve">V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; ([S]/([S] + K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;)

[[Image:Michaelis-Memten.JPG|left|thumb|Michaelis and Menten Graph]]

The Michaelis-Menten equation arises from the general equation for an enzymatic reaction: E + S ↔ ES ↔ E + P, where E is the enzyme, S is the substrate, ES is the enzyme-substrate complex, and P is the product. Thus, the enzyme combines with the substrate in order to form the ES complex, which in turn converts to product while preserving the enzyme. The rate of the forward reaction from E + S to ES may be termed k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the reverse reaction as k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;. Likewise, for the reaction from the ES complex to E and P, the forward reaction rate is k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the reverse is k&lt;sub&gt;-2&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, the ES complex may dissolve back into the enzyme and substrate, or move forward to form product. 

At initial reaction time, when t ≈ 0, little product formation occurs, therefore the backward reaction rate of k&lt;sub&gt;-2&lt;/sub&gt; may be neglected. The new reaction becomes:

E + S ↔ ES → E + P

Assuming steady state, the following rate equations may be written as:

Rate of formation of ES = k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[E][S]

Rate of breakdown of ES = (k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [ES]

and set equal to each other (Note that the brackets represent concentrations).
Therefore:

k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[E][S] = (k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [ES]

Rearranging terms,

[E][S]/[ES] = (k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

The fraction [E][S]/[ES] has been coined K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, or the Michaelis constant.

According to Michaelis-Menten's kinetics equations, at low concentrations of subtrate, [S], the concentration is almost negligible in the denominator as K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; [S], so the equation is essentially 

V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; [S]/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; 

which resembles a first order reaction.

At High substrate concentrations, [S] &gt;&gt; K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus the term [S]/([S] + K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) becomes essentially one and the initial velocity approached V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, which resembles zero order reaction.

The '''Michaelis-Menten''' equation is:
[[File:Michaelis menten equation.jpg|thumb|left|Michaelis-Menten Equation]]

'''''In this equation:'''''

'''V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the velocity of the reaction. 

'''V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the maximal rate of the reaction.

'''[Substrate]''' is the concentration of the substrate.

'''K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the Michaelis-Menten constant which shows the concentration of the substrate when the reaction velocity is equal to one half of the maximal velocity for the reaction.  It can also be thought of as a measure of how well a substrate complexes with a given enzyme, otherwise known as its binding affinity.  An equation with a low K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value indicates a large binding affinity, as the reaction will approach V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; more rapidly. An equation with a high K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that the enzyme does not bind as efficiently with the substrate, and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; will only be reached if the substrate concentration is high enough to saturate the enzyme.

As the concentration of substrates increases at constant enzyme concentration, the active sites on the protein will be occupied as the reaction is proceeding. When all the active sites have been occupied, the reaction is complete, which means that the enzyme is at its maximum capacity and increasing the concentration of substrate will not increase the rate of turnover. Here is an analogy which help to understand this concept easier.

Vmax is equal to the product of the catalyst rate constant (kcat) and the concentration of the enzyme. The Michaelis-Menten equation can then be rewritten as V= Kcat [Enzyme] [S] / (Km + [S]). Kcat is equal to K2, and it measures the number of substrate molecules &quot;turned over&quot; by enzyme per second. The unit of Kcat is in 1/sec. The reciprocal of Kcat is then the time required by an enzyme to &quot;turn over&quot; a substrate molecule. The higher the Kcat is, the more substrates get turned over in one second.   

Km is the concentration of substrates when the reaction reaches half of Vmax. A small Km indicates high affinity since it means the reaction can reach half of Vmax in a small number of substrate concentration. This small Km will approach Vmax more quickly than high Km value.

When Kcat/ Km, it gives us a measure of enzyme efficiency with a unit of 1/(Molarity*second)= L/ (mol*s).  The enzyme efficiency can be increased as Kcat has high turnover and a small number of Km.  

Taking the reciprocal of both side of the Michaelis-Menten equation gives:
[[Image:Reciprocal MM equation.JPG]]
To determined the values of K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and Vmax. The double-reciprocal of Michaels-Menten equation could be used. 

[[Image:Reciprocal-MM.JPG|thumb|left|Lineweaver-Burk Plot]]
A graph of the double-reciprocal equation is also called a Lineweaver-Burk, 1/Vo vs 1/[S]. The y-intercept is 1/Vmax; the x-intercept is -1/KM; and the slope is KM/Vmax.  Lineweaver-Burk graphs are particularly useful for analyzing how enzyme kinematics change in the presence of inhibitors, competitive, non-competitive, or a mixture of the two.

{{BookCat}}

There are three reversible inhibitors: competitive, uncompetitive, and non-competitive. They can be plotted on double reciprocal plot. 
Competitive inhibitors are molecules that look like substrates and they bind to active site and slow down the reactions. Therefore, competitive inhibitors increase Km value (decrease affinity, less chance the substrates can go to active site), and Vmax stays the same. On double reciprocal plot, competitive inhibitor swifts the x-axis (1/[s]) to the right towards zero compared to the slope with no inhibitor present.
Uncompetitive inhibitors can bind close to the active site but don't occupy the active site. As a result, uncompetitive inhibitors lower Km (increase affinity) and lower Vmax.  On double reciprocal plot, x-axis (1/[s]) is shifted to the left and up on the y-axis (1/V) compared to the slope with no inhibitor. 
Non-competitive inhibitors are not bind to the active site but somewhere on that enzyme which changes its activity. It has the same Km but lower Vmax to those with no inhibitors. On the double reciprocal plot, the slope goes higher on y-axis (1/V) than the one with no inhibitor.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Biography==
Linda McGreevy’s life started with the “shotgun romance” of her parents. After knowing each other for only two weeks the two discovered they were meant for each other and the rest is history. Mc Greevy was Born July 13, 1945 in Savanna, Georgia on the same day the atomic device is exploded at Alamogordo [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamogordo,_New_Mexico]]. Her father did not get to meet his new daughter until she was six months old, he was an Army Captain and currently stationed in Guam when she was born.  
===Early Childhood===
McGreevy was born the only child to loving and nurturing parents. Her parents encouraged her to develop a creative mind.  McGreevy believes much of her talent and creative thinking comes from her father’s side of the family.

==Education==
===Undergraduate Degree===
UGA 1963, she was one of 1,000 female freshman in the newly constructed 9 story dorm. The campus was very restrictive and she started her academic career as a painter there.

==Armstrong State==
Double major, history and English
===Graduate and PHD===
She was close to the studio student body and has &quot;always been a modernist.&quot;
==UGA==
MA Art History 1973. PHD Art History 1975.
===Career===
1967-69 &quot;Savanna AM News PM Press&quot;
1976-78 Art critic in Savanna. This career move was encouraged by Elaine de Kooning.
1978 Old Dominion University. She has been teaching at the university for 30 years and still possesses a passion for art that intoxicates her classroom.
1980, She was offered a position as an Art Critic at the Village Voice. She declined the position and she has no regrets.

==Teaching==
&quot;Art History leads you everywhere&quot; -Linda McGreevy 
She teaches because she loves talking about art. While she was studying art in college she didn't like how others taught art and believed that she could do better. McGreevy's teaching methodology is based on a personal experience with art and feeling a connection to life and art.

==Concentration==
Mid. Century Art between the German Wars, Atto Dix and Anti War 
===Accomplishments===
She is proud that she has been able to live in the Norfolk area and stay active in the art community. 
==Positions Held==
Department Chair of Art Department, Full Professor of Art History and Criticism. She want to be at ODU when the Art department moved into the new building and is not actively involved in the renovation of the art library.
===Funny ODU Story===
In 1984, a Grad student ran into her 121 ARTH class with a stocking on his head ran down the isle at her. McGreevy's 60 students all hit the floor in fear for their lives. McGreevy brandished a toy gun and chased the student across campus. Her students were later told it was all a performance piece.

===Her wonderful husband===
Tim Cooper is Linda Mc Greevy's husband and owner of the Naro Expanded Video. Tim and Linda enjoy collecting antiques and 20th century Pop Culture. The couple has been together for 29 years and was introduced by a former student. Their love was formed by the death of a dog-named Happy. The tragedy of the dog brought the two together and over a coffee the two discovered their love of Marcel Duchamp and each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Lipid bilayer''' is a universal component of all cell membranes. The structure is called a &quot;lipid bilayer&quot; because it composed of two layers of fatty acids organized in two sheets. The lipid bilayer is typically about five nanometers to ten nanometers thick and surrounds all cells providing the cell membrane structure. With the hydrophobic tails of each individual sheet interacting with one another, a hydrophobic interior is formed and this acts as a permeability barrier. The hydrophilic head groups interact with the aqueous medium on both sides of the bilayer. The two opposing sheets are also known as leaflets.

The lipid bilayer has unique properties. They are formed in sheet-like structures that contain both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic moiety. The membrane is composed of lipids and proteins and sometimes even carbohydrates. There are two different membrane proteins in the lipid bilayer. Integral membrane proteins traverse the lipid bilayer and are adjacent to both the extracellular fluid and the cytoplasm of the cell. Peripheral membrane proteins only bind to the surface of the integral proteins and are only on either side of the membrane, outer or inner. Specific proteins on the surface of the membrane mediate different functions. For example, the sodium-potassium pump plays a major role in balancing the concentration gradient between the extracellular fluid and inside the cell. Phospholipid bilayer also has electrical properties which, as discussed with the sodium-potassium pump, allows the transfer of ions through and out of the lipid bilayer.

== Structure ==
[[Image:Membrane bilayer.jpg‎|right|thumb|A bilayer lipid membrane]]

The structure of the lipid bilayer explains its function as a barrier. Lipids are fats, like oil, that are insoluble in water because of its long hydrophobic tails. The hydrophobic interactions among several phospholipids and glycolipids, a certain structure called lipid bilayer or bimolecular sheet is favored. Phospholipids and glycolipids have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties (amphiphilic or amphipathic). Thus, when several phospholipids or glycolipids come together in an aqueous solution, the hydrophobic tails interact with each other to form a hydrophobic center, while the hydrophilic heads interact with each other by forming a hydrophilic coating on each side of the bilayer point radically towards the polar solvent. 

This lipid bilayer formation is spontaneous since the hydrophobic interactions are energetically favorable to the structure. The lipid bilayer is a noncovalent assembly. The proteins and lipid molecules are held together by noncovalent interactions such as Van der Waals forces (which holds the hydrophobic tails together) and hydrogen bonding (which binds the hydrophilic heads with water), which help to stabilize the lipid bilayer structure.

Proteins are embedded in the biological lipid bilayer membrane. The mass ratio of the lipid molecules and the proteins that are embedded in them ranges from 1:4 to 4:1. Two types of proteins exist in the lipid bilayer: '''integral''' and '''peripheral''' membrane proteins. Integral membrane proteins traverse the lipid bilayer.  That is, they interact extensively with the hydrophobic region (hydrocarbon region) of the lipid bilayer. Integral membrane proteins interact by nonpolar interactions. Peripheral membrane proteins are usually attached to surfaces of integral proteins; therefore, they are on both faces of lipid bilayer. Peripheral membrane proteins interact with the hydrophilic polar head groups of the lipid molecule. Peripheral proteins bind through electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with the head group of the lipid. They usually bind to integral proteins on the cytoplasmic or extracellular side. However, they can also be covalently attached to the bilayer by a hydrophobic chain.

Lipid bilayer membranes are asymmetric, which means the outside face of membrane is always different from the inner face of the membrane.

==Bilayer Dimension==
The diameter of the spherical lipid bilayers starts from 250Å and goes up. The width or thickness of the bilayers is determined by the length of non polar tails. For phospholipids and sphingolipids it has ranges between 16 to 24 carbon atoms. Total width including the group heads ranges from 45Å to 50Å.

==Phospholipid Translocators==
Because phospholipids are synthesized from the cytosol side of the membrane, there needs to be a way to move the phospholipid towards the lumen side of the lipid bilayer. Scramblase, a translocator, is responsible for creating symmetry between the two leaflets of the lipid bilayer. As each individual phospholipid is synthesized, they are equilibrated between the layers, known as &quot;FLIP FLOP.&quot; With the function of scramblase, it is concluded that the different types of phospholipids are evenly distributed between the two layers, seen in ER membrane. 

However, in the plasma membrane, a different movement occurs. Part of the P-type pumps, flippase translocator use the energy coupled with the ATP hydrolysis to flip the phospholipids towards the cytosol side of the membrane. Therefore the bilayer in plasma membrane is maintained to be asymmetric by the flippase. Plasma membrane also does contain scramblase, but as opposed to ER scramblase, the scramblase in plasma membrane is activated only at certain times especially during apoptosis and activated platelets, where its purpose is to promote asymmetry.

== Properties ==
Because of these interactions, lipid bilayer inherits unique properties. Lipid bilayers have &quot;extensive&quot; properties - they can enclose and form compartments. Lastly, they can also recover quickly if there is a hole in the lipid bilayer due to energetic reasons. However, phospholipids and glycolipids do not form micelles like fatty acids do because phospholipids and glycolipids have two hydrocarbon chains and they are too bulky to orient themselves into a sphere like a micelle. Additional properties of the lipid bilayer membrane include that they are: sheet-like, formed by lipids and proteins (sometimes carbohydrates), are amphiphatic, possess some noncovalent parts, are asymmetric, fluid, and are electrically polarized. Using fluid mosaic models, it can be seen that the bilayer undergoes rapid lateral diffusion, but flip-flop or transverse diffusion proceeds very slowly. There is also a hydrophobic transmembrane alpha helix that passes through the membrane, with the amine component on the extracellular side and the carboxy group on the cytoplasmic side.

Membrane Properties:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Form sheet-like structures&lt;br /&gt;
2. Formed by lipids and proteins (sometimes carbohydrates)&lt;br /&gt;
3. Lipid membranes are amphipatic (have properties that are both polar and nonpolar)&lt;br /&gt;
4. Specific proteins mediates membrane functions (proteins can promote permeability of membrane)&lt;br /&gt;
5. Non-covalent assemblies (hydrophobic forces keeps membrane together&lt;br /&gt;
6. Asymmetric (typically because of proteins)&lt;br /&gt;
7. Fluid Structures - phospholipids are constantly moving&lt;br /&gt;
8. Electrically polarized - has the ability to isolate/separate charges (EX: used to produce ATP or transfer nervous signals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Membrane Properties.&quot; UCSD Lecture. November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions of the lipid bilayer ==
The most important property of the lipid bilayer is that it is a highly impermeable structure. Impermeable simply means that it does not allow molecules to freely pass across it. Only water and gases can easily pass through the bilayer. This property means that large molecules and small polar molecules cannot cross the bilayer, and thus the cell membrane, without the assistance of other structures. This property of the lipid bilayer balance water and other organic molecules from influx/exflux through the cell and environment.

Another important property of the lipid bilayer is its fluidity. The lipid bilayer contains lipid molecules, and, it also contains proteins. The bilayer's fluidity allows these structures mobility within the lipid bilayer. This fluidity is biologically important, influencing membrane transport. 

The function of the lipid bilayer membrane is mediated by the specific protein that is embedded in it. The proteins of the lipid bilayer function as pumps, channels, energy transducers, receptors, and enzymes.

===Liposomes===

A liposome, or lipid vesicle, is a vesicle enclosed by a lipid bilayer. Lipsomes are the opposite of micelles in that they are hollow on the inside. Liposomes are important for studying membrane permeability and they can be used to deliver ions or molecules inside cells.  It is characterized by a bilayer membrane that creates an outer aqueous compartment and an inner aqueous compartment due to the hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails of the lipids, as shown by the figure below.

[[File:Liposome Structure.png]]
[[File:LiposomeInWater.png|thumb|Another view of liposomes, the red represent the hydrophylic heads and the orange represents the hydrophobic tails.]]
One of the ways liposomes can deliver ions and molecules to the inside of cells is through sonication of phospholipids. Phospholipids are suspended in an aqueous medium and are then sonicated, after which the phospholipids form closed vesicles. Sonication involves applying sound energy to agitate the phospholipids so that they can create liposomes around the desired ions or molecules in the solution. After the liposomes trap the ions present in the aqueous layer, gel filtration is used to wipe out the excess ions. By measuring the rate of efflux of ions from the inner compartment to the outer aqueous solution, the permeability of the bilayer can be measured. The hydrophobic layer of the membrane isolates ions from coming in-as this would be a very thermodynamically unfavorable process. This process is shown in the figure below using glycine as an example. [[File:Liposome Formation-Sonication.png]]

==Effect of Lipid Bilayers on Local Aqueous Environment==
When the majority of lipids in a bilayer are anionic, they attract cations and repel anions. This will result in a special double layer solution depleted in anions and enriched in cations surround the bilayer. This layer has the ability to change the structure and function of membrane proteins. A sodium/potassium pump driven by ATP in the bilayer pumps potassium into the cell and sodium out of the cell.

== Significance of the lipid bilayer ==
The fact of lipid bilayer, it forms a basis for cell membrane is very significant in cellular biology. If there were no membrane, there would be no distinction between intra and extracellular compartments. If there were be no cells, there would be no ways to understand how many of the biological and chemical phenomena occur since cells are the basic building blocks of life. Employing such difference between hydrophility and hydrophobicity, albeit simple, has enormous significance and consequences in the field of biochemical studies, if not the life itself. This is also an example of how intricate and fearfully the cells are made to operate to bring life.

== Proteins Carry Out Most Membrane Processes==
Proteins are responsible for most of the dynamic processes carried out by membranes. In particular, proteins transport chemicals and information across a membrane. 

'''Membranes and Protein Concentration'''

Membranes differ in their protein content. Myelin, a membrane that serves as an electrical insulator around certain nerve fibers, has a very low concentration of proteins (18%). Relatively pure lipids are usually sufficient in their insulating properties. In contrast, the plasma membranes, or exterior membranes, of most other cells are much more metabolically active. It contains many pumps, channels, receptors and enzymes. The protein content is usually 50%. Energy-transduction membranes, such as the internal membranes of mitochondria and chlororplasts, have the highest concentration of proteins, usually 75%. In general, membranes performing different functions contain different concentrations and repertoires of proteins.

'''Proteins Associate with the Lipid Bilayer in a Variety of Ways'''

The ease with which a protein can be dissociated from a membrane indicates how intinately it is associated with the membrane. Some membrane proteins can be solubilized by relatively mild means, such as extraction by a solution of high ionic strength. Other membrane proteins are bound much more tenaciously; the can be solubilized only by using a detergent or an organic solvent. In this manner, membrane proteins can either be classified as peripheralor integral on the basis of this difference in dissociability. Integral proteins interact extensively with the hydrocarbon chains of the membrane lipids, and they can be released only by agents that compete for these nonpolar interaction. In fact, most integral membrane proteins span the lipid bilayer. In contrast peripheral proteins are bound to membranes primarily by electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions with the head groups of the lipids. These polar interactions can be disrupted by adding salts or by changing the pH. Many peripheral membrane proteins are bound to the surface of integral proteins on either the cytoplasmic or the extracellular side of the membrane. 

'''Secondary Structure of Membrane Proteins'''
Proteins can span the membrane with alpha helices. The archaeal protein bacteriorhodopsin is built almost entirely of alpha helices; seven closely packed alpha helices arranged almost perpendicularly to the plane of the cell membrane, spanning its width. Examination of the primary structure of this protein reveals that most of the amino acid residues in the alpha helices are nonpolar and only a few are charged. This distribution of nonpolar amino acids is sensible because these residues are either in contact with the hydrocarbon core of the membrane or with one another. Membrane spanning alpha helices are the most common structural motif in membrane proteins. These regions can be identified with the primary sequence alone.

Robert Wojtowicz was born December 12, 1961 in Philadelphia, PA. He grew up with four sisters and his parents were culturally minded individuals. Wojtowicz is a noted scholar of Lewis Mumford and finds Mumford a rewarding topic of research. Wojtowicz admires his concentration of teaching interdisciplinary studies and challenges himself to keep his sights high. 

Originally he wanted to be an architect but was encouraged by a professor to study Art History because he demonstrated skills as a writer. His first job was the Art History position at ODU.

[[Image:Nest of Carrot Salad, by LadyofProcrastination.jpg|thumb|300px|Carrot salad, without the optional wrapping in greens]]
==Ingredients==
*Carrots (about 4 medium sized)
*Almond oil
*White balsalmic vinegar (or a mix of two parts red wine vinegar to one part balsamic vinegar)
*Coarse salt
*Fresh ground pepper
*Pine nuts
===Optional===
*Fresh greens (like matzumi or baby Chinese mustard, or even Boston lettuce)
*Chives

==Procedure==
Julliene the carrots (or grate them if julienning is not feasible). Coat with about 1-2 tablespoons of almond oil. Sprinkle generously with vinegar, salt and pepper. Add a hefty serving of pine nuts.

===Optional: Carrot salad wrapped in greens===
Place a little bit of salad on a green leaf and wrap it up, tying it with a chive. They make about 2-bite hors d'œuvres that are light, healthy, and surprisingly filling. If you can get a-hold of the young mustard greens, they add a fantastic spiciness to it that can't be matched.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nouns ==

طالب Student &lt;br&gt;
استاذ Teacher &lt;br&gt;
كتاب Book &lt;br&gt;
مطعم Restaurant &lt;br&gt;
سيارة Car &lt;br&gt;
بيت House &lt;br&gt;
جامعة University &lt;br&gt;

== Definite Article ==

The use of definite articles in Arabic can completely change the use of the word. ال (Alif Lam) is the definite article in Arabic. This is the equivalent to the English &quot;the&quot;. Without the definite article ال the noun will become either two things. كتاب (book), is displayed indefinite and can mean either &quot;a book (one book)&quot; or just &quot;book&quot;. An example of كتاب used without the definite article is: &quot;Do you have a book?&quot; &quot;I want one book.&quot; &quot;I like that book&quot;

Definite: الطالب قرا الكتاب The student read the book الكتاب &lt;br&gt;
Indefinite: اريد ان اقرا كتاب I want to read a book كتاب &lt;br&gt;

== Feminine &amp; Masculine ==

Every noun in Arabic is either feminine or masculine. The general rule for feminine words are that they end in the letter ة. There are words that don't end in ة but are still feminine; but, there are no words that end in ة that are masculine. Non proper nouns like book كتاب and house بيت always remain either masculine or feminine. But others like student طالب and teacher استاذ that are actual living beings that differ in gender differ in spelling. A male student would be a طالب while a female student would be a طالبة. To differ between genders, add a ة to designate that the person is a female, and drop the ة to designate that the person is masculine. &lt;br&gt;

طالب Student (male) &lt;br&gt;
طالبة Student (female) &lt;br&gt;
استاذ Teacher (male) &lt;br&gt;
استاذة Teacher (female) &lt;br&gt;
صديق Friend (male) &lt;br&gt;
صديقة Friend (female) &lt;br&gt;

== Adjectives ==

جميل Beautiful &lt;br&gt;
كبير Big &lt;br&gt;
برد Cold &lt;br&gt;
صغير Small &lt;br&gt;

In Arabic, an adjective also is either masculine or feminine depending on the gender of the noun being described. ة is used at the end of adjectives if the noun is feminine, and the ة is dropped when the noun is masculine. 

البيت الكبير The big house &lt;br&gt;
السيارة الجميلة The beautiful car &lt;br&gt;
المطعم الصغير The small restaurant &lt;br&gt;
NOTE: The adjective comes after the noun in this context &lt;br&gt;

When connecting nouns and adjectives (i.e.: the teacher is big), use either هي or هو .هو means either &quot;he&quot; or &quot;is (masculine)&quot;. هي means either &quot;she&quot; or &quot;is (feminine)&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
الاستذة هي صغيرة The teacher is small &lt;br&gt;
السيارة هي جديدة The car is new &lt;br&gt;
البيت هو جميل The house is beautiful &lt;br&gt;
محمد هو كبير Muhammad is big &lt;br&gt;

== Pronouns ==

انا I (me) &lt;br&gt;
انت You (enta = masculine, enti = feminine) &lt;br&gt;
هو He &lt;br&gt;
هي She &lt;br&gt;
انتم You (plural) &lt;br&gt;
نحن We &lt;br&gt;

When connecting these pronouns with adjectives, there is no connector needed. انت جميلة You are beautiful. Connectors consist of &quot;is&quot; &quot;are&quot; which occur in the middle of a sentence.

== Possessive Pronouns ==

To express possession upon an object or noun, Arabic uses suffixes. The suffixes remain the same for all nouns. &lt;br&gt;

Using the noun كتاب memorize these basic possessive pronouns. &lt;br&gt;

كتاب Book &lt;br&gt;
كتابي My book &lt;br&gt;
كتابك Your book &lt;br&gt;
كتابه His book &lt;br&gt;
كتابها Her book &lt;br&gt;
كتابكم Your (plural) book &lt;br&gt;
كتابنا Our book &lt;br&gt;

== Verbs ==

Like many other languages, Arabic conjugates verbs through numerous prefixes and suffixes.
When displaying a verb, the verb will most likely be conjugated in all tenses as هو. So before using these verbs, be sure you know how to correctly conjugate them.
Using the verb كتب, memorize these conjugations. Notice how each conjugation has كتب in it.

اكتب I write &lt;br&gt;
تكتب She writes / You (male) write &lt;br&gt;
تكتبين You (female) write &lt;br&gt;
يكتب He writes &lt;br&gt;
نكتب We write &lt;br&gt;
تكتبون You (plural {masculine &amp; feminine}) write &lt;br&gt;
يكتبون They (masculine &amp; feminine) write &lt;br&gt;

اريد I want &lt;br&gt;
احب I like &lt;br&gt;
اذهب I go &lt;br&gt;
اقرا I read &lt;br&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f:X\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathcal{L}^1&lt;/math&gt; be such that there exist &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;f(x)&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a convex function on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; then, 

&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\phi\left(\int_Xfd\mu\right)\leq\int_X\phi\circ fd\mu&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof'''

Let &lt;math&gt;t=\displaystyle\int_Xfd\mu&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a probability measure, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;t&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\beta=\sup\{\frac{\phi(t)-\phi(s)}{t-s}:a&lt;s&lt;t&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;t&lt;u&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;; then &lt;math&gt;\beta\leq\displaystyle\frac{\phi(u)-\phi(t)}{u-t}&lt;/math&gt;


Thus, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{\phi(t)-\phi(s)}{t-s}\leq\frac{\phi(u)-\phi(t)}{u-t}&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)-\phi(s)\leq\beta(t-s)&lt;/math&gt;


Put &lt;math&gt;s=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\phi\left(\int_Xfd\mu\right)-\phi f(x)+\beta\left(f(x)-\int_Xfd\mu\right)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, which completes the proof.

===Corollary===
#Putting &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)=e^x&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle e^{(\int_Xfd\mu)}\leq\int_Xe^fd\mu&lt;/math&gt;
	
#If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a counting measure, and if &lt;math&gt;f(x_i)=p_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle e^{\left(\frac{p_1+\ldots+p_n}{n}\right)}\leq\frac{1}{n}\left(e^{p_1}+e^{p_2}+\ldots+e^{p_n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

For every &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathcal{L}^p&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_p=\left(\int_X|f|^pd\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Holder's inequality==
Let &lt;math&gt;1&lt;p,q&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathcal{L}^p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in\mathcal{L}^q&lt;/math&gt;. 

Then, &lt;math&gt;fg\in\mathcal{L}^1&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;math&gt;\|fg\|\leq\|f\|_p\|g\|_q&lt;/math&gt;
 
'''Proof'''

We know that &lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; is a concave function

Let &lt;math&gt;0\leq t\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;a&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;t\log a+(1-t)\log b\leq \log(at+b(1-t))&lt;/math&gt;


That is, &lt;math&gt;a^tb^{1-t}\leq ta+(1-t)b&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;t=\frac{1}{p}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a=\left(\frac{|f|}{\|f\|_p}\right)^p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b=\left(\frac{|f|}{\|f\|_q}\right)^q&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{|f|}{\|f\|_p}\frac{|g|}{\|g\|_q}\leq\frac{1}{p}\frac{|f|^p}{\|f\|^p_p}+\frac{1}{q}\frac{|g|^q}{\|g\|^q_q}&lt;/math&gt;


Then, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{1}{\|f\|_p\|g\|_q}\int_X|f||g|d\mu\leq\frac{1}{p\|f\|_p^p}\int_X|f|^pd\mu+\frac{1}{p\|g\|_q^q}\int_X|g|^qd\mu=1&lt;/math&gt;,

which proves the result

===Corollary===
If &lt;math&gt;\mu(X)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1&lt;s&lt;r&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^r\subset \mathcal{L}^s&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof''' 

Let &lt;math&gt;\phi\in\mathcal{L}^s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p=\frac{r}{s}\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g\equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;

Then, &lt;math&gt;f=|\phi|^s\in\mathcal{L}^1&lt;/math&gt;, and hence &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\int_X|\phi|^sd\mu\leq\left(\int_X\left(|\phi|^s\right)^{\frac{r}{s}}d\mu\right)^{\frac{s}{r}}\mu(X)^{1-\frac{s}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;


We say that if &lt;math&gt;f,g:X\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f=g&lt;/math&gt; ''almost everywhere'' on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mu(\{x|f(x)\neq g(x)\})=0&lt;/math&gt;. Observe that this is an equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^p&lt;/math&gt;


If &lt;math&gt;(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is a measure space, define the space &lt;math&gt;L^p&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of all equivalence classes of functions in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^p&lt;/math&gt;

==Theorem==
The &lt;math&gt;L^p&lt;/math&gt; space with the &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_p&lt;/math&gt; norm is a normed linear space, that is,
#&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_p\geq0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;f\in L^p&lt;/math&gt;, further, &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_p=0\iff f=0&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\|\lambda\|_p=|\lambda|\|f\|_p&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\|f+g\|_p\leq\|f\|_p+\|g\|_p&lt;/math&gt; . . . (Minkowski's inequality)

'''Proof'''

1. and 2. are clear, so we prove only 3. The cases &lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p=\infty&lt;/math&gt; (see below) are obvious, so assume that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;p&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;f,g\in L^p&lt;/math&gt; be given. Hölder's inequality yields the following, where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is chosen such that &lt;math&gt;1/q+1/p = 1&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;p/q = p-1&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\int_X|f+g|^pd\mu=\int_X|f+g|^{p-1}|f+g|d\mu\leq\int_X|f+g|^{p-1}(|f|+|g|)d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\leq\displaystyle\left(\int_X|f+g|^{(p-1)q}d\mu\right)^\frac{1}{q}\|f\|_p+\left(\int_X|f+g|^{(p-1)q}d\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{q}}\|g\|_p=\|f+g\|_p^{\frac{p}{q}}\|f\|_p+\|f+g\|_p^{\frac{p}{q}}\|g\|_p.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, as &lt;math&gt;t\mapsto t^p&lt;/math&gt; is convex for &lt;math&gt;p&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \frac{|f+g|^p}{2^p} = \left|\frac{f}{2}+\frac{g}{2}\right|^p\leq \left(\frac{|f|}{2}+\frac{|g|}{2}\right)^p \leq \frac{1}{2}|f|^p + \frac{1}{2}|g|^p.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that &lt;math&gt;\|f+g\|_p&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; so that we may divide by it in the previous calculation to obtain &lt;math&gt;\|f+g\|_p\leq\|f\|_p+\|g\|_p&lt;/math&gt;.


Define the space &lt;math&gt;L^{\infty}=\{f|X\to\mathbb{C},f\text{ is bounded almost everywhere}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Further, for &lt;math&gt;f\in L^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; define &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{\infty}=\sup\{|f(x)|:x\notin E\}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section there is a large amount of information and unfortunately most of it just has to be learnt. Read the suggestions at the end of each sub-section for best ways of learning.

== Period 3 Oxides ==
You are required to know about the formation and reactions of MgO, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Magnesium oxide ===
[[Image:Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png|200px|thumb|Ionic Lattice]]

MgO is formed simply by heating in oxygen:

Mg(s) + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) ---&gt; MgO(s)

Observations: Burns with bright white flame to form white solid. (used in fireworks for this reason)

Basic oxide: Magnesium oxide is a basic oxide, meaning that when it dissolves in water an alkaline solution will be made:

MgO(s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) ---&gt; Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an weak alakali due to partial dissociation of ions.

Structure: Magnesium oxide forms a giant lattice structure with ionic bonding




=== Aluminium Oxide ===
[[Image:Corundum-3D-balls.png|300px|thumb|Aluminium Oxide]]
Aluminium reacts very easily in oxygen, so much so that at room temperature it forms a layer around aluminium. Once this layer has formed, it protects the aluminium and prevents it from readily reacting. However, if the aluminium is in powdered form the aluminium burns. The formation reaction is as follows:

4Al(s) + 3O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)---&gt; 2Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

Observations: Burns when powdered - white solid product

Amphoteric oxide: This means that it can react as either an acid or a base (see below). However, aluminium oxide will not react with water (insoluble).

Structure: Aluminium Oxide has 'intermediate bonding'- This basically means that it has a Giant lattice structure but also has some covalent bonding too. The intermediate bonding in aluminium oxide explains why it is insoluble.


[[Image:Sulfur-dioxide-3D-vdW.png|200px|thumb|Sulphur dioxide molecule]]

=== Sulphur dioxide ===

Sulphur burns in oxygen to produce sulphur dioxide:

S(s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) ---&gt; SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

Observations: Burns with blue flame to give gas

When heated with a platinum catalyst SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(l) is formed

Acidic oxide: Sulphur dioxide reacts with water leaving an acidic solution:

SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(l) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) ---&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)

and similarly:

SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(l) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) ---&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)

Structure: Simple molecular

=== Acid-Base reactions ===
Some questions ask you to give examples of &quot;acid-base reactions&quot; they may or may not say oxides specifically. Basically an acid base reaction is one where an acid and a base react with each other. We have already discussed the nature of these oxides (e.g. acidic oxide - sulphur) and this refers to the role that it plays in the reaction:

MgO(s) + 2HCl(aq) ---&gt; MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)

Here, Magnesium oxide acts as a base in a reaction with hydrochloric acid.

Aluminium oxide is amphoteric so acts as a base or an acid. It's reaction as a base is similar to above but its reaction as an acid occurs when it is hydrated:

Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) ---&gt; [Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

It is also worth knowing the acid-base reaction for sulphur because it is a little different to what may be expected. We already know that sulphur is an acidic oxide and that it is able to form SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and now we can see this in action:

SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + NaOH(aq) ---&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)

The OH group is removed in the reaction as SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is acting as an acid.

'''Remember:''' 
* Basic oxides (left of periodic table) have giant lattice structures and form alkaline solutions in water
* Amphoteric oxides (aluminium oxide - Metalloid) have giant lattice structure with some covalent bonding so don't dissolve
* Acidic oxides (right of periodic table) are simple molecules and react with water to produce acid

== Period 3 Chlorides ==
The chlorides that you need to know about are NaCl, MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Magnesium chloride.jpg|200px|thumb|Solid Magnesium Chloride]]
=== Sodium and Magnesium Chlorides ===
2Na(s) + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) ---&gt; 2NaCl(s)

Mg(g) + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s) ---&gt; MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

There is nothing fancy about these reactions or products - you simply heat the metals and lower into chlorine gas to form white solids.

Structure and bonding - Both of these products have giant ionic lattice structures with ionic bonding

Reactions with water (products) - Sodium chloride dissolves in water, leaving a neutral solution. Magnesium chloride also dissolves but leaves a sligtly acidic solution.

[[Image:Aluminium-trichloride-3D-structures.png|350px|thumb|Aluminium trichloride]]
=== Aluminium Chloride ===
Some text books miss out Aluminium chloride but the specification includes it with the other chlorides so it is important. 
Aluminium Chloride can be prepared under anhydrous conditions by heating aluminium in dry chlorine gas:

2Al(s) + 3Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) ---&gt; 2AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

When AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is heated above its melting point of 178 °C (451 K) it forms a dimer with formula Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; where the chlorine atoms donate electron pairs forming dative covalent bonds. At higher temperatures the Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; dimer dissociates into trigonal planar AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Structure - Aluminium trichloride has simple molecular structure with covalent bonding

Reaction with water - '''Hydrolysis''' reaction evolving hydrogen chloride gas, some dissolves to leave acidic solution:

Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) ---&gt; 2Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 6HCl(g)

[[Image:Silicon tetrachloride.svg|150px|thumb|Silicon tetracloride]]

=== Silicon tetrachloride ===
Silicon tetrachloride is prepared in a similar way to aluminium chloride except a side arm is needed because silicon tetrachloride is a liquid at room temperature.

Si(s) + 2Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) ---&gt; SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(l)

Structure - Molecular 

Reaction with water - Hydrolysis:

SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(l) + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) ---&gt; SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 4HCl(g)

Observations - white fumes of hydrogen chloride gas

[[Image:Phosphorus-pentachloride-3D-balls.png|thumb|150px|Phosphorus pentachloride]]

=== Phosphorus pentachloride ===
Phosphorus trichloride combines directly with chlorine without heating:

P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 6Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) ---&gt; 4PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(l)

However, we are not really interested in the trichloride but the solid pentachloride that is formed in excess chlorine:

PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(l) + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) ---&gt; PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

Stucture - Covalent molecular in gaseous state

Reaction with water - Hydrolysis, leaving acidic solution:

PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) ---&gt; 5HCl(g) + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)

'''Remember:'''
* Neutral chlorides (left of periodic table) have giant lattice structures and dissolve to give neutral solutions (or very slightly acidic)
* Acidic chlorides (right of periodic table) have simple molecular structure and undergo hydolysis reactions to leave acidic solutions

== Reactions of period 3 elements with water ==
=== Sodium ===
Sodium reacts vigorously with water, fizzing around the surface and sometimes catching fire:

2Na(s) + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) ---&gt; 2NaOH(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

The product sodium hydroxide is a strong alkali with a high PH (&gt;12)
sodium is a very reactive element in the periodic table

=== Magnesium ===
The reaction of magnesium with water is much slower than sodium, hydrogen bubbles form very slowly:

Mg(s) + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) ---&gt; Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

This alkali is much weaker than sodium hydroxide (PH 9-11) This is because sodium hydroxide dissolves more easily - more ions in the solution.

However, if magnesium is reacted with steam the reaction is much faster in forming the oxide:

Mg(s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g) ---&gt; MgO(s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

== Questions ==

(These questions are easy if you look at the page so do it without to check you know everything)

1. Give an example of hydrolysis and acid-base reactions. Show equations and state observations

2. State the type of bonding in Aluminium oxide, does it dissolve?

3. Which reacts most readily with water - sodium or magnesium?

4. How can magnesium be made to react with water?

5. How does one make PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;?

6. Write out all 21 equations shown on this page...(no seriously)

&lt;big&gt;'''GRAMMAR NOTES'''&lt;/big&gt;

These are the grammar notes for the [[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod lessons|SpanishPod newbie lessons]]. They explain several grammar terms and concepts that are used in the lessons. 
You can read these notes as an introduction to Spanish grammar or to review the grammar discussed in the lessons. Either way, it's useful to read at least the table of contents so that you'll know where to find each particular explanation when you need it.

&lt;big&gt;'''About the Green Alien'''&lt;/big&gt;

As we discuss Spanish grammar, we are joined by a curious little alien, who wants to know everything about humans — including Spanish grammar. Many thanks to [[commons:User:LadyofHats|LadyofHats]] for establishing this contact!

==Pronunciation==
===Alphabet===
The good news is that the pronunciation of Spanish words is a lot easier than the pronunciation of English words because you don't have to learn the pronunciation for each word individually. The not so good news is that you still have to learn the pronunciation of the individual letters and a few common rules which are summarized in the following table (adapted from the wikibook [[en:Spanish/Pronunciation|“Spanish”]]). The most important rules are about the different pronunciation of '''c''', '''g''', and '''u'''. The words for the English approximation were specifically chosen to avoid strong deviations between British and American pronunciation. If the difference is important, the relevant variant is specified.

[[Image:Smiley green alien sick.svg‎|thumb|right|120px|Learning the rules about stress in Spanish words isn't that stressful.]]
===Stress===
By default, the stress is on the last syllable. The stressed vowels are underlined in the following examples:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0041|6|Cheers!| '''¡Sal&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;d!''' | Cheers! }}
However, if a word has more than one syllable and ends in a vowel ('''-a''', '''-e''', '''-i''', '''-o''' or '''-u''') or in the consonant '''-n''' or '''-s''', by default the stress is put on the second-last syllable:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0019|1|How do you spell beige?| '''T&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;ngo &lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;na preg&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;nta.'''| I have a question.}}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0092|4|How old are you?| '''M&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;chas gr&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;cias.''' | Thanks a lot. }}
One more example with both types of word:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0066|2|Bottle of Water| '''¿M&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt; d&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;na bot&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;lla d&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;gua, p&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;r fav&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;r?''' | Will you give me a bottle of water, please? }}

However, sometimes the stress does not follow these default rules. When this is the case Spanish indicates the stressed syllable by putting an accent on its vowel. For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0035|1|Is anyone in there?| '''Est&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt; ocupado.'''| It's busy.}}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0033|4|It's expensive| '''Tienes raz&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;/u&gt;n.'''| You're right.}}

Sometimes an accent mark is used even though the stress follows the default rules:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0006|2|How's it going?| '''Bien, bien. ¿Y t&lt;u&gt;ú&lt;/u&gt;? ¿Qu&lt;u&gt;é&lt;/u&gt; tal?'''| Good, good. And you, how are you?}}
Spanish uses these additional accent marks to differentiate different words that are pronounced the same way. For example: '''tú''' means ''you'' but '''tu''' means ''your''. Also, question words always have an accent, for example: '''¿qué?''' , which means ''what?'' or ''how?''.


[[Image:Smiley green alien GRRR.svg‎|thumb|right|120px|It took the green alien quite a bit of patience and practise to find out which key combinations worked best for him.]]
==Typing Spanish Characters==
Spanish uses several characters not used in English. Not only can it have marks on its vowels and a tilde on '''ñ''', but Spanish also uses an inverted question mark '''¿''' to start questions and an inverted exclamation mark '''¡''' to start exclamations (in addition to the normal question mark and exclamation mark at the end). For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0002|1|Birthday party| '''¡Hola! ¿Vas a la fiesta?'''| Hello! Are you going to the party?}}

Typing these special Spanish characters can be a bit of a problem if you do not have a Spanish keyboard. If you have a US keyboard, the first step is to switch to a US international keyboard layout if possible; see the wikibook [[Spanish/Typing Spanish Characters|“Spanish”]] for instructions. The following table summarizes some key combinations that are useful on various platforms. It also shows the codes for HTML and RSS files. The + means that you have to hold down the first key while pressing the following key. If there is no {{key2|AltGr}} key on your keyboard, it should be the {{key2|Alt}} key on the right. If there is no {{key2|Option}} key on your keyboard, it should be labeled {{key2|Alt}}. On some keyboards you have to use the number pad to type the numbers (on notebooks sometimes the number pad is part of the normal keyboard and is accessed by pressing the {{key2|Fn}} key).

Nouns are naming words. They denote things, people, places and abstract concepts, e.g., ''beer'', ''party'', ''birthday'', ''internet'', ''Seattle'', ''man'' or ''Javier'' (a person's name):
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0003|2|At the bar| '''Quiero una &lt;u&gt;cerveza&lt;/u&gt;.'''| I'd like a &lt;u&gt;beer&lt;/u&gt;.}}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0002|3|Birthday party| '''La &lt;u&gt;fiesta&lt;/u&gt; de &lt;u&gt;cumpleaños&lt;/u&gt; de &lt;u&gt;Javier&lt;/u&gt;.'''| &lt;u&gt;Javier&lt;/u&gt;'s &lt;u&gt;birthday&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;party&lt;/u&gt;.}}

[[Image:Smiley green alien cool.svg|thumb|right|120px|Being macho and being a man are different things, so are grammatical gender and sex.]]
===Gender (Masculine and Feminine)===
Spanish divides its nouns into two genders — masculine and feminine. All words in Spanish are either masculine or feminine, even if the noun has no natural gender (and in English would therefore be neuter). For instance in Spanish, the word for ''hamburger'' is feminine and the word for ''moment'' is masculine. The gender of a noun is important because the endings of Spanish [[#Articles|articles]] and [[#Adjectives|adjectives]] that belong with the nouns change depending on the noun's gender. If you don't know the gender of the noun, you have a 50:50 chance of using the wrong ending for its article or adjective. 

The good news is that most nouns that end in '''-a''' are feminine, e.g. '''hamburguesa''' – ''hamburger'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0106|3|Room service| '''Quiero una &lt;u&gt;hamburguesa&lt;/u&gt;.''' | I want a hamburger. }}
And most nouns that end in '''-o''' are masculine, e.g., '''momento''' – moment:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0001|2|Are you ready yet?| '''¡Espera un &lt;u&gt;momento&lt;/u&gt;!'''| Wait a moment!}}
And the best news of all is that most Spanish nouns actually end either in '''-a''' or '''-o'''. 

As you learn more nouns, you will see that there are also other endings that tell you whether a noun is masculine or feminine. For example, nouns ending in '''-ción''' are always feminine:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0106|1|Room service| '''¿Tiene servicio a la &lt;u&gt;habitación&lt;/u&gt;?''' | Do you have room service?}}

Probably the best way to learn the gender of Spanish nouns is to learn masculine nouns with the article '''el'''; for example: '''el momento''' – ''the moment''; '''el servicio''' – ''the service''. For feminine nouns the article is '''la'''; for example, '''la cerveza''' – ''the beer''; '''la hamburguesa''' – the hamburger; '''la habitación''' – ''the room''.

[[Image:Smiley green alien droling.svg|thumb|right|120px|'''una galleta''' – ''one cookie''; '''muchas galletas''' – ''many cookies''.]]

===Number (Singular and Plural)===
Most nouns come in two flavors: singular or plural. This is called their ''number''. In the singular form a noun denotes a single thing or person; for example, '''galleta''' – ''cookie''. In the plural form the noun denotes multiple things or persons; for example, ''' galletas''' – ''cookies'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0052|2|Smells good| '''Sí, son mis &lt;u&gt;galletas&lt;/u&gt;.''' | Yes, they are my cookies. }}

In most cases you will learn the singular form of a noun. Spanish forms the plural by adding an '''-s''' on the end, just like in English.

To form the plural of nouns that end in a vowel ('''-a''', '''-e''', '''-i''', '''-o''', or '''-u'''), you just add an '''-s''' on the end. For example, '''galleta''' – ''cookie'' and '''galletas''' – ''cookies''; '''año''' – ''year'' and '''años''' – ''years'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0092|2|How old are you?| '''Tengo treinta &lt;u&gt;años&lt;/u&gt;.''' | I'm thirty &lt;u&gt;years&lt;/u&gt; old. }}

For nouns that end in a consonant, i.e. not in '''-a''', '''-e''', '''-i''', '''-o''' or '''-u''', you add the ending '''-es''' to form the plural. For example, singular: '''dólar''' – ''dollar'' and plural: '''dólares''' – ''dollars''.
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0033|1|It's expensive| '''Mi renta es de mil &lt;u&gt;dólares&lt;/u&gt;.'''| My rent is at a thousand dollars.}}

===Plural of Masculine Nouns===
Several Spanish nouns have a masculine and a feminine form, for example, '''hijo''' – ''son'' and '''hija''' – ''daughter''. Another example is '''médico''' – ''male doctor'' and '''médica''' – ''female doctor''.

In contrast to English, the Spanish plural of the masculine forms of these words refers to “not-all-feminine” groups, i.e. either to a group of male persons or a group of male and female persons. For example, the plural of '''hijo''' – ''son'' is '''hijos''' – ''sons/children'', which can either refer to a group of sons only or to a group of sons and daughters. On the other hand, the plural of the feminine form is never ambiguous, i.e. it always refers to “all-feminine” groups. For example, '''hija''' – ''daughter'' has the plural form '''hijas''' – ''daughters''. 

Other masculine plurals that are ambiguous in English are: '''niños''' – ''boys/kids'', '''chicos''' – ''boys/kids'', '''padres''' – ''fathers/parents'', '''abuelos''' – ''grandfathers/grandparents'', etc.

==Articles==
===Definite Articles===
In English, the definite article is ''the''. The English definite article is always ''the'', whatever sort of noun it precedes. In Spanish, however, the definite article takes one of four forms depending on the [[#Gender (Masculine and Feminine)|gender]] and [[#Number (Singular and Plural)|number]] of the corresponding [[#Nouns|noun]]. The four forms are:
*'''el''' for masculine, singular nouns:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0016|4|I feel sick| '''Me duele &lt;u&gt;el&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;estómago&lt;/u&gt;.'''| My stomach hurts.}}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0096|1|I am allergic| '''Quiero &lt;u&gt;el&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;pastel&lt;/u&gt; de chocolate.'''  | I want the chocolate cake. }}
*'''los''' for masculine, plural nouns; e.g., '''los pasteles''' – ''the cakes''.

*'''la''' for feminine, singular nouns:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0002|1|Birthday party| '''¡Hola! ¿Vas a &lt;u&gt;la&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;fiesta&lt;/u&gt;?'''| Hello! Are you going to the party?}}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0102|2|Where is the restroom?| '''&lt;u&gt;La&lt;/u&gt; segunda &lt;u&gt;puerta&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;la&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;derecha&lt;/u&gt;.'''  | The second door on the right. }}
*'''las''' for feminine, plural nouns; e.g., '''las puertas''' – ''the doors''.

[[Image:Smiley green alien mmm.svg|thumb|right|140px|Don't worry about exceptions until you are familiar with the regular form!]]
As always, there are exceptions to these rules. Firstly, you use '''el''' instead of '''la''' as the feminine singular definite article whenever the definite article comes immediately before a feminine, singular noun that starts with a stressed '''a-''' or '''ha-'''. For instance '''el agua''' – ''the water'', '''el hambre''' – ''the hunger'' (both these Spanish nouns are feminine). This exception is discussed in [[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod newbie lesson A0066|lesson A0066]].

Secondly, the combination '''de el''' – ''of the'' is shortened to '''del''' and the combination '''a el''' – ''to the'' is shortened to '''al'''. For example, '''al cine''' – ''to the cinema/movies'', see [[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod newbie lesson A0013|lesson A0013]], or '''al agua''' – ''to the water''.

===Indefinite Articles===
The indefinite articles in Spanish equate to ''a'', ''an'' and ''some'' in English. In  Spanish, four different forms are used depending on the [[#Gender (Masculine and Feminine)|gender]] and [[#Number (Singular and Plural)|number]] of the corresponding [[#Nouns|noun]]. They are:
* '''un''' for masculine, singular nouns:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0001|2|Are you ready yet?| '''¡Espera &lt;u&gt;un&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;momento&lt;/u&gt;!'''| Wait a moment!}}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0010|3|I'm hungry| '''Sí, quiero ir a &lt;u&gt;un&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;restaurante&lt;/u&gt; italiano.'''| Yes, I want to go to a Italian restaurant.}}
* '''unos''' for masculine, plural nouns; e.g., '''unos restaurantes''' – ''some restaurants''.

* '''una''' for feminine, singular nouns:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0066|2|Bottle of Water| '''¿Me da &lt;u&gt;una&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;botella&lt;/u&gt; de agua, por favor?''' | Will you give me a bottle of water, please? }}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0116|1|Do you want a mint?| '''¿Quieres &lt;u&gt;una&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;menta&lt;/u&gt;?''' | Do you want a mint? }}
* '''unas''' for feminine, plural nouns; e.g., '''unas mentas''' – ''some mints''.

The exception to this rule is similar to the exception for definite articles: if you have an indefinite article right before a feminine, singular noun that starts with a stressed '''a-''' or '''ha-''', then the indefinite article is '''un''' (instead of '''una''').


[[File:Smiley green alien weap.svg|thumb|right|120px|''sadness'' is a noun, ''sad'' is an adjective, and ''sadly'' is an adverb.]]

==Adjectives==
Adjectives are words that modify [[#Nouns|nouns]] or describe what the noun is referring to, for example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0010|3|I'm hungry| '''Sí, quiero ir a un &lt;u&gt;restaurante&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;italiano&lt;/u&gt;.'''| Yes, I want to go to a Italian restaurant.}}
In this example, the adjective '''italiano''' – ''Italian'' describes the noun '''restaurante''' – ''restaurant''. 

===Agreement with Nouns===
Similarly to [[#Articles|articles]], Spanish adjectives have different endings depending on the  [[#Gender (Masculine and Feminine)|gender]] and [[#Number (Singular and Plural)|number]] of the [[#Nouns|noun]] that they describe. If you look up an adjective in a dictionary, the dictionary will give you the masculine, singular form of the adjective, for example '''italiano''' – Italian, '''mexicano''' – ''Mexican'', '''rojo''' – ''red'', '''mucho''' – ''much''. 

To form the feminine, singular form, the last letter '''-o''' is replaced by an '''-a'''; for example, masculine: '''mexicano''' – ''Mexican'' becomes feminine: '''mexicana''' – ''Mexican''.
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0004|1|She's not Mexican| '''¿Cómo se llama tu &lt;u&gt;amiga&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;mexicana&lt;/u&gt;?'''| What is your (female) Mexican friend called?}}
Sometimes the masculine form does not end in an '''-o'''. These adjectives usually have the same ending for masculine and feminine, singular nouns; e.g., '''igual''' – ''equal'' or '''verde''' – ''green'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0023|2|Going to the market| '''¿&lt;u&gt;Manzana&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;verde&lt;/u&gt; o roja?'''| Green apples or red? (literally: green apple or red?)}}
However, there are also exceptions. In particular, many adjectives related to nationalities which don't end in an '''-o''' in the masculine nevertheless add an '''-a''' on the end to form the feminine; for example, masculine: '''español''' – ''Spanish'' becomes feminine: '''española''' – ''Spanish''. 

For the plural forms, an '''-s''' is appended, just like with the [[#Number (Singular and Plural)|plural forms of nouns]] and the [[#Indefinite Articles|indefinite article]]; for example: feminine, singular: '''mucha''' – ''much''; feminine, plural: '''muchas''' – ''many'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0092|4|How old are you?| '''&lt;u&gt;Muchas&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;gracias&lt;/u&gt;.''' | Many thanks.}}

The exception to this rule is the same as with the [[#Number (Singular and Plural)|plural form of nouns]]: if a singular adjective ends in a consonant (i.e. not in '''-a''', '''-e''', '''-i''', '''-o''', or '''-u''') then the ending '''-es''' is added, for example, singular: '''internacional''' – ''international'', plural: '''internacionales''' – ''international'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0122|2|Telephone card| '''¿Para &lt;u&gt;llamadas&lt;/u&gt; nacionales o &lt;u&gt;internacionales&lt;/u&gt;?'''  | For domestic or international calls? }}

Note that the ending of an adjective has to agree with the gender and number of the corresponding noun even if the noun does not appear in the same sentence, for example, the adjective '''caro/cara''' – ''expensive'' and the feminine, singular noun '''renta''' – ''rent'' in this dialogue:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0033|1|It's expensive| '''Mi &lt;u&gt;renta&lt;/u&gt; es de mil dólares.'''| My rent is at a thousand dollars.}}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0033|2|It's expensive| '''¿En serio? Es muy &lt;u&gt;cara&lt;/u&gt;.'''| Seriously? It's very expensive.}}

[[File:Smiley green alien sad.svg|thumb|right|120px|A female speaker would say: '''Soy &lt;u&gt;alérgica&lt;/u&gt;.''' – ''I'm allergic''.]]
When you use adjectives about yourself, if you are male you use masculine endings and if you are female you use feminine endings. When you talk to others and use adjectives about them, if you are talking to a man you use a masculine ending and if you are talking to a woman you use a feminine one. 

In the following question, a man is talking to a woman. The adjective '''seguro''' – ''sure'' is used in the feminine form because it describes the woman who is being asked the question. The adjective '''alérgico''' – ''allergic'' is used in the masculine form because the man is describing himself:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0096|5|I am allergic| '''¿&lt;u&gt;Segura&lt;/u&gt;? Porque soy &lt;u&gt;alérgico&lt;/u&gt;.'''  | Are you sure? Because I am allergic. }}

One last exception: sometimes an adjective doesn't describe a specific noun. In this case, the masculine, singular form of the adjective is used, for example, in impersonal expression such as '''está claro''' – ''it's clear'' or in these examples:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0127|4|Flirting| '''¡&lt;u&gt;Perfecto&lt;/u&gt;! Voy a hablar con ella.'''  | Perfect! I'm going to talk to her. }}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0052|3|Smells good| '''¡Qué &lt;u&gt;rico&lt;/u&gt;!''' | How delicious! }}

===Word Order===
Spanish adjectives usually follow the noun they describe, for example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0010|3|I'm hungry| '''Sí, quiero ir a un &lt;u&gt;restaurante&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;italiano&lt;/u&gt;.'''| Yes, I want to go to an Italian restaurant.}}
However, some adjectives are always placed before the nouns they describe, e.g., '''mucho''' – ''much'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0072|1|Here is my card| '''&lt;u&gt;Mucho&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;gusto&lt;/u&gt;.''' | It's been my pleasure. (Literally: much pleasure)}}
Other adjectives can be placed either before or after the noun, e.g. '''nuevo''' – ''new'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0041|3|Cheers!| '''Por mi &lt;u&gt;nuevo&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;trabajo&lt;/u&gt;.''' | To my new job. }}
The meanings of these adjectives often depend on their position: '''nuevo''' before a noun means that a thing is new to the speaker (subjectively new) while '''nuevo''' after a noun means that the thing itself is new (objectively new).

Some adjectives change their endings (and also their meanings) when they come before nouns, e.g. '''grande''' means ''big'' when it comes after a noun, but alters its ending and means ''great'' when it comes before one, e.g. '''una gran mujer''' – ''a great woman''.

Other adjectives change their endings only when they come before masculine nouns, e.g. '''bueno''' – ''good'': '''un buen trabajo''' – ''a good job'', but: '''buena idea''' – ''good idea''.

[[File:Smiley green alien sleepy.svg|thumb|right|140px|OK, that's all about word order and adjectives. Everyone wake up again!]]
Finally, adjectives can also appear in other positions, e.g. after '''qué''' – ''how'' or after certain verbs:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0052|3|Smells good| '''¡&lt;u&gt;Qué&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;rico&lt;/u&gt;!''' | How delicious! }}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0052|4|Smells good| '''¡Cuidado, &lt;u&gt;están&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;calientes&lt;/u&gt;!''' | Careful, they're hot! (literally: Careful, are hot!)}}

===Comparisons===
Comparisons (with or without adjectives) are constructed with '''más''' – ''more'', '''más ... que ...''' – ''more ... than ...'' or '''más de''' + number – ''more than'' + number. For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0092|3|How old are you?| '''Pareces &lt;u&gt;más&lt;/u&gt; joven.'''| You seem younger (more young). }}
To say ''less'' or ''fewer'', you use '''menos''' – ''less/fewer'' or '''menos ... que ...''' – ''less/fewer ... than ...'' or '''menos de''' + number – ''less/fewer than'' + number, e.g.:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0001|4|Are you ready yet?| '''&lt;u&gt;Menos&lt;/u&gt; mal.'''| Less bad.}}

===Possessive Adjectives===
Possessive adjectives are words like ''my'' and ''your'' and are also sometimes called possessive pronouns or possessive determiners. Let's start with an example of the possessive adjective: '''mi''' – ''my'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0112|2|What is your telephone number?| '''&lt;u&gt;Mi&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;número&lt;/u&gt; de móvil es el seis, cinco, dos, doce, cincuenta y seis, cincuenta y seis.'''  | My cell phone number is six-five-two, twelve, fifty-six, fifty-six. }}
Possessive adjectives specify that the noun which follows them (in the example: '''número''' – ''number'') belongs to someone. Here it belongs to the speaker, who used '''mi''' – ''my''.

There are several possessive adjectives in English, for example, ''my'', ''your'', ''his'', ''her'', ''its'', ''our'', etc. Analogously, there are several possessive adjectives in Spanish:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| possessive adjectives before singular nouns
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''mi''' || ''my''
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''tu''' || ''your'' (informal, singular)
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''su'''&lt;br&gt;'''su''' || ''his/her(/its)''&lt;br&gt;''your'' (formal, singular)
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''nuestro/nuestra''' || ''our'' 
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''vuestro/vuestra'''|| ''your'' (informal, plural) &lt;br&gt;
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''su'''  &lt;br&gt; '''su'''|| ''their''&lt;br&gt;''your'' (formal, plural)
|-
|}
Note that only '''nuestro/nuestra''' and '''vuestro/vuestra''' have different forms for masculine and feminine nouns. Also note that the English word ''your'' has four different translations: The informal form for a single person is '''tu''', but the formal form is '''su'''. If you are talking to a group of people, the informal form is '''vuestro/vuestra''', and the formal form is '''su'''. 

Some more examples:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0131|2|I miss them| '''Extraño a &lt;u&gt;mi&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;familia&lt;/u&gt;.''' | I miss my family. }}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0112|1|What is your telephone number?| '''¿Cuál es &lt;u&gt;tu&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;número&lt;/u&gt; de teléfono?''' | What's your phone number? }}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0062|3|At the Bank| '''¿Me presta &lt;u&gt;su&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;pluma&lt;/u&gt;?''' | Will you lend me your pen? (formal)}}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0056|1|What time is the train?| '''¿A qué hora sale &lt;u&gt;nuestro&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;tren&lt;/u&gt;?''' | What time does our train leave? (literally: At what time ...?)}}

[[Image:Smiley green alien droling.svg|thumb|right|120px|'''mi galleta''' – ''my cookie''; '''mis galletas''' – ''my cookies'']]
Just like other Spanish adjectives, Spanish possessive adjectives change their ending when they relate to a plural noun. But the change is easy — it's just the standard plural '''-s''':
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| possessive adjectives before plural nouns
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''mis''' || ''my''
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''tus''' || ''your'' (informal, singular)
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''sus'''&lt;br&gt;'''sus''' || ''his/her(/its)''&lt;br&gt;''your'' (formal, singular)
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''nuestros/nuestras''' || ''our'' 
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''vuestros/vuestras''' || ''your'' (informal, plural) 
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''sus'''&lt;br&gt;'''sus''' || ''their''&lt;br&gt;''your'' (formal, plural)
|-
|}
Here is an example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0052|2|Smells good| '''Sí, son &lt;u&gt;mis&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;galletas&lt;/u&gt;.''' | Yes, they are my cookies. }}

There is some good news — most of these number never change their form. For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0112|2|What is your telephone number?| '''Mi número de móvil es el &lt;u&gt;seis&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;cinco&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;dos&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;doce&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;cincuenta y seis&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;cincuenta y seis&lt;/u&gt;.'''  | My cell phone number is 6-5-2-12-56-56. }}
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0106|4|Room service| '''Se la llevo en &lt;u&gt;diez&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;minutos&lt;/u&gt;.'''  | I'll bring it to you in 10 minutes. }}
In the latter example, '''diez''' – ''ten'' is an adjective to the plural noun '''minutos''' – ''minutes'' but it does not change its ending.

Of course, there is an exception. The number one changes its ending wherever it appears as the final digit of a number describing a noun, except when it appears as part of the number eleven. This means that '''once''' – ''11'' stays the same whatever noun it's describing, but '''uno''' – ''one'', '''veintiuno''' – 21, '''treinta y uno''' – 31, etc. change their endings to match the noun, like the [[#Indefinite Articles|indefinite article]] '''un/una''' – ''a'' does.
Before masculine nouns (singular and plural), you get '''un''', '''veintiún''', '''treinta y un''', etc. 
Before and when refering to feminine nouns (singular and plural) you get '''una''', '''veintiúna''', '''treinta y una''', etc. 
Here is an example for a masculine noun:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0023|1|Going to the market| '''Buenas tardes. ¿Me da &lt;u&gt;un&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;kilo&lt;/u&gt; de manzana?'''| Good afternoon. Will you give me one kilo of apples?}}
When you want to mention the number ''one'' without it relating to any particular noun (for instance when counting or when doing math), then you use '''uno'''.

[[Image:Smiley green alien lipbite.svg|thumb|right|110px|Oops, sorry! There is actually no grammar to learn here. Ordinal numbers work just like adjectives!]]
The following table shows the ordinal numbers 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ... to 10th in Spanish in the form used before singular nouns or with no noun at all. Watch out for 1st and 3rd, where the ordinal number before masculine nouns is different from the ordinal number for when there isn't a related noun.
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''ordinal number''' || before masculine/feminine nouns
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''primero''' || 1st ||align=&quot;center&quot;| '''&lt;u&gt;primer&lt;/u&gt;''' / '''primera'''
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''segundo''' || 2nd ||align=&quot;center&quot;| '''segundo''' / '''segunda'''
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''tercero''' || 3rd ||align=&quot;center&quot;| '''&lt;u&gt;tercer&lt;/u&gt;''' / '''tercera'''
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''cuarto''' || 4th ||align=&quot;center&quot;| '''cuarto''' / '''cuarta'''
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''quinto''' || 5th ||align=&quot;center&quot;| '''quinto''' / '''quinta'''

|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;| '''décimo''' || 10th ||align=&quot;center&quot;| '''décimo''' / '''décima'''
|-
|}
For the plural forms an additional '''-s''' is added to the end of the masculine or feminine form. 

If one of these ordinal numbers describes a noun, its ending has to agree with the gender and number of the noun; e.g.:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0102|2|Where is the restroom?| '''La &lt;u&gt;segunda&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;puerta&lt;/u&gt; a la derecha.'''  | The second door on the right. }}

===Participles as Adjectives===
See [[#Participles|participles]].


==Pronouns==
Pronouns are little words that stand in for nouns,  such as ''I'', ''it'' and ''him''. Spanish uses pronouns slightly differently from English — particularly when pronouns are the subject of the verb in the sentence (for instance the ''I'' in ''I ate an apple''). 

===Subject Pronouns===
Pronouns that act as the subject of a sentence are known as subjective pronouns or subject pronouns. (The subject of a sentence is the person or thing that does the action described by the [[#Verbs|verb]].) For example '''yo''' – ''I'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0007|3|Where are you from?| '''&lt;u&gt;Yo&lt;/u&gt; soy de Colombia.'''| &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;'m from Colombia.}}
[[Image:Smiley green alien big eyes.svg|thumb|right|120px|Yes, you have to learn these pronouns. And, yes, the accents are important.]]
Here is a table of the Spanish subject pronouns:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! '''person''' ||colspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''subject pronoun''' 
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||1st person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''yo''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''I''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||2nd person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''tú''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''you (informal, singular)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||3rd person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''él/ella'''&lt;br&gt;'''usted''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''he/she(/it)''&lt;br&gt;''you (formal, singular)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||1st person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''nosotros/nosotras''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''we''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||2nd person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''vosotros/vosotras''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''you (informal, plural)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||3rd person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''ellos/ellas'''&lt;br&gt;'''ustedes''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''they''&lt;br&gt;''you (formal, plural)''
|}

====Grammatical Person====

Pronouns can be categorised according to their grammatical person. In English and Spanish the categories are first person, second person and third person, and each of these persons is in turn divided into singular and plural, depending on whether the pronoun refers to one person (singular) or more than one person (plural). The categories into which each Spanish pronoun falls have been shown in the table above. This is slightly different from the categorisation for English because of the way the formal form of the pronoun ''you'' works in Spanish.

In Spanish, the 3rd person forms of [[#Verbs|verbs]] are not only used to talk about a 3rd person (someone who is neither the speaker/writer nor the listener/reader) but also for the [[#Formal and Informal You|formal versions of the ''you'' pronoun]]. A good way to imagine it in English, is to imagine that instead of saying ''Are you ready?'', the formal way of addressing others in Spanish is more similar to saying ''Is sir ready?'' Thus, the formal subject pronoun '''usted''' – ''you'' and its plural form '''ustedes''' – ''you'' are labeled as 3rd person forms in the table.
{{Wikipedia|Pro-drop language}}

====Pro-Drop====

Spanish is a pro-drop language which means that Spanish subject pronouns can be and often are dropped from sentences. For example:

{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0019|1|How do you spell beige?| '''Tengo una pregunta.'''| I have a question. (Literally: have a question.)}}

Unlike non-pro-drop languages such as English, dropping the subject pronoun in Spanish is not considered non-standard or colloquial. 

In contrast to English where you need the pronoun to tell who or what the subject of the sentence is, in Spanish the form of the [[#Conjugation|conjugated]] verb already indicates the person and number of the subject. In other words, in Spanish the form of the verb used with ''I'' is different from the one used with ''they'', and both are different from the one used with ''we'' etc.

The exceptions to this are '''él''' – ''he(/it)'', '''ella''' – ''she(/it)'' and '''usted''' – ''you (formal, singular)'', as these subject pronouns all take the same form of the verb, so you can't tell which one is meant from the verb alone. For this reason, these pronouns are usually used to avoid ambiguity. 

In addition, subject pronouns can also be included in the sentence for emphasis.

====Gender====

There is no subject pronoun for ''it'' in Spanish because all Spanish nouns have a [[#Gender (Masculine and Feminine)|gender]], i.e. they are all either masculine or feminine. Thus, either '''él''' – ''he(/it)'' or '''ella''' – ''ella(/it)'' is used to refer to them.

[[Image:Smiley green alien whaaa.svg|thumb|right|120px|OK, this paragraph is a bit advanced; maybe you just skip it on first reading.]]
Except for '''ustedes''' (''you'' formal plural), all the plural subject pronouns have a masculine form (ending in '''-os''') and a feminine form (ending in '''-as'''). The feminine form is used to refer to “all-feminine” groups (groups of which all the members are described by feminine nouns) while the masculine form refers to “not-all-feminine” groups (groups in which at least one member is specified by a masculine noun). For example, '''mis hermanas y la bici''' – ''my sisters and the bike'' is an “all-feminine” group and therefore requires the feminine plural form. On the other hand, '''mis hermanas y el coche''' – ''my sisters and the car'' is a group, which includes one member that is specified by a masculine noun ('''el coche''' – ''the car''); therefore, this “not-all-feminine” group requires the masculine plural form. Note that only the grammatical gender is relevant. For example, '''las personas''' – ''the persons'' is an “all-feminine” group because '''la persona''' – ''the person'' is a feminine noun even if the person is male.

====Formal and Informal You====

Unlike English, which has just one pronoun for addressing other people — ''you'' — Spanish uses different words for ''you'' depending on the speaker or writer's relationship with the listener/reader and on how many listeners/readers the speaker or writer is addressing. 

The formal way to address someone (singular) uses the subject pronoun '''usted''' – ''you''. The plural form is '''ustedes'''. 

The informal way to address someone (singular) uses the subject pronoun '''tú''' – ''you''. In Spain, the plural form of '''tú''' (for addressing more than one person) is '''vosotros''' or '''vosotras''', depending on whether you are addressing men or women.  '''Vosotros''' is used for addressing groups which include at least one man (even if it's a group of thousands of women and just one man). Whereas '''vosotras''' is used for all-female groups. In Latin America, however, there is no separate informal plural form of '''tú''', and you always use '''ustedes''' for the plural. 

The difference between '''tú''' and '''usted''' is discussed in several lessons, for example in lesson [[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod newbie lesson A0023|A0023]]. It is not always obvious when to use which form, and in fact it is often a personal decision.


===Direct Object Pronouns===

Not all pronouns act as the subject of a verb. Pronouns can also play a different role in the sentence, for instance the direct object. Direct object pronouns are pronouns which act as the direct object of a verb, i.e. the person or thing that is directly affected by the action specified by the [[#Verbs|verb]], for example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0027|2|The Neighbor| '''¿&lt;u&gt;Lo&lt;/u&gt; conoces?'''| Do you know him?}}
In this example, '''lo''' – ''him/it'' is the direct object. Note that this Spanish sentence does not include the subject pronoun '''tú''' – ''you'', because Spanish is a [[#Pro-Drop|pro-drop]] language, which means it can and often does drop subject pronouns from sentences. Instead the subject pronoun '''tú''' – ''you'' is implied by the form of the verb used. 

Like most (but not all) direct object pronouns in English, Spanish direct object pronouns are different from their subject pronoun equivalents. Here is a table with the Spanish direct object pronouns:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! '''person''' ||colspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''direct object pronoun''' 
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||1st person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''me''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''me''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||2nd person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''te''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''you (informal, singular)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||3rd person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''lo/la'''&lt;br&gt;'''lo/la''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''him/her(/it)''&lt;br&gt;''you (formal, singular)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||1st person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''nos''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''us''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||2nd person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''os''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''you (informal, plural)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||3rd person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''los/las'''&lt;br&gt;'''los/las''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''them''&lt;br&gt;''you (formal, plural)''
|}
====Gender====
The feminine plural form '''las''' is used to refer to groups where all the members of the group are described by feminine nouns — “all-feminine” groups — while the masculine plural form '''los''' refers to any group which contains at least one member which is described by a masculine noun — “not-all-feminine” groups. '''Lo''' – ''you'' and '''la''' – ''you'' are the direct object pronoun equivalent of the [[#Subject Pronouns|subject pronoun]] '''usted'''. '''Lo''' is used to address a man and '''la''' is used to address a woman.

====Word Order====
Direct object pronouns usually come immediately before the [[#Verbs|verb]]:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0027|3|The Neighbor| '''No, no &lt;u&gt;lo&lt;/u&gt; conozco. ¿Y tú?'''| No, I don't know him. How about you?}}

[[Image:Smiley green alien why.svg|thumb|right|110px|You think it's very strange that pronouns are appended to verbs? '''Gimme''' a break!]]
However, sometimes instead of appearing as a separate word in front of the verb, direct object pronouns are appended to the end of the verb, forming a single word with the verb. This can happen whenever the verb is an affirmative [[#Imperative|imperative]], an [[#Infinitives|infinitive]] or a [[#Gerunds|gerund]]. 
For example, it is correct to say '''¡Lo busca!''' – ''Look for it!'' but it is much more common to append the object pronoun directly to the verb in the imperative:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0013|4|Doing the laundry| '''No sé. ¡Búsca&lt;u&gt;lo&lt;/u&gt;!'''| I don't know. Look for it.}}
More details about this construction are discussed in the sections on [[#Imperative|imperatives]] and [[#Infinitives|infinitives]].

===Indirect Object Pronouns===
Indirect object pronouns substitute for the indirect object of a sentence, i.e., the person or thing that is affected only indirectly by the [[#Verbs|verb]]. Here is an example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0005|3|Take a picture| '''¡Disculpe! ¿&lt;u&gt;Nos&lt;/u&gt; podría tomar una foto por favor?'''| Excuse me, could you please take a picture for us?}}
In this example, '''nos''' – ''(to/for) us'' is the indirect object pronoun. The thing that is taken, '''una foto''' – ''a picture'', is the direct object. This answers the question ''what is taken?''. On the other hand, '''nos''' – ''(to/for) us'' is only indirectly affected by the action. Instead of answering the question ''what is taken'', '''nos''' answers the question ''to or for whom is it taken?''. Another example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0072|4|Here is my card| '''Mejor &lt;u&gt;te&lt;/u&gt; doy mi tarjeta de presentación.''' | I'd better give you my business card.}}
The thing that is given, '''mi tarjeta de presentación''' – ''my business card'', is the direct object. It answers the question ''what is given?''. The indirect object pronoun is '''te''' – ''(to) you'' is only indirectly related to the verb. It answers the question ''to or for whom is it given?''.

Here is a table with the Spanish indirect object pronouns:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! '''person''' ||colspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''indirect object pronoun''' 
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||1st person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''me''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''(to/for) me''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||2nd person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''te''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''(to/for) you (informal, singular)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||3rd person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''le'''&lt;br&gt;'''le''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''(to/for) him/her(/it)''&lt;br&gt;''(to/for) you (formal, singular)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||1st person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''nos''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''(to/for) us''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||2nd person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''os''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''(to/for) you (informal, plural)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||3rd person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''les'''&lt;br&gt;'''les''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''(to/for) them''&lt;br&gt;''(to/for) you (formal, plural)''
|}
The difference between the more formal form '''le''' – ''you'' and the more familiar form '''te''' – ''you'' is the same as between the [[#Subject Pronouns|subject pronouns]] '''usted''' and '''tú'''.

====Word Order====

Indirect object pronouns come before the [[#Verbs|verb]] and also before any [[#Direct Object Pronouns|direct object pronoun]] (if there is one):
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0072|3|Here is my card| '''¿&lt;u&gt;Me&lt;/u&gt; puedes dar tu e-mail?''' | Can you give me your e-mail? }}
Note that the pronoun '''me''' – ''(to/for) me'' comes before the [[#Conjugation|conjugated]] verb '''puedes''' – ''(you) can'' even though it is an indirect object of the verb '''dar''' – ''to give''.

Just like direct object pronouns, instead of appearing as a separate word in front of the verb, indirect object pronouns can be appended to the end of the verb, forming a single word with the verb if the verb is an affirmative [[#Imperative|imperative]], [[#Infinitives|infinitive]] or [[#Gerunds|gerund]]. 

If there is an indirect object pronoun and a direct object pronoun, the indirect object pronoun comes first and is followed directly by the direct object pronoun, for example, '''¿&lt;u&gt;Me&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;lo&lt;/u&gt; puedes dar?''' – ''Can you give me it?'' In this example, '''lo''' – ''him/it'' is the direct object because it is what is being given and '''me''' – ''(to/for) me'' is the indirect object pronoun, because it is who the verb is being done to or for.

[[Image:Smiley green alien whatface.svg|thumb|right|120px|Stay calm! Just remember to avoid  combinations of two '''l'''-pronouns, such as '''le lo''' or '''les la''' or '''les los''', etc. by substituting '''se''' for the first pronoun.]]
====Le(s) before la(s) and lo(s)====
If the indirect object pronoun is '''le''' or '''les''' and the following direct object pronoun is '''la''', '''lo''', '''las''', or '''los''' then the indirect object pronoun is changed to '''se'''. For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0106|4|Room service| '''&lt;u&gt;Se&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;la&lt;/u&gt; llevo en diez minutos.'''  | I'll bring you it in 10 minutes. }}
Here, the direct object pronoun is '''la''' – ''her/it''. The indirect object pronoun would usually be '''le''' – ''(to) you (formal)''. To avoid the combination '''le la''', the indirect object pronoun is changed to '''se'''. A very similar example is:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0066|5|Bottle of Water| '''Enseguida &lt;u&gt;se&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;la&lt;/u&gt; doy.''' | I'll give you it right away. }}

===Reflexive Pronouns===
If the subject and object of a verb are the same, then the verb is called a reflexive verb. An example is '''tú te llamas''' – ''your name is'' (literally: ''you yourself call''). However, the [[#Subject Pronoun|subject pronoun]] is often dropped; thus, a more realistic example is:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0082|1|My name is... | '''¡Hola! ¿Cómo te llamas?''' | Hi! What's your name? (literally: how yourself call?))}}
The answer could be '''yo me llamo''' – ''my name is'' (literally: ''I myself call), or without the [[#Subject Pronoun|subject pronoun]]:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0082|2|My name is... | '''Me llamo Antonia. ¿Y tú?''' | My name's Antonia.  And you? (literally: myself call Antonia. And you?)}}

As these examples show, reflexive verbs usually require a reflexive pronoun; for example, '''me''' – ''myself'' or '''te''' – ''yourself''. Here is a list of all reflexive pronouns:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! '''person''' ||colspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''reflexive pronoun''' 
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||1st person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''me''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''myself''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||2nd person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''te''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''yourself (informal, singular)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||3rd person singular ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''se'''&lt;br&gt;'''se''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''himself/herself(/itself)''&lt;br&gt;''yourself (formal, singular)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||1st person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''nos''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''ourselves, each other''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||2nd person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''os''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''yourselves, each other (informal, plural)''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||3rd person plural ||align=&quot;right&quot;| '''se'''&lt;br&gt;'''se''' ||align=&quot;left&quot;| ''themselves, each other''&lt;br&gt;''youselves, each other (formal, plural)''
|}
Note that the plural forms of the reflexive pronouns can also mean ''each other''. (In this case, these pronouns are called reciprocal pronouns.) For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0011|1|Call me| '''&lt;u&gt;Nos&lt;/u&gt; vemos mañana, ¿no?'''| We'll see each other tomorrow, right?}}

====Word Order====

Reflexive pronouns usually come before the verb and before any other object pronouns, for example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0037|4|The baby is sleeping| '''¡No &lt;u&gt;te&lt;/u&gt; preocupes!''' | Don't worry (yourself).}}

[[Image:Smiley green alien deep sleep.svg|thumb|right|135px|Yes, this is exactly the same as for direct and indirect object pronouns. I just wanted to remind you.]]
Similarly to [[#Direct Object Pronouns|direct object pronouns]] and [[#Indirect Object Pronouns|indirect object pronouns]], sometimes instead of appearing as a separate word in front of the verb, reflexive object pronouns are appended to the end of the verb, forming a single word with the verb. This can happen whenever the verb is an affirmative [[#Imperative|imperative]], an [[#Infinitives|infinitive]] or a [[#Gerunds|gerund]]. For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0056|5|What time is the train?| '''¡Apúra&lt;u&gt;te&lt;/u&gt;! ¡Corre!''' | Hurry (yourself) up! Run! }}

{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0021|2|I'm sleepy| '''No, prefiero quedar&lt;u&gt;me&lt;/u&gt; en casa.'''| No, I prefer to stay at home.}}

In the dictionary, reflexive verbs are shown in the [[#Infinitives|infinitive]] with the 3rd person reflexive pronoun '''se''' – ''oneself'' appended to the verb. For example, the infinitive of the reflexive variant of '''llamar''' – ''to call'' is '''llamar&lt;u&gt;se&lt;/u&gt;''' – ''to call oneself/to be called''.

===Interrogative Pronouns===
Interrogative pronouns are the question words which are used to ask about someone or something, e.g. to ask about a direct object:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0016|3|I feel sick| '''¿&lt;u&gt;Qué&lt;/u&gt; tienes?'''| What do you have? / What's wrong with you?}}
Note the accent mark in '''¿qué?''' – ''what?'', which is characteristic for Spanish question words.

Another interrogative pronoun is '''¿cuál?''' – ''which?, what?'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0002|2|Birthday party| '''¿&lt;u&gt;Cuál&lt;/u&gt; fiesta?'''| What party?}}
As a rule of thumb, '''¿qué?''' corresponds to ''what?'' and '''¿cuál?''' to ''which? (one out of two or more)''. However, there are exceptions, e.g.:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0112|1|What is your telephone number?| '''¿&lt;u&gt;Cuál&lt;/u&gt; es tu número de teléfono?''' | What's your phone number? }}

Further interrogative pronouns are '''¿quién?''' – ''who?'' and its plural form '''¿quiénes?''' – ''who?''.

Interrogative pronouns usually start questions:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0066|1|Bottle of Water| '''¿&lt;u&gt;Qué&lt;/u&gt; le doy?''' | What shall I give you? }}

However, they can be preceded by [[#Prepositions|prepositions]], such as '''de''' – ''of, from'': 
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0004|3|She's not Mexican| '''¿De verdad? ¿&lt;u&gt;De&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;qué&lt;/u&gt; parte de Guatemala?'''| Really? From what part of Guatemala?}}

===Possessive Pronouns===
See [[#Possessive Adjectives|possessive adjectives]].


[[Image:Smiley green alien satisfied.svg|thumb|right|110px|Verbs are important. (And they know it.)]]
==Verbs==
Verbs are doing words. They usually express some kind of action, for example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0027|1|The Neighbor| '''Ahí &lt;u&gt;viene&lt;/u&gt; el vecino.'''| Here &lt;u&gt;comes&lt;/u&gt; the neighbor.}}
Here, '''viene''' – ''comes'' is the verb, which expresses the action of coming. 

Verbs play a special role in sentences. In fact, when you read a new sentence, it is often a good idea to look for the verb first because that is where the action is. Most of the other parts of a sentence make much more sense once you are sure about the verb. The problem with this advice is that there is no standard word order in Spanish and also verbs often change their form, so it can be a bit tricky to find the verb.

[[File:Smiley green alien.svg|thumb|right|120px|''to smile'' is the infinitive of a verb; (''he'' or ''she'') ''smiles'' is a conjugated form of the same verb.]]
===Conjugation===
The verb form that you find in dictionaries is called the infinitive; English examples are ''to be'', ''to smile'', ''to read'', ''to learn'' etc. However, verbs often change their form depending on the subject and the tense. This change is called conjugation. You know this from English verbs, for instance ''to be''. In the present tense, the first person singular of ''to be'' is: ''(I) am''. The second person is: ''(you) are''. The third person singular is: ''(he/she/it) is''. The first person plural is: ''(we) are'', etc. It is always the same verb ''to be'' but it appears in different conjugated forms for different subjects. 

In the following sections we will have a look at the Spanish conjugation for the present tense, the (affirmative) imperative, and the negative imperative. These are the most important tenses in many everyday situations.

===Present Tense===
The Spanish present tense works very much like the English present tense: you use it to talk about things that are happening in the present.

Let us look at the Spanish conjugation of verbs in the present tense. Spanish has three slightly different conjugation patterns. Which one is used depends on the ending of the verb in the infinitive. Spanish has three different endings in the infinitive: '''-ar''', '''-er''', and '''-ir'''. All Spanish verbs have one of these endings in the infinitive. In the following table, there is an example verb for each of these endings representing the pattern that most verbs with that infinitive ending follow. The table also includes the relevant Spanish and English [[#Subject Pronouns|subject pronouns]]. The hints in the last column summarize the changes compared to the infintive.

The specific endings of the conjugated forms are set in '''bold'''. Note that the stems of the verbs (the parts before the bold endings) usually don't change. The vowels of the [[#Stress|stressed]] syllables are underlined to help you with [[#Pronunciation|pronunciation]].

The conjugated forms of many other verbs have the same endings. For example, '''llevar''' – ''to take/to carry/to bring'' which has the infinitive ending '''-ar''' is conjugated like '''amar'''. Here is an example in the first person singular (without the subject pronoun '''yo''' – ''I''):
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0106|4|Room service| '''Se la &lt;u&gt;llevo&lt;/u&gt; en diez minutos.'''  | I'll bring it to you in 10 minutes. }}

[[File:Smiley green alien wink.svg|thumb|right|120px|Don't worry too much about irregular verbs! Learn the regular conjugation first and then the conjugation of specific irregular verbs.]]
Unfortunately, that's not the end of the story. Not all verbs have a regular conjugation in the present tense (i.e. follow the above patterns). Many Spanish verbs have irregular conjugated forms. The good news is, the irregularities are usually rather minor, for example a different vowel or an additional consonant, like in this example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0019|1|How do you spell beige?| '''&lt;u&gt;Tengo&lt;/u&gt; una pregunta.'''| I have a question.}}
'''yo tengo''' – ''I have'' is the first person singular for the infinitive '''tener''' – ''to have''. If '''tener''' was regular, it would have the same endings as '''aprender''' and be '''&lt;s&gt;teno&lt;/s&gt;'''. Since it is irregular, however, it has an additional '''g''' in the first person singular.

Many verbs have specific irregularities, but we will not discuss those groups of irregular verbs here. Instead, the vocabulary lists for the lessons include the conjugated forms of all the verbs that appear in the present tense in the dialogues.

===Imperative===
There are two types of imperative: with and without negation, i.e., with and without '''no''' – ''not''. The type with negation is called a [[#Negative Imperative|negative imperative]] and is discussed in the next section. The type without is an affirmative or positive imperative — or just the imperative — and is discussed in this section.

In Spanish, the imperative is not only used for orders and commands but also for requests. Thus, the Spanish imperative is not considered as direct and as demanding as the imperative in English. For example, it is common to start a conversation on the phone with an imperative in Spanish:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0019|2|How do you spell beige?| '''¡Dime!'''| Tell me!}}

Similarly to the [[#Present Tense|present tense]], there are three regular conjugation patterns for the three infinitive endings '''-ar''', '''-er''', and '''-ir'''. They are summarized together with the relevant [[#Subject Pronouns|subject pronouns]] in the following table:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''PERSON''' ||rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''SUBJECT PRONOUN''' || '''-ar''' VERBS||'''-er''' VERBS||'''-ir''' VERBS ||rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| HINT
|-
! '''amar''' – ''to love''||'''aprender''' – ''to learn''||'''vivir''' – ''to live''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||2nd person singular|| '''tú''' – ''you (informal)'' || &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;m'''a''' || apr&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;nd'''e''' || v&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;v'''e''' || 3rd p. s., pres. tense
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
||3rd person singular|| '''usted''' – ''you (formal)'' || &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;m'''e''' || apr&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;nd'''a''' || v&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;v'''a''' || '''a'''→'''e''' and '''e'''/'''i'''→'''a'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
||1st person plural|| '''nosotros/nosotras''' – ''we''|| am'''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;mos''' || aprend'''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;mos''' || viv'''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;mos''' || '''a'''→'''e''' and '''e'''/'''i'''→'''a'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
||2nd person plural|| '''vosotros/vosotras''' – ''you (informal)''|| am'''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;d''' || aprend'''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;d''' || viv'''&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;d''' || '''ar/er/ir'''→'''ad/ed/id'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
||3rd person plural|| '''ustedes''' – ''you (formal)''|| &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;m'''en''' || apr&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;nd'''an''' || v&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;v'''an''' || '''a'''→'''e''' and '''e'''/'''i'''→'''a'''
|}
Similarly to the regular conjugation for the [[#Present Tense|present tense]], the stems of the verbs do not change. The vowels of the [[#Stress|stressed]] syllables are underlined to help with [[#Pronunciation|pronunciation]]. The endings of the conjugated forms are set in '''bold'''. 

Note that the forms for the ''2nd person singular'' of the imperative are identical to the forms of the ''3rd person singular'' of the [[#Present Tense|present tense]]. Here is an example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0001|2|Are you ready yet?| '''¡Espera un momento!'''| Wait a moment!}}
Thus, '''espera''' can mean ''wait!'' or ''he/she/it waits'' or ''you (formal) wait''.

[[Image:Smiley green alien sorry.svg|thumb|right|120px|In a less formal situation you would say: '''¡disculpa!''' – ''sorry!'' (informal)]]
In the 3rd person singular and plural and the 1st person plural, there is a characteristic change from '''a''' to '''e''' for '''-ar''' verbs. Analogously, there is a change to '''a''' from '''e''' for '''-er''' verbs and from '''i''' for '''-ir''' verbs. (In the case of the [[#Negative Imperative|negative imperative]] this change occurs in all persons.) Here is an example for the '''-ar''' verb '''disculpar''' – ''to pardon'', ''to excuse'' for the 3rd person singular:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0035|2|Is anyone in there?| '''Ah, disculpe.'''| Oh, pardon me / sorry. (formal)}}

These are the regular forms of the affirmative imperative. Irregular forms are included in the vocabulary lists for the lessons for all the verbs that appear in the imperative in the dialogues. However, instead of learning all these forms, you should focus on the forms for the 2nd person singular ('''tú''' – ''you'') and the more formal 3rd person singular ('''usted''' – ''you (formal)''). These two are the most common ones.

[[#Indirect Object Pronouns|Indirect object pronouns]] and [[#Direct Object Pronouns|direct object pronouns]] can be appended to the affirmative imperative (but not to the negative imperative). Here is an example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0013|4|Doing the laundry| '''No sé. ¡Búsca&lt;u&gt;lo&lt;/u&gt;!'''| I don't know. Look for it.}}
In this case, the direct object pronoun '''lo''' – ''he/it'' has been appended to the imperative form '''¡busca!''' – (you) search! (informal). Note that the stress is on the next-to-last syllable of '''¡b&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;sca!''' Since this is the default for words ending with a vowel (see the section about [[#Stress|stress]]), no accent mark is necessary. However, to indicate that the stress is on the same syllable in '''¡búscalo!''', an accent mark is necessary.

Here is another example with the direct object pronoun '''los''' – ''them'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0131|3|I miss them| '''¡Lláma&lt;u&gt;los&lt;/u&gt;!'''  | Call them! }}
And with the direct object pronoun '''me''' – ''me'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0015|4|Table for two| '''No importa. Sígan&lt;u&gt;me&lt;/u&gt; por favor.'''| It doesn't matter. Follow me please.}}
In the case of imperatives of [[#Reflexive Pronouns|reflexive verbs]], the [[#Reflexive Pronouns|reflexive pronoun]], for example '''te''' – ''yourself'', is appended just like an object pronoun:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0056|5|What time is the train?| '''¡Apúra&lt;u&gt;te&lt;/u&gt;! ¡Corre!''' | Hurry up! Run! }}

===Negative Imperative===
The negative imperative (also called prohibitive imperative) always includes a negation with '''no''' – ''not''; thus, it is used for prohibitive commands. Here is an example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0037|4|The baby is sleeping| '''¡&lt;u&gt;No&lt;/u&gt; te &lt;u&gt;preocupes&lt;/u&gt;!''' | Don't worry. }}
All forms except the 2nd person singular and plural are the same as for the [[#Imperative|affirmative imperative]] with the characteristic change from '''a''' to '''e''' and from '''e/i''' to '''a'''. Even better: the 2nd person singular and plural show the same change of the vowel; thus, the conjugation for the negative imperative is actually simpler than the conjugation for the positive imperative. Here is the full list:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''PERSON''' ||rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''SUBJECT PRONOUN''' || '''-ar''' VERBS||'''-er''' VERBS||'''-ir''' VERBS ||rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| HINT
|-
! '''amar''' – ''to love''||'''aprender''' – ''to learn''||'''vivir''' – ''to live''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; 
||2nd person singular|| '''tú''' – ''you'' || &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;m'''es''' || apr&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;nd'''as''' || v&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;v'''as''' || '''a'''→'''e''' and '''e'''/'''i'''→'''a'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
||3rd person singular|| '''usted''' – ''you (formal)'' || &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;m'''e''' || apr&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;nd'''a''' || v&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;v'''a''' || '''a'''→'''e''' and '''e'''/'''i'''→'''a'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
||1st person plural|| '''nosotros/nosotras''' – ''we''|| am'''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;mos''' || aprend'''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;mos''' || viv'''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;mos''' || '''a'''→'''e''' and '''e'''/'''i'''→'''a'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
||2nd person plural|| '''vosotros/vosotras''' – ''you''|| am'''&lt;u&gt;é&lt;/u&gt;is''' || aprend'''&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;is''' || viv'''&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;is''' || '''a'''→'''e''' and '''e'''/'''i'''→'''a'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
||3rd person plural|| '''ustedes''' – ''you (formal)''|| &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;m'''en''' || apr&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;nd'''an''' || v&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;v'''an''' || '''a'''→'''e''' and '''e'''/'''i'''→'''a'''
|}
[[Image:Smiley green alien unhappy.svg|thumb|right|120px|'''¡No lo hagas!''' – ''Don't do that!'']]
Here is another example with the irregular verb '''hacer''' – ''to make'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0037|1|The baby is sleeping| '''¡Sh! ¡&lt;u&gt;No&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;hagas&lt;/u&gt; ruido!''' | Sh! Don't make noise!}}
As always, irregular conjugations are listed in the vocabulary lists for the lessons where the irregular verb appears.

In contrast to the [[#Imperative|affirmative imperative]], object pronouns are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; appended to the verbs in the negative imperative but appear in their usual position right before the verb (and after the '''no''').

===Infinitives===
The infinitive is the form of verbs that is included in dictionaries. In English, the word ''to'' is often used to indicate an infinitive, e.g., ''to be'', ''to give'', ''to go'', etc. In actual sentences, the infinitive form is not conjugated; it always stays the same. 

There are several verbs (in Spanish and in English) that can be followed by a second verb in the infinitive form, for example, '''querer''' – ''to want'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0010|3|I'm hungry| '''Sí, &lt;u&gt;quiero&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;ir&lt;/u&gt; a un restaurante italiano.'''| Yes, I want to go to a Italian restaurant.}}
In this example, the conjugated verb '''quiero''' – ''(I) want'' is followed by the infinitive form '''ir''' – ''to go''. Another verb that can be followed by an infinitive is '''poder''' – ''to be able'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0072|3|Here is my card| '''¿Me &lt;u&gt;puedes&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;dar&lt;/u&gt; tu e-mail?''' | Can you give me your e-mail? }}
Here, the conjugated verb '''puedes''' – ''(you) can'' is followed by the infinitive '''dar''' – ''to give''. Note that the [[#Indirect Object Pronoun|indirect object pronoun]] '''me''' – ''(to) me'' comes before the conjugated verb ('''puedes''' in this case). Alternatively, object pronouns can be appended to the infinitive as in the following example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0021|2|I'm sleepy| '''No, &lt;u&gt;prefiero&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;quedarme&lt;/u&gt; en casa.'''| No, I prefer to stay (myself) at home.}}
Here, the [[#Reflexive Pronouns|reflexive pronoun]] '''me''' – ''myself'' has been appended to the infinitive form '''quedar''' – ''to stay''. In dictionaries, reflexive verbs are actually listed with the appended 3rd person reflexive pronoun '''se''' – ''oneself''; e.g., '''quedarse''' – ''to stay (oneself)''.

One very important way to express future actions uses a conjugated form of '''ir''' – ''to go'' followed by '''a''' – ''to'' and an infinitive; in short: '''ir''' + '''a''' + infinitive. For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0013|1|Doing the laundry| '''&lt;u&gt;Voy&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;lavar&lt;/u&gt; la ropa. ¿Hay detergente?'''| I'm going to wash clothes. Is there detergent?}}
In this example, '''voy''' – ''(I) go'' is the (irregular) conjugated form of '''ir''', which is followed by '''a''' – ''to'' and the infinitive '''lavar''' – ''to wash''.  In English, this construction corresponds to phrases with ''going to''.

===Participles===
The (past) participle of a verb is formed by replacing the infinitive ending '''-ar''' by '''-ado''' and the infinitive endings '''-er''' and '''-ir''' by '''-ido'''. The most important use of participles are perfect tenses, which are not discussed in this course.

[[Image:Smiley green alien doof.svg|thumb|right|120px|A male speaker would say: '''Encantado.''' – ''Nice to meet you.'']]
However, participles can also be used as [[#Adjectives|adjectives]]. In this case, the ending has to agree with the gender and number of the corresponding noun as discussed [[#Agreement with Nouns|above]]. For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0082|4|My name is... | '''Encantad&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;.''' | Nice to meet you. }}
The participle of '''encantar''' – ''to enchant'' is '''encantado''' – ''enchanted''. In this example, however, the participle is used as an adjective for a female speaker; thus, the ending is changed to '''encantada'''. Here is another example for a masculine singular noun with the participle of the verb '''dormir''' – ''to sleep'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0037|3|The baby is sleeping| '''El bebé &lt;u&gt;está&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;dormido&lt;/u&gt;.''' | The baby is sleeping. }}

===Gerunds===
The gerund (or present participle) corresponds to the ''ing''-form of verbs in English. In Spanish, it is formed by replacing the infinitive ending '''-ar''' by '''-ando''' and the infinitive endings '''-er''' and '''-ir''' by '''-iendo'''. The gerund is often used after a conjugated form of '''estar''' – ''to be'' to express a continuing action in the present. This corresponds to English phrases of the form ''to be doing something''. Here is an example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0127|1|Flirting| '''¡Mírala! &lt;u&gt;Está&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;coqueteando&lt;/u&gt;.''' | Look at her! She is flirting. }}
Note that the endings '''-ando''' and '''-iendo''' are the same for masculine and feminine, singular and plural nouns.

Similarly to [[#Infinitives|infinitives]] and [[#Imperative|affirmative imperatives]], object pronouns can be appended to gerunds.

===Reflexive Verbs===
See [[#Reflexive Pronouns|reflexive pronouns]].


[[Image:Smiley green alien droling.svg|thumb|right|120px|'''Las galletas huelen bien.''' – ''The cookies smell well/good.'']]

==Adverbs==
While [[#Adjectives|adjectives]] describe [[#Nouns|nouns]], adverbs describe [[#Verbs|verbs]]. For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0052|1|Smells good| '''Huele &lt;u&gt;bien&lt;/u&gt;.''' | It smells well/good. }}
Here, the adverb '''bien''' – ''well'' describes the verb '''huele''' – ''(it) smells''.

Adverbs can also describe adjectives or even other adverbs, for example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0030|4|Call back later| '''&lt;u&gt;Muy&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;bien&lt;/u&gt;. Gracias.'''| Very well/fine. Thank you.}}
In this example, the adverb '''muy''' – ''very'' describes the adverb '''bien''' – ''well''.

As in English, Spanish adverbs never change their form.

===Adverbs from Adectives===
In English, adverbs can be derived from adjectives by appending ''-ly'' (or ''-lly''). For example, the adverb ''approximately'' is derived from the adjective ''approximate''. Something very similar is possible in Spanish: Adverbs can be derived from adjectives by appending '''-mente''' to the feminine, singular form of an adjective. For example, the feminine, singular form of the adjective '''aproximado''' – ''approximate'' is '''aproximada'''; thus, the adverb is: '''aproximadamente''' – ''approximately''. Here is another example: 
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0072|2|Here is my card| '''&lt;u&gt;Igualmente&lt;/u&gt;.''' | Equally/likewise.}}
The adjective '''igual''' – ''equal'' has only one form for the masculine and feminine case; thus, the adverb is '''igualmente''' – ''equally''.


==Prepositions==
Prepositions are usually short words that indicate a certain relation to the following words. For example: 
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0056|2|What time is the train?| '''&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt; las tres &lt;u&gt;de&lt;/u&gt; la tarde.''' | At three o'clock in the afternoon. }}
In this sentence, '''a''' – ''at, to'' and '''de''' – ''of'' are both prepositions. Another example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0066|3|Bottle of Water| '''¿Agua &lt;u&gt;con&lt;/u&gt; gas o &lt;u&gt;sin&lt;/u&gt; gas?''' | Carbonated water or non-carbonated water? }}
Here, '''con''' – ''with'' and '''sin''' – ''without'' are the prepositions.

Just as in English, Spanish prepositions never change their form. However, the combination '''de el''' – ''of the'' is shortened to '''del''' and the combination '''a el''' – ''to the'' is shortened to '''al'''. For example, '''al cine''' – ''to the cinema/movies''; see [[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod newbie lesson A0013|lesson A0013]].

[[File:Smiley green alien depresive.svg|thumb|right|120px|'''Extraño mi planeta.''' – ''I miss my planet.'' (no preposition required)]]
===Preceding Objects with “a”===
There is one particular use of the preposition '''a''' – ''to'' that we should discuss. If the direct object or indirect object of a sentence is a [[#Nouns|noun]] that denotes one or more persons, it is preceded by the preposition '''a'''. For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0131|2|I miss them| '''Extraño &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt; mi familia.''' | I miss my family. }}
Here, '''mi familia''' – ''my family'' is the direct object of the verb '''extrañar''' – ''to miss''. Since this object denotes a group of people, the preposition '''a''' is required. Note that this preposition is not required if the object is specified by a [[#Pronouns|pronoun]] nor if it doesn't denote one or more persons.


==Conjunctions==
Conjunctions are usually short word that connect words or clauses. For example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0023|2|Going to the market| '''¿Manzana verde &lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt; roja?'''| Green apples or red ones?}}
In this sentence, the conjunction '''o''' – ''or'' connects two adjectives. Another example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0127|3|Flirting| '''Te ve &lt;u&gt;y&lt;/u&gt; te sonríe.''' | She looks at you and she smiles. }}
Here, the conjunction '''y''' – ''and'' connects two clauses. 

As in English, conjunctions usually do not change their form. However, '''o''' – ''or'' becomes '''u''' – ''or'' before words starting with '''o-''' or '''ho-''' as in this example:
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0003|3|At the bar| '''¿Clara &lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt; obscura?'''| Regular or dark?}}
Similarly, '''y''' – ''and'' becomes '''e''' – ''and'' before words starting with '''i-''' or '''hi-'''. 


[[Image:Smiley green alien wow.svg|thumb|right|120px|'''¡Ay!''' – ''Oh!'']]
==Interjections==
Interjections are usually exclamations in the form of short words that do not really fit in any of the other word categories. For example, '''hola''' – ''hello'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0006|1|How's it going?| '''¡&lt;u&gt;Hola&lt;/u&gt;, guapa! ¿Cómo te va?'''| Hello, beautiful! How is it going for you?}}
Another Spanish interjection is '''ah''', which corresponds to the English interjection ''oh'':
{{SbcExampleLineSpanishPod|A0035|2|Is anyone in there?| '''&lt;u&gt;Ah&lt;/u&gt;, disculpe.'''| Oh, sorry.}}



[[Image:Smiley green alien aaah.svg|thumb|right|120px|'''¡Hasta luego!''' – ''See you!'' ]]
==Epilog==
Well, that's it. Hopefully these explanations are helpful to understand the grammar of the SpanishPod newbie lessons. If you want to learn more about Spanish grammar, we recommend the wikibook [[Spanish|“Spanish”]] or the [[w:Spanish grammar|articles about Spanish grammar]] on Wikipedia. There you will also find links to further internet resources about Spanish grammar. '''¡Que lo pases bien!''' – ''Have a good time!''

== Policy and Guidelines ==

The Reading room is an important discussion area, and most discussions that affect the project will happen there. However, equally important are many of the ongoing discussions about policy, many of which happen on their own pages. These discussions, when they gather enough attention, will typically be announced on the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]], or somewhere in the Reading Room.

Wikibooks has a large number of policy and guideline pages. Each page has an associated talk page, and that is where the discussion about that policy or guideline is taking place.

=== What Kinds of Policies are There? ===

Wikibooks has a few policies that Wikibookians really need to follow in order to keep this website running smoothly. Luckily, the amount of policy we have is really kept to a bare minimum, and is constantly being modified, expanded, reduced, and rewritten to make sure it's the best we can do.

Here are a few of the most fundamental policies, some of which we will discuss in greater detail in later chapters:
;Be Bold:...but don't be reckless. &quot;Be Bold&quot; is a common phrase at Wikibooks. Because everybody has the tools available to make improvements, we expect people to just make them without asking for permission. See something you don't like? Don't complain about it, jump in and fix it! Sometimes however, being bold means not making changes, and asking for other people's opinions. Getting the community involved in a tricky discussion is much better than making controversial changes.
;Neutral Point of View:Often abbreviated &quot;NPOV&quot;, the neutral point of view policy means that we can't use Wikibooks as a tool for pushing a particular social, political, religious, or personal agenda. When writing a Wikibook, you need to make sure to include opposing points of view, and discuss material in a fair and unbiased way. 
;Be Civil:We know that some people are difficult to deal with, and sometimes people can get so angry that they want to say some nasty things to each other. Don't. On Wikibooks, you need to try to stay nice to each other. If you absolutely can't be nice, you need to at least keep the conversation civil. If you can't be civil take a walk, or watch some TV, or check your email. Whatever you do, calm down before you start saying things that you are going to regret. 
;Be Mature and Professional:Some things just aren't appropriate, and we aren't going to list them. You just need to use your best judgment, and try to stay mature and professional. Some people who can't follow this rule post some lousy things on Wikibooks, and we call them &quot;Vandals&quot;. We will discuss vandalism, and how to deal with it, in a later chapter.

Those are the most important policy rules, but there are plenty of other policies that you should probably familiarize yourself with. You can find the complete list at [[WB:PAG|Wikibooks Policies and Guidelines]]. As with any community, there are norms that are pervasive. Important ones are sometimes reflected in the proposed guidelines, policies and information pages in the Wikibooks and Help namespaces. You'll get a feel for these norms as you participate, and some of them will be pointed out to you. For example, Wikibooks has no guideline or policy that says you should add a signature to discussions, but not to content. But this makes perfect sense &amp;mdash; so much so that it is a social norm, but is not enshrined in policy.

=== Who Gets To Write Policy? ===

Anybody can draft a new proposal, but the community needs to reach consensus on it before it can become an official policy or guideline. Notice that this doesn't mean that nobody rejects the proposal. Instead, a proposal must have overwhelming affirmative support in order to become an accepted policy or guideline. 

If you write a proposal that doesn't get accepted, you shouldn't get upset. The vast majority of all proposals, both for new policies and changes to existing ones, are rejected or ignored. Sometimes a good policy author is a good salesperson too. Even the best salespeople can cross the line of harassment, however, so if nobody is interested in your proposals at all you might need to forget about it yourself. As always, a little bit of moderation and personal best judgment is the best prescription.

== Changing Policy ==

No policy is written in stone, anything is always open to discussion. However, without strong community support, it can be difficult to change policy. The best way to try and make a change is to start a discussion and write up a quick draft. Any user may write a draft for a new policy or a policy change at any time.

=== Drafts and Proposals ===

All new policies start as policy drafts. Ambitious editors create a draft of a proposal that they think needs to exist. Then, a discussion can start about the proposal in a public forum. Drafts are located on the wiki, of course, so they will be edited and modified as various users provide their input. The draft will grow and change over time, and may even spawn entirely separate drafts which can be compared together.

Modifying an existing policy usually requires some sort of public proposal and community discussion. Sometimes, if the proposed changes are large enough, a new unstable version of the policy will be drafted and discussed. The unstable version may lead to individual changes being agreed upon and merged into the existing policy. Sometimes, if the unstable version is different enough and has enough support, it could replace the existing policy entirely. 

Once a draft or a proposal has been created, it should be well-advertised to get community involvement. An obvious place to advertise these kinds of discussion is in the [[WB:RR|Reading Room]]. The [[WB:BB|Wikibooks Bulletin Board]] is a great place to make notifications as well.

== List ==

Here is a list of some of the policy and guideline pages, and the associated discussion pages. The complete list of all Wikibooks policies and guidelines are located at [[WB:PAG]]. Policies that are not open to change or discussion will not be listed here.

=== Important Policies ===

These are some of our most important policies that define how Wikibooks works, what kinds of materials we accept, and how our users should behave.

;[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]:Also known as WIW, this is one of the most important policies on Wikibooks. WIW tells what kinds of books and materials can be hosted on this project, and what kinds of things need to be moved or deleted.
;[[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]]: Similar to WIW, the annotated text policy tells how annotated texts can be hosted here at Wikibooks and how Wikibooks is related to sister project Wikisource.
;[[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]:The naming policy tells how pages should be named, and how books should be organized.
;[[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]]:Also known as NPOV, this policy is a very important limitation to writing styles here on Wikibooks. Authors cannot use Wikibooks as a forum or a soapbox to push religious, political, or personal viewpoints or agendas.
;[[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]:The deletion policy tells what kinds of pages can be deleted here at Wikibooks, and how those deletions should be pursued to minimize project disruption.
;[[Wikibooks:Profanity]]:Wikibooks has a relatively low tolerance about profanity, but we aren't into aggressive censorship either. The profanity policy describes how we walk the fine line between these two points.
;[[Wikibooks:Be civil]]:Wikibookians should treat each other with respect, if not politeness and kindness. This is more of a rule than a guideline.
;[[Wikibooks:Administrators]]:Administrators are held to a certain standard. This policy describes the expectations made of our administrators, and how they should perform certain duties.

=== Guidelines ===

Guidelines are things that ''should'' be followed, while policies are things that generally ''must'' be followed. Here is a list of some of our most important guidelines.

;[[Wikibooks:  Decision making]]:Wikibookians don't generally cast yes/no votes. Instead, we try to use discussion, compromise, and consensus to make decisions. The decision making guidelines outline how decisions can be made, and helps to ensure that the voices of all Wikibookians are heard.
;[[Wikibooks:  Editing policy]]:More of an editorial philosophy than a rule, the editing policy page talks about some best practices in making edits and interacting with other editors.
;[[Wikibooks:  Be bold in updating pages]]:Wikibooks can only grow and improve when its editors are bold in making changes. You don't need anybody's permission to edit, and you can edit most pages at any time. 
;[[Wikibooks:  Please do not bite the newcomers]]:All our active contributors used to be hesitant new users at one point. We try to treat our newcomers with patience and respect, to insure that they stay to become regular and active contributors.
;[[Wikibooks:  Manual of Style]]:Wikibookians have developed a number of best practices that should probably be followed to insure books reach a high level of quality. The manual of style lays down some of these guidelines.

=== Proposals ===

Wikibookians often write proposals for new policy or guidelines, many of which are never accepted by the community. Some proposals are simply forgotten. Some proposals are never formally accepted, but make so much sense that we seem to follow them anyway. The complete list of proposals can be found here:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Deodorant is actually very common in Japan, and of about the same strenght as anywhere else... It's just not used as much, and maybe not always easy to identify for a non-japanese speaker. A good effective line of products is called 8x4: http://www.kao.co.jp/8x4/

: 8x4 is about the only decent brand I've tried. Still, I make sure to bring supplies when I visit the &quot;civilised&quot; world. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:23, 1 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">An English speaker should not find French pronunciation too difficult, but it is easy to start mispronouncing French words which have a similar spelling to English words. There are also many different letter combinations which can produce a particular sound and also many silent letters, so it is often difficult to tell how a word should be spelled just from the sound of it. To assist the student, this book makes extensive use of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) which is used in many dictionaries to show the correct pronunciation. By convention, pronunciation is shown bracketed by “/” characters.

====Consonants====

These are generally like English, but with the following modifications.

=====Dental Consonants=====

The letters d, l, n, s, t and z are pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the lower teeth and the middle of the tongue against the roof of the mouth. In English, one would pronounce these letters with the tip of the tongue at the roof of one's mouth. (It is very difficult to pronounce a word like 'voudrais' properly with the d formed in the English manner.)

=====b &amp; p=====

Unlike English, when you pronounce the letters 'b' and 'p' in French, little to no air should come out of your mouth. If you're an English speaker, say the word 'pit' and then the word 'spit' out loud. Did you notice the extra puff of air in the first word that doesn't come with the second? The 'p' in 'pit' is aspirated [pʰ]; the 'p' in 'spit' is not (like the 'p' in any position in French).

=====/ʀ/===== 
The French “r” sound is produced at the back of the throat, as when gargling.  (This is the “official” pronunciation, but there is a lot of regional variation with some dialects being more like English.)
 
=====/ʃ/=====
The French “sh” sound is pronounced as in English but is spelled with “ch”. e.g.
{| width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; 
| width=&quot;25%&quot; | château

|}
{{clear}}

=====/ʒ/===== 
This is the “zh” sound like in English “leisure” which can be spelled with “g” or “j” in different words. e.g.

=====/s/=====
This is the “s” sound is produced by the letters “s” and “c” as in English, and can also be produced by the letter “ç” and sometimes by “x”. e.g.

=====Silent Consonants=====

In French, certain consonants are silent when they are the final letter of a word. The letters p (as in 'coup'), s (as in 'dos'), t (as in 'court'), d (as in 'grand), and x (as in 'locaux'), are generally not pronounced at the end of a word. They are pronounced if there is a letter e added at the end ('coupe', 'dose', 'courte', 'grande', etc.) There are exceptions, e.g. many words taken from English.

The letter “h” is always silent, but where it appears on the front of a word it can affect the pronunciation of any silent consonants on the end of the preceding word. (see Liaison)

====Vowel Sounds====

=====/a/=====

      <comment>/* Base Model 24 */ fixed a typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Many Timex/Ingersoll/US Time movements share common base movements, with extra features and/or modifications. 

Note:  If you have examples of these movements before or after the dates listed here, please either edit this page, or contact user sevesteen. 

Note:  Grids are 1/4 per square, scaled so 1 1/4 inch equals 400 pixels in the full-size image

==Ingersoll Model 20==
*Ingersoll movement model 20, with or without sweep (this movement is missing sweep specific parts)  Has plastic spacers between top and bottom plates, back plate is steel with brass bushings for pivots.  Replaced by the model 21 in about 1950
[[Image:Ingersoll Model 20.jpg|center|thumb|Model 20]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preamble ==

This article is about best-first search in its general form.  There are a number of specific algorithms that follow the basic form of best-first search but use more sophisticated evaluation functions.  A* is a popular variant of the best-first search.  This page does not discuss A* or other variants specifically, though the information contained herein is relevant to those search algorithms.

== Definition ==

Best-first search in its most general form is a simple heuristic search algorithm.  “Heuristic” here refers to a general problem-solving rule or set of rules that do not guarantee the best solution or even any solution, but serves as a useful guide for problem-solving.  Best-first search is a graph-based search algorithm (Dechter and Pearl, 1985), meaning that the search space can be represented as a series of nodes connected by paths.

== How It Works ==

The name “best-first” refers to the method of exploring the node with the best “score” first.  An evaluation function is used to assign a score to each candidate node.  The algorithm maintains two lists, one containing a list of candidates yet to explore (OPEN), and one containing a list of visited nodes (CLOSED).  Since all unvisited successor nodes of every visited node are included in the OPEN list, the algorithm is not restricted to only exploring successor nodes of the most recently visited node.  In other words, the algorithm always chooses the best of all unvisited nodes that have been graphed, rather than being restricted to only a small subset, such as immediate neighbours.  Other search strategies, such as depth-first and breadth-first, have this restriction.
The advantage of this strategy is that if the algorithm reaches a dead-end node, it will continue to try other nodes (Pearl, 1984).

== Algorithm ==

Best-first search in its most basic form consists of the following algorithm (adapted from Pearl, 1984):

The first step is to define the OPEN list with a single node, the starting node.  The second step is to check whether or not OPEN is empty.  If it is empty, then the algorithm returns failure and exits.  The third step is to remove the node with the best score, ''n'', from OPEN and place it in CLOSED.  The fourth step “expands” the node ''n'', where expansion is the identification of successor nodes of ''n''.  The fifth step then checks each of the successor nodes to see whether or not one of them is the goal node.  If any successor is the goal node, the algorithm returns success and the solution, which consists of a path traced backwards from the goal to the start node.  Otherwise, the algorithm proceeds to the sixth step.  For every successor node, the algorithm applies the evaluation function, ''f'', to it, then checks to see if the node has been in either OPEN or CLOSED.  If the node has not been in either, it gets added to OPEN.  Finally, the seventh step establishes a looping structure by sending the algorithm back to the second step.  This loop will only be broken if the algorithm returns success in step five or failure in step two.

The algorithm is represented here in pseudo-code:

:1. Define a list, OPEN, consisting solely of a single node, the start node, ''s''.

:2. IF the list is empty, return failure.

:3. Remove from the list the node ''n'' with the best score (the node where ''f'' is the minimum), and move it to a list, CLOSED.

:4. Expand node ''n''.  

:5. IF any successor to ''n'' is the goal node, return success and the solution (by tracing the path from the goal node to ''s'').

:6. FOR each successor node:
::a) apply the evaluation function, ''f'', to the node.
::b) IF the node has not been in either list, add it to OPEN.

:7.looping structure by sending the algorithm back to the second step. 

Pearl (2012?) adds a third step to the FOR loop that is designed to prevent re-expansion of nodes that have already been visited.  This step has been omitted above because it is not common to all best-first search algorithms.

== Evaluation Function ==

The particular evaluation function used to determine the score of a node is not precisely defined in the above algorithm, because the actual function used is up to the determination of the programmer, and may vary depending on the particularities of the search space.  While the evaluation function can determine to a large extent the effectiveness and efficiency of the search (Pearl, 1984), for the purposes of understanding the search algorithm we need not be concerned with the particularities of the function.

== Applications ==

Best-first search and its more advanced variants have been used in such applications as games and web crawlers.  In a web crawler, each web page is treated as a node, and all the hyperlinks on the page are treated as unvisited successor nodes.  A crawler that uses best-first search generally uses an evaluation function that assigns priority to links based on how closely the contents of their parent page resemble the search query (Menczer, Pant, Ruiz, and Srinivasan, 2001).
In games, best-first search may be used as a path-finding algorithm for game characters.  For example, it could be used by an enemy agent to find the location of the player in the game world.  Some games divide up the terrain into “tiles” which can either be blocked or unblocked.  In such cases, the search algorithm treats each tile as a node, with the neighbouring unblocked tiles being successor nodes, and the goal node being the destination tile (Koenig, 2004).

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Note that this article concerns only events in the Shrieking Shack that occurred in the book [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]. The Shrieking Shack does make a brief reappearance in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 32|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], but this article does not include those events.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is dragged into a tunnel under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|the Whomping Willow]] by a large black dog. Following him, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are trapped in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who turns out to be an unregistered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]]; his Animagus form is the black dog. Though disarmed, Harry manages to get his wand back, and is preparing to kill Sirius who he believes betrayed his parents to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]], Hermione's cat, gets in the way. The impasse is broken by the arrival of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], who greets Sirius as a brother. Their explanation of what is going on is interrupted again by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], who [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Incarcerous|binds]] both Sirius and Lupin and prepares to take them away to meet the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]]. Harry, Hermione, and Ron [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|Disarm]] Snape, which throws him against a wall and knocks him out. Freed, Lupin and Sirius reveal that Ron's rat, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], is actually an Animagus, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]]. As they return to the school to turn Pettigrew in, the full moon causes Lupin to assume his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]] shape, and Sirius transforms into his dog shape to keep Lupin away from the students. Pettigrew changes to his rat shape and escapes. Sirius is caught by the Dementors, and Harry and Hermione try to rescue him, but are unable to and nearly succumb themselves.

== Event Details ==

This event covers some five chapters in the original book, and therefore even the details must be a bit sketchy. For the full event details, the only recourse would be chapters 17 through 21 of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''.

As [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] head back to the school after visiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], the recovered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]] seems unusually determined to escape. Scabbers bites Ron, then escapes, with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]] in hot pursuit. Ron catches Scabbers, but a black dog appears, knocking Harry aside and grabbing Ron. The dog drags Ron into a hole under the roots of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|the Whomping Willow]], breaking Ron's leg. Harry, trying to follow, is struck by one of the Willow's flailing branches.

Crookshanks dives under the branches and presses a knot in the tree trunk. The branches fall still; following Ron and the black dog, Harry and Hermione enter a tunnel that leads to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]]. Upstairs, Ron, lying beside a decrepit four-poster bed, warns them it is a trap; the dog is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]]. Black [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]] Harry and Hermione with Ron's wand.

Sirius remarks he is glad Harry acted like his father, coming to save his friend rather than running for help; that makes things easier. Ron says Black will have to kill them all, not just Harry, but Black responds there will only be one murder tonight. Harry demands to know if killing twelve Muggles plus Peter Pettigrew were not enough and lunges at the visibly weakened Black, grabbing his wand wrist. Black chokes Harry with his free hand. Hermione kicks Black while Ron grabs his wand hand. Harry breaks away; as he grabs Black's wand, Crookshanks claws his hand. Defenseless, Black asks if Harry is going to kill him. Harry says he knows Black betrayed his parents to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Black admits he was responsible but there is more to the story. As Harry decides whether or not to listen, Crookshanks deliberately sits on Black's chest, resisting Black's efforts to remove him. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] suddenly bursts in and disarms Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and asks, &quot;Where is he?&quot; Black points at Ron. Lupin demands, &quot;Why hasn't he shown himself? Unless... you switched... and didn't tell me?&quot; Black nods. Lupin pulls Black to his feet, embracing him. Hermione, sounding betrayed, tells Lupin that she trusted him and protected the secret that he is is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]]. Lupin admits that he is, but he has not been helping Black, nor does he want Harry dead. The Hogwarts staff knows he is a Werewolf; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] convinced them he was trustworthy. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] set the Werewolf assignment with the expectation that a student would detect Lupin and give away his secret. 

Lupin returns the Trio's wands, placing his own wand in his belt, and asks the Trio to listen. Lupin saw Black's name on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], a map Lupin helped create when he was a student. Lupin is &quot;Moony.&quot; He saw someone on the map with the Trio. Lupin and Black claim Scabbers is actually a Wizard Animagus named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]].

Harry, Ron, and Hermione insist Lupin and Black must be crazy, Scabbers could not be Peter Pettigrew; Black murdered him twelve years ago. Black says he did try to kill him, but, unknown to him, Peter escaped. Lupin insists that Harry must understand everything before Pettigrew dies. Black acquiesces, but demands Lupin be quick, he wants to commit the murder for which he was imprisoned. When Ron reminds Black there were witnesses who saw him kill Pettigrew and the Muggles, Black contends they were fooled. Hermione points out that Pettigrew is not listed among the seven registered Animagi. Lupin claims there were three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.

Ron, noting a door apparently opening by itself, thinks the Shrieking Shack is haunted, but Lupin claims it is not. The howls the villagers heard were his, not [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|Ghosts]]. Before there was a potion to allow a Werewolf to retain his mind, the Shrieking Shack was built specifically to confine Lupin during his transformations. The Whomping Willow was planted to guard the tunnel leading to the shack. Terrible as the transformations were, Lupin did have three great friends: Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]]. After discovering he was a Werewolf, rather than shunning their friend, they secretly became Animagi to support him. It took them three years to learn how, perfecting it in their fifth year. James and Black learned on their own, but Pettigrew needed their help. When transformed, they could safely run with Lupin in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Sirius and James were large enough to keep a Werewolf in check, though there were near misses. Their Animagus forms determined their nicknames; Black was Padfoot, James was Prongs. Pettigrew, the rat, was Wormtail. 

Harry asks what animal his father was, but Hermione interrupts, saying it was dangerous to allow a Werewolf to run free. Lupin admits it was, but they were young and uncaring. Lupin regrets never telling Dumbledore that Black is an Animagus, but says he was ashamed to admit to him that he betrayed his trust by once roaming [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|the village]] as a Werewolf. Lupin believed Black was serving Voldemort and convinced himself that Black used Dark Magic to enter the castle, rather than his Animagus form. He confesses that Snape was partially right, that by remaining silent, he was aiding Black. Black demands to know how Snape is involved, and Lupin explains that Snape is now a Hogwarts teacher. Black once tricked Snape after he became curious about Lupin's monthly disappearances. Black told him about the Whomping Willow and how to get into the tunnel. It was James' last-minute intervention that saved Snape from a deadly Werewolf. Dumbledore had, of course, forbidden Snape from revealing anything about Lupin's condition.

Snape now reveals himself, having been hiding under Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] which he had found by the Whomping Willow where Harry and Hermione had dropped it. He was bringing Lupin his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wolfsbane Potion|Wolfsbane potion]] when he noticed a very interesting map on Lupin's desk that confirmed his suspicion Lupin was helping Black. Snape [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Incarcerous|magically binds]] Lupin before he can explain, then insists everyone return to the castle so he can have a word with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]]. Harry blocks the door, demanding Snape listen. When Snape refuses, Harry disarms him, helped by Ron and, surprisingly, Hermione. Their triple-force spell tosses Snape against the wall and knocks him out.

Harry still doubts Lupin's story. Lupin makes Ron hand over Scabbers, though Ron protests that even if Peter Pettigrew assumes a rat form, why would it be Scabbers? Black explains that when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Fudge]] visited him at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], he gave Sirius the newspaper containing the Weasley family photograph. Black recognized Pettigrew (as Scabbers) in the photo by his missing toe. Pettigrew severed his finger before killing the Muggles, then, shouting that Black murdered James and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]] for bystanders to hear, Pettigrew blew up the street. Amid the chaos, he transformed, disappearing into the sewer, his severed finger left behind as evidence he was dead. Lupin points out that Scabbers has been in the Weasley family for twelve years, whereas a common rat lives only three or four. Lupin observes that Scabbers is looking unwell, though Ron claims it is stress caused by &quot;that mad cat&quot; going after him all the time. Harry figures differently: Scabbers was already looking ill in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], and before Hermione bought Crookshanks, presumably because he had heard about Black's escape.

Crookshanks recognized Pettigrew for what he was. He had also spotted Black and initially distrusted him, but helped him once he understood what Black's purpose was. Unable to bring Scabbers to Sirius, Crookshanks stole Neville's password list and later told Black that Scabbers had vanished, leaving blood and hairs on Ron's sheets. After all, appearing dead had worked once before.

Just as Black is about to kill Pettigrew, Harry says Black was his parents' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Secret-Keeper]] and he betrayed them. Black claims he was responsible for their deaths, but was not the Secret Keeper; he had persuaded James and Lily to switch Secret-Keepers, using Pettigrew rather than him, believing no one would suspect a weak Wizard like Pettigrew. When Black checked on Pettigrew's hiding place and found him missing without any apparent struggle, he feared something had happened. He went to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], and finding James and Lily's bodies amid their destroyed house, realized Pettigrew betrayed the Potters to Voldemort.

Lupin calls a halt, and he and Black cast a spell that transforms Scabbers into a human: a short man with vaguely rat-like features, colorless hair, and a large bald spot&amp;mdash;it is Peter Pettigrew. When Lupin demands an explanation about the night James and Lily died, Pettigrew feebly claims he faked his death because he feared Black, after betraying the Potters, would also come after him, and he possessed powers that &quot;He Who Must Not Be Named&quot; taught him. Black responds that Voldemort's followers are unhappy with Pettigrew, that Voldemort went to the Potters' on Pettigrew's information and died there. The Death Eaters in Azkaban think Pettigrew double-crossed Voldemort, and many are still at large. Lupin asks why an innocent man would stay hidden for twelve years. Pettigrew claims he was scared because he put Voldemort's top lieutenant, Sirius Black, in Azkaban. Sirius angrily reminds Pettigrew that he (Pettigrew) was the Potter's Secret-Keeper. 

Black states that Pettigrew never harmed Harry because he would never risk acting on Voldemort's behalf unless he knew Voldemort could protect him. Black kept his sanity in Azkaban by changing into a dog when things became unbearable. A dog's simpler thoughts are less affected by the Dementors than a human's. Dementors are blind and were unable to detect him transforming. Instead, they sense and navigate towards emotions. When Black recognized Pettigrew's Animagus form in the photograph, he vowed to expose the traitor. As a dog, he was able to evade the Dementors during his escape. He journeyed north to Hogwarts and lived in the Forbidden Forest, emerging to watch the Quidditch matches.

Harry is finally convinced that Black is innocent. Pettigrew's pleas for mercy are ignored, and he admits to serving the Dark Lord, because he would have been killed if he resisted. Black says he should have died for his friends, as they would have done for him. Lupin and Black prepare to execute Peter, but Harry intervenes to protect his father's two best friends from becoming murderers; Pettigrew will be turned over to the Dementors. Black and Lupin relent, and Lupin binds Pettigrew and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ferula|splints]] Ron's leg. Black warns Pettigrew that if he transforms, he will kill him. Lupin [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mobilicorpus|charms]] the unconscious Snape to float along with them. Black suggests having two people chained to Pettigrew to prevent him escaping. Lupin and Ron volunteer, and Black, using Snape's wand, conjures manacles. With Crookshanks leading, they return to the tunnel.

Proceeding down the tunnel, Black realizes he will be a free man once Pettigrew is turned over to the authorities. He tells Harry that he is his godfather and also his guardian and hesitantly offers to have Harry live with him. Harry's enthusiastic, &quot;Yes!&quot; catches Black rather by surprise, and his smile makes him look ten years younger.

As they exit the tunnel, a shifting cloud bathes them in full moonlight. Lupin, who has forgotten to take his potion, transforms into a Werewolf. Black yells at Harry to run, but he cannot&amp;mdash;Ron is still chained to Pettigrew. Black transforms into a dog to defend the others. Lupin, now a Werewolf, is no longer shackled to Pettigrew, who grabs Lupin's dropped wand and stuns Ron and Crookshanks. Harry disarms Pettigrew, but he transforms into a rat and vanishes into the grass. Lupin, blocked by Black from attacking Harry, Hermione, and the Stunned Ron, bounds off into the Forbidden Forest, chased by a wounded Black.

Harry and Hermione rush to Ron's aid, but they are unable to undo Pettigrew's jinx. Hearing a whining yelp, Harry and Hermione run to the lake and find the human Black cowering on the shore. Nearly a hundred Dementors are approaching from all directions. Harry and Hermione leap to Black's defense, but there are too many Dementors, and Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus charm]] is too weak to repel them. The creatures' presence overwhelm Harry and Hermione. Harry falls and feels himself being lifted by one to administer the ''Kiss''.

As Harry's consciousness fades, a bright light seems to race around him, scattering the Dementors. As they disperse, a large glowing animal appears in the light's midst, then trots back to someone standing on the on the lake's opposite shore. What Harry sees before losing consciousness seems impossible.

Harry awakens in the infirmary and hears  Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge and Professor Snape discussing the night's events. Snape says that the cut on his head was Harry, Ron, and Hermione's work but that they were probably under a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|Confundus charm]] put on them by Black. When he regained consciousness, the Dementors were returning to their posts, and he found Harry, Hermione, and Black unconscious beside the lake. He conjured stretchers and brought them to the Hospital Wing. Fudge says this will probably put him in line for the Order of Merlin, Third Class. Harry opens his eyes and sees Hermione in the next bed, wide awake and looking frightened. Nearby, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] is attending to Ron. Madam Pomfrey tells Harry that Black has been captured, and the Dementors will shortly administer the ''Kiss''. Harry leaps up, shouting that Sirius is innocent and Peter Pettigrew is alive and is an Animagus. Snape says he is obviously Confunded, and Madam Pomfrey forces him back into bed.  When Professor Dumbledore arrives, Harry also tells him. Dumbledore says he has spoken with Black and needs to speak to Harry and Hermione alone. Madam Pomfrey and Fudge depart, but Snape protests that Black has shown that he was capable of killing someone when he was 16. Dumbledore responds that he is aware, and Snape leaves stiffly.

Harry and Hermione try to explain what happened, but Dumbledore says their unsupported word will not save Black. Neither can Lupin, even if he were not currently roaming the Forbidden Forest. Apart from his being Black's old friend, a Werewolf's word counts for little. Snape's version will bear the most credibility, and while Dumbledore believes Harry and Hermione, he cannot force other people to see the truth. &quot;What we need,&quot; Dumbledore comments, &quot;is more ''time''.&quot; Hermione apparently understands, though Harry does not. He mentions that Black is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]'s office. He cryptically says it is five minutes before midnight, that they must not be seen, and that more than one innocent life can be saved. He tells Hermione that &quot;three turns&quot; should do it, then leaves, locking them in the infirmary.

Harry is mystified, but Hermione produces a tiny sparkling hourglass from her robes. She loops the chain around herself and Harry, and turns the hourglass over three times. The world becomes a spinning blur; when it settles, they are standing in the deserted Entrance Hall, and the sun is shining. Pushing them into a broom closet, Hermione tells Harry that they are now three hours in the past. Slow footsteps are heard going past, and Hermione says that it is themselves under the Invisibility Cloak; Harry is trying to comprehend being in two places at the same time, in the closet with Hermione as well as under the Cloak with Ron and Hermione heading for Hagrid's hut. Hermione explains that the hourglass is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time-Turner]]; she has been using it all year to get to all her classes. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] instructed her to tell no one about it. 

Now that they have gone back three hours, Hermione is unsure what Dumbledore expects them to do. Harry guesses that he intends for them to save [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]] and Black, who is locked in Flitwick's office. Buckbeak can fly them to Flitwick's window to save Black. They head for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], edging around it until they reach Hagrid's pumpkin patch. There they watch themselves going in the hut. Harry wants to grab Buckbeak, but Hermione says the Committee must see him first, otherwise they will think Hagrid freed him. They hear Hagrid breaking the milk jug and the other Hermione finding Scabbers. Harry wants to dash in and grab Pettigrew, but Hermione asks what would he think if he suddenly saw himself bursting in that way. There is a reason Dumbledore said they must not be seen.

The Committee, including Professor Dumbledore and Cornelius Fudge, approach. Harry and Hermione watch Harry, Ron, and Hermione vanish under the Invisibility Cloak and exit at the back while the Committee enter the front. After the executioner, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walden Macnair|Macnair]], has spotted Buckbeak, Harry decides it is time to act. He bows to Buckbeak and starts leading him into the forest, but Buckbeak resists. As the Committee starts to exit the hut, Dumbledore calls them back, saying that the decree needs another signature. Just as Harry gets Buckbeak into the woods, the Committee emerges to find Buckbeak gone. Macnair slams his axe into the fence in anger.

Harry and Hermione, with Buckbeak, move closer to the Whomping Willow and watch as the black dog drags Ron into the tunnel. Shortly, Crookshanks stills the branches and their other selves go into the tunnel. Almost immediately, Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and the old Committee member walk past on their way back to the castle. Now they see Professor Lupin running to the Whomping Willow and diving into the passage. Harry wonders if he could dash out and collect his Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione dissuades him. Two minutes later, Snape arrives, throws on the Invisibility Cloak, and enters the tunnel.

Now Harry and Hermione must wait while the events inside the Shrieking Shack replay. Hermione wonders how they were saved from all those Dementors. Harry says it must have been a powerful Patronus and believes he saw his late father casting it.

An hour later, everyone exits the tunnel, and Lupin transforms into a Werewolf. Realizing they are standing where Lupin is about to run, Harry and Hermione rapidly retreat to Hagrid's empty hut. Despite a Werewolf roaming loose, Harry wants to see who cast the Patronus and takes off for where the spell-caster was standing. No one is there. Harry suddenly understands: it was not his father he saw, it was himself. As the Dementors attack Black and the earlier Harry and Hermione, he casts the Patronus. A large animal bursts from his wand, and charging the Dementors, scatters them. When they have dispersed, the Patronus, a large silver stag form, canters back to Harry, who now realizes his father's Animagus form was a stag, hence the nickname, &quot;Prongs&quot;.

Hermione appears, furious that Harry has been up to something. He explains that his earlier self had seen his later self casting the spell, and he was only performing the events that already happened. They watch as Snape conjures stretchers and transports everyone to the castle. They mount Buckbeak and fly to the West Tower. Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Alohomora|charms]] the window open, and Black climbs out onto Buckbeak. Harry and Hermione dismount on the tower top, and Harry urges Black to leave quickly. Black first inquires about Ron, then escapes with Buckbeak into the night.

== Notable Consequences ==

The main result of the events in the Shrieking Shack is the revelation of the truth surrounding the betrayal of Harry's parents. Harry now knows that Peter Pettigrew is still alive, and had been hiding since his supposed death at Sirius' hand, thirteen years earlier; that it was Pettigrew, not Sirius, that had betrayed his parents; that Sirius, Pettigrew, and Lupin had been friends of his father; and that Sirius, his godfather, still cared about him and would be available to help him. For a short while, Harry believes that he may have a chance to live with Sirius, instead of with the Dursleys. This hope is unfortunately dashed with the escape of Pettigrew, shortly after they leave the Shrieking Shack.

We also learn that Sirius and Pettigrew are Animagi, as Harry's father was; the large black dog that we have seen throughout the book in many cases was Sirius. Pettigrew, of course, had been posing as Ron's rat Scabbers. We don't yet know what shape Harry's father took as an Animagus.

We learn that Snape had been in school at the same time as James, Lupin, Sirius, and Pettigrew, and that he had hated them so much that he is apparently willing to fabricate stories about them in revenge for the past, even to the extent of possibly getting Lupin killed.

== Analysis ==

Clearly, the events in the Shrieking Shack are central to the story of this book, taking up, as they do, almost a quarter of the book. Several things are learned here which may be of interest in the series.

First and foremost, we learn that Sirius is innocent of the crimes for which he has been imprisoned. Readers may find it curious that even wizards have trouble discerning the truth in criminal cases, and we can guess that there will be some discussion of that in later books. We also learn that Lupin is a werewolf, a revelation that has previously been hinted at, and that Sirius is an Animagus, another ability that has been only suggested and never in context with him. We further discover it is Sirius' Animagus ability that allowed him to survive Azkaban relatively unscathed.

Additionally, we learn about Harry's father's school days, and learn that Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew were his best friends. We learn that James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew chose to undertake the extremely difficult Animagus transform to accompany their friend Lupin when he became a werewolf, rather than abandoning him to his own devices. This reinforces Harry's view of his father as a kind, fair, and just person. Harry seems to dismiss the reports of Lupin being allowed to run as a werewolf in Hogsmeade, though as Hermione points out, that was very dangerous and irresponsible.

Snape's hatred of Sirius, and incidentally of James, is explained here as well by revelation of the circumstances alluded to earlier: Dumbledore had mentioned that James saved Snape's life, we now learn how that happened, and perhaps why Snape was unable to forgive him for that. We learn also that Snape believes Lupin had been helping Sirius enter the school, and that both Snape and Lupin, at least initially, believe in Sirius' guilt. Snape must continue to believe Sirius is guilty, in order to prevent his bitter world view from being shattered, so it is necessary that he not see Pettigrew; his being knocked out by the Trio's triple spell is thus a plot requirement. Snape's continuing enmity with Sirius and, to a lesser extent, Lupin may prove necessary in later books.

One point that remains somewhat unexplained is Snape's awareness that the Invisibility Cloak is Harry's. Snape finds it outside the Whomping Willow, and uses it to eavesdrop on Sirius, Black, and the Trio; the door that Ron sees open, that leads him to comment on the Shack being haunted, is, we believe, actually being opened by Snape under the Cloak. It is unclear why Snape immediately guesses the Cloak is Harry's, rather than Ron's or Hermione's. Granted, Harry's family was the most likely to be able to afford one such, but Harry's family are unable to tell Harry that such things even exist, and Hermione's family are Muggles, so despite the Weasley family's relative poverty, Ron is actually the most likely owner. We can't explain this assumption on the part of Snape, no matter how accurate it might be, unless it is extrapolation from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 14|the earlier incident outside the Shrieking Shack]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]], possibly coupled with a touch of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]]. It is likely that Snape's awareness of the existence of the Cloak, and his awareness also of the Marauder's Map, which he had seen in Harry's possession following that event, will be important later in the series.

Finally, we learn that the Wizarding world has at least some ability to manage, and travel through, time. While the use of the Time-Turner is presented as being somewhat limited, allowing the wearer to go back to an earlier time and thus be in multiple places at the same time, it is entirely possible that Wizarding time-manipulation abilities are much more advanced, and that this specific Time-turner is limited in what it can do, as it has been issued to a student.

Although the effect of the events in the Shrieking Shack on Sirius is minimal, as he was a fugitive both before and after this episode, it does still leave Harry with an adult who he feels able to call upon in times of need, as Harry will do several times in the next two books. Sirius' being free from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] will allow him to offer the use of his family home in London as the Headquarters of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]], something he could not have done had he not re-established contact with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. It could be argued that had the events in the Shrieking Shack not occurred, Dumbledore would not have chosen to re-open communications with Sirius, and Sirius in turn would not have been available to help Harry.

Sirius will reveal that the shape James Potter took as an Animagus was that of a stag, similar to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] that Harry casts shortly after the events at the Shrieking Shack. This would be the second corporeal Patronus that Harry had cast; the first, used to disable supposed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch match]] against Ravenclaw, had quite disturbed Lupin as he recognized its shape, though Harry had been too busy to look at it himself. It will develop that the ability to produce a Patronus is quite advanced defensive magic, usually taught no earlier than sixth year. Harry's facility with this charm will stand him in good stead in his fifth year and later. Possibly Lupin's being able to teach this charm to Harry is a reflection of how good a teacher he is, though given the nature of the curse on that particular teaching position, and the fact that the school seems to be rather scraping the bottom of the barrel to find teachers of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], Lupin does not have a lot of competition for excellence. On the other hand, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] seems to consider Lupin a competent teacher, which from McGonagall could be considered high praise indeed.

Dumbledore points out that Harry having stopped Sirius and Lupin from killing Pettigrew leaves Pettigrew owing Harry a life debt. While there is little discussion of life debts in the books, these are apparently taken quite seriously in the Wizarding world. At this time, in response to Harry's bemoaning the fact that, even forewarned, Harry had still let Pettigrew escape to return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord]], Dumbledore comments that Voldemort is unlikely to be completely pleased that his lieutenant owes a life debt to his enemy. We will see that Voldemort is not particularly pleased with Pettigrew anyway, treating him as a not particularly valuable servant, rather than as a confidant. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we will see that this life debt does end up saving Harry's life and resulting in Pettigrew's death.

The term “functional group” is one that is used almost exclusively in organic chemistry. In organic chemistry, functional groups are a set of specific atoms within a molecule that determine the molecule’s overall reactivity and properties. Small differences in functional groups, like the difference between an aldehyde and a ketone, can result in drastic differences in the properties and reactivity of the molecules. Compounds that have the same functional groups will have the same type of reactivity, though small deviances will result if other substituents or functional groups are present on the molecule. 
:[[Image:12functional.jpg|500px|An example of a Grignard reaction]]
There are 7 important functional groups in the chemistry of life: [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Hydroxyl|'''Hydroxyl''']], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carbonyl|'''Carbonyl''']], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carboxyl|'''Carboxyl''']], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Amino|'''Amino''']], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Sulfhydryl|'''Thiol''']], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Phosphate|'''Phosphate''']], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Aldehyde|'''aldehyde''']] groups.

1) Hydroxyl group:  consists of a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an oxygen atom. The hydroxyl group is denoted by -OH in chemical structures and has a valence charge of -1 when in the hydroxyl ion form. It is present in Alcohols and Carboxylic Acid molecules.

2) Carbonyl group: is written as a covalent C=O double bond. It is a very polar molecule and the carbonyl carbon can serve as a reaction site for many reactions. It is present in Aldehydes, Ketones, Esters, Anhydrides, and Carboxylic Acids.

3) Carboxyl group: is the monovalent group -COOH, consisting of a carbonyl group bound to a hydroxyl group. It is the main functional group in organic acids (carboxylic acids), as the Hydrogen can dissociate due to the strong stabilizing resonance that forms between the two oxygens when deprotonated.

4) Amino group: The amino group (–NH2) consists of one atom of nitrogen attached by covalent bonds two atoms of hydrogen, and a spot where it is attached to an alkyl group, or another hetero atom. This leaves a lone valence electron pair on the nitrogen which is available for bonding to another atom. 

5) Thiol group: a fuctional group containing a sulfur atom bonded to a hydrogen atom. General formula: -SH. The amino acid cysteine contains a thiol group. It is the thiol derivative of a hydroxyl group, and can undergo similar reactions.

6) Phosphate group: A functional group or radical comprised of phosphorus attached to four oxygen (a diester), and with a net negative charge, thus represented as PO4-. The phosphate group is important in living things in varying ways. Firstly, it is an important structural backbone component of nucleotides, which is the basic structural unit of DNA and RNA. Secondly, it is used as an electron transfer component of energy-rich molecules, such as ATP. Thirdly, it is also bound to coenzymes like NADP / NADPH involved in anabolic reactions (such as photosynthesis in plants and lipid synthesis in animals). It is also a part of the hydrophilic head of phospholipids in biological membranes.

7) Aldehyde group: Aldehydes are the second compound containing the carbonyl group (C=0). In aldehydes, one of the two groups attached to the carbonyl carbon is an alkyl group, while the other is a hydrogen atom. This means that aldehyde carbonyl occur at the end of a chain of carbon atoms (i.e. in sugars, R-CHO is at the end of a chain, while a carbonyl inside the chain attached to two carbons is a ketone). They can form acetals and hemiacetals when exposed to water, or in the presence of hydroxy groups.
When an aldehyde group is the highest priority functional group present in the molecule, it is names as an alkanal (note, the -e is dropped). The numbering scheme used will be the one that gives the carbonyl carbon atom the lowest possible number (i.e. number 1). Other functional groups are located by this numbering scheme. Since the carbonyl group is always at carbon number 1, there is no need to indicate the location. 
It is possible to have the -CHO group directly attached to a ring. If it is the highest priority group in the molecule, the ring is a substituent to the aldehyde and it is named as a cycloalkyl carbaldehyde or cycloakanecarbaldehyde (an older way is as a carboxaldehyde). There are a number of compounds which were named before IUPAC developed the standardized nomenclature rules. Many of these compounds are still referred to by these common names. 




Other common functional groups include:&lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot;&gt;Schore, Neil E. (2011). Organic Chemistry Structure and Function 6th Edition. W. H. Freeman&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Haloalkanes: can also be named as alkyl halides despite the fact that the halogens are higher priority than alkanes. The alkyl halide nomenclature is most common when the alkyl group is simple. 

[[File:Haloalkane-2D-flat.png|240x120px|thumbnail|right|Example of Haloalkane]]

*Ethers: If both groups are simple alkyl groups, then the ether is usually named as alkyl alkyl ether. If the two alkyl groups are the same, then it's a dialkyl ether. 
*Thiols: A sulfur-containing organic compound having the general formula RSH, where R is another element or radical.
*Alkenes: The root name is based on the longest chain containing both ends of the alkene unit, the C=C. The chain is numbered so as to give the alkene unit the lowest possible numbers. The locant for the first carbon of the alkene is used in the name.
*Alkynes: The alkynes are the third homologous series of organic compounds of hydrogen and carbon, where there is at least one triple-bond between the atoms in the molecules.
*Aromatic Compounds: a hydrocarbon containing one or more benzene rings that are characteristic of the benzene series of compounds.

*Anhydrides: are used in the preparation of esters. Ethyl acetate and butyl acetate (from butyl alcohol and acetic anhydride) are excellent solvents for cellulose nitrate lacquers. Acetates of high-molecular-weight alcohols are used as plasticizers for plastics and resins. Cellulose and acetic anhydride give cellulose acetate, used in acetate rayon and photographic film. The reaction of anhydrides with sodium peroxide forms peroxides (acetyl peroxide is violently explosive), used as catalysts for polymerization reactions and for addition of alkyl halides to alkenes. In Friedel-Crafts reactions, anhydrides react with aromatic compounds, forming ketones such as acetophenone. 
Anhydrides react with water to form the parent acid, with alcohols to give esters, and with ammonia to yield amides; and with primary or secondary amines, they furnish N-substituted and N,N-disubstituted amides, respectively.

*Esters: is any of a class of organic compounds corresponding to the inorganic salts and formed from an organic acid and an alcohol.
*Nitriles: are typically undergo nucleophilic addition to give products that often undergo a further reaction. The chemistry of the nitrile functional group, C=N, is very similar to that of the carbonyl, C=O of aldehydes and ketones.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic Information==
The hydroxy-group is one of many functional groups studied in organic chemistry. The presence of a hydroxy group indicates that the molecule is either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The chemical representation of a hydroxy group is &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;OH, indicating an oxygen atom covalently bonded to a hydrogen atom. 

Within the general functional group of alcohol, there are three subgroups: primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. An alcohol is classified as a primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on the carbon it is attached to. An alcohol is primary if it is attached to a carbon with only one carbon-carbon bond. By the same token, an alcohol is secondary if the carbon to which it is attached is bound to two other carbons, and tertiary if the carbon’s remaining three bonds are bonded to other carbons.  The following examples of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols are ethanol, isopropanol (IUPAC nomenclature: propan-2-ol), and tert-butyl alcohol (IUPAC nomenclature: 2-methylpropan-2-ol), respectively.

== Physical Properties of Alcohols ==
The bond existing between oxygen and hydrogen is significantly shorter than the bonds formed between carbon and hydrogen. Hydroxy groups are inherently polar. The oxygen in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent]] bond is highly electronegative; thereby, pulling the majority of the electron density shared in the covalent bond towards itself. From this information it becomes clear that the oxygen bears a significant partial negative charge, while the hydrogen bears a partial positive charge of the same magnitude. 

The presence of a highly electronegative group allows alcohols to hydrogen bond with other molecules. For example, in ethanol, the negatively charged oxygen on one ethanol molecule is attracted to a positively charged hydrogen molecule on another ethanol molecule. The ability of alcohols to hydrogen bond amongst themselves explains their high melting points. Alcohols also have higher boiling points than the hydrocarbons and ethers which contain a comparable number of carbon atoms. 

The solubility of alcohols in water is interesting because alcohols have hydrophobic and hydrophilic centers, making them amphipathic or amphiphilic. The hydrocarbon portion of the alcohol is nonpolar, and thus resists dissolving in water; the polar alcohol group is hydrophilic and thereby promotes dissolution in water. In a small molecule such as propanol, the alcohol dissolves because the polar alcohol group outweighs the very short hydrogen chain. However, as the hydrocarbon chain increases beyond butanol to pentanol and hexanol, alcohols become virtually immiscible in water. 

Alcohols are amphoteric species that may exist as both acids and bases. At low pH, or when surrounded by strong acids, they may be protonated to alkyloxonium ions. In contrast, at high pH and when surrounded by strong bases, they may exist as alkoxide ions.

==Phenols==
[[File:Phenol.svg|thumb|Structure of Phenol]]
Phenols are hydroxy-arenes. They have some similarities to alcohols in chemical reactivity at oxygen, but they are much more acidic and much less basic. They appear to be enols (hydroxy attached to an alkene) and should be unstable relative to the keto form, but the gain in aromaticity in being in the enol favors the enol form relative to the keto. Examination of the resonance forms indicates that the hydroxyl donates electron density to the ring, hence the hydroxyl group is activating and ortho-para directing.
[[File:Phenol resonance.svg|500x150px]]

===Nomenclature of Phenols===
Substituted phenols are named as derivatives of the parent compound phenol with the hydroxyl-bearing carbon being designated as C-1. Some examples are:

|}

===Acidity of Phenols===
The pka of phenols is around 8-10. Phenols are substantially more acidic than alcohols. This is because phenoxide (the corresponding conjugate base) is resonance stabilized.

[[File:Phenoxide-anion-resonance-2D-skeletal.png|500px]]

===Synthesis of Phenols: Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution===
Direct concerted displacement of leaving groups on aromatic rings is not possible. In appropriately substituted rings, leaving groups may be replaced by hydroxyl involving nucleophilic processes via a 2-step mechanism: nucleophilic aromatic substitution. 
[[File:Nucleophilic aromatic substitution example.PNG|500px]]

===Alcohol-like Reactivity of Phenols===
Phenols undergo many of the same reactions as alcohols, especially where the nucleophicity of the corresponding phenoxide (alkoxide) is concerned.

== Synthesis of Alcohols ==

In industry, methanol is made on a multibillion-pound scale from a pressurized mixture of CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; called synthesis gas.The reaction involves a catalyst consisting of copper, zinc oxide and chromium(III) oxide.

Changing the catalyst to rhodium or ruthenium leads to 1,2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol), an important industrial chemical that is the principal component of automobile antifreeze.
Ethanol is prepared in large quantities by fermentation of sugars or by the phosphoric acid-catalyzed hydration of ethene (ethylene).

On a smaller than industrial scale, we can prepare alcohols from a wide variety of starting materials. For example, conversions of haloalkanes into alcohols by Sn2 and Sn1 processes featuring hydroxide and water. These methods are not as widely used as one might think, however, because the required halides are often accessible only from the corresponding alcohols. They also suffer from the usual drawbacks of nucleophilic substitution: Bimolecular elimination can be a major side reaction of hindered systems, and tertiary halides from carbocations that may undergo E1 reactions. Some of these drawbacks are overcome by the use of polar, aprotic solvent.

Conceptually, the easiest way to reduce a carbonyl group would be to add hydrogen, H-H, across the carbon-oxygen double bond directly. Although this can be done, it requires high pressures and special catalysts. A more convenient way is a polar process, in which hydride ion, and a proton, are delivered to the double bond, either simultaneously or sequentially.

=== Organometallic Reagents ===
Organometallic reagents of magnesium and lithium are used in the synthesis of alcohols. Since the metal in organometallic compounds are extremely electropositive, the carbon can react as if it were carrying a negative charge (giving it nucleophilic behavior). These organometallic compounds can attack the carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones. An important feature of this reaction is that a new carbon-carbon bond is formed in the process.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot;&gt;Schore, Neil E. (2011). Organic Chemistry Structure and Function 6th Edition. W. H. Freeman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grignard-Reaction Mechanism.png|thumbnail|right|Synthesis of Tertiary Alcohol From Ketone]]
The first step of this reaction involves the nucleophilic carbon attacking the carbonyl carbon of a ketone or aldehyde to form the carbon-carbon bond. Simultaneously, two electrons from the carbon-oxygen double bond (carbonyl) are pushed by the electrons from the attacking carbon to form a metal alkoxide with the metal from the organometallic compound.  Upon aqueous work-up, an alcohol is formed by hydrolyzing the metal alkoxide.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot; /&gt;

Different types of alcohols can be formed by changing the compound reacting with the organometallic compound.  For example, a reaction between an organometallic compound and formaldehyde will result in a primary alcohol.  Reaction with any other type of aldehyde will produce secondary alcohols; reaction with ketones will yield tertiary alcohols.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot; /&gt;

==Hydroxylation==

An important function of metabolic degradation is the introduction of hydroxy groups into unfunctionalized parts of molecules in our body (hydroxylation).  A set of proteins, known as the cytochrome proteins, are vital biomolecules that are present in almost all living cells, which assist with the process of hydroxylation.  An example of a cytochrome protein is cytochrome P-450.  Cytochrome P-450 uses O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to add hydroxy groups to alkyl substituents. The importance of hydroxylation can be signified by the excretion of drugs to prevent toxic accumulation.  Hydroxylation helps increase the water solubility of compounds through addition of hydroxy groups to specific regions of the compounds.  Thus in the liver, hydroxylation helps to accelerate the excretion of medicine that we ingest by making it more soluble.  If it weren't for this process, ingested drugs would stay in our bodies much longer and have a much greater chance of toxic accumulation. &lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot; /&gt;

Hydroxylation can also be selective in the addition of hydroxy groups to a molecule.  Protein's undergoing hydroxylation can control the order in which hydroxy groups are added, as well as, the positions to which they are added.  This is a key function of the process of hydroxylation, as it allows molecules to undergo oxidation at specific regions of the molecule.  Also it allows molecules to bind or react with other compounds in specific orientations.  &lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot; /&gt;

== Nomenclature ==

The system used to name organic molecules – IUPAC – is relatively simple to use for alcohols, though it can get more complicated if the molecule containing the alcohol group contains substituents containing other functional groups, such as alkenes, alkynes or halogens. The simplest case is when the molecule contains only hydrocarbons and the hydroxy group is the sole functional group, making it purely an alcohol.

In general, the presence of functional groups is indicated by a characteristic suffix that is distinct for each functional group and a number designating the location of the functional group on the molecule. For alcohols, the characteristic suffix used is –ol. 

Case 1: Hydrocarbons and alcohols
In this case, the longest chain of the hydrocarbons is counted – this becomes the primary hydrocarbon chain of the molecule. Then the longest carbon chain is numbered with the goal of putting as small a number as possible on the hydroxyl group. The longest chain is named as it is for alkanes, but the suffix for alcohols is –ol. Thus, for a propane chain which contains an alcohol group on the second carbon is named propan-2-ol or 2-propanol. Because the alcohol is the only functional group, it does not matter which of the two names is used. It is assumed that the “2” corresponds with the location of the hydroxy group. However, this rule does not always hold  true when other functional groups are present. 

Case 2: This is more complex because there is a hierarchy of functional groups in organic chemistry. Each functional group when isolated wants to be labeled as the smallest number. However, some functional groups are of “higher importance” and thus are numbered first. Also, if the alcohol is no longer the most “important” functional group, the molecule does not the suffix for the alcohol. This may present a slight problem initially, because the –ol was the only hint that the molecule possessed an –OH group. However, the presence of the –OH group is designated by using the word “hydroxy” after the number of the carbon on which the –OH group is bound to. An example is: 1-chloro-2-hydroxybenzene. 

If there are multiple –OH groups present, the nomenclature is modified only slightly. The suffix used in the name is the number of alcohol groups followed by –ol. For example, a compound containing two –OH groups has a suffix of “diol”; for a compound with three –OH groups, the suffix is a “triol.” The numbers of the carbons containg the alcohol groups are stated in the same manner as if there were only one; giving the hydroxy group the lowest number possible. For example, a diol would be named as 3,3 pentandiol. This name indicates that the third carbon in the five-carbon chain is bonded to two –OH groups.

== Unique Infrared Spectroscopy of Alcohols and Phenols ==
Infrared Spectroscopy is a technique used by chemists to elucidate structural information about an organic compound. Organic molecules absorb electromagnetic radiation in the infrared region and promote specific vibrational states. These vibrations are called fundamental absorptions, and they arise from the excitation from the ground state to the lowest-energy excited state. These modes of vibration are then picked up by a machine which interprets the radiation in the form of a spectrum. Since every type of covalent bond has a different natural frequency of vibration, two different molecules will never share the same infrared spectrum. The absorption of certain bonds have very distinct vibrational frequencies. A small range of absorption can be allocated to a specific type of bond. For instance, an absorption around 1715 is normally due to the carbonyl group. 

Alcohols and Phenols have unique Infrared spectrum and usually show strong and broad streching bands between 3400 and 3300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. In solution, it is sometimes possible to observe a free stretching band at around 3600&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; with a sharp but weaker peak. 

The broad peak that is well known as the alcohol or phenol peak is created by the stretching vibrations between the O-H. Intermolecular [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen]] bonding usually weakens the O-H bond, and shifts the band to a lower frequency. Phenols are known to have a broader O-H band than alcohols. However, it is hard to determine the difference by looking at the O-H band due to their similar shapes. The bending vibrations between the C-O-H usually yield weak and broad peaks around 1440–1220&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. However, these peaks are difficult to see due to interference by similar bands from strong CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bending peaks. Strong C-O bond stretches are observed from 1260 – 1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Since the C-O bond is adjacent to the C-C bond, the shape and size of the peak can be used to determine whether an alcohol is primary, secondary, or tertiary. It can also be used to distinguish between phenols and alcohols. In addition, alcohols that are present in amides, ethers, and aldehydes can also be distinguished in IR spectrum. Infared spectrum is a useful analytical tool that is used to identify which function groups are present or which ones are not.

== NMR of alcohol groups ==

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a technique used to identify organic compounds. Since the atomic nucleus has a spinning  charge due to the positively charged protons, it can generate a magnetic field. Because of this, the protons will have two orientations, a β and α spin state that have different energies in the presence of an external magnetic field. When the compound is exposed to electromagnetic radiation, resonance (when the nuclei is flipped back and forth between orientations) will occur and when the amount of radiation matched the difference in energy of the two spin states, an NMR signal is recorded and the NMR detector records peaks. 

One of the most common forms of NMR is the proton NMR (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; NMR). The NMR spectrum is read by the chemical shift of the different groups. In a proton NMR a compound with an   -OH group will have a chemical shift (peak) at around 0.5-5.0 ppm. For example, ethanol will have a peak at around 4.0 ppm indicating the hydroxide groups while its two other peaks at around 1.0 ppm and around 3.0 ppm will indicate the position of the C-H protons in accordance to their position in the compound.

      <comment>/* Biochemical Synthesis of Carbonyl Groups */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Information ==
[[Image:ketone-displayed.png|150px|right|thumb|A '''ketone'''. Carbonyl is in between two hydrocarbons.]]
[[Image:aldehyde2.png|thumb|150px|right|An '''aldehyde'''. R can be a anything but a ''hydroxyl group'' or ''alkoxy group'' attached to a carbonyl.]]
A carbonyl group is a functional group that is comprised of a carbon atom doubly bonded to an oxygen atom. The carbon attached to the oxygen can have single bonds to different atoms. The atoms that the carbon chooses to bind with distinguish it from being a ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, ester, or amide.

&lt;ref&gt;Bruice,Paula Yurkanis.Organic Chemistry Six edition, Pearson Education,Inc. New York. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;==The Nomenclature of Carbonyl Compounds==

1, Naming Carboxylic Acids:

  The functional carboxylic acid is called a carboxyl group. In systematic nomenclature, a carboxylic acid is named by replacing the
last alphabet &quot;e&quot; with &quot;oic acid.&quot; For instance, a two carbon alkane is called ethane and two carboxylic acid is ethanoic acid. Notice
that a six (or fewer) carbon caboxylic acid are usually known by their common names. ( methanoic acid= formic acid, ethanoic acid=
acetic acid, propanoic acid= propionic acid, butanoic acid= butyric acid, pentanoic acid= valeric acid,hexanoci acid= caproic acid)

2, Naming acyl Hlides

  Acyl halides have a halide in place of the Oh group in a carboxylic acid. Acyl halides are namend by replacing &quot;ic acid&quot; in the acid
name with &quot;yl halide&quot; (eg; yl chloride, yl bromide, yl flouride etc). If acid has a name with &quot;carboxylic acid,&quot; then replace
&quot;carboxylic acid with &quot;carbonyl halide&quot; (eg; carbonyl chlorid, carbonyl bromide, carbonyl flouride)

3, Acid anhydrides

  An acid anhydried is formed by two molecules of carboxylic acid reacting with each other to loss one water molecule. An anhydride is
a symmetrical anhydride if the two reacting acid molecules are the same. If two reacting acid molecules are different then they are
going to from a mixed anhydride.symmetrical anhydrides are named by replacing &quot;acid&quot; in acid name with &quot;anhydride.&quot; Mixed anhydride are
named by stating the names of both acids in alphabetical order then followed by &quot;anhydried.&quot;

4, Naming Esters

  If there is an OR group in place of OH group of a carboxylic acid.The name of the group that   attaching carboxyl oxygen should be
stated first, then state the name of acid by replacing &quot;ic acid&quot; with &quot;ate.&quot;
  Salts of carboxylic acids are named in the same way. The cation is named first then name the acid with replacing &quot;ic acid&quot; by &quot;ate&quot;
  Notice that cyclic ester are called Lactones.Their common names are derived from the common name of the carboxylic acid, which designates the length of the carbon chain, and a Greek letter to indicate the carbon to which the carboxyl oxygen si attached.

5,Naming Amides

  An amide has an NH2,NHR,or NR2 group in place of OH group of a carboxylic acid.They are named by replacing &quot;oic acid&quot;, &quot;ic acid&quot;, or
&quot;ylic acid&quot; of the acid name with &quot;amide.&quot; If a substituent is bonded to the nitrogen, the name of the substituent should be stated
first(if there si more than one substituent bonded to the nitrogen, they should be stated alphabetically), then state the name of the
amide. The name of each substituent is preceded by capital N to indicate that the substituent is bonded to a nitrogen.Cyclic amides are
called Lactams. Their nomenclature si similar to that of Lactones.

Each of the characteristic specific to each compound is detailed on their specific pages.

==General Reactivity==

Oxygen is far more electronegative than carbon, so the oxygen atoms pull electron density away from the carbon. This creates a dipole moment, where the oxygen bears a negative charge and the carbon bears a positive charge of the same magnitude. This distribution of charges makes carbon an electrophile and oxygen, the resulting nucleophile. 

The reactivity of each carbonyl compound is dependent on the group attached directly onto the alpha carbon. This is because of the resonance stabilized structures which form due to the donation of an electron by this group. The stronger the contribution of this resonance structure increases the stability of the carbonyl. An example of this can be seen in carboxylic acids which upon deprotination create a degenerate structure and thus increases the acidity of the proton. Peptide bonds are unusually strong and carry more of an SP2, planar hybridization due to the resonance contribution of the amide electron onto the alpha carbon. This decreases the reactivity of peptide bonds considerably and thus requires much energy or a protease to catalyze the bond. Carbonyls by themselves are very stable bonds and the energy of their formation are usually very high. This makes the formation of carbonyls in organic synthesis to be highly thermodynamically favorable and usually the creation of a carbonyl bond as the end product will drive a reaction to formation.

The carbonyl group has a short, strong, and very polar double bond.  Its reactivity of its double bond is very different from the double bond of the alkenes because of their oxygen's electronegativity along with the lone pair of electrons.  The carbonyl carbon is also electron withdrawing since it is so close to the highly electronegative oxygen.  The polarization of aldehydes and ketones also alters the physical constants.  The polarization of the carbonyl group is the reason why their boiling points are higher than those of the hydrocarbons of similar molecular weight.  the carbonyl group's polarity causes the smaller molecules to be completely miscible in water.  Carbonyl compounds with more than six carbons are considered large, which is insoluble in solution.  The larger the compound, the larger its hydrocarbon chain, the more hydrophobic the molecule is, so its solubility would then decrease. 

'''Inductive Effect'''
Take important notice that the electrophilicity of the carbon is highly dependent on the nearby atoms and the atoms it is directly bounded to. For example, the carbonyl carbon of a carboxylic acid will not be as electrophilic as a carbonyl carbon of a ketone because of resonance stabilization. On the other hand, acetal chloride (the carbon is bound to an R-group, doubly bonded to the oxygen, and then bound to the fluorine), will have a more electrophilic carbonyl carbon because the electronegative chlorine will increase the induced positive dipole of the carbon. Electrophilicity plays a key role in chemical reactions, and less electrophilic carbonyl carbons are not as readily reactive.

== Biochemical Synthesis of Carbonyl Groups ==

[[File:NADH phys.svg|thumbnail|right|Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide]]
Within biological systems, carbonyl compounds can be formed by the oxidation of alcohols.  An oxidation reaction in organic chemistry is one that is characterized by a process which either adds electronegative atoms or removes hydrogen from a molecule.  An example of this oxidation includes the oxidation of ethanol by the oxidizing agent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is composed of a pyridine ring, two ribose molecules, and the heterocycle adenine.  When the two enantiometers of 1-Deuterioethanol are reacted with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, in the presence of enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, the biochemical oxidation is found to be stereospecific (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and only removes the hydrogen attached to the C1 atom in 1-Deuterioethanol. &lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot; /&gt;  Similar to the oxidation of 1-Deuterioethanol described above, other alcohols can be oxidized biochemically to form carbonyl groups.  Another example includes the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. &lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot; /&gt;

== ''''HNMR''' ==

In 'HNMR spectroscopy, aldehyde compounds have a very unique chemical shift which appears to be between 9-10 ppm.  Which means that the aldehyde formyl hydrogen is also very strongly deshielded.  Aldehyde C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogens are also slightly deshielded because of the electron withdrawing from the oxygen from the carbonyl group.  In ketones, this is also similar.  The alpha-hydrogens also experience this deshielding; which has a chemical shift between 2-2.8 ppm.  


[[File:1H NMR Ethanol Coupling shown.GIF]]

----

== '''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CNMR''' ==
The carbon-13 NMR spectra for aldehydes and ketones are the same since it is of the chemical shift of the carbon participating in carbonyl group.  Since that carbon is bound to an oxygen, it will appear at a lower field approximately 200 ppm.  The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl carbon are also deshielded (just like the hydrogens in 'HNMR).  The carbons further away from the carbonyl group are less deshielded.  

=='''IR Spectroscopy'''==
The IR absorbtion bands for all carbonyl compounds absorb in the 1760-1665 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; region, which is due to the streching vibration of the C=O bond. Generally, carbonyl groups have a high intensity and narrow regions, making them useful for diagnostic purposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

A carboxyl group consist of a carbon double bonded to an oxygen and also bonded to a -OH group. Compounds with carboxyl groups are called carboxylic acids or organic acids. The carboxyl group can act as an acid when by donating a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to a solution and becoming ionized. Under biological conditions at pH~7, carboxyl groups are usually deprotonated, meaning they lose a H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,  and become negatively charged. An example of a carboxyl group in the body would be carbonic acid, formed from the hydration of a carbon dioxide. Under biological conditions, carbonic acid usually dissociates into bicarbonate ion.

[[Image:tinocarboxyl.jpg|thumb|An ester functional group]]

==Properties==

Carboxyl groups have an electronegative oxygen atom double bonded to a carbon atom. This carbon-oxygen bond is very polar and the fact that its a double bond increases the polarity of the bond. As a result of the polarity, compounds containing carboxyl groups usually have higher melting points, boiling points and have hydrophilic centers. Moreover the higher melting point and higher boiling point can be attributed to the fact that they can form hydrogen bonds both in the liquid and solid state.  [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Fatty Acids|Fatty acids]] are examples of compounds that have hydrophilic centers due to their carboxyl groups.  Also, carboxyl groups, especially when present in molecules with a low molecular weight tend to be highly volatile and therefore tend to have strong odors.  The pKa of carboxyl groups usually range from 4-5.

==Nomenclature==

In naming organic molecules with multiple functional groups, the carboxyl group takes precedence in naming over any other functional group.  Therefore when naming a molecule such as an alkane that contains a carboxyl group, the -e on the alkane is replaced by -oic acid.  Also, when numbering the chain of the organic molecule that contains a carboxyl group, the carboxy carbon is labeled as the number 1 carbon.  Molecules with two carboxyl groups would use instead the -dioic suffix.

==Bonding==

The polarity of the carbon-oxygen bond makes the carbon very susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Upon attack, the electrons of the double bond will migrate to the oxygen atom in order to maintain the octet for the carbon atom. The oxygen will now be negatively charged and a tetrahedral intermediate has been formed. The double bond will reform when the migrated electrons on the oxygen atom move back into the double bond to oxygen while the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carbonyl|carbonyl]] carbon attacked expels the -OH group as a leaving group. While the expulsion of an -OH group is energetic unfavorable, the formation of the energetically favorable carbon-oxygen double bond helps overcomes this obstacle. Other ways to overcome this obstacle is to convert the -OH group into a better leaving group. The polarity giving the oxygen a partially negative charge also makes the carboxylic acid susceptible to electrophilic attack. An example of this is the hydrolysis of a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions where a proton acts as an electrophile and attacks at the oxygen which is doubly bonded to the carbon.

==Amino Acids==

The carboxyl group is a major component of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]]. The carboxyl group, along with the amino group, allows amino acids to be zwitterions where both the amino group and the carboxyl group are charged. Since the carboxyl group can be deprotonated, it can impart a negative charge onto the amino acid. The carboxyl group is also key in the formation of peptide bonds. The carboxyl group of an amino acid can be attacked by the amino group of another amino acid. The nitrogen group of the amino group acts as the nucleophile and attacks the carbon of the carboxyl group. Carboxyl groups are also present on the side chains of two amino acids, Aspartate and Glutamate. These amino acids allow for [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]] and the formation of salt bridges, which help stabilize the structure of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]].

==From Nature==

* Fromic acid (HCOOH), the simplest carboxylic acid with only one carboxyl group, is primarily responsible for the pain caused by insects' bites(mostly Hymenoptera, like bees and ants). 
* Acetic acid (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH) can be biologically synthesized by either aerobic or anaerobic fermentation, a process used to make vinegar. The aerobic process requires warm ethanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) and oxygen with Acetobacter. The anearobic process requires only sugar(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) as input chemical, and acetogen can then give carboxylic acids as output. It should be noted that aerobic process is still dominantly applied, because acetogens used for anaerobic processes show less tolerance to acidic environments. In other words, acetogens will be killed if too much acid is produced.
* Propanoic acid (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COOH,or C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH). It can be formed by breakdown of fatty acids with odd numbers of carbon atoms. During such metabolic process, propanoic acid undergoes condensation reaction with the thiol end of CoA (coenzyme A) to form propionyl-CoA. Propanoic acid can also be synthesized by anaerobic respiration of bacteria called propionybacterium. 
* Butanoic Acid (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;COOH) can be found in some naturally occurring esters, such as hexyl butanoate from oil of Heracleum and octyl butanoate in parsnip. The fermentation (biological) method of butanoic acid production was discovered by Louis Pasteur in 1861. The overall process takes one mole of glucose and the products are one mole of butanoic acid, two moles of carbon dioxide, two moles of hygrogen gas and three moles of ATP. During such process, glucose is cleaved into two pyruvate molecules first. The pyruvate is then oxidized to acetyl CoA releasing carbon dioxide and hydrogen as by-products. The ATP is released after the acetyl CoA undergoes various enzyme reactions. 
* Benzoic acid (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH) is the main component of benzoin resin. However, it will be fairly pricey to extract benzoic acid directly from benzoin resins. Therefore most benzoic acid in the market is manufactured industrially.
* Citric acid (HOOCCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-COH(COOH)-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COOH).The simple structure is similar to glycerol, which is also a biologically abundant molecule in fat. Citric acid is a well known organic acid in variety of citrus fruit such as lemon and lime. It is the essential material for citric acid cycle, a very important metabolic process. It is also very useful for modern pharmaceutical, cosmetics and other industries that include chemical processes. The industrial production of citric acid experienced a transformation from juice extraction to biosynthesis. Industrial citric acid production began in 1890 using extractions from Italian citrus exports, following the first crystallization of citric acid by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1784. The biological methods of production was discovered in 1893 using Penicillium mold and sugar, but such process was not popular until World War I cut the Italian citrus exports. A more effecient biological production was then discovered by American food chemist James Currie by using cheap sugary mixture and mold called A. niger. Such industrial process has been used by major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer. In addition, the extracted or biologically synthesized citric acid is precipitated by calcium hydroxide for isolation and acid is converted back from precipitate at the end.
* Oxalic acid (HOOC-COOH) is found in kidney stones as calcium oxalate, and it leads to kidney failure. It is therefore risky to eat carambola (commonly known as starfruit) and monstera due to their high oxalate content. Oxalate is also included in citric acid cycle.

[[Image:Peptide Bond Mechanism.jpg|thumb|The mechanism of peptide bond formation.]]
Amino groups are composed of a N atom bonded to two H atoms. Amino groups can act as a base because they can pick up an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from a solution. Amino groups can be ionized with a 1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; charge under basic condition. Organic compounds with an amino group are called &quot;amines&quot;; organic compound containing an amino group and [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carboxyl|carboxyl]] group are called [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] which are the building blocks of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]]. 

Amines can readily form [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonds]]. The amines in the bases of [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Nucleic Acids (DNA)|DNA]] form [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonds]] with nearby nitrogen or oxygen atoms and keep the two strands together. 

The amino group of lysine[[|]], for example, has be proven useful in the regulation of genes. In particular when the amino group of Lysine in the histones is acetylated, it can no longer function as it regularly does. This is a regulating step that is involved with gene expression and replication. 

Another role amino groups play in biochemistry is in [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]]. In the case of a protease, an enzyme which cleaves amino acids, a tetrahedral transition state is formed when the hydroxy group of serine attacks the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carbonyl|carbonyl]] carbon of the amino acid. Because the tetrahedral transition state has a negative charge, the positive NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; charges help to stabilize the transition state, forming what is called an oxyanion ring. 

Amines can also act as nucleophiles because of its lone pair of electrons. This is the basis by which peptide bonds are formed, with the carbonyl carbon acting as the electrophile in a dehydration reaction.

==Structure and Physical Properties==
[[File:Inversion_of_Amine.PNG|thumb|Inversion of amine]] The amine nitrogen is sp3-hybridized and tetrahedral shape. The nitrogen non-bonded pair acts like a substituent—the geometry is tetrahedral around nitrogen and the bond angles are all around 109°. Unlike carbon, sp3 hybridized nitrogen is not rigid and undergoes rapid inversion at room temperature. It is similar to an umbrella flipping inside-out and similar to the inversion of configuration which occurs in an Sn2 reaction.

==Nomenclature==
All the usual IUPAC rules are followed. The suffix –amine is added to the name at the end and the position of the amino group must be specified. For 2° and 3° amines, the largest alkyl substituent is chosen as the parent and the other alkyl groups on nitrogen are named as substituents with the prefix N- to denote that they are attached to nitrogen. Because the amine functional group has the lowest priority in naming, it is often named as a substituent on more highly functionalized molecules. 

==Acidity of Amines==
Amines are much less acidic than alcohols with a pKa ~ 35 and Keq = 10-35. A very strong base like alkyllithium must be used to completely deprotonate an amine.

==Basicity of Amines==
Amines are the most basic of the common organic functional groups, but are still fairly weak bases. Protonation occurs on the non-bonded electron pair exclusively. The basicity of amines is directly dependent on the “electron density” at the nitrogen atom. Both inductive and resonance effects can alter the basicity of a nitrogen atom. 

Hybridization on the N also affects basicity. An increase in s character on an atom increases the electronegativity of that atom which favors acidity and therefore disfavors basicity. Hence sp3-hybridized nitrogen is more basic than either sp2 or sp hybridized nitrogen.

==Synthesis of Amines==
[[File:Gabriel_Synthesis_Scheme.png|thumb|Gabriel synthesis to 1° amines]]
1. Cyanide displacement of alkyl halides followed by reduction

2. LiAlH4 reduction of amides

[[File:Reduction-of-amide.gif|LiAlH4 reduction of amides]]

3. Displacements with azide followed by reduction

4. Gabriel synthesis to 1° amines

5. Reductive amination

[[File:Reductive_amination_acetophenone_ammonia.svg|Reductive amination]]

==IR Spectroscopy for Amines==
Primary Amines will give two short, sharp equal peaks at around 3200 cm-1 – 3500 cm-1 &lt;br /&gt;

Secondary Amines will give one short, sharp peak at around 3320 cm-1 &lt;br /&gt;

Tertiary amines will not give a peak in any region. &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Overview ==

A sulfhydryl is a  functional group consisting of a sulfur bonded to a hydrogen atom. The sulfhydryl group, also called a thiol, is indicated in chemistry nomenclature by &quot;-thiol&quot; as a suffix and &quot;mercapto-&quot; or &quot;sulfanyl&quot; as a prefix. Thiols have great affinity for soft metals. Sulfhydryls play an important role biochemistry, as disulfide bonds connect necessary [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] together for functional purpose in secondary, tertiary, or quaternary  [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] structures.

== Several Important Roles in Biochemistry ==

Sulfhydryl groups can be found in the amino acid cysteine. When two cysteine residues are in close proximity to each other, they can form a disulfide bridge also called cystine. The formation of a disulfide bond is an example of a post translational modification. It can be helpful to the structure of proteins, but it can make it difficult to accurately determine the sequence of a protein through the technique of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/Edman Sequencing|Edman Sequencing]]. Disulfide bridges often play important structural and functional roles in proteins. Their hold are crucial in the formation of many tertiary structures of proteins. Extracellular proteins usually contain disulfide bonds whereas intracellular proteins usually lack disulfide bonds. These disulfide bonds can be broken with the addition of beta mercaptoethanol. Beta mercaptoethanol reduces the disulfide bonds back into their sulfhydryl form. It was found by Christian Anfinsen that proteins denatured by beta mercaptoethanol in urea will spontaneously reform its disulfide bonds if trace amounts of beta mercaptoethanol are present. This reformed protein was found to be fully functional. If the protein was reformed in the absence of urea, it was found that the function was greatly reduced. This is due to the fact that the wrong disulfide bonds were formed and the amino acid became &quot;scrambled.&quot;

==Structure==
The C-S bond in thiols are 180 picometers in length, and the C-S-H bonds are at a 90˚ angle, similar to alcohols. Their main cohesive forces are Van Der Waals interactions, and they have lesser electronegativity than most Hydoxyl groups, making them less polar. 

==Reactions==
Thiols can be easily oxidized, and thiolates act as potent neucleophiles.
 
'''S-Alkylation'''

The conjugate bases of thiols can be alkylated to give thiolethers.
 
RSH + R'Br + base → RSR' + [Hbase]Br

'''Redox'''

Thiols, in the presence of a base, are oxidize to give an organic disulfide.

2 R–SH + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → R–S–S–R + 2 HBr 

Thiols can be oxidized by more powerful reagents such as sodium hypochlorite to yield sulfonic acids.

R–SH + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Thiols can also undergo thiol-disulfide exchange.

RS–SR + 2 R'SH → 2 RSH + R'S–SR'

Grignard reagents can react with sulfur to make thiolates.&lt;ref&gt;E. Jones and I. M. Moodie (1990), &quot;2-Thiophenethiol&quot;, Org. Synth.; Coll. Vol. 6: 979&lt;/ref&gt;

RLi + S → RSLi
RSLi + HCl → RSH + LiCl

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

[[Image:tinophosphate.jpg|250px|right]]
A phosphate group consists of a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms. It is usually ionized and attached to the carbon skeleton by one of its oxygen atoms.
Compounds with phosphate groups are called organic phosphates and they are frequently  involved in energy transfer reactions. Phosphates can also be found in the backbone of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] forming phosphodiester bonds (two esters with a common posphonyl). The negative charges on phosphates are part of the reason why the backbone of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] is on the outside. A good example of transferring energy is the three phosphate group which is found in the energy compound ATP(adenosine triphosphate).

Phosphorylation of proteins is important for several reasons. Phosphate has a charge of negative two, which is important for disrupting or forming electrostatic interactions that alter the structure and function of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]]. Phosphate is also capable of forming three hydrogen bonds[[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonds]]. The free energy of phosphorylation is large allowing it to change the equilibrium between conformational states. Phosphorylation can also take place very quickly or very slowly making it very flexible and versatile in meeting the needs of the body. Phosphorylation also results in highly amplified effects where hundreds of target proteins are phosphorylated by one activated kinase in a short time span. Phosphorylation is prevalently seen with the application of ATP, which aids in the regulation of metabolism.

==Properties==
Phosphate group is a hypervalent molecule containing five bonds which makes ten electrons. Phosphate salts can form through ionic bonds between a cation and one of the oxygen anions. Molecules with a phosphate group are usually not very soluble in water. Phosphate can exist in four different forms. In acidic conditions, it can take the form of phosphoric acid while in the more basic conditions it can be fully deprotonated to the phosphate ion. The forms phosphoric acid, dihydrogen phosphate ion, hydrogen phosphate ion, and phosphate ion all act and behave as individual weak acids. Each pK value differs greater than 4. This creates three [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]] regions of very acidic, moderately acidic to moderately basic, and very basic, depending on which deprotonation stage. These characteristics give the phosphate group a functionality of being a good [[Structural Biochemistry/Buffer|buffer]]. Polymeric ions such as pyrophosphate and metaphosphates can be formed. When a pyrophosphate binds to a calcium ion, calcium phosphate is formed. Calcium phosphate is and important component to the strength and solidity of animal teeth and bones. The exoskeleton of crustaceans and insects contain calcium phosphate as well.

==Phosphate Applications==
Phosphate can be used chemically as polish metal alloys. Phosphoric acid polishers work by reacting with various metal ions and generating hydrogen gas thus releasing some of the metal ions. By doing so, the metal is &quot;phosphatized&quot; with a phosphate coating that prevents corrosion and increases paint adhesion. This also plays a role in producing and maintaining a system of drinkable water because water usually runs through pipes and other water distribution sources that can easily erode. Because phosphate acts as a good buffer, it ensures that the pH of drinking water is stable and resists dramatic changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the &quot;impulse response&quot; section it says h(t) = y(t)/x(t).  This is wrong.  The relationship between h(t), y(t), and x(t) is shown lower below as y(t) = the convolution of h(t) and x(t).

See, in the laplace domain convolution becomes multiplication, and that's why Y(s) = H(s)*X(s) =&gt; H(s) = Y(s)/X(s).  Again, to say h(t) = y(t)/x(t) is inaccurate.

Just wanted to let someone know who can hopefully edit this page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Chymotrypsin, a [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases|protease]], is an enzyme that cleaves the carbonyl side of certain peptide bonds primarily by covalent catalysis. In this mechanism, a nucleophile becomes covalently attached to a substrate in a transition state with an acyl-enzyme. The protease cleaves proteins by a hydrolysis reaction, an addition of a water molecule. The double bond between the carbon and nitrogen strengthens its bond. Chymotrypsin is site specific and will only cleave the carboxyl side of large hydrophobic or aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine (Phe), methionine (Met), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp), unless the next amino acid is proline (Pro). The reason why chymotrypsin prefers to cleave specifically to bulky hydrophobic amino acids is due to the formation of [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Catalytic Triad and S1 Pocket|S1 pockets]],which, in the case of chymotrypsin, is lined with relatively hydrophobic residues such as Ser-189, Ser-214, Trp-215, Gly-216, and Gly-226. Chymotrypsin catalyzes the reaction rate by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. The reaction has two steps, an acylation phase and a deacylation phase. In the former phase, the peptide bond is cleaved and an ester is formed between substrate and enzyme. In the latter phase, this ester is hydrolyzed and the enzyme is regenerated.

[[Image:Jacylenzyme.gif]]

This illustrates the covalent catalysis of chymotrypsin. The first step is the acylation, which forms the acyl-enzyme intermediate. Then the acyl-enzyme intermediate goes through deacylation converting back to its original free enzyme form.

==Evidence of Mechanism==
Because chymotrypsin can also catalyze the hydrolysis of esters and amides, p-nitrophenolacetate was used in conjunction with chymotrypsin. The reaction with p-nitrophenolacetate will yield p-nitrophenol, a chromic-effector with a yellow color change in the product. The absorbency can be determined from the color and the intensity can determine the amount of product. Hartley and Kilby used this information in 1954 to show that the reaction proceeds in two phases: a Burst Phase and then levels off to a steady-state phase. Thus, there is a formation of a covalently bound enzyme substrate intermediate. 

[[Image:Chromogenicsubstrate.png|frame|N-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl ester yields a yellow product, p-Nitrophenolate, on cleavage by chymotrypsin.]]

Another test to determine the mechanism of chymotrypsin hydrolysis was to treat the protease with an organofluorophosphate, diisopropylphosphofluoridate (DIPF). In this reaction, chymotrypsin loses all activity and becomes inactivated. Since only serine-195 was modified by diisopropylphosphofluoridate, it indicates that Serine-195 plays the crucial role in the mechanism as a nucleophile. It is covalently linked to Serine-195. 
Covalent catalysis of chymotrypsin basically goes through acylation and deacylation. Acylation forms the acyl enzyme intermediate and the deacylation adds water which produces a free enzyme. 

Site-directed mutagenesis is another technique that can test the reaction by creating a mutant in the amino acid sequence of the active site of the enzyme.  It supported the mechanism below by demonstrating that the replacement through site directed mutagenesis of any one member of the catalytic triad had a devastating effect on reaction rate.  In fact, replacing just one of the triad had the same effect as replacing all three--demonstrating that each component is vital for efficient catalysis. While the enzyme continued to bind to the substrate (we know this because the K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; remained constant throughout the replacements--it required the same substrate concentration to achieve half of the maximum rate), the reaction rate was orders of magnitude smaller without the triad.

==Structure of Chymotrypsin==
The primary structure shows that disulfide bonds are the crucial role to the protein folding. The protein is spherical and itself consists of three polypeptide chains. There is also a pocket in the protein which is known as the active site. The active site includes Ser-195, His-57, and Asp-102 (the catalytic triad). Ser-195 is hydrogen bonded to the His-57 and it in turn is hydrogen bonded to the Asp-102 residue. The His-57 role is to position the serine residue and polarize the hydroxyl group so it can be deprotonated to the alkoxide ion. In the presence of the substrate, this accepts a proton by acting as a base. Asp-102 orients the His-57 and stabilizes it through hydrogen bonding and electrostatics.

==Mechanism== 
'''&lt;u&gt;Step 1:&lt;/u&gt;''' When substrate (polypeptide) binds, the side of chain of the residue next to the peptide bond to be cleaved nestles in a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme, positioning the peptide bond for attack. Histidine extracts one proton from serine to form an alkoxide ion. This serine ion reacts with the substrate.

'''&lt;u&gt;Step 2&lt;/u&gt;:''' In chymotrypsin, the carboxylate R-group of Asp102 forms a hydrogen bond with R group of His 57. When this happens, it compresses this hydrogen bond and shifts electron density to the other nitrogen atom (not involved in the H-bond) in the R-goup of His57 becomes a very strong base. This allows His 57 to deprotonate Ser195 and turn it into a strong nucleophile that can attack the substrate. 
[[Image:Oxyanion hole.png|thumb|Oxyanion hole stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate.  It is formed by hydrogen bonds linking peptide NH groups to the negatively charged oxygen atom.]] Oxygen develops a partially negative charge in the oxyanion hole.
'''&lt;u&gt;Step 3&lt;/u&gt;:''' Instability of the negative charge on the substrate carbonyl oxygen when will leads to collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate, re-formation of a double bond with carbon which breaks the peptide bond between the carbon and amino acid group. The amino leaving group is protonated by His57, facilitating its displacement.  Once the oxyanion hole stabilizes the negative charge, the bond breaks because the proton from Histidine is binding to nitrogen to make it less likely to carbon. The leaving group is stabilized and the acyl-enzyme is formed.

'''&lt;u&gt;Step 4&lt;/u&gt;''': The amine component is departed from the enzyme (metabolized by the body) and binds to serine. This completes the first stage (acylation of enzyme). The first product has been made.

'''&lt;u&gt;Step 5&lt;/u&gt;''': A water molecule is added where the N terminus was. Histidine deprotonates the water to form a hyrdoxy group. This hydroxy group attaches to carbon from the carboxy side and destabilizes the acyl intermediate. The bond is broken.

'''&lt;u&gt;Step 6&lt;/u&gt;''': An incoming water molecule is deprotonated by acid-base catalysis, generating a strongly nucleophilic hydroxide ion. Attack of hydroxide on the ester linkage of the acylenzyme generates a second tetrahedral intermediate.

'''&lt;u&gt;Step 7&lt;/u&gt;''': collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate form the second product, a carboxylate anion, and displace Ser195. The proton from Histidine goes back to Serine. 

'''&lt;u&gt;Step 8&lt;/u&gt;''': The carboxylic acid is released and the enzyme is reformed to catalyze the next reaction with the original active site.

==1. Give the history and development of model railroading. ==
===Practical Beginnings===
The development of model railroading runs, for the most part, parallel to the development of real-life (or 'prototype') railroading.  The first model railroads appeared after 1810 and were one-of-a-kind creations used in designing or promoting their full-sized counterparts.  Railroading was first developed to reduce the time and effort required to move raw materials or people over short distances made otherwise difficult by bad weather and poor roadways.   The first rail cars were pulled along by animals, while steam-propelled machines, whether trains or automobiles, followed as quickly as the public was ready to adopt them.  Various authors from diverse countries each lay different claims to the origins of both railroading and model railroading; and for this reason it is nearly impossible to reckon the precise date and location of the first model trains.  By the 1830's, however, several countries including Germany, France, England and the United States were each developing steam-driven railroads to move freight and passengers.  Original models of these first railroads are still on display in museums, and the first toy trains appeared not long after in German and British catalogs of the 1860's.

===On the Right Track===
The first toy trains of the 1840's actually ran on steam produced by filling the metallic model with water and placing in on a heating surface.  These '[[w:Carpet_railway|carpet railways]]' didn't use track and often left a trail of water behind them.  In 1891, the German company ''Märklin'' began offering a track system for its wind-up, or &quot;clockwork,&quot; trains which were moving along on their own electric power within the decade.  The famous American toy train manufacturer, ''Lionel,'' began selling its first sectional three-rail electric train track (later called &quot;Standard Gauge&quot;) in 1906, just five years after their first store window display called the &quot;Electric Express&quot; captured public attention.  By 1910, the British company ''Bassett-Lowke'' had opened a London showroom exclusively for its model trains.  Other early toy train producers from around the world were ''Lima, Bing, Fleischmann'' and ''Rivarossi.''

===The World's Greatest Hobby===
Today, dozens of manufacturers from around the world sell their model railroading products via thousands of catalogs, magazines, websites and hobby stores.  Model railroading has many fascinating aspects to attract people with many different interests and skill sets.  Some modelers continue to make many things, even engines track and cars, from scratch, while a satisfying railroading experience can be gained from many ready-made sets available right out of the box.  Called by many [http://www.greatesthobby.com 'The World's Greatest Hobby'], model railroading will doubtless continue to be a source of great enjoyment for many years to come.

==2. Tell the difference in how the following prototype motive power units operate:== 
===a. Steam ===
[[File:Walschaerts motion.gif|thumb|200px|Steam Locomotion]]
Steam powered locomotives use burning coal or wood to heat water enclosed in a large boiler.  The steam released from this boiler acts much like the steam that emanates from a kettle of boiling water on the stove.  By channeling the steam’s pressure into an engine cylinder, it pushes a piston that provides mechanical power to the wheels.  Steam locomotives dominated rail transport until the mid-1900’s when diesel and electric locomotives took over.  Steam locomotives had to stop periodically to receive a new supply of water plus logs or coal.
{{clear}}

===b. Diesel ===
[[File:Three-loco-styles.jpg|thumb|200px|Three Diesel Locomotives]]
Diesel locomotives burn diesel fuel in a combustion engine in virtually the same way as in the cars we use every day.  The main difference between various types of diesel locomotives relates to how the power from its diesel engine is transferred to its drive wheels.  Diesel locomotives were a great improvement over the steam locomotives in that they are quieter, cleaner, easier to maintain, and they can be started and stopped quickly, without the delay of waiting for water to boil.  In mild weather, diesel engines don’t need to be left running to be ready to use at a moment’s notice, and diesel locomotives require far fewer people to operate them.  Diesel locomotives continue to be used today.
{{clear}}

===c. Electric ===
[[File:NECtrain3967.jpg|thumb|200px|An Electric Locomotive]]
Electric locomotives get power to turn their wheels from electric motors housed inside.  Most such locomotives receive their electrical power from overhead wires or an additional rail running alongside the rails used by the wheels.  Some electric locomotives employ onboard batteries to drive them.  Electricity became the preferred way of driving trains that had to travel underground or through frequent tunnels because they produce no exhaust as diesel or gasoline engines do.   Another advantage is that they are virtually silent when operating and are easier to maintain because they utilize fewer moving parts than mechanical combustion engines.
{{clear}}

==3. Know the name, scale, and track gauge for four model railroad gauges.==
The six most popular scales used are: G scale, Gauge 1, O scale, H0 scale (in Britain, the similarly sized 00 is used), TT scale, and N scale (1:160), although there is growing interest in Z scale. H0 scale is the single most popular scale of model railroad. Popular narrow-gauge scales include HOn3 Scale and Nn3, which are the same scale as HO and N, except with a narrower spacing between the tracks (in these examples, a scale three feet instead of the 4'8.5&quot; standard gauge).

The words scale and gauge seem at first to be used interchangeably in model railways, but their meanings are different. Scale is the model's measurement as a proportion to the original, while gauge is the measurement between the two running rails of the track.

==4. Know the shapes and names of at least eight track plan arrangements.==
==='''Oval'''===
[[File:Model Railroad Oval Track.gif|thumb|200px|Oval Layout Design]]
The simplest layout for a model railroad and the starting point for most designs.  In this design, two straightaway segments are connected by a semi-circle at each end. This is also the only layout which can easily be created with sectional track without the use of a manufacturer-specific design.  Curved sectional track is sold by radii (half the distance across the semi-circle) and a box of such track sections will almost always create exactly half a circle.  The two straightaway sections will usually utilize multiple pieces of sectional straight track, as desired by the modeler.
{{clear}}
==='''Figure-Eight'''===
[[File:Model Railroad Figure-Eight Track.gif|thumb|200px|Figure-Eight Layout Design]]
The second most common beginner's layout.  This layout is best accomplished by purchasing it as a single set or following a manufacturer's layout design using their sectional track.  The intersection in the center of the layout can either be accomplished by a piece of crossover track, or by elevating one track over the other.  In the latter case, a set of piers or risers will be needed to raise the track at an appropriate rate.
{{clear}}
==='''Twice-Around'''===
[[File:Model Railroad Twice-Around Track.gif|thumb|200px|Twice-Around Layout Design]]
A modification of the figure-eight, in which one end-loop is contained within the other.  The crossover here is not at 90° like in the basic figure-eight example and can be accomplished by using a alternately angled crossover piece or by using elevated track to pass one track over the other.  The twice-around layout design allows the train to run continuously for longer than the simple oval before reaching its starting point.
{{clear}}
==='''Point-to-Point'''===
[[File:Model Railroad Point-to-Point Track.gif|thumb|200px|Point-to-Point Layout Design]]
This design does not allow a train to run continuously indefinitely, as you might imagine most plans would allow.  However, this is the design that most closely resembles real-life railroad operation, since real-life railroads run across country, not in loops or circles.  You can construct more elaborate yards at each end in order to enjoy the complexities of real-world operation.
{{clear}}
==='''Out-and-Back'''===
[[File:Model Railroad Out-and-Back Track.gif|thumb|200px|Out-and-Back Layout Design]]
This design approximates real-world operation, as each train must make a journey before it returns to the yard from which it originated.  Although real freight never returns to its origin the same way it left, this arrangement does allows you to concentrate your time and resources on one yard instead of  the two required in a Point-to-Point design (above).
{{clear}}
==='''Loop-to-Loop'''===
[[File:Model Railroad Loop-to-Loop Track.gif|thumb|200px|Loop-to-Loop Layout Design]]
This design diverges from realistic operation, but does allow the operator to interact with a continuous-running train.  A yard can be added in the middle of the layout to simulate freight coming in from each direction.  When modeling with two-rail scales, such as HO and smaller, special wiring will be required to insulate each loop from the rest of the line and allow the direction to be reversed on the mainline.
{{clear}}
==='''Dog Bone'''===
[[File:Model Railroad Dog-Bone Track.gif|thumb|200px|Dog-Bone Layout Design]]
This design is similar to the loop-to-loop design, but allows for continuous running without intervention from an operator.  In addition, the two tracks running side-by-side simulate the double-track lines often seen in real life.
{{clear}}
==='''Twisted Dog Bone'''===
[[File:Model Railroad Twisted-Dog-Bone Track.gif|thumb|200px|Twisted-Dog-Bone Layout Design]]
This design is adds additional length to the mainline featured in the basic dog-bone design (above).  Keeping one or both of the end-loops out of sight allows this layout to very realistically simulate the long distance running of a real railroad. 
{{clear}}

==5. Know at least six points to check for the maintenance of a model railroading layout. ==
===Cleaning &amp; Checking Basic Trackwork===
Most model railroads receive power for their electric motors through the tracks they run on.  Thus, track must be kept clean and free of even the smallest obstructions.  A train running on a dirty track does not operate smoothly or realistically, or may not run at all!  The space between rails must also be maintained, though this is more of an issue when individual rails and ties have been laid down by hand.  Sectional track usually maintains its proper gauge (space between the rails). Rail cleaning solution can be safely wiped across model track and track-cleaning cars are also available for running around the layout and cleaning hard-to-reach places.
===Checking Wheels and Couplers===
Locomotives and cars are kept rolling along together by various types of 'couplers.' These can be very tiny on the smaller model railroad scales, but in any case, they must be kept clean and properly hooked together for a train to run along smoothly.  Another common problem is derailment when a car's wheels come off the track.  This can also be harder to detect on smaller scale trains, but it will eventually get noticed as cars may tip completely off the track.  Nevertheless, derailment is the most common operating problem encountered and should be one of the first possibility to check when things are going wrong.
===Lubricating Engine Drive Mechanisms===
Most model locomotives are powered by electric motors which involve a minimum of moving parts.  There are typically tiny gears used in transferring the turning motor's power to the drive wheels of the locomotive.  These are easily lubricated with special grease and/or oil available from a hobby supply store.  Be careful to follow both the engine and lubricant manufacturers' instructions.  Most wheels on other non-powered cars do not need to be oiled or greased except in rare cases.
===Detailing Scenes &amp; Structures===
Model structures and landscape gather dust, making them look less realistic.  These elements of a typical layout should be well anchored with adhesive when they are first installed so that their surfaces can be brushed clean, repainted, re-weathered and even vacuumed.  In addition, its fun and rewarding to keep a layout fresh by installing new structures or creating new track-side scenes once your basic modeling is complete.
===Testing Electrical Connections===
Most model locomotives receive their power from the tracks below through one or more of their wheel sets.  Since these wheels are turning, they transmit their power through stationary metal brushes that maintain contact with the tiny axle running between these wheels.  These brushes should be kept clean and checked whenever an electrical problem is suspected.  In addition, the wires which run from the operator's power pack to the rails themselves can become tangled, shorted out (when they inadvertently touch each other), or disconnected all leading to potential breakdown in the power supplied to the model railroad.  A simple electric meter available from a hobby or electronics store can help determine where a breakdown is occurring by testing (1) the output of the power pack directly, (2) the presence of power on the set of tracks where the train is located, or (3) at any control point in between, such as when a control panel switch is used to control power to different track sections.
===Adjusting Turnouts, Switch Machines &amp; Ground Throws===
Turnouts (sometimes called 'switches') are used to send a train from one set of track to another.  These are easy places for trains to become derailed because the wheels must pass over a series of changeable mechanical parts that are more complex than the simple two (or three) rails used elsewhere in the layout.  The 'points' of a switch are moved between two different resting positions which determine what path the trail will take after it passes through the turnout.  These points must rest securely against either the inside or outside rail and must not move otherwise.  If the points are moved remotely, by an electrical signal sent from the control panel to a 'switch machine' next to the turnout, then this switch machine and its associated wiring must be in good working order.  If the switch is operated by hand using a small lever or 'ground throw' next to the turnout, then the ground throw needs to be kept clean and lubricated and able to move the points the full distance between their two desired positions.
==6. Identify and explain the use of: ==
===a. Five types of freight cars ===
==== Covered Hopper ====
[[Image:6619.JPG|thumb|200px|Covered hopper]]
Structurally, a covered hopper is very similar to an open­top hopper car. What distinguishes this type of car from an open hopper is the car's roof, and also the car's overall size. Covered hoppers typically carry loads of less dense, and therefore lighter, materials, so they are built to a higher cubic capacity than open top hoppers. 
{{clear}}

====Box Car====
[[Image:CIL 1620 20050710 IN Linden.jpg|thumb|200px|Box car]]
A boxcar (the American term; the British call this kind of car a &quot;goods van&quot; while in Australia, they are usually referred to as &quot;louvre vans&quot;) is a railroad car that is enclosed and generally used to carry general freight. The boxcar, while not the simplest freight car design, is probably the most versatile, since it can carry most loads. Boxcars have side doors of varying size and operation, and some include end doors and adjustable bulkheads to load very large items.
{{clear}}

====Container Car====
[[Image:Containerzug 100 7207.jpg|thumb|200px|Container cars]]
''Containerization'' is a system of intermodal freight transport cargo transport using standard ISO containers known as ''shipping containers'' that can be loaded and sealed intact onto container ships, railroad cars, planes, and trucks.  The introduction of containers resulted in vast improvements in port handling efficiency, thus lowering costs and helping lower freight charges and, in turn, boosting trade flows. Almost every manufactured product humans consume spends some time in a container.

====Flat car====
[[Image:JNR type tora70000 flatcar.jpg|thumb|200px|Flat car]]
A flatcar (also flat car) is a piece of railroad rolling stock that consists of an open, flat deck on four or six wheels or a pair of trucks (US) or bogies (UK). The deck of the car can be wood or steel, and the sides of the deck can include pockets for stakes or tie-down points to secure loads. Flatcars designed for carrying machinery have sliding chain assemblies recessed in the deck.  Flatcars are used for loads that are too large or cumbersome to load in enclosed cars such as boxcars. They are also often used to transport containers or trailers in intermodal shipping.

====Gondola====
[[Image:PhosphateGon.JPG|thumb|200px|Gondola car]]
A gondola is an open-top type of rolling stock that is used for carrying loose bulk materials. Because of its low side walls, gondolas are used to carry either very dense material, such as steel plates or coils, or bulky items such as prefabricated pieces of rail track.

A refrigerator car (or &quot;reefer&quot;) is a refrigerated boxcar, a piece of railroad rolling stock designed to carry perishable freight at specific temperatures. Refrigerator cars differ from simple insulated boxcars and ventilated boxcars (commonly used for transporting fruit), neither of which are fitted with cooling apparatus. Reefers can be ice-cooled, come equipped with any one of a variety of mechanical refrigeration systems, or util

====Stock Car====
In railroad terminology, a stock car is a type of rolling stock used for carrying livestock (not carcasses) to market. A traditional stock car resembles a boxcar with slats missing in the car's side (and sometimes end) for the purpose of providing ventilation; stock cars can be single-level for large animals such as cattle or horses, or they can have two or three levels for smaller animals such as sheep, pigs, and poultry.

====Tank Car====
[[Image:TILX290344.JPG|thumb|200px|Tank car]]
A tank car is a type of railroad rolling stock designed to transport liquid and gaseous commodities. Outside of North America, they are also known as tank wagons or tanker wagons.

===b. Three types of passenger cars ===
====Coach Cars====
[[File:UICX Rome.jpg|thumb|200px|A coach car in Rome]]
The most basic passenger car, the coach car is lined with rows of seats like a bus.  In some cases, a set of seats will face each other making it possible for passengers to pass the time in conversation.  Passengers with carry-on baggage usually find overhead or under-seat storage available.  In large, metropolitan areas, many people ride on the coach cars of their commuter trains every day to get to and from work.  Some coach cars have seating on two levels which doubles their capacity to transport passengers.

====Dining Cars====
[[File:Buffet dining car SBB.jpg|thumb|200px|A Swiss dining car modeled by Roco]]
A dining car serves food to its passengers. Its like a long, narrow restaurant on wheels.  The rail line must employ extra personnel to prepare food and wait on the passengers.  A more limited version of the dining car is the &quot;lounge&quot; car, which serves only refreshments and can provide passengers with larger, more comfortable seats rather than tables to sit at.
{{clear}}

====Observation Cars====
[[File:VIA Passenger Train.jpg|thumb|200px|A Canadian observation car]]
The observation car is almost always the last car in a passenger train in order to take advantage of the view from the rear of the train.  It might have other features that provide sleeping, refreshments or food, but it almost always has larger windows around the car and a U-shaped lounge at the end where passengers can see the view where the train has just traversed.  Observation cars modeled on older era railroads might have a small open-air porch off the rear of the last car.
{{clear}}

====Sleeping Cars====
[[File:Type T2 sleeping car.jpg|thumb|200px|A model sleeping car by Rivarossi]]
&quot;Sleepers&quot; are sometimes called &quot;Pullman cars&quot; in the United States because of the Pullman Company that manufactured a great deal of them beginning in the mid-1800's.  Some beds are designed to either roll or fold out of the way or convert into seats for daytime use, while some sleeping compartments look like small personal apartments with their own bathrooms.

===c. Three types of steam engines according to their wheel arrangement ===
[[File:Alco 2-6-6 NYC.jpg|thumb|200px|A New York 2-6-6 Locomotive]]
[[File:Central Sucre 2-4-0.jpg|thumb|200px|A Central Sucre 2-4-0 Locomotive]]
[[File:92220 Evening Star (Dave Cooper).jpg|thumb|200px|Standard Class 9F 2-10-0 Locomotive]]
Steam locomotives are described most commonly by how many wheels they have in each of three sections.  The most notable set of wheels are the drive wheels which are usually larger and are connected by the rods which power them.  The other two sets of wheels are both smaller and lie ahead of and behind the central drive wheels.  Since there are at most three sets of wheels, a locomotive classification will have three numbers separated by dashes.  If a locomotive has only drive wheels, the first and last numbers will still appear, but will both be zero.  This classification system counts each wheel separately, so when looking at the side of a locomotive, remember to multiply what you see by two.

Pictured to the right are a 2-6-6, a 2-4-0, and a 2-10-0.

===d. Two types of grade crossing warning devices ===
====Uncontrolled Crossings ====
[[File:American Crossbuck.jpg|thumb|150px|The American Crossbuck]]
&quot;Open&quot; or &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; crossings utilize a sign with or without flashing lights and an audible bell warning.  These are considered 'open' because there is no barricade to the passage of pedestrians or traffic.  In America, the 'crossbuck' is most typically seen at graded crossings.  This is the familiar white &quot;X&quot; shape with the words &quot;RAILROAD&quot; and &quot;CROSSING&quot; printed on them.
{{clear}}

====Controlled Crossings ====
[[File:Finnish level crossing activated.jpg|thumb|150px|Gated Crossing in Finland]]
The most typical method of controlling a railroad crossing is with automatic close-able gates.  In addition to flashing lights and warning bell, the gates make it difficult for cars or pedestrians to cross the tracks when they are down.  Gated crossings have become more elaborate in recent years because accidents can still occur if cars try to drive around the gates.
{{clear}}

===e. Two types of railroad signals ===
====Mechanical Semaphore Signals ====
[[File:Lower Signal 1.jpg|thumb|100px|Mechanical Semaphore Signal]]
Mechanical semaphores utilize a moveable arm (or 'blade') whose position indicates how approaching trains may proceed.  A set of differently colored lenses are also mounted on the arm, each passing in front of a stationary light when the arm moves, so that the semaphore can effectively signal trains at night.

====Colored Light Signals ====
[[File:Railroad lamp-2.jpg|thumb|100px|Colored Light Signal]]
These signals control train movements by displaying one of several colors of lights.  They can also position the lights differently in order to send additional information to the engineer.

===f. Five types of railroad-related buildings or structures ===
Besides track, locomotives and cars, a realistic model railroad will probably have several structures as part of the layout, such as:

==7. Know the meaning of the following model railroad terms:== 
;a. Ballast: Rock or gravel poured between railroad ties to secure them in place and stabilize the track.
;b. Blind drivers: Driving wheels on a steam locomotive with a large number of wheel sets.  These were driving wheels without the usual flanges, allowing a larger number of wheels to negotiate a turn without binding up against the rails.
;c. Block:  A section of model track which is electrically insulated from its surrounding sections so that engines on it can be controlled independent of trains on other engines.
;d. Bolster:  A beam that transfers the weight of a railcar to its truck.
;e. Crossing: A place where pedestrian or automobile traffic crosses the railroad.
;f. Crossover:   A place where two railroad tracks cross each other.
;g. Double header:  The use of two locomotives to pull an especially long and heavy train.
;h. Draft gear:  Part of a railcar's coupling system which allows for some flexing in the tension between cars.
;i. Flange:  The larger, flat part of a trains wheels that descend below the track's top surface on the inside edge, thus holding the car on the track as it moves.
;j. Frog:  At the center of a turnout, it is the small X-shaped piece of track that enables a train's wheels to cross over the inside rail.
;k. Gap: A space between rails so that they are electrically insulated from one another.  This is done so that the two rails do not short together, or so they can be on different circuits.
;l. Gauge:  Sometimes used to describe the size of track and cars used on a certain model railroad, it more accurately measures the space between the rails of that railroad's track.
;m. Grade: A measurement of the steepness of the track when it is not flat or level with the ground.  It is measured in degrees according to its angle from level ground.
;n. Gravity yard: A place for storing, sorting or processing train cars which uses track set at an angle with the ground in order to let gravity move cars when needed.
;o. Hot box: A wheel bearing that has become excessively hot because of friction.
;p. Insulated rail joiner:  A non-conducting clip, usually made of plastic, that allows two pieces of track to be connected physically while remaining independent electronically.  Used between distinct ''blocks'' of track.
;q. Journal: A bearing in which the shaft between two wheels rotates against the car's truck with the help of lubrication supplied within a journal box, often seen on a train car's trucks.   
; r. Layout: An arrangement of model railroad track, structures and scenery that models real-life railroad operation in a contained area. 
; s. Mainline: The route a train takes from one destination to another, independent of track used in yards, sidings or spurs.
;t. Prototype:  The real-life railroad operation and equipment upon which a model railroad is based.
;u. Rail joiner:  A metallic clip placed on the bottom flange at the end of a section of track allowing it to be connected both physically and electrically to the next piece of track on the line.
;v. Reverse loop: A length of track which, by use of one or more turnouts, returns a train to its originating position facing the opposite way from which it left.
;w. Siding:  A section of track that runs parallel to the mainline and allows a train to stop and be passed by another train occupying the same mainline.
;x. Spur:  A dead-end piece of track which accepts cars to be delivered from the mainline or prepared for shipment to another destination via the mainline.
;y. Switch: Something which routes power or trains between two or more options.  When routing trains, it is best to use 'turnout' to distinguish the track mechanism from the electronic toggle switch that activates it from the layout's control panel.
;z. Machine: Refers in model railroading to the small mechanism attached to a turnout which allows it to be operated by remote-control from the layout's control panel.
;aa. Talgo truck:  A model railroad truck with its own attached coupler. Although Talgo trucks permit model trains to operate on smaller radius curves, they can be more likely to derail when trains are pushed, rather than pulled.
;bb. Truck:  A single, solid piece of hardware mounted to the bottom of a railroad car or locomotive to which is attached on or more sets of wheels.  On train cars, trucks usually contain two sets of wheels and can swivel beneath the car when the train is navigating a turn.
;cc. Turnout: A mechanism for allowing a train to leave one set of tracks and join another.  Sometimes called a 'switch.'
;dd. Two-rail: A standard of model railroading which does not employ a separate (third) rail for power.  Layouts using two-rail modeling systems must employ special wiring when a wye or reverse loop exists within the layout's design.
;ee. Wye: A triangle-shaped junction of two railroad lines in which one line joins another with the option of going either direction on the second line.
;ff. Yswitch:  A turnout in which both branches leave the turnout at a different angle from the original line.  Most turnouts have one straight-through line and a ''single'' branch that leaves the line in a different direction.
;gg. Yard:  A set of tracks which branch off of the mainline and allow train cars to be sorted, reordered or stored while they are en route to their destination.

==8. Construct a portion of a model railroad layout. In your construction, do the following: &lt;br&gt; a. Assist in assembling the framework &lt;br&gt; b. Install a section of ballast &lt;br&gt; c. Install a section of track &lt;br&gt; d. Install at least one turnout, including the wiring &lt;br&gt; e. Assist in making scenery, such as trees, rocks, mountains, or grass &lt;br&gt; f. Make one model railroading building or structure &lt;br&gt; g. Assist in the wiring to supply electrical power to the tracks ==
You can do this on your own, or as part of a club (either a group of Pathfinders earning the honor together, or as part of a model railroading club).  Because there are a lot of requirements to meet here, it would be a good idea to make a checklist so you can be sure you have met each.

==9. Successfully operate a model railroad train on the layout you have assisted in building. ==
Once you have built (or have helped build) a model set, how can you pass up the opportunity to operate it?  In reality, the set will be operated several times during construction to test each new addition.  If possible, why not transport the setup to your church for Pathfinder Sabbath?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nucleoside Monophosphate (NMP) Kinases are enzymes that aid in transferring the phosphoryl group at the end of a nucleoside triphosphate to the phosphoryl group that is on a nucleoside monophosphate. The challenge for NMP kinases is to promote the transfer of the phosphoryl group from NTP to NMP without promotoing the competing reaction - the transfer of a phosphoryl group from NTP to water; that is NTP hydrolysis. NMP kinases are known to have P-Loop Structures.

[[Image:Nucleoside Monophosphate.png]]

== Function ==
Nucleoside monophosphate kinase catalyzes the reaction of ATP and NMP to yield ADP and nucleoside diphosphate (NDP). Other groups such as sugars and single-carbon groups can be substituted in this reaction instead of the phosphoryl group. One setback that may arise during this interconversion is trying not to allow the phosphoryl group from NTP to transfer to water. This can also be known as NTP hydrolysis. However, the ability of the enzyme to undergo induced fit—changing the structure in order to bind to a substrate—allows this reaction to occur successfully and bind to nucleotides instead of water. Therefore, NMP kinases is an example of catalysis by approximation. NMP kinases can exist in two forms: (1) free, or (2) bounded to substrates. NMP kinases are homologous proteins that have a conserved NTP-binding domain. This domain consists of a central beta sheet surrounded on both sides by alpha helices. NMP kinases are considered to be in P-loops because there is a loop between the first helix and the first beta strand, often in the animo sequence of X-X-X-X-Gly-Lys. The P-loop is called so because it is known to react with the beta phosphoryl group attached on the nucleotide. 

Magnesium or complexes of NTP's are the true substrates for this reaction. The enzymes are essentially inactive in the absence of divalent metal ions such as the ones mentioned above. Nucleotides such as ATP bind these ions and ti is the metal ion-nucleotide complex that is the true subsrate for the enzymes. How does binding of a Mg or Mn ion to the nucleotide enhance catalysis? The interaction between the magnesium ion and the phosphoryl group oxygen atoms hold the nuleotide in a well-defined conformation that can be bound by an enzyme in a specific way. Magnesium ions are usually coordinated to six group in an octahedral arrangement.  Typically, two oxygen atoms are directly corrdinated to a magnesium ion, with the remaining four positions often occupied by water molecules. Oxygen atoms of the alpha and beta, or the beta and gama, or alpha and gama phosphoryl groups may contribute, depending on the particular enzyme. Thus the magnesium ion provides additional points of interaction between the ATP-magnesium ion complex and the enzyme, increasing the binding energy.  

ATP binding induces large conformational changes. For instance in the case of adenylate kinase the presence of the ATP substrate induces large structural changes in the kinase. This interaction caused the p-loop to be brought down onto the ATP to in order to interact with the beta phosphoryl group.The movement of the P-loop brings down the top domain of the enzyme to form a lid over the bound nucleotide. The ATP is held in position by the lid with the gama phorsphoryl group positioned next to the binding site for the second substrate NMP. The binding of NMP induces additional confomational changes. Both sets of changes ensure that a catalytically competent confomration is formed only when both the donor and the acceptor are bound, oreventing wasteful transfer of the phosphoryl group to water. 

Another feature of NMP kinases, is that it interacts with the ATP substrate only after it forms a complex. ATP forms a complex with either a magnesium or manganese ion which provides more points for the substrate and enzyme to interact thus increasing the binding energy. There are isomeric forms to the metal ion-nucleotide complex depending on the interaction between the metal ion and the oxygen atoms attached to the phosphoryl groups.

[[Image:isomericcomplex.png|frame|These are examples of two isomeric forms of the ATP-Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex. Red P = alpha phosphyl group, green P = beta phosphyl group, and blue P = gamma phosphyl group.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Makefile==
A makefile is used to quickly and easily compile our program when we are not using an IDE automating it. To create a makefile we just create a new file with no extension and give it the name &quot;Makefile&quot;. We can then edit it in any simple text editor. To compile a program using a makefile we simply go to the folder using the command line (using &quot;cd&quot;), and type &quot;make&quot;. The command line will tell you whether everything worked fine, or if there are errors to fix. Let's look at an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
TARGET = hello_world
OBJS   = main.o myLibrary.o

INCDIR   =
CFLAGS   = -G0 -Wall -O2
CXXFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti
ASFLAGS  = $(CFLAGS)

LIBDIR  =
LDFLAGS =
LIBS    = -lm

BUILD_PRX = 1 

EXTRA_TARGETS   = EBOOT.PBP
PSP_EBOOT_TITLE = Hello World
PSP_EBOOT_ICON= ICON0.png
PSP_EBOOT_PIC1= PIC1.png
PSP_EBOOT_SND0= SND0.at3

PSPSDK=$(shell psp-config --pspsdk-path)
include $(PSPSDK)/lib/build.mak 
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, it's not that scary looking. Most of these parameters you won't even have to touch. The &quot;target&quot; tells the compiler the name of our source file, and &quot;objs&quot; to create a &quot;main.o&quot; and &quot;myLibrary.o&quot; as we are using &quot;main.c&quot; as the file where we program the code and “myLibrary.c” as a helper class. For now will not talk about the next four lines, just understand that we need them unchanged. Next we tell it the lib direction (same folder, so it is unchanged), a couple parameters, and the libraries which we will use. 

Next we tell it to build a PRX binary rather than a static ELF binary. Static ELFs are generally depreciated, and only PRX-based homebrew can be signed to run on any PSP firmware. (PRX binaries in EBOOTs are different from PRX kernel mods!)

Afterwards we also create an &quot;EBOOT.PBP&quot; which is the file that will actually start up. Then you give it the title and have an option of an icon (144x80), a background picture (480x272), and a PSP sound file (at3). If you don't want one of these, then just delete the lines.

      <comment>Minor edit. &quot;callbacks.c&quot; should have been &quot;callback.c&quot;.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Common Callback ==
Before we begin programming for the PSP, we will start by creating a folder named “common” in our programming directory. This folder will contain several files which will often be used in our programs. We'll put these files here so that we don't constantly have to write the same code over and over again.

=== callback.h ===
Now let's create a new file with the name &quot;callback.h&quot;. This header file will declare some of the stuff needed so that we can get our program to run on the PSP.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#ifndef COMMON_CALLBACK_H
#define COMMON_CALLBACK_H

int isRunning();
int setupExitCallback();

#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

The 'ifndef' is used to make sure that this file only gets imported once, otherwise an error will occur. Then it should be pretty self explanatory; we will have two functions which we will use: &quot;isRunning()&quot; to check if the user has requested to quit the program, and &quot;setupCallbacks()&quot; which will setup all the necessary things for your program to run on the PSP.

=== callback.c ===
Now that we have the header definitions we can also create the source file: name it &quot;callback.c&quot;. We'll start by including the file &quot;pspkernel.h&quot; which gives us access to several kernel methods. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;pspkernel.h&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Next we create a boolean. Executing the method &quot;isRunning()&quot; will tell us whether a request to exit the application was created by the user. We will use this  function in our program so that we can clean up any leftover memory, and exit gracefully.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
static int exitRequest  = 0;

int isRunning()
{
	return !exitRequest;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now this is where the hard part comes in... the good news, is that you don't need to completely understand it! Essentially what it does is create a new thread, which will create an exit callback. The callback will then make &quot;exitRequest&quot; equal to true if the user presses the &quot;home&quot; and &quot;exit&quot; button on the PSP. See for yourself:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;pspkernel.h&gt; 

static int exitRequest = 0; 

int isRunning() 
{ 
	return !exitRequest; 
} 

int exitCallback(int arg1, int arg2, void *common) 
{ 
	exitRequest = 1; 
	return 0; 
} 

int callbackThread(SceSize args, void *argp) 
{ 
	int callbackID; 

	callbackID = sceKernelCreateCallback(&quot;Exit Callback&quot;, exitCallback, NULL); 
	sceKernelRegisterExitCallback(callbackID); 

	sceKernelSleepThreadCB(); 

	return 0; 
} 

int setupExitCallback() 
{ 
	int threadID = 0; 

	threadID = sceKernelCreateThread(&quot;Callback Update Thread&quot;, callbackThread, 0x11, 0xFA0, THREAD_ATTR_USER, 0); 
	 
	if(threadID &gt;= 0) 
	{ 
		sceKernelStartThread(threadID, 0, 0); 
	} 

	return threadID; 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Don't worry if you don't completely understand it, that's why we created a separate file for it. It's not going to change, so all we have to do is include it. 

Now you can go into the next section, which will show you how to create a simple [[PSP Programming/General/Hello_World|&quot;Hello World!&quot; program]].

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/182.186.101.117|182.186.101.117]] ([[User talk:182.186.101.117|talk]]) to last version by Antonizoon</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hello World! ==
Now that we've got a common folder for files which we're going to use often, and created our callbacks file we can begin creating a simple &quot;Hello World!&quot; program.

=== main.c ===
We'll start by including “pspkernel.h” which will allow us to exit the application, &quot;pspdebug.h&quot; so that we can get a simple debug screen started, &quot;pspdisplay.h&quot; for &quot;sceDisplayWaitVblankStart&quot; function, and &quot;callback.h&quot; of course so that the user can quit at any time by pressing 'home' and then 'exit'.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;pspkernel.h&gt;
#include &lt;pspdebug.h&gt;
#include &lt;pspdisplay.h&gt;

#include &quot;../common/callback.h&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Next we will tell the PSP a little about our program. In &quot;PSP_MODULE_INFO&quot; we will tell it the name of our program, any attributes, and its major and minor version. You can ignore most of these attributes for now. Then to make things easier for ourselves (so that we don't have to type as much), we will replace &quot;pspDebugScreenPrintf&quot; with &quot;printf&quot; which will allow us to type text on the screen.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#define VERS    1 //Talk about this
#define REVS    0

PSP_MODULE_INFO(&quot;Hello World&quot;, PSP_MODULE_USER, VERS, REVS);
PSP_MAIN_THREAD_ATTR(PSP_THREAD_ATTR_USER); 
PSP_HEAP_SIZE_MAX();

#define printf pspDebugScreenPrintf
&lt;/source&gt;

So, first we will initialize the debug screen, and setup our callbacks. Then inside a loop we place the position to write to at (0,0) (so that printing doesn't go to the next line) and print out our message, then to prevent “ripping” effects we call “sceDisplayWaitVblankStart”. Once the user quits and the loop is broken (remember we are using the &quot;isRunning()&quot; method), we do a last call to &quot;sceKernelExitGame()&quot; which will exit our application and return zero thus closing off the program.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int main()
{       
	pspDebugScreenInit();
	setupExitCallback();

	while(isRunning())
	{
		pspDebugScreenSetXY(0, 0);
		printf(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
		sceDisplayWaitVblankStart();
	}

	sceKernelExitGame();	
	return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now if you are using an IDE that can also compile your PSP programs, you can hit compile and put the &quot;EBOOT.PBP&quot; in a folder on your PSP, and then run it. If on the other hand you choose to do things manually, then we will have to create the Makefile before compiling.

=== Makefile ===
So... create a &quot;Makefile&quot; file (no extension) in your project's directory and open it up in your favorite text editing application. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
TARGET		= hello_world
OBJS		= main.o ../common/callback.o

INCDIR		=
CFLAGS		= -G0 -Wall -O2
CXXFLAGS	= $(CFLAGS) -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti
ASFLAGS	= $(CFLAGS)

LIBDIR		=
LDFLAGS	=
LIBS		= -lm

BUILD_PRX = 1 

EXTRA_TARGETS	= EBOOT.PBP
PSP_EBOOT_TITLE= Hello World

PSPSDK	= $(shell psp-config --pspsdk-path)
include $(PSPSDK)/lib/build.mak
&lt;/source&gt;

Compile the program by using the word “make”, place the eboot.pbp in a folder on your PSP (no other files needed) and run it. Once you're done with this you can proceed to the [[../Button_Input|next tutorial]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Button Input ==
In this tutorial we will learn how to work with handling user input. Let's start by including some headers. You should already know what the first two are for, and the third one is to get controller input. As before we will also include the callback header.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;pspkernel.h&gt; 
#include &lt;pspdebug.h&gt; 
#include &lt;pspctrl.h&gt;

#include &quot;../common/callback.h&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

We'll raise the revision so that our program is now at version 1.1. This is assuming each progression of tutorial deserves a raise to the revision. The rest of the code is the same aside from the name change in the psp module info.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#define VERS    1 
#define REVS    1

PSP_MODULE_INFO(&quot;Button Input&quot;, PSP_MODULE_USER, VERS, REVS);
PSP_MAIN_THREAD_ATTR(PSP_THREAD_ATTR_USER); 
PSP_HEAP_SIZE_MAX();

#define printf pspDebugScreenPrintf
&lt;/source&gt;

In our main function we do the usual, but this time create an 'running' variable so that we can update it if the exit callback occurs or if the user presses the button 'start' (more on this later). Then we create the button input object and set the sampling rate to 0, and allow analog mode so that we can read where the analog pad is. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int main()
{       
	pspDebugScreenInit(); 
	setupExitCallback();

	int running = isRunning();

	SceCtrlData buttonInput;

	sceCtrlSetSamplingCycle(0);
	sceCtrlSetSamplingMode(PSP_CTRL_MODE_ANALOG);
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we start the while loop, update our variable from the exit callback telling us if we should quit or not. We reset the position to print, and print out the analog pad position. Printing the variable is done by passing it in the second parameter and using '%d' as a placeholder for it.

One thing to remember, when you get the position of the analog stick using the 'Lx' and 'Ly' properties, you get a value from 0 to 255. You can subtract 128 from that so that the center would be 0. Unfortunately there is such a thing as a “dead-zone” which means that the user might not even be touching the analog stick, but it may still detect a value between -30 to 30. We'll learn how to deal with this problem in later tutorials.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
	while(running)
	{
		running = isRunning();

		pspDebugScreenSetXY(0, 0);
		printf(&quot;Analog X = %d &quot;, buttonInput.Lx); 
		printf(&quot;Analog Y = %d \n&quot;, buttonInput.Ly);
&lt;/source&gt;

To update our button input variable with the button information we call 'sceCtrlPeekBufferPositive' and give it the reference to our variable. When we want to check what buttons are pressed we first check if any buttons are pressed at all. If the 'start' button is pressed, we print it out and then close our program by making 'running' equal to zero.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
		sceCtrlPeekBufferPositive(&amp;buttonInput, 1); 

		if(buttonInput.Buttons != 0) 
		{ 
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_START){ 
									printf(&quot;Start&quot;); 
									running = 0;
			} 
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_SELECT)	printf(&quot;Select&quot;); 
&lt;/source&gt;

We do the same thing with the other buttons, but we do not close the program, just print out the name of the button.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_UP)		printf(&quot;Up&quot;); 
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_DOWN)		printf(&quot;Down&quot;); 
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_RIGHT)	printf(&quot;Right&quot;); 
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_LEFT)		printf(&quot;Left&quot;); 

			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_CROSS)	printf(&quot;Cross&quot;); 
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_CIRCLE)	printf(&quot;Circle&quot;); 
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_SQUARE)	printf(&quot;Square&quot;); 
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_TRIANGLE)	printf(&quot;Triangle&quot;); 
	
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_RTRIGGER)	printf(&quot;R-Trigger&quot;);
			if(buttonInput.Buttons &amp; PSP_CTRL_LTRIGGER)	printf(&quot;L-Trigger&quot;);
		} 
	}
	
	sceKernelExitGame(); 
	return 0; 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

At the end we close our program. You may notice that we don't check for all buttons, this is because we need kernel control to check for those buttons. More on that in later tutorials or if you want to check how to get kernel control in your program, you can skip right [[PSP_Programming/Kernel/Kernel Mode|to it]].

=== Makefile ===
Once again create the 'Makefile' file and make it like so, the only difference being the names again.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
TARGET		= ButtonInput
OBJS		= main.o ../common/callback.o

INCDIR		=
CFLAGS		= -O2 -G0 -Wall
CXXFLAGS	= $(CFLAGS) -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti
ASFLAGS	= $(CFLAGS)

BUILD_PRX	= 1

LIBDIR		= ./
LIBS		= -lm
LDFLAGS	=

EXTRA_TARGETS		= EBOOT.PBP
PSP_EBOOT_TITLE	= ButtonInput

PSPSDK	= $(shell psp-config --pspsdk-path)
include $(PSPSDK)/lib/build.mak
&lt;/source&gt;

Once you're done with this and everything is working, you can proceed to the [[PSP_Programming/General/Images|next tutorial]].

      <comment>general cleanup, typos fixed: leniancy → leniency using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Epitope, or antigenic determinant, is a small, specific portion of an antigen recognized by the immune system such as antibodies. A single antigen usually has several different epitopes. The region on an antibody which recognizes the epitope is called a paratope. Antibodies fit precisely and bind to specific epitopes.

[[Image:chem114A epitopes.jpg]]

Epitopes exist as tertiary structures of amino acids and are not recognized by antibodies with the same specificty or affinity when denatured by pH or temperature. Immunoglobins which recognize the epitopes will also denature under similar conditions. There is a distinction in the naming of native epitopes and denatured linear epitopes. Epitopes on natural tertiary structures are named cryptotopes and that of linear sequences is called unfoldons.  There are two different yet effective ways to study epitope and map their locations. These methods are x-ray crystallography and monoclonal antibodies. The immune response of an animal produces many different types of antibodies that recognize different epitopes with a range of affinity. These various antibodies are called polyclonal antibodies and are found in the serum taken from the blood. A monoclonal antibody is just one of these antibodies out of the many polyclonal antibodies, and it is this monoclonal antibody that is used to define specific epitopes.

'''Epitope Mapping'''

The challenges in mapping epitopes and identifying its location becomes challenging because different monoclonal antibodies will recognize different or similar epitopes. An epitope cannot exist without there being a corresponding antibody that recognizes it specifically. This definition makes it harder to specifically identify the range of any given epitope since monoclonal antibodies begin first and polyclonal antibodies all with different affinities and specificity. Some of these antibodies will have different leniency for amino acids and others will overlap in the epitope they recognize.  It then becomes troublesome in deciding which polyclonal antibody should correspond to the specific epitope as many recognize the same sequence. 

Often the means of the monoclonal antibody, or Mab, influences the definition of the epitope. Because Western Blotting’s SDS-PAGE partially denatures the protein this will affect the recognition of MAb to epitope. Other procedures that utilize native conformations such as liquid phase immunoassays and or frozen tissue samples will simulate in vivo affinities. This creates three artificial categories of Mab to eptiope recognition. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize only partially denatured epitopes, those that recognize nativetertiary structure of epitopes, and those that recognize both. 

Disulfide bridges that are distinctly visible can be isolated through the precise mapping of Epitope. However, epitopes can be recognized through various different monoclonal antibodies. The specificity and recognition of these features become more pronounced in the tissues. Monoclonal antibodies are rather selective in recognizing Epitope despite the structural subtle and differences that may arise in the conformational change of this protein. Despite the domain not having a concrete protein residue or subunit cavity, the structure can still be detected under x-ray crystallography.

X-ray crystallography is the most precise method in determining native tertiary contact between the epitope and monoclonal antibody. Challenges exist in defining how close the antibody must be to be in “contact” and even if the two are in contact it does not necessarily mean there is binding. Also x-ray crystallogoraphy is an expensive method and requires the antibody to be in crystal form. Methods that circumvent these challenges include NMR which can be used commonly but it sacrifices the precision of x-ray crystallography. NMR is hindered by the size of the antigen. If the antigen is too large then electron-microscopy can be used because it requires that the antigen be sizable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What kind of work is being done by mobile workers?}}

By 2009, one-quarter of the world’s working population will be mobile workers, according to a July 2007 study issued by Cisco Systems Inc., titled “Understanding and Managing the Mobile Workforce.” What kind of work is being done by mobile workers? There are five kinds of mobile workers 1. On site movers: work at one site, but move around within it, e.g. security guards and IT Technicians, 2. Yo-Yo’s: occasionally work away from a fixed location, e.g. jobs that require business trips, 3. Pendulums: alternate between working at two fixed locations, e.g. the company office and a client’s office or home office, 4. Nomads: work in a number of different places and constantly move between them, e.g. a sales rep calling on many customers a day, and last but not least is, 5. Carriers: work while they move, transporting goods or people, e.g. train conductors and airline attendants. Two of the major issues that are faced by mobile workers are telecommuting, as well as health.

==Advantages==
With today’s technology employers and employees are able to do work from anywhere so long as they have a modem and internet access is available. Physical locations are not what they use to be, with video conferencing, virtual networks and email we are able to stay connected with the office without having to be in the office, and it avoids employers and employees having to carry all kinds of cables in order to connect.

==Disadvantages==
Although we have advanced in many ways with all the different concessions made towards technology employers are concerned that 
mobile employees will not be able to push themselves without the proper supervision. Many mobile workers lack sufficient technology tools to get their jobs done efficiently, a situation that can lead to great stress.

==Analysis==
There may be an issue that arises if customers want to speak face to face as opposed to using the new modern route, being that not everyone adapts to change. Another issue that can be visited is the cost associated with installing all the necessary equipment for employees that will work from home instead of at the office.  Health issues that may arise, are that with travel it can make it difficult to for the traveling individuals to maintain a healthy lifestyle, eating, exercise and sleep, as well as isolation from support of colleagues can allow mental strain to build up to unhealthy levels. 

==Future==
With the advancement of technology it is safe to say that things will continue to evolve well into the future.  We may not know what the future holds; however it shows promise of more great things to come.

The future office will be increasingly mobile, with technology enabling employees to perform their jobs from virtually anywhere, according to Office of the Future: 2020, a research study recently released by OfficeTeam. But greater control over where and how people work won’t necessarily translate into more free time. Forty-two percent of executives polled said they believe employees will be working more hours in the next 10 to 15 years.

Technology tools to provide even greater flexibility — Miniature wireless devices, WiFi, WiMax and mobile technology will continue to allow a company’s staff to work outside of the office with greater ease. Additionally, virtual environments and web-based conferencing services will provide off-site employees with real-time access to meetings, reducing the need to travel.

Telecommuting to rise — improved wireless connectivity will allow for an increasingly flexible workforce. Eighty-seven percent of executives surveyed believe telecommuting will increase in the next 10 to 15 years. Telecommuting enables employees to work where it’s most convenient, but it also challenges their interpersonal skills. They must build relationships with coworkers while having fewer in-person interactions.

      <comment>/* Equilibrium Constant */general cleanup, typos fixed: calulated → calculated, activites → activities using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Equilibrium Constant==

The '''equilibrium constant''', '''K''', reflects the ratio of the activities of the products versus the reactants, and represents the extent to which a reaction goes to completion. &lt;br&gt;
In general, a reaction with a 
*LARGE K, K &gt; 10&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;, is said to favor the products and thus forms more products than reactants
*SMALL K, K &lt; 10&lt;small&gt;-3&lt;/small&gt;, favors reactants and thus very little product is formed. Intermediate values of K, form similar amounts of both products and reactants.
The equilibrium constant is a thermodynamic property and thus the size of K does not indicate anything about the rate at which products form, only the amount. The '''equilibrium constant''' for the reaction:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;h4&gt;aA + bB &lt;--&gt; cC + dD&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

can be calculated by,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;h4&gt;K = a&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;/(a&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where '''a&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;''' represents the activity of species '''I'''. The activities of the reaction species are raised to their corresponding stoichiometric coefficient.

The equilibrium constant can be very closely approximated by using concentrations for aqueous solutions and pressures for gasses, in place of activities. Solids and pure liquids are not facored into K and are given a value of 1. 

The equilibrium constant is related to the standard gibbs free energy, delta G, by

&lt;center&gt;&lt;h4&gt;delta G&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = -RTlnK&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''Kd''' is defined as dissociation constant that accounts for amount of reactant that dissociates reversibly to form component products; the constant deals with half of binding site of enzyme that binds for concentration of ligands, or the concentration for ligands that bind enzyme to be equal to that that are not; the unit of the constant is in molarity or M; it is a measurement that is indirectly proportional to affinity constant, for example, between enzyme and ligand; or the smaller dissociation constant means higher affinity constant as the stronger the bond between the enzyme and ligand, which is more difficult to be separated to two components.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The activation energy required to achieve the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]] is a barrier to the formation of products; it is the minimum, necessary, amount of energy required for a reaction to proceed. This barrier is the reason why the rate of many chemical reactions is very slow without the presence of enzymes, heat, or other catalytic forces. There are two common ways to overcome this barrier and thereby accelerate a chemical reaction. First, the reactants could be exposed to a large amount of heat. For example, if gasoline is sitting at room temperature, nothing much happens. However, if the gasoline is exposed to a flame or spark, it breaks down rapidly, probably at an explosive rate. A second strategy is to lower the activation energy barrier. Enzymes lower the activation energy to a point where a small amount of available heat can push the reactants to a transition state. The question that arises is: How do enzymes work to lower the activation energy barrier of chemical reactions? 

Enzymes are large proteins that bind small molecules. When bound to an enzyme, the bonds in the reactants can be strained (that is stretched) thereby making it easier for them to achieve the transition state. This is one way for which enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction. When a chemical reaction involves two or more reactants, the enzyme provides a site where the reactants are positioned very close to each other and in an orientation that facilitates the formation of new covalent bonds. This technique also lowers the needed activation energy for a chemical reaction. Straining the reactants and bringing them close together are two common ways the enzymes use to lower the activation energy. There are other methods that the enzymes use to facilitate a chemical reaction. Changing the local environment of the reactants is one of these methods. In some cases, enzymes lower the activation energy by directly participating in the chemical reaction. For example, certain enzymes that hydrolyze ATP form a covalent bond between phosphate and amino acid in the enzyme that may have a charge that affects the chemistry of the reactants. This is very temporary condition. The covalent bond between phosphate and the amino acid is quickly broken, releasing phosphate and returning the amino acid back to its original condition.

==Arrhenius equation==
Arrhenius equation is a description of the relationship between the activation energy and the reaction rate.

&lt;big&gt;'''''k = Ae&lt;sup&gt;(-E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/RT)&lt;/sup&gt;'''''&lt;/big&gt;

where: k = chemical reaction, T = temperature in Kelvin, E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = activation energy, A = the pre-exponential factor, R = the gas constant

According to this equation, it is observed that at a higher temperature, the probability that the two molecules will collide is higher, resulting in a higher kinetic energy, which leads to the lower requirement on the activation energy.

The Arrhenius equation is particularly helpful when calculating the rate of production of products over time, which is characterized by the following:

&lt;big&gt;'''''d[products]/dt = rate = Ae&lt;sup&gt;(-E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/RT)&lt;/sup&gt;[A&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;]'''''&lt;/big&gt;

where the ''[A]'' and ''[B]'' are the concentrations of the reactants and ''m'' and ''n'' are their respective reaction orders.

== Lowering the Activation Energy ==
A catalyst is something that lowers the activation energy; in biology it is an enzyme. The catalyst speeds up the rate of reaction without being consumed; it does not change the initial reactants or the end products.

[[Image:Carbonic anhydrase reaction in tissue.svg]]

The graph above shows how the activation energy is lowered in the presence of an enzyme (blue line) that is doing the catalysis, exempflified with the carbon anhydrase reaction. [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|The transition state]] is usually the most unstable part of the reaction since it is the one with the highest free energy. The difference between the transition state and the reactants is the Gibbs free energy of activation, commonly known as activation energy ''&lt;math&gt;(\Delta G^{\ddagger})&lt;/math&gt;''.

Enzymes (blue line) change the formation of the transition state by lowering the energy and stabilizing the highly energetic unstable transition state.  This allows the reaction rate to increase, but also the back reaction occurs more easily.

== Common Misconceptions ==

Some common misconceptions about activation energy barriers and catalysts to speed up the reaction. The catalyst does NOT lower activation energy of the same barrier, '''but rather chooses another chemical pathway with a lower activation energy.'''The catalysts lead to new pathways which don't require as high of an energy of activation in turn speeding up the reaction.

Another big misconception about activation energy is that reactions will not always give the most thermodynamically stable products. Sometimes, the product that forms is the one that is more kinetically stable, or forms faster. However, if a catalyst is available, the thermodynamically more stable product will be able to form, even if the energy barrier is high.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The initial rate, V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is the rate of the reaction after almost no time has passed, t is approximately 0. It is the measure of moles of product formed per second (t cannot equal zero, because we cannot divide by zero) and can be approximated by finding the slope of the product versus reactant curve at the beginning. Near beginning, the reverse reaction is negligible, and thus the slope is a good approximation.

[[Image:Nuclear_Binding_Energy.jpg|right|thumb|Example of a nuclear binding energy curve]]

The binding energy is the free energy that is released by the formation of weak interactions between a complementary substrate and enzyme. The binding energy is maximized since only the correct substrate can interact with an enzyme and is released when the enzyme facilitates formation of the transition state. This interaction between the enzyme and the transition state gives way to the maximum binding state. Upon formation of the transition state, the activation energy is lowered, which will speed up the reaction.

Binding energy is known as separation energy that is the requirement for dissociation of chemical substance to its constituent components. There are different binding energies at different molecular level such as electron binding energy, atomic binding energy, nuclear binding energy, and gravitational binding energy.

With the units of eV, electron binding energy is the energy required to release an electron from its atomic or molecular orbital. According to Moseley's law, the binding energies of 1s electron are proportional to(Z-1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. 

To dissemble an atom into free electrons and nucleus, atomic binding energy is required. It is the energy that was derived from electromagnetic interaction.

Nuclear binding energy is also known as binding energy of nucleons into a nuclide. It was derived from the strong nuclear force and is the energy required to disassemble a nucleus into the same number of free unbound neutrons and protons that its contained. Such that the particles are far enough from one another so that the strong nuclear force can no longer cause the particles to interact. In bound systems, the mass must be subtracted from the mass of the unbound system, if the binding energy is removed from the system, because this energy has mass. If subtracted from the system at the time it is bound, the mass of the system will be removed. Since the system is not closed during the binding process, system mass is not conserved.&lt;ref = &quot;Binding Energy&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy], Wikipedia-Binding Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
By definition, the transition state is the transitory of molecular structure in which the molecule is no longer a substrate but not yet a product. All chemical reactions must go through the transition state to form a product from a substrate molecule. The transition state is the state corresponding to the highest energy along the reaction coordinate. It has more free energy in comparison to the substrate or product; thus, it is the least stable state. The specific form of the transition state depends on the mechanisms of the particular reaction. 

In the equation S → X → P, X is the transition state, which is located at the peak of the curve on the Gibbs free energy graph.

[[Image:transitionstatechem114A.jpg]]

==Application to Enzymes==
[[File:Activation2 updated.svg|right|thumb|The energy required in Transition state is lowered by enzyme. However, the energy levels of initial and final states remain unchanged.]]
Enzymes are usually proteins that act like catalysts. The enzyme's ability to make the reaction faster depends on the fact that it stabilizes the transition state. The transition state's energy or, in terms of a reaction, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Activation energy|activation energy]] is the minimum energy that is needed to break certain bonds of the reactants so as to turn them into products. Enzymes decreases activation energy by shaping its [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]] such that it fits the transition state even better than the substrate. When the substrate binds, the enzyme may stretch or distort a key bond and weaken it so that less activation energy is needed to break the bond at the start of the reaction. In many cases, the transition state of a reaction has a different geometry at the key atom (for instance, tetrahedral instead of trigonal planar). By optimizing binding of a tetrahedral atom, the substrate is helped on its way to the transition state and therefore lowers the activation energy, allowing more molecules to be able to turn into products in a given period of time.
The enzyme stabilizes the transition state through various ways. Some ways an enzyme stabilizes is to have an environment that is the opposite charge of the transition state, providing a different pathway,and making it easier for the reactants to be in the right orientation for reaction.

Consider the peptide hydrolysis by chrymotypsin as an example.

In a normal peptide hydrolysis reaction without the help of a catalyst, water acts as a nucleophile to attack the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. The carbon atom being attacked goes from its initial sp2 state(trigonal planar) to a new sp3 state(tetrahedral) in its transition state. 

[[Image:Transition.jpg]]

In the presence of chymotypsin, however, a better nucleophile is used in the form of the catalytic triad - Asp 102, His 57, Ser 195 side chains. Moreover, the oxyanion hole, which consists of the backbone -NH- groups of Gly 193 and Ser 195 of the enzyme, have the N-H groups positioned in such a way that they will donate strong hydrogen bonds to the substrate's C=O oxygen, given that the carbon atom is tetrahedral as found in the transition state. This strains the bonds of the trigonal planar C=O of the original substrate, helping the reaction to proceed to the transition state. The hydrogen bonds also stabilize the formal negative charge on the oxygen atoms. In this way, the activation energy of the reaction is lowered and the rate of reaction thus increases.

== Enzyme Inhibition ==
In 1948, Linus Pauling proposed that transition state analogs should be effective inhibitors of enzymes.  These molecules are mimics of transition states of the substrate of a particular enzyme reaction.  Because they are so similar to the transition states of the substrate, they can bind to the enzyme, oftentimes much more tightly than the substrate can.  The fact that these transition state analogs bind so tightly to enzymes makes it an effective enzyme inhibitor. 
The transition state theory says that the occurrence of enzymatic catalysis is equivalent to an enzyme binding to the transition state more strongly than it binds to the ground-state reactants. This theory is based on the two fundamental principles of physical chemistry: Absolute reaction-rate theory and the thermodynamic cycle. Also, the thermodynamic cycle relating substrate binding and transition state binding apply elementary transition-state theory to enzymatic catalysis, which is a restatement of Pauling's description of transition-state binding in quantitative symbols. He has stated that the catalytic powers of enzymes result from their highly specific binding of the transition state.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An antibody is a protein that is synthesized by an animal in response to the presence of a foreign substance in our body, called an antigen. They play a great role in the immune system, and are usually found in blood and other bodily fluids. Antibodies are created by white blood cells, or more specifically, B cells. There are five isotypes of antibodies that each play self-defense role to fight off foreign objects in our body. Antibodies are created in response to antigens that include, but are not limited to, foreign proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. The antibody recognizes a small portion of the antigen called the antigenic determinant or epitope.  Each antibody recognizes and binds to a specific antigen in a lock and key type model.  Given the sheer amount of antigens present, there are an equally diverse selection of antibodies.

== Structure ==

Antibodies are gamma globulin proteins that have sugar groups attached to amino acid chains. They can be classified as '''glycoproteins'''. The most basic form is the immunoglobulin monomer, which has only one immunoglobulin unit. Antibodies can also appear in dimeric forms with two immunoglobulin units, tetrameric form with four immunoglobulin units, or even pentameric form with five immunoglobulin units.

'''Immunoglobulin G''', the most common type of antibody, consists of 4 chains. There are 2 light chains and 2 heavy chains. The two heavy chains are bound together by a disulfide bond (S-S), and the two light chains are bound to the heavy chain by disulfide bonds. Together, they roughly form a Y shape. 
[[Image:Antibody svg.svg‎|center|300px|Basic Structure of Antibody]]&lt;br&gt;
There are two sites that recognize and bind to antigens located at the top of the Y shaped immunoglobulin.'''Immunoglobulin G (IgG)''' all have the same general structure only varying at the antigen binding site. This region is called the '''variable region (V)''' and is composed of hypervariable loops. These hypervariable loops give great versatility to the antigen binding site allowing it to bind to multitudes of different antigens. The '''variable regions (V)''', which make up the two identical antigen-binding sties, are different in each specific type of antibody, giving these sites specific shapes that fit certain antigenic epitopes. The remainder of the molecule consists of light and heavy chain '''constant regions (C)''' where these amino acid sequences vary little form antibody to antibody.

Antibodies obtain their diversity through two processes.  The first stage is called somatic or V(D)J, which stand for variable, diverse, and joining regions, recombination.  Within each of the three regions are located several sets of genes.  During cell maturation, the B cell will splice out the DNA of all but one of the genes from each region and combine the three remaining genes together to form one VDJ segment.  This segment, along with a constant region gene, forms the basis for subsequent antibody production.  It is estimated that given the number of variants in each of the three regions, approximately 10,000-20,000 unique antibodies are producible.

The second stage of recombination occurs after the B cell is activated by an antigen.  When an antigen binds to the B cell, the B cell will begin to reproduce rapidly.  During this division process, the variable regions of the gene will undergo rapid mutation called somatic hypermutation.  This hypermutation serves to fine tune the antibody binding to the antigen.  Cells that have a stronger affinity for the antigen will be given a stronger signal to multiply, leading to a gradual selection of antibodies that bind to the antigen the strongest.

In IgG, the heavy chain has four subunits, C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;3, C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2, C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 (the constant portions) and V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (the variable portion). The light chain has two subunits, C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. The two C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;3 units are joined directly, while the C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 units are separated by oligosaccharides. The C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 is located past the &quot;hinge&quot; of the heavy chain and is joined to the C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; unit by a disulfide bond.

== Folding ==
Because antibodies can be produced with thousands of variations, the chance of producing an antibody that cannot fold properly or will otherwise not function properly is high. Folding is therefore a very important step in antibody production, and antibody production is highly dependent on the &quot;quality control&quot; mechanisms of the '''endoplasmic reticulum (ER)'''. Heavy chains and light chains are synthesized separately and translocated into the ER during the translation process; they begin folding before translation is even complete.

=== The Ig Fold ===
The '''Ig fold''' is a highly conserved protein topology, with such a broad presence in nature that it gives the name to the '''Ig superfamily (IgSF)''', which consists of proteins that contain an Ig fold. The Ig fold consists of two antiparallel β-sheets, containing 7 to 9 β-strands in total, which form a sandwich-like structure. Typically, the Ig fold is stabilized by internal disulfide bridges that connect two of the β-strands and run perpendicular to the sheets themselves. The two variable regions and one constant region of IgG each contain an Ig fold. An important step in the formation of an Ig fold is proline isomerization. While most peptide bonds have a ''trans'' conformation, proline's cyclic structure means that it is only slightly less stable in a ''cis'' conformation and can exist that that conformation in nature. A proline residue exists between two of the β-strands in the Ig fold, and this residue's isomerization from ''trans'' to ''cis'' conformation is often the rate-limiting step in the formation of an Ig fold.

=== Categories of Folding ===
While the final structures are generally very similar, Ig domains can broadly be grouped into three categories based on their folding processes.

In the first category, domains fold autonomously, guided by the internal disulfide bridge, and the final state is a monomer. One major intermediate exists between the unfolded polypeptide and its native folded state. This intermediate persists for a noticeable amount of time because it contains a ''cis'' proline residue, while in the final, folded state this residue is ''trans'', and the transformation from ''cis'' to ''trans'' is relatively slow. The central β-strands in the intermediate are almost completely folded, and small helices link two pairs of the strands, making this intermediate highly stable. The reason for the high stability in the intermediate is because the small helices act as an organizing center in the antibodies and they position the bulky hydrophobic molecules in the center of the protein. These helices are found in the most commonly in the constant domains and not in the variable domains or in immunoglobulin molecules that are prone to misfold, suggesting that these internal linkages are key to the folding of the antibody. Examples of protein domains in this category include the constant region of the light chain (C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) and the second constant region of the heavy chain (C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2) of IgG.

The second category begins folding similarly to the first: it forms a partially-folded monomer, with a ''trans'' proline residue, which then isomerizes to a ''cis'' residue. At this point, the domain is unable to finish folding until it dimerizes with itself. A representative of this domain is the third constant region of the heavy chain (C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;3) of IgG. In fully-formed IgG, the two heavy chains are directly joined at this domain (as opposed to C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2, which are separated by sugars), so its folding by this process makes sense.

The third category is more distinct from the first two. The first constant region of the heavy chain (C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1) of IgG is incapable of folding autonomously, and must associate with already-folded C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;, forming a dimeric intermediate. As in the other two categories, the folding domain contains a ''trans'' proline residue that must become ''cis'' before folding is complete. Unlike the other two processes, this isomerization cannot occur until the C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; bonds to the C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. This causes C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 folding to be the slowest of all IgG domains; it does not happen until the heavy and light chains have already come together.

A commonality in the folding of every antibody is a slow proline isomerization reaction, which is the conversion from the trans proline to a cis proline. This reaction has a very high activation energy (~80 kJ/mol) which makes this a very slow reaction. Because of this fact, the proline isomerization reaction acts as a rate-limiting step in the folding of an antibody. In each of these three categories, there exist very important transition states. The rate-limiting proline isomerization reaction allows for the reactions to proceed slower and for the transition states to be populated since the proline must be in the cis conformation in order to proceed in the folding.

=== Quality Checks ===

B cells have been observed to go through a series of “quality checks” to in order to regulate the functionality of the antibodies being made. In the pre-B cell state, the folding of all the domains in the heavy chain is tested. After the heavy chain gene is rearranged, the pre-B cells produce IgMs, a short heavy chain with no light chains attached, bound to immunoglobulin heavy chain binding proteins (BiP). The BiP is bound to an unfolded CH1 domain, which is a part of the constant region in the heavy chain. A “surrogate” light chain is then produced from the variable domain of the pre-B cell. If the surrogate light chain induces the unbinding of the BiP with the IgM and the domain CH1 folds appropriately, then the heavy chain proceeds to the plasma membrane. If, however it fails this quality check, then the IgMs act as a substrate for endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). Thus the failure of this quality check leads to the degradation of the heavy chain. Then when the heavy chain is formed and a conventional light chain is formed, the same process as before takes place with the conventional light chains acting as the surrogate lights chains. The conventional light chains must induce the unbinding of the BiP from the CH1 domain and allow for folding in the CH1 domain of the heavy chains in order for the antibody to not undergo ERAD. Once the heavy chain and the light chain have gone through these two quality checks, disulfide bonds are formed between the heavy and light chains and the antibody is then ready for secretion.

=== Alternative States ===
Unlike most proteins, which can generally be said to exist in either a specific folded form or the denatured polypeptide form, antibodies are capable of forming some alternate structures under specific conditions. For example, below pH 3, antibodies can exist in a stable form unlike their typical one. While this is unlikely to directly cause any human health issues (a blood pH of 3 would be fatal long before misfolded antibodies caused any problems), it has ramifications for antibody production. Industrial antibody production includes steps that are carried out at low pH, which could affect the final product of the production.

Another, more direct problem that can come from alternative states of antibodies occurs when light chains or truncated heavy chains are secreted from B cells without forming a full antibody. These fragments can clump and become deposited in various organs, inhibited their function. The most common fatal complication from such deposition is light chain amyloidosis, in which monoclonal light chains are produced, secreted, and form deposits in the kidneys. The variable portion of the light chain is more likely to form amyloid deposits, possibly because the need for high variation in its structure make it more able to escape the cell without errors being detected.

== Function ==
Antibodies functions:
#Bind to foreign objects and prevent them from attacking normal cells
#Can help get rid of pathogens with the aid of macrophages
#Can directly damage pathogens by signaling the start of complement pathway, which is another immune response.

An example of antibody function would be in blood types. For instance, people with blood type A produce antibodies that recognize B antigens. If a person with blood type A was transfused with blood type B or blood type AB, the antibodies that recognize the B antigen on these blood cells would cause the person to begin clotting. This phenomenon explains why an individual of type AB blood can receive tranfusion of type A or B blood however type A or B individuals cannot receive AB blood. This is the problem that usually occurs when blood donation is low and a match is necessary for medical purposes.

Five Major Classes of Antibodies:

1.) IgM :

a.This is a class of antibody that is produces after the initial exposure to antigen, but afterwards, its concentration in blood start to decrease. Immunoglobulin neutralizes the antigen and is responsible for the agglutination of the antigen. Because of this, it is very effective in complement activation.

b.IgM is a pentamer. It has µ heavy chains and exists as a pentamer in combination with another polypeptide called the J chain, which is responsible for initiating the polymerizaiton to form the pentameric structure. With its large number of antigen-binding sites, each IgM molecule binds very tightly to any pathogen that has multiple copies of the same antigen on its surface. The binding induces the Fc region to activate the complement pathway which eventually causes the death of the pathogen. IgM also activates macrophages to phagocytose pathogens. Not surprisingly given these functions, IgM is the first antibody produced when an animal responds to a new antigen.


2.) IgG:

a.This class of antibody is present in tissue fluids. It is the most abundant class in bloodstream late in the primary immune response and particularly during the secondary immune response. IgG promotes neutralization, agglutination, and opsonization of the antigen, and it is also the only class of antibodies that can cross the placenta. It is secreted into the mother's milk and is taken up from the gut of the newborn animal into the bloodstream, thus it presents passive immunity to the fetus. 

b.IgG is a monomer.


3.) IgA:

a.IgA presents the defense of mucous membranes by neutralizing the antigen, and also by agglutination. This antibody is present in bodily secretions such as saliva, tears, breast milk, mucus and in the secretions of the lungs and the intestine. IgA presents in breast milk also presents passive immunity on nursing infants.

b.IgA is a dimer.


4.) IgE:

a.Mast Cells, basophils of Histomine, and other chemicals that cause allergic reactions are released when IgE is triggered. IgE occurs in tissues where having bound the antigen. Some of these in turn activate white blood cells (called eosinophils) to kill various types of parasite. However, the mast cells can also release biologically active amines, including histamine, which cause dilation and increased permeability of blood vessels and lead to the symptoms seen in allergic reactions such as hay fever and asthma.

5.) IgD:

a.In the antigen stimulated proliferation and differentiation of B Cells, IgD operates as the antigen receptor. This class of antigen exists on exterior of naïve B cells that have not been exposed to antigens.

b.IgD is a monomer.

Additionally, antibodies have proven to be remarkable because they can block specific protein synthesis within the body, while leaving human cells unharmed. This is due to the differences in ribosome structure found between bacteria and eukaryotic cells. The shapes of ribosomes in bacteria and humans have very specific differences that prove convenient when developing antibiotics meant to target just the bacterial ribosomes in order to halt their protein synthesis. If successful, antibiotics should bind and interfere with protein synthesis initiation complex formation in bacteria, or have some effect on the transcription of the bacteria's messenger RNA. Scientists trying to develop these antibiotics successfully take advantage of these structural differences in ribosomes, attempting to create ways to stop bacterial ribosomes from functioning without affecting the human in which they are located. For instance, mitochondrial cells contain ribosomes resembling those of bacteria, while the eurkaryotic cells hosting those mitochondria have much different ribosome structure. Thus antibiotics can target those bacterial-resembling ribosomes in the mitochondria without harming the eurkaryotic cell itself, which is merely one minor example that proves the remarkable role that structure and specificity can play in drug development.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Health, &quot;Inside the Cell&quot;, 2005, Pg.10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiviral Antibodies===
Antibodies target the functional sites of the virus at hand. A failure of the antibody to target the functional site will usually result in the failure of the antibody to combat the variation of the virus. If the functional site cannot be targeted, the second choice target should be directed at the host molecules (not virus-encoded molecules). The more chemically similar the antibody and the target's natural ligands are, the more effective the antibody will be.

===Generating Bispecific Antibodies===
Antibody therapeutics are a valuable form of treating disease due in part to their selectivity for a target protein. However, certain drawbacks exist due to certain diseases having several different mechanisms. Bispecific antibodies (BsAb) create an interesting possible alternative with greater benefits. These antibodies can effective target two different binding sites. Some benefits include limited possibility of escape from therapy, greater tumor targeting, and more efficient cytotoxic selectivity. The main drawback for BsAbs is the difficulty in production. New technology has emerged in antibody production through single-chain variable fragment diabodies, tandem diabodies, two-in-one antibody, and dual variable domain antibodies. Although, these techniques have issues with too frequent dosing or conjugation problems.

CovX-Bodies present a technology based on the aldolase catalytic antibodies. This makes it possible to quickly generate the needed antibodies with proper targeting. A CovX body consists of two covalently bound pharmacophores. They're attached to the lysine at position 93 within the Fab arms of the scaffold antibody. They are created through a process of mixing a branched azetidinone linker with a peptide pharmacophore heterodimer with the aldolase antibody. The peptide is responsible for functional activities and the antibody acts to improve half-life and distribution properties. These antibodies are capable of being created with specific binding affinity, potency and pharmacokinetics. The CovX-Body, CVX-241 is currently taking advantage of angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), and vascular endohelial growth factor (VEGF). This drug has shown impressive phamacokinetics in rodents and nonhuman primates. Xenograft models have shown potent efficacy. CVX-241 is completing phase-1 clinical trials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The rate constant is a proportionality constant where the rate of reaction that is directly correlated to the concentration of the reactant.  In first order reactions, the reaction rate is directly proportional to the reactant concentration and the units of first order rate constants are 1/sec.  In bimolecular reactions with two reactants, the second order rate constants have units of 1/M*sec.  Second order reactions can be made to appear as first order reactions, such reactions are called pseudo-first order since adding one reactant in excess will make the reaction first order with respect to the other reactant.  There are also zero order reactions in which the reaction is independent of the reactant concentrations where the units of the rate constant are mol/L*sec. 

For a general chemical reaction of the form: aA + bB --&gt; products

The expression of the reaction rate would be: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d[C]}{dt} = k[A]^{a}[B]^{b}&lt;/math&gt;

where: k is the rate constant of the reaction, [A] and [B] are the concentrations of the reactants, and a and b are the order of the reaction respect to A and B respectively. The overall order of the reaction is the sum of m and n. Keep in mind here that the above [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Rate equation|rate equation]] refers to the disappearance of A and B, thus the rate will be negative (indicating that the reactants were consumed). Products, on the other hand, have a positive value for the rate, since they are being generated. To account for this, many texts list the equation as &lt;math&gt;rate = k[A]^{a}[B]^{a}&lt;/math&gt;. 

It is important to note that not every reactant will appear in the rate constant since a reaction may be zeroth order in a given reactant. Furthermore, except in very limited cases, the order of the reaction cannot be determined from the stoichiometric equation, but rather must be experimentally calculated.


Although this is generally not seen in general chemistry courses, the reaction order can be negative and/or not a whole number.

===Pseudo 1st Order Rate Laws===
In some instances it proves difficult to near impossible to monitor concentrations of each reactant. A rate law for a reaction can be written in the &quot;pseudo&quot; 1st order for reactions involving multiple species, for instance species X and Y. By holding concentrations of one species constant, for instance X, there is essentially no net change in X vs time. As a result a new rate law can be defined to incorporate the X into the preexisting rate constant.

&lt;math&gt;\ k'&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\ k[X]&lt;/math&gt;, thus our new rate equation is written as 
&lt;math&gt;\ r = k'[Y]&lt;/math&gt;

Varying experimental conditions and the resulting data can be used to determine k.

===Steady State Approximation===

A steady state approximation is useful in systems where it proves ultimately difficult to measure the concentration of one reactant (or one of its intermediates). However, if it is assumed that the concentrations of the species in question remains in a constant steady state, an equation can be written in terms of other species in which we can measure. 

Lets examine a system that involves the following reactions:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
| reaction|| rate equation
|-
|{{chem|A + B &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; X}}|| k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[A][B]
|-
|{{chem|X + C &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; D + E}}|| k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[X][C]
|-
|{{chem|X + E &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; F}} || k&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[X][E]
|}

First we are going to assume that species X is in steady state.

&lt;math&gt;\ {d[A]}{dt} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

As part of out assumption X remains constant thus:

&lt;math&gt;\ {d[A]}{dt} = 0 =&lt;/math&gt; '''production terms - loss terms


&lt;math&gt;\ {d[A]}{dt} = 0 =&lt;/math&gt; '''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[A][B] - k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[X][C] - k&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[X][E]

Simplifying :

'''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[A][B] = k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[X][C] - k&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[X][E]

Solving for [X] in terms of reactants in which the concentrations can be experimentally measured, we obtain the equation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{k_1[A][B]}{k_2 k_3 [C][E]} = [X]&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The steady state assumption was proposed by George Briggs and John Haldane in 1942.  In this assumption, the concentrations of the intermediates of a reaction remain the same even when the concentrations of starting materials and products are changing.  Steady state occurs when the rate of formation and breakdown of the intermediate are equal. The steady state assumption relies on the fact that both the formation of the intermediate from reactants and the formation of products from the intermediate have rates much higher than their corresponding reverse reactions. In other words, steady state assumes that k1&gt;&gt;k-1 and k2&gt;&gt;k-2.

Example of steady state of enzyme can be found from Michaelis-menten enzyme kinetics. This enzyme kinetic has a model for rate equation which has a closed-form solution for the concentration of reactants and products in an enzymatic reaction. In particular, the steady-state approximation assumes a negligible rate of change in the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex during the course of the reaction. The initial phase of the reaction was examined by using the stopped flow method, which makes it possible to mix enzyme and substrate and monitor the results within a millisecond. This method revealed an initial rapid burst of colored product, followed by its slower formation as the reaction reached the steady state.</text>

      <comment>/* Regulation of the activities of the target proteins */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">After a molecule is covalently attached to an enzyme, the activity, or catalytic activity, of the enzyme can be changed. In this regulatory strategy, the donor molecule provides the modifying group. The acceptor molecule is usually an enzyme molecule which accepts the modifying group therefore changing its activity. The acceptor is usually a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue, amino acids that contain hydroxide. The process of the covalent modification may be reversible, but not in all cases. One common example of covalent regulation is protein phosphorylation.

==Examples==
The examples of the covalent modification strategy are acetylation/deacytilation; phosphorylation/dephosphorilation; myristoylation; ADP ribosylation; farnesylation; sulfation; ubiquitination. However, phosphorylation and acytilation are the most common examples. In phosphorylation, ATP dontates a phosphate to the hydroxyl group of a cytosine or tyrosine. The reaction yields ADP and a phosphate ester (phosphorylated protein). In the case of phosphorylation, glucose homeostasis is the function that is modified in the glycogen phosphorylase protein. In case of acytilation, the donor molecule is acetyl CoA. The DNA packing function can be modified in the histon protein.

==Regulation of the activities of the target proteins==
[[Image:Protein Kinase.jpg|thumb|frame|right|''Protein Kinase'']]

The phosphorylation reaction is used in almost every metabolic process; moreover, approximately 30% of the known proteins are phosphorylated. The enzyme which catalyzes the phosphorylation process is protein kinase. The human genome contains about 500 homologs for this enzyme. The donor molecule that provides modifying group for that process of the catalytic modification is an ATP molecule. The acceptor molecule has to contain one of the OH groups containing amino acids in its sequence (such as serine, threonine, or tyrosine). In the process of phosphorylation, the ɤ-phosphoryl group from ATP molecule attacks the OH containing amino acid in the protein molecule. This process can ONLY occur within the cell. Proteins that are located outside the cell are not able to go though the phosphorylation regulation. [[Image:Protein Phosphotase.jpg|thumb|frame|left|''Protein Phosphotase'']]
Protein phosphotases are another type of enzyme which catalyze the process of the removal of phosphate group from the protein molecule. This is also known as dephosphorylation. This enzyme deactivates the flag on the protein that was activated by the kinase. Protein phosphtase removes the phosphoryl group that is attached to the protein. However, those enzymes are required to increase the reaction rate of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions.

Protein phosphorylation adds two negative charges, forms 2-3 hydrogen bonds, is a reversible modification, kinetics can be adjusted to physiological process, amplifies signal, and ATP coordinates signaling with bio-energetics.

==Phosphorylation can control the activity of proteins==
1.	An attached phosphoryl group gives an additional negative charge (2-) to the modified protein. Presence of the negative charge can be a source for the electrostatic interaction with other proteins which contain positive charge or within the same protein with positively charged amino acids.

2.	A phosphoryl group is also able to form an additional interaction, as a result of the ability to form three H-bondings. 

3.	Phosphorylation process gives large expand of free energy.

4.	The phosphorylation process can take time in the range between one second and few hours depending on the physiological process. 

5.	The donor molecule for phosphorylation, ATP, is represented as a unit of energy currency required for the regulation in the metabolic processes.

&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Phosphorylation cascade.jpg‎|700]]

Phosphorylation is a covalent modification that controls the activity of enzymes and other proteins. Signals can be greatly amplified by this modification because one kinase has the potential to create an exponential chain effect on various target molecules. An example of this would be the sensitivity of human eyes in reaction to a photon. Protein kinase regulatory activations can be reversed by protein phosphatases, a hydrolysis reaction of connected phosphates. Cyclic AMP, an intercellular messenger, can activate protein kinase A. Cyclic AMP activates Protein Kinase A by altering the quaternary structure. The effects of cAMP in eukaryotic cells are due to activation of PKA by cAMP.The activation of that multifunctional kinase is accomplished by cAMP binding to the regulatory subunit of the enzyme, which frees the functional sites of protein kinase A. When a inhibitor is bound to a Protein kinase A, it binds between the domain of the enzyme in a cleft. 

[[Image:tinocamp.jpg|500px]]

[[Image:cyclic AMP.jpg ‎|200px|frame|right|''Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)'']]

PKA in muscle has 2 subunits: Regulatory (R) subunit and catalytic (C) subunit. The binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit relieves its inhibition of the catalytic subunit.

Regulation of PKA: PKA is activated when four molecules of cAMP bind to it; this dissociates the inhibited holoenzyme(R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into a regulatory subunit (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and two catalytically active subunits (C).

      <comment>/* Actomyosin Powerstroke Pathway */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Actin is the most abundant protein found in eukaryotic cells. It is a monomeric unit of microfilaments (actin filaments). The globular actin is often called G-actin. It contains a nucleotide-binding site, which can bind to ATP or ADP. The conformation of actin depends on the ATP or ADP in the nucleotide-binding site.
Actin filament is often called F-actin. It is twisted helical chains of actins, which the actin monomers orient in the same direction of actin filament. It has polarity that contains different ends in its structure. One end is called barbed (+) while the other end is called pointed (-). They are called by the appearance when myosin S1 fragments are bound to it. An actin has a myosin binding site at every 2.7&amp;nbsp;nm. Actin filament occur as linear filament and also form structural networks, which plays a major role in muscle contraction, cell movement, cell signaling, cytokinesis, and cell division. 

The structure of actin monomer was observed to atomic resolution through x-ray crystallography, which scientists have been determined that the structure of actin as filaments. As actin monomers (G-actin) bind together, they form actin filament (F-actin), which has a helical structure. Each monomer has a distance of 27.5pm with a rotation of 166 degrees around the helical axis. Each actin monomer is orientated in the same direction along the helical structure (F-actin), which makes up a polar character of the structure. One end of the helical structure is called the &quot;barbed&quot; end (+), and the other end is called the &quot;pointed&quot; end (-). Actin filaments are self-assembled, which actin monomers come together as very well-structured, polar helical. Since the aggregation of the first two or three monomers to form actin filament is highly unfavorable, specialized protein complexes, such as Arp2/3, would be required to serve as nuclei for actin assembly in cells. Once the first filament nucleus exists, the addition of subunits is more favorable.

==Regulation of Actin Filament==

A skeletal muscle fiber only moves when it is stimulated. Otherwise at rest, the binding sites are blocked. Actin contains two types of regulatory proteins that modulate the binding site. The first type is tropomyosin, a protein chain that lies along actin and covers the binding sites. Troponin C is attached to tropomyosin and directs the position of tropomyosin on actin. Once a Troponin C binds to calcium, it pulls the tropomyosin to unwrap the binding sites. The exposed binding site allow for myosin to bind to actin. Once myosin binds to actin, it forms a &quot;cross bridge&quot; and is called a rigor complex.

[[Image:Myosin.jpg]]

== Polymerization ==
Actin-ATP can polymerize to form actin filament. It is more readily to polymerize than actin-ADP, because actin polymerization occurs when bound ATP in actin is hydrolyzed to ADP.

Three Nucleators:
===== Formins =====
Actin filament is self-assembled spontaneously, but formins can help the formation. Formin binds to the barbed(+) end of actin filament, and actin monomers can be added on it until a plus-end capping protein binds to the barbed end. This mechanism stabilizes the polymerization and consequently produce a linear unbranched fliament due its FH2 domain.

===== Arp 2/3 Complex =====
Branched actin networks can form from polymerization with Arp2/3 complexes. Arp2/3 complex is a seven-subunit protein that includes two actin-related proteins, Arp2 and Arp3, and five other smaller proteins. Nucleation of Arp2/3 complex associated with an activator such as WASp can start the actin polymerization. It binds to the side of an actin filament and nucleates to initiate growing of a new Y-shaped filament branch at a 70° angle. In this formation, the structures of two subunits Arp2 and Arp3 are similar to actin. These two subunits are then triggered by the binding of activator to mimic the barbed end of a filament.
 
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Arp23 side branching model.png|Arp23 side branching model
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===== Spire =====
Unbranched actin filaments are produced by spire that has WH2 domains each bind to an actin monomer to complete the nucleation. The mechanism associated with spire is totally different from those with formin and Arp2/3 complex. By organizing actin monomers into a prenucleation complex, spire makes template for filmation formation.

Consider the polymerization reaction in detail. Assume an actin filment with n subunits A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. This filment can bind an additional actin monomer, A, to form A&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;. The given equation is the following:

K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;=[A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]*[A]/[A&lt;sub&gt;n+1]&lt;/sub&gt;]

K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the dissociation constant, which defines the equal concentration of polymers of length n+1 and for the polymers of length n. Therefore, the polymerization reaction will proceed until the monomer concentration is reduced to the value of K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Functions ==

Some major roles of actin include:
(1) Being the structural makeup and support of the cytoskeleton. 

(2) Dividing and producing cells in order to enable cells to move spontaneously and actively. 

(3) Serving as a supportive framework for myosin proteins during muscle contraction. 

(4) Acting as a track for the cargo transport myosins in non-muscle cells.

'''β- and γ- actin Proteins'''

The mammalian cytoskeleton proteins β- and γ- actin have amino acid sequences that are extremely similar, yet they both have significantly different functions in the cell. β-actin proteins are partly responsible for the cell mobility by pushing the cell forward, whereas γ-actin proteins promote cell adhesion. The β-actin protein structure changes when arginine is added, while γ-actin structure doesn’t change. Scientists have been trying to distinguish between the two proteins from their form and function. They found that slow translation of γ-actin leads to quick degradation by the proteasome in the cell because both arginylation and ubiquitination are allowed. Ubiquitination is a protein post-translation modification (PTM) process which results in labeling of the proteins so that they are sent to the proteasome to be destroyed. On the other hand, the fast translation of β-actin permits only arginylation and stabilizes the protein. γ-actin is less stable than β-actin due to the occurrences of many codons in its gene that slows down the rate of translation. β-actin proteins use different codons that code for the same amino acids. Lysine is an important amino acid found in both β-actin and γ-actin proteins. Researchers found that slowing the rate of translation experimentally allows for the process of ubiquitination by revealing the Lysine to ubiquitin and leads to the quick degradation of the γ-actin proteins.

==Actomyosin Powerstroke Pathway==
The powerstroke of actomyosin is linked through three events which lead to the release of products from ATP hydrolysis (inorganic phosphate and ADP): myosin head binding to actin, structural changes in the head causing strong actomyosin interaction, and the swinging of the lever. The study of ATP hydrolysis-linked enzymatic force generation is difficult to perform because efficient force generation requires the powerstroke to occur while myosin is bound to actin.  And this process can only begin when myosin is in a low actin-affinity state, so it is quite rare to observe this occurrence.

Myosin has three different parts, a motor domain, the lever and the tail region.  The motor domain is what swings the lever during powerstroke of actomyosin, it has three main parts: the nucleotide pocket, the actin-binding region and the relay region.  Three loops: P-loop, Switch 1 and Switch 2 are attached to the nucleotide pocket and face the actin-binding and relay region.  Weak interactions with actin is begun in the lower part of the actin-binding region, then when the cleft closes, the upper part of the actin-binding region folds over the actin and produces stronger binding interactions.  The relay region interprets the conformation of the now folded actin-binding region and swings the lever from the primed “up” position down, the distance traveled by the lever determines the size of the powerstroke.

Kinetics block the ‘futile’ lever swing in an actin-detached state which leads to an ATP-wasting cycle. The ATP binds to myosin rapidly following a quick conformational equilibrium between down-lever and up-lever states (also known as the recovery step); this is followed by the hydrolysis of ATP. ATP can only be hyrdolized by myosin in the up-lever state. When myosin bings to ADP and P, it results in weaker interactions and the release of the P reduces the complexes stability and is rate-limiting in the absence of actin.; this is contradictory to previously thought rate-limiting step: release of inorganic phosphate. Release of inorganic phosphate is only possible during the down-lever state. In the absence of actin, myosin is mostly in the ADP and Pi bound up-state.

Over the past couple decades; many myosin conformations have been identified via crystallization process which teaches us about the allosteric communication pathways between the actin-binding region and the lever region during powerstroke.  Experiments have revealed that energy barriers in myosin enzymatic steps, nucleotide binding, ADP release and conformational changes directly depends on the actions of the lever, meaning that the lever controls energy in the myosin complex during powerstroke.

The actin affinity is determined by the nucleotide content of the active site allosterically. Nucleotide-free and ADP-bound forms of myosin have been found to strongly bind actin, but in complexes where the gamma-phosphate sites are occupied with ATP or ADP-Pi, weak actin affinity is found. This is due to the allosteric coupling between the actin-binding region and the nucleotide pocket which is in the more distant regions of the motor domain. The actin affinity is determined by the conformation of the actin-binding region. The affinity depends primarily on the equilibrium of the switch 1 loop of the nucleotide pocket, which can have an open or closed conformation. The actomyosin powerstroke is initiated by myosin at low actin affinity.

An effective powerstroke stems from the pathway of actin-induced acceleration of the lever swing. The lever swing of ADP-Pi-bound myosin is accelerated by actin by over two orders of magnitude. Therefore actin activation is a crucial part in an effective powerstroke, despite the fact that it starts in a weak actin-affinity, or ADP-Pi, state.  The reaction flux is brought into the kinetic pathway involving the lever swing cause by the powerstroke.  The reaction flux is then brought towards the actin attachment after the futile lever swing is kinetically blocked.  This however is not thermodynamically favorable but this non-equilibrium situation is necessary because this pathway has higher free-energy.  This is known a kinetic pathway selection and is used to force a reaction through a more efficient pathway rather than a futile one that would be thermodynamically stable.

Another effective powerstroke pathway also begins with a weak actin attachment to a actomyosin complex.  But an opening and closing of the actin-binding region, as opposed to just, is what causes the lever swing.  In another method, the powerstroke might begin right after the weak binding of the lower actin-region on the myosin.  Both of these alternative reaction pathways will result a reaction flux much like the original one described above.  This shows that the reaction flux will also undergo kinetic pathway selection, something that scientists have began studying recently in detail to determine how important it is in physiological function.

[[File:Group specific reagent.jpg|right|550 px]]
Irreversible inhibitors are covalently or noncovalently bound to the target enzyme and dissociates very slowly from the enzyme.  There are three types of irreversible inhibitors: group-specific reagents, reactive substrate analogs also known as affinity labels and suicide inhibitors.  
* '''Group specific reagents''' react with specific amino acid side chains like diisopropylphosphofluoridate '''(DIPF)''' and iodoacetamide.  For example, only 1 of the 28 serine residues in chymotrypsin is modified by DIPF.  This means that this specific residue is especially reactive; moreover, it is implied that this specific residue lies in the active site of the enzyme '''chymotrypsin'''.  DIPF has also provided data that suggests, through its binding with active serine residues, that there is indeed a reactive serine residue contained within the active site of the enzyme [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Acetylcholinesterase|Acetylcholinesterase]].  The inactivating functionality of DIPF and similarly-shaped molecules in acetylcholinesterase is representative of a group of compounds, known as nerve agents.  
[[File:Irreversible inhibitors.png|thumb|]]

* '''Affinity labels''' (Reactive substrate analogs) are structurally similar to the substrate that can covalently bind to the active site and are therefore more specific than group specific reagents.  An example is Tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone '''(TPCK)''' which is an analog for chymotrypsin which binds to the active site and reacts irreversibly with the histidine residue to inhibit the enzyme.  Another example is triose phophate isomerase which mimics the substrate and binds covalently to the active site and then modifying the enzyme so it becomes irreversibly inhibited. 
* '''Suicide inhibitors''' (Mechanism-based inhibitors) bind to the enzyme as a substrate and is processed by a normal catalytic mechanism that generates a chemically reactive intermediate that inactivates the enzyme through covalent modification. An example of a mechanism-based inhibitor can be seen through the inhibitory power of the planar proline intermediate formed during proline racemization. During this process, a trigonal intermediate is formed, and the formation of the racemase is inhibited because the tetrahedral intermediate necessary for formation of the product is not formed. The isomerization of proline through the planar transition state underscores the essence of transition-state analogs as potent inhibitors of enzymes. 

Irreversible inhibition is covalent modification of enzymes such that the chemical reaction is not reversible; the inhibition molecules has specificity for their own enzyme to inactivate them, such that they work by changing active site of enzymes; the binding of enzyme to inhibitor forms enzyme complex that is reversible and not covalent that reacts to form another complex that can not work for catalysis reaction. The inhibition reaction can be changed by reversible competition of enzyme and substrate or other reversible inhibitor.

      <comment>/* Ground State */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ground State ==
An electron is in its ground state meaning it is in its lowest energy state, in other words, an electron is in its excited state whenever it is not in its ground state. An excited state of a molecule is known to have higher energy levels than its ground state. The third law of thermodynamics states that the system is at its ground state when it is at absolute zero degree in temperature, which causes the entropy of the reaction to be determined by the degeneracy of that ground state. However, some systems will have zero entropy due to its physical/chemical properties.

== Pre-steady State ==
In the first moment after an enzyme is mixed with substrate, no product has been formed and no intermediates exist. The study of the next few milliseconds of the reaction is called pre-steady-state kinetics. Pre-steady-state kinetics is therefore concerned with the formation and consumption of enzyme–substrate intermediates (such as ES or E*) until their steady-state concentrations are reached.

This approach was first applied to the hydrolysis reaction catalysed by chymotrypsin. Often, the detection of an intermediate is a vital piece of evidence in investigations of what mechanism an enzyme follows. For example, in the ping–pong mechanisms that are shown above, rapid kinetic measurements can follow the release of product P and measure the formation of the modified enzyme intermediate E*. In the case of chymotrypsin, this intermediate is formed by an attack on the substrate by the nucleophilic serine in the active site and the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.

In the figure below, the enzyme produces E* rapidly in the first few seconds of the reaction. The rate then slows as steady state is reached. This rapid burst phase of the reaction measures a single turnover of the enzyme. Consequently, the amount of product released in this burst, shown as the intercept on the y-axis of the graph, also gives the amount of functional enzyme which is present in the assay.
[[File:pre-steady-state.pdf]]

== Steady State ==
The steady state assumption was proposed by George Briggs and John Haldane in 1942. In this assumption, the concentrations of the intermediates of a reaction remain the same even when the concentrations of starting materials and products are changing. Steady state occurs when the rate of formation and breakdown of the intermediate are equal. The steady state assumption relies on the fact that both the formation of the intermediate from reactants and the formation of products from the intermediate have rates much higher than their corresponding reverse reactions. In other words, steady state assumes that k1&gt;&gt;k-1 and k2&gt;&gt;k-2.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Antigen is a macromolecule that causes an immune response by lymphocytes. Antigen receptor, a surface protein located on B cells and T cells, binds to antigens and initiates acquired immune responses. The antigen receptors on B cells are called B cell receptors (or membrane immunoglobulins) and the antigen receptors on T cells are called T cell receptors.

[[Image:antigen_receptor_chem114A.jpg]]

Antigens may either be proteins or polysaccharides. In general, an antigen is defined as a substance that binds to specific antibodies, which in the human body are used to find and neutralize any potentially harmful foreign substances in the bloodstream. The specific binding between antigen and antibody is similar to that of the lock-and-key binding model.

In human blood, the different lettering of different blood types is designated by the specific antigen present in the individual's blood cells. While all types contain the oligosaccharide (O) antigen, the A and B blood types are defined by having N-acetylgalactose (A) or galactose (B) monosaccharide. Likewise, the AB blood group has both A and B antigens. Additional antigens are bound to define the positive or negative state of the ABO blood groups. The structures of the enzymes that bind to the antigen are similar and very slightly different, demonstrating antigen specificity.

== Applications ==

Besides being used in the indirect ELISA technique to detect the presence of antibody, antigens can also be used to prepare '''vaccines''' to establish or to improve immunity to a particular disease.


When pathogens get into the blood and lymph, antigens on the surfaces of the pathogens stimulate lymphocytes to produce specific antibodies which kill the pathogens by lysis, enhanced phagocytosis, clumping the pathogen together, or neutralizing the toxins from pathogens.

In wake of first (primary response) infection involving a particular antigen, the responding naive cells proliferate to produce a colony of cells, most of which transform into plasma cells or effector B cells (which produce the antibodies) to resolve the infection, and the rest persist as the memory cells that can survive for years, or indeed even for a lifetime. This is a complicated set of reactions that needs a latent period for the production of antibodies.

During the invasion of the same type of pathogens, however, previously produced memory cells trigger lymphocytes to produce much a larger amount of antibodies immediately. Unlike antibodies produced in the primary response that can only be maintained for a short period of time, the antibodies produced in the secondary response can be maintained for a longer period, usually for years.

Knowing these facts, vaccines are made to stimulate the production of memory cells to get one ready for the exposure to that kind of pathogens in the future.

[[Image:Responses.jpg]]

Levels of antibodies produced during the primary response and secondary response


There are three types of '''antigen-based vaccines, namely, purified, recombinant, and synthetic'''.


'''Purified antigen vaccines''', sometimes called '''subunit vaccines''',composed small fragments of molecules purified directly from the pathogen that generates a &quot;protective&quot; immune response.  These molecules can be proteins, polysaccharides or exotoxins (i.e. bacterial proteins either
chemically inactivated or attenuated (derived from mutated
organisms) to prevent toxicity in the host.)

Example: Vaccines against causative agents of meningitis in children


'''Recombinant antigen vaccines''' are immunogenic proteins produced by genetic engineering. DNA encoding for an immunogenic protein of a pathogen can be inserted into either bacteria, yeast, viruses which infect mammalian cells, or by transfection of mammalian cells. The cells will then produce the protein endogenously and the protein can
be harvested. 

Example: surface protein of Hepatitis B virus (HBsAg)


'''Synthetic Antigen Vaccines''' are peptide antigens synthesized by automated machines. Synthetic polynucleotide technology also exists while synthetic polysaccharide technology is still under development. Which sequences to choose requires knowledge of the
conformational structures for B cell epitopes (sequential v.
assembled) and of the anchor residues of MHC for T cell
epitopes. Computer algorithms are available to assist in selection,
but trial-and-error approach is still required. Other aids include the
generation of &quot;protective&quot; monoclonal Abs (B cell epitopes &amp; phage-display libraries) and the peptide-dependent restimulation of T cells from convalescent subjects (T cell epitopes).

A ligase helps to form a bond between smaller molecules in order to form one large joined molecule by catalytic methods. This reaction usually involves the hydrolysis of a minor group branching off from one of the smaller molecules and usually needs ATPase, or some form of energy in order to carry out the reaction. This can be illustrated by the following reaction:

Aa + Bb --&gt; Aa-B + b

Where [A] and [B] denote large molecules, [a] and [b] denote smaller molecules, and the dash [-] represents a new bond formed.

==DNA ligase==
DNA ligases are vital enzymes that function in important cellular processes, such as: DNA replication, repair of damaged DNA, and recombination. The enzyme forms phosphodiester bonds between adjacent 3'-OH and 5'-phosphate terminals to link the double stranded DNA. However, ligases may also repair and restore the nicks and cuts between double stranded DNA, double stranded RNA, or hybridized DNA/RNA strands. 

Ligases can be classified into two groups depending on their requirement for ATP or NAD+ as the cofactor. All eukaryotic and viral enzymes require ATP, and most prokaryotic enzymes require NAD+ for their activity.

[[Image:DNA_Ligase.jpg]]
[[Image:Dnaligase.JPG]]

==Ligase mechanism==

Ligases are a type of enzyme that can catalyze ligation of two substrates through ATP hydrolysis. Ligases are seen in DNA and RNA ligation, where they bind two nucleotides by forming covalent phosphodiester bonds between 3'-OH ends of one nucleotide with the 5' phosphate end of another. The catalysis mechanism involves three steps:

1.	The lysine residue of the enzyme is covalently linked to the adenylyl group from ATP and form an enzyme-AMP intermediate. The reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate in ATP. The ATP is the larger molecule in the graph shown below.
[[Image:Ligase1.jpg]]
2.	The adenynyl group of the enzyme-nucleotide intermediate is transferred to the 5’ phosphate group on the DNA strand.
[[Image:Ligase2.jpg]]
3.	The 3’-OH of the DNA strand attacks the phosphorus atom to displace the adenynyl group and form a phosphodiester bond in the DNA. By forming a pyrophosphate linkage and a good leaving group in the previous step, the 3’-OH of one nucleotide is readily bonded through nucleophilic attack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
Lyases are enzymes that catatyze the cleavage of C-C, C-O, C-N bonds by other means than by hydrolysis or oxidation. These bonds are cleaved by the process of elimination and the resulting product is the formation of a double bond or a new ring. This class of enzymes differs from other enzymes in that two substrates are involved in one reaction direction, but only one substrate is involved in the other direction. To generate either a double bond or a new ring, the enzyme is acted upon the single substrate and a molecule is eliminated. Lyases can be seen in the reactions of the Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs cycle) and in glycolysis. 

In glycolysis, the lyase called aldolase catalyzes the readily reversible splitting of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP),into the products glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). This is an example of a lyase that helps to cleave carbon-carbon bonds.
[[Image:lyasesexample.png|frame| The reaction that takes place in the second stage of glycolysis.]]

A subclass of lyases is the Carbon-Carbon Lyases, which contain the decarboxylases, the aldehyde-lyases catalyzing the reversal of an aldol condensation, and the oxo-acid lyases catalyzing the cleavage of a 3-hydroxy acid, or the reverse reactions. Another subclass is the Carbon-Oxygen Lyases, which contain the hydro-lyases catalyzing the cleavage of C-O bonds by the elimination of water. Other C-O Lyases catalyze the elimination of an alcohol from a polysaccharide or the elimination of a phosphate. Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases are enzymes that release ammonia or its derivatives by forming a double bond or ring (CH-CH(-NH-R)-  &gt;C=CH- + NH2-R). Also, a specific enzyme, synthase, is responsible for catalyzing the synthesis process, and belongs to the class of Lyases that catalyze the reverse reaction.

Lyase also are enzymes that aid in breaking bonds, which often later result in the formation of a double bond or a cyclic structure by means of catalytic pathways. These types of reactions only calls for one molecule in the forward reaction, but needs two molecules for the reverse reaction.

An example of a lyase-catalyzed chemical reaction is a step in glycolysis: the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate from 2-phosphoglycerate, where dehydrations are involved to form the double bonds (refer to Bell p. 427 for diagram). 
The reaction, ATP &gt; cAMP + PPi is catalyzed by the enzyme lyase.

[[Image:dehydrationexample.png|frame|The formation of phosphoenolpyruvate from the dehydration of 2-phosphoglycerate. The dehydration forms a double bond between two carbons.]]

Lyases cleave bonds in 6 different manners:

1) Carbon-Carbon bonds

2) Carbon-Oxygen bonds

3) Carbon-Nitrogen bonds

4) Carbon-Sulfur bonds

5) Carbon-Halide bonds

6) Phosphorous-Oxygen bonds

The means of this cleaving is through oxidation or hydrolysis.  When acting on the single substrate, a molecule is eliminated and this generates a new double bond or a new ring. The naming of the group is formed according to 'substrate group-lyase'. For example, decarboxylase is a carbon-carbon lyase that adds or removes carboxyl groups from different organic compounds.

Example 1: Carbon-Carbon Lyases: These compounds contain decarboxylase, as explained above; aldehyde lyase which catalyzes the reverse reaction of aldol condensations; and oxo-acid lyases which catalyze the cleavage of many 3-hydroxy acids.

Example 2: Carbon-Oxygen Lyases: These enzymes catalyze the cleavage of a carbon-oxygen bond, as explained above. In hydro-lyases, this process is facilitated through the elimination of water; the same can be done by the elimination of alcohol groups as well as phosphate groups.

Example 3: Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases: This enzyme releases ammonia, while simultaneously forming a double bond or ring. Some of these enzymes can also catalyse the elimination of an amine or amide group.  The following reaction is catalyzed by carbon-nitrogen lyase: CH-CH(-NH-R) &gt; C=CH + NH2-R.  Alternatively, the mechanism may also undergo the following reaction under carbon-nitrogen lyase enzyme: C(-OH)-CH(-NH2) &gt; CH2-CO + NH3.  Both illustrate the powerful cleaving ability of this enzyme at the carbon-nitrogen bond.

Example 4: Carbon-Sulfur Lyases: These enzymes work by eliminating or substituting dihydrogen sulfide (H2S) from a reaction.

Example 5: Carbon-Halide Lyases: This enzyme utilizes a mechanism which eliminates hydrochloric acid (HCl) from Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane (DDT), a synthetic pesticide.

Example 6: Phosphorous-Oxygen Lyases: The enzyme eliminates diphosphate from nucleotide triphosphates such as ATP.


'''Lyase Deficiency Disorder'''

Lyase deficiency, also referred to as HMG-CoA lyase deficiency, is rare inherited disorder in which the body can't process the amino acid leucine. Also, the disorder prevents the body from synthesizing ketones, which are used for energy during periods where the body is without food.  The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition, but may be at risk of passing it onward to the next generation.

The symptoms of lyase deficiency usually appear within the first year of life. The condition causes episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, lethargy, and weak muscular development. During a stint with the symptoms, blood sugar levels can become hypoglycemic, or very low, and a buildup of harmful compounds can cause the blood to become too acidic. If untreated, the disorder can lead to breathing problems, convulsions, coma, and even death.  Infection, strenuous exercise, and other physical stresses can lead to bouts with the symptoms from lyase deficiency.


'''Treatment for Lyase Deficiency Disorder'''

1) Going long periods without eating food could amplify the symptoms of lyase deficiency so therefore someone with the disease should make sure they eat frequently and in good balance.  

2) Eating foods high in carbohydrates and low in protein and fat may help prevent low blood sugar levels.

3) Taking L-Carnitine may aid in the body making cellular energy, which would help greatly when the body feels lethargic and dehydrated.

4) Even without the body's ability to produce leucine through the form of the enzyme lyase, most people may live a healthy lifestyle if they monitor their eating, exercising, and blood sugar levels carefully.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A transferase is an enzyme that aids in the transferring of a functional group from one molecule to another. The functionl group detaches from the donor molecule and forms a bond with the acceptor through catalytic pathways. The donor molecule is usually small non-protein molecules known as coenzymes.

As the name states, transferases transfer functional groups, such as amino group, acyl group, phosphate group, and glycosyl group, between donors and acceptors. 

A page with a list of transferases can be found here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferases]

==Nomenclature and Classification==

Transferases are commonly labeled as acceptor transferases or donor transferases depending on the target transfer.  Functional groups can also be found in the name describing the functional group that the transferase transfers. There is also a classification system in which transferases are organized. This system is called the EC system. In this system there are 9 subgroups each beginning with EC 2. They are mainly organized by the functional groups that they transfer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">MHC, also known as the Major Histocompatibility Complex is attached to a host cell and it produces a protein that can basically present an antigen fragment to other cells (such as T cells), which will then take an appropriate action depending on what fragment is being presented.  The interaction of the antigen fragment with the MHC molecule and T Cell receptor is an event that the acquired immunity (our immune system) uses in order to destroy pathogens that are not meant to be in the body.
The MHC is a large genomic region or gene family that is found in most vertebrates. It is the region that most densely contains the genes of the mammalian genome and is important for the success of the immune system, autoimmunity, and reproduction. Proteins that have been encoded by the HMC are expressed on the surface of cells in all jawed vertebrates and display both self and nonself antigens to a type of white blood cell known as a T cell that has the ability to kill or coordinate the killing of pathogens, infected, or malfunctioning cells.

==Variation of MHC proteins==
Different forms of MHC proteins are present in different people. 
This variation aids in the prevention of a widespread epidemic, since if all people had the same MHC proteins and a pathogen mutated to avoid being presented by MHC proteins, the entire population would be susceptible to the pathogen. 
This variation is also why a &quot;match&quot; is needed for a successful organ transplant. That is, rejections of transplanted organs by the immune system are often caused by too much variation in the MHC genotypes  of the organ donor and acceptor. The hereditary nature of MHC structure reveals why immediate family members are the best candidates for an organ donor.


==Subgroups==
The MHC region is divided into three subgroups: MHC class I, MHC class II, and MHC class III.
MHC class I is responsible for encoding heterodimeric peptide-binding proteins, as well as antigen-processing molecules such as TAP and Tapasin. MHC class I can be found in all nucleated cells. the MHC class I proteins contain an α chain and β2-micro-globulin. They present antigen fragments to cytotoxic T-cells that will bind to the CD8 on cytotoxic T-cells.
MHC class II is responsible for encoding hetrodimeric peptide-binding proteins and proteins that modulate antigen loading onto MHC class II proteins in the lysosomal compartment such as MHC II DM, MHC II DQ, MHC II DR, and MHC II DP. MHC class II can be found on antigen-presenting cells. MHC class II proteins contain α and β chains and they present antigen fragments to T-helper cells by binding to the CD4 receptor on the T-helper cells.
The MHC class III region is responsible for encoding for other immune components, such as complement components (C2, C4, factor B) and some that encode cytokines (TNF-α) and also hsp. Class III has a very different function than do class I and II, but it has a locus between the other two, so they are frequently discussed together.

===Responses===
The MHC proteins act as &quot;signposts&quot; that show fragmented pieces of an antigen on the host cell's surface. These antigens can be either self or nonself. If they are nonself, there are two ways by which the foreign protein can be processed and recognized as being &quot;nonself.&quot; The first method is when the phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes, degrade foreign particles that are engulfed during a process known as phagocytosis. Degraded particles are then presented on MHC class II molecules. The other method involves the host sell first being infected by a bacterium or virus, or being diagnosed as cancerous, then it may be able to display the antigens on its surface with a Class I MHC molecule. Cancerous cells and cells infected by a virus usually display unusual, nonself antigens on their surface. These nonself antigens, despite which type of MHC molecule they are displayed on, will initiate the specific immunity of the host's body. It is important to remember that cells constantly process endogenous proteins and display them within the context of MHC I. Immune effector cells are then built up to be non-reactive to self peptides within MHC, and are then able to recognize when foreign peptides are being presented during infection or cancer.

==HLA Genes==
The most well known genes in the MHC region are the group that encodes cell surface antigen-presenting proteins. These genes are referred to as human leukocyte antigen genes in humans, though people often abbreviate MHC to mean the HLA gene products. Some of the biomedical literature uses HLA to refer to the HLA protein molecules and uses MHC for the region of the genome that encodes for this molecule, though this is not consistently adhered to. The most intensely studies HLA genes are the nine classical MHC genes: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C. HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1. The MHC is divided into three regions: Class I, II, and III. The A, B, and C genes belong to the first class, whereas the six D genes belong to the second class. Besides being scrutinized by immunologists for its pivotal role in the immune system, the MHC has also attracted the attention of many evolutionary biologists, due to the high levels of allelic diversity found within many of its genes. Indeed, much theory has been spent to explaining why this specific region of the genome harbors so much diversity, especially in light of its immunological importance.

==Molecular Biology of MHC Proteins==
The classical MHC molecules have a vital roles in the complex immunological dialogue that must occur between T-cells and other cells of the body. At the time of maturity, MHC molecules are anchored in the cell membrane, where they display short polypeptides to T cells, via the T cell receptors (TCRs). The polypeptides may be &quot;self,&quot; meaning they originate from a protein created by the organism itself, or they may be foreign, &quot;nonself,&quot; where they originate from bacteria, virus, pollen, etc. The overarching design of the MHC-TCR interaction is that T-cells should ignore self peptides while reacting appropriately to the foreign peptides. The immune system has another and equally important method for identifying an antigen. B-cells with their membrane-bound antibodies, also known as B-cell receptors (BCRs). BCRs of B-cells do not require much outside help in order to bind to antigens while TCRs of T-cells require &quot;presentation&quot; of the antigen, which is the job of the MHC. During the vast majority of the time, MHC are kept busy presenting self-peptides, which the T-cells should appropriately ignore. All MHC molecules receive polypeptides from inside the cells they are part of and display them on the cell's exterior surface for recognition by T-cells.

==MHC Evolution and Allelic Diversity==
MHC gene families are found in almost all vertebrates, though the gene composition and genomic arrangement vary widely. Gene duplication is almost certainly responsible for much of the genetic diversity. MHC is littered with many pseudogenes in humans. One of the most striking features of the MHC is the astounding allelic diversity found therein, and especially among the nine classical genes. The most conspicuously diverse loci, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1, have roughly 250, 500, and 300 known alleles respectively, which is a truly exceptional exemplification of diversity. The MHC gene is the most polymorphic in the genome. Population surveys of the other classical loci routinely find tens to a hundred alleles, which is still relatively high in diversity. Many of these alleles are quite old, too. It is often the case that an allele from a particular HLA gene is more closely related to an allele found in chimpanzees than it is to another human allele from the same gene. The allelic diversity of MHC genes has created fertile grounds for evolutionary biologists. The most important task for theoreticians is to explain the evolutionary forces that have created and maintained such diversity. Most explanations invoke balancing selection, a broad term that identifies any kind of natural selection in which no single allele is absolutely most fit. Frequency-dependent selection and heterozygote advantage are two types of balancing selection that have been suggested to explain MHC allelic diversity. However, recent models have suggested that a high number of alleles is not plausibly achievable through heterozygote advantage alone. Pathogenic co-evolution, a counter-hypothesis, has recently emerged. It theorizes that the most common alleles will be placed under the greatest pathogenic pressure, thus there will always be a tendency for the least common alleles to be positively selected for. This creates a &quot;moving target&quot; for pathogen evolution. As the pathogenic pressure decreases on the previously common alleles, their concentrations in the population will stabilize, and they will usually not go extinct if the population is large enough, and a large number of alleles will remain in the population as a whole. This explains the high degree of MHC polymorphism found in the population, although an individual can have a maximum of 18 MHC I or II alleles.

==MHC and Natural Selection==
It has been suggested that MHC plays a role in the selection of potential mates. MHC genes make molecules that enable the immune system to recognize invaders. Generally, the more diverse the MHC genes of the parents, the stronger the immune system of the offspring. It would obviously be beneficial, therefore, to have evolved systems of recognizing individuals with different MHC genes and preferentially selecting them to breed with.

      <comment>/* Class I MHC molecules */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Class I MHC molecules==
The Class I MHC molecules are found on almost all the cells in the body (except for antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells as well as the non-nucleated cells such as red blood cells).  It is found extending from the plasma membrane of body cells that have been infected with a virus or are otherwise abnormal (for example, cancerous).  MHC Class I proteins bind to foreign antigen fragments (peptides) that are derived from intracellular proteins.  For example, any cell that can become infected with a form of cancer will synthesize foreign antigens and then present them on the surface of the cell by the MHC I molecule. The T cell receptor of a Cytotoxic T cell that recognizes the MHC I-peptide complex binds to it with the aid of CD8, a protein found on the surface of cytotoxic T cells. This activates the cytotoxic T cell, stimulating its release of perforin, which increases permeability of the target cell membrane, and granzymes, which enter the target cell and initiate apoptosis, killing the target cell and fragmenting both its DNA and that of the virus. The cytotoxic T cell then detaches from the MHC I molecule and proliferates 
forming active cytotoxic T cells, which attack other infected body cells expressing the same antigen fragment, and memory cytotoxic T cells which will help produce a faster response to the virus if it attacks again.

Properly functioning MHC I molecules are essential in fighting cancer. That is, the immune cells of a person with defective MHC I molecules would not be able to recognize that cells had become cancerous, so no immune response would take place.
&lt;/br&gt;


&lt;b&gt;The interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells&lt;b&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1&lt;b&gt; A fragment of foreign protein (antigen) inside the cell associates with the components of an MHC molecule on the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported to the cell surface&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2&lt;b&gt; The combination of MHC molecule and antigen fragment is recognized by a cytotoxic T cell&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3&lt;b&gt; Cytotoxic T cells kill the infected cell.&lt;/br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Class II MHC molecules are made by '''antigen presenting cells''' (dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells) which help trigger an acquired immune response. Antigen presenting cells ingest foreign antigens via phagocytosis or endocytosis and break it down into peptide fragments that bind to MHC Class II molecules which bring the antigen fragment to the surface of the cell to be recognized by the '''T cell receptor''' on the surface of '''Helper T Cells'''. The T cell receptor binds to the MHC II-antigen fragment complex with the aid of the CD4, a protein receptor on the surface of helper T cells, and once bound, the helper T cell becomes active and begins proliferating and secreting cytokines.  

When Helper T cells proliferate, both memory helper T cells, and to a larger extent, active helper T cells are made. '''Memory helper T cells''' contribute to the acquired immune response by quickly proliferating in the case of a secondary &quot;attack&quot; by the antigen producing a faster, stronger response to the antigen. '''Active helper T cells''' have a shorter life span than memory helper T cells and help initiate an immune defense against the pathogen by secreting '''cytokines''' that stimulate the activation of nearby B cells and Cytotoxic T cells. Once activated, '''cytotoxic T cells''' destroy infected cells via apoptosis while the '''plasma B cells''' secrete specific antibodies that neutralize and eliminate the pathogen. The cytotoxic T cells and B cells will also proliferate to produce their respective memory cells for use in a second attack by the pathogen.

In the case of HIV, the Helper T cells are the cells that are directly attacked by the virus.  They are completely killed off, which means that no more Helper T cells are able to create cytokines and call the other phagocytic cells to reproduce and create an immune response.  This causes the death of all Helper T cells, as well as the death of the immune system.  Because of this, the person that has HIV/AIDS does not die of the virus, but can die of (i.e.) a common cold, because the immune system has no way to respond to it.

      <comment>/* Different Types of the Myosin */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Myosins  are a large super-family of motor proteins that move along actin filaments, while hydrolyzing ATP to forms of mechanical energy that can be used for a variety of functions such as muscle movement and contraction. About 20 classes of myosin have been distinguished on the basis of the sequence of amino acids in their ATP-hydrolyzing motor domains. The different classes of myosin also differ in structure of their tail domains. Tail domains have various functions in different myosin classes, including dimerization and other protein-protein interactions.

==Structure==
Myosin is a common protein found in the muscles which are responsible for making the muscle contract and relax. It is a large, asymmetric molecule, and has one long tail as well as two globular heads.  If dissociated, it will dissociate into six polypeptide chains. Two of them are heavy chains which are wrapped around each other to form a double helical structure, and the other four are light chains.  One main characteristic of myosin is its ability to bind very specifically with actin.  When myosin and actin are combined together, that makes the muscle produce force.

[[Image:MYOSIN_ACTIN_BINDING_CHEM114A.jpg]]

==Sarcomeres and the Sliding Filament Theory==
Skeletal muscles are responsible for voluntary movement. Skeletal muscles contain many muscle fibers and these muscle fibers are actually made up of myofibrils, bundles of thick myosin filaments and thin actin filaments. Myofibrils are constructed and lined up in a chain-like formation to create what are called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres contain several regions. One region is called the A-bands and only consist of myosin filaments. The counterpart of A-bands is the I-bands that only contain actin filaments. The ends of each sarcomere are called Z discs. A middle region of each sarcomere called the H-zone only contains myosin. 

[[File:sarcomere_chem114a.jpg]]

According to the sliding filament theory by Andrew Huxley and Ralph Niedergerke, muscles contract when Z-discs come closer together thus shortening the sarcomeres. Actin filaments from the I-bands become very short while myosin filaments from the A-bands do not change in length. The actin filaments are actually sliding towards the H-zone and the A-bands thus creating an overlap of myosin and actin filaments. As this overlap occurs, myosin filaments are binding to the actin filaments, allowing myosin to function as the driving motor of filament sliding. 

[[File:contraction_chem114a.jpg]]

This relative movement between myosin and actin is what results in muscle contraction. The molecular basis for muscle action and contraction is explained in the next section.

==Mechanism of muscle movement==
This mechanism of contraction is also called &quot;The Sliding Filament Theory.&quot;
* ATP binding to the myosin head causes and it is in its low-energy conformation
* The active site closes and ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi. This induces a conformational change (cocking of the head) resulting in  myosin weakly binding to actin. This forms a cross-bridge.
* Pi release results in conformational change that leads to stronger myosin binding, and the power stroke.
* ADP dissociation leaves the myosin head tightly bound to actin. 
* Binding of a new molecule of ATP to myosin head triggers it to let go of actin and the cycle starts all over again.
* In the absence of ATP, this state results in muscle rigidity called rigor mortis.

[[Image:MuscleSlidingfilament2.gif]]

==Different Types of the Myosin==
Myosin has groups of protein that divide the motor proteins. The motor proteins are involving actin filaments that hydrolyze ATP. There are 20 different types of Myosin that already distinguished by amino acid sequence.
All 20 types of Myosin have different structure following by tail domain. Because Each classes have characteristic of dimerization, and protein interactions. However, there are known classes in the Myosin. Myosin I, Myosin II, Myosin V and VI.   

'''Myosin I'''

Among the proteins whose genes have been linked to deafness are several types of myosin. Myosin I appears to cross-link actin filaments to control the tension inside each stereocilium. The ratcheting activity of this myosin motor along the actin filaments may adjust the sensitivity of the hair cells to different sounds. Other types of myosin use their motor 
activity to redistribute cellular constituents along the length of the actin filaments.

'''Myosin II'''

MyosinII consists of six polypeptied chains: two 220-kD heavy chains and two pairs of different light chain that vary in size between 15 and 22kD, depending on their source. The N-terminal half of each individual heavy chain assumes a globular form that is stretched in one direction. Coming up next is a roughly 100 Angstrom long alpha helix stiffened by the two light chains wrapping around it. This portion of the protein acts as a lever when the muscle contracts. The C-terminal half of the heavy chain takes the form of alpha-helix that ends as a long, fibrous chain. Two of those associate and takes the form a left-handed coiled-coil motif. The overall shape of myosin is a rod 1600 Angstroms long with two globular heads. 

'''Myosin V'''

MyosinV has a different structure of motor. It has a two headed motor protein which heavy chains diverge. That means actin dependent transport move to axon associated vesicle effect on a melanin. Both microtubule and actin filaments lead to the speculation and affect to the hair color. Myosin V is also a two-headed protein, but it doesn't form a thick filament like Myosin II. Myosin V acts by itself - the domain at the tail-end binds a vesicle that has pigments as its cargo. The lever region of this protein is long enough to have six light chains bound to it, giving it three times greater capacity for those light chains than Myosin II's counterpart lever arm. Under electron microscope (EM) image of Myosin V bound to F-actin filament, it is estimated that the globular heads have thirteen actin subunits between them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|F Sharp|Lists|Sets and Maps}}

{{fsharpTitle|Sequences}}

'''Sequences''', commonly called '''sequence expressions''', are similar to lists: both data structures are used to represent an ordered collection of values. However, unlike lists, elements in a sequence are computed ''as they are needed'' (or &quot;lazily&quot;), rather than computed all at once. This gives sequences some interesting properties, such as the capacity to represent infinite data structures.

== Defining Sequences ==
Sequences are defined using the syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;seq { expr }&lt;/source&gt;

Similar to lists, sequences can be constructed using ranges and comprehensions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; seq { 1 .. 10 };; (* seq ranges *)
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [1; 2; 3; 4; ...]

&gt; seq { 1 .. 2 .. 10 };; (* seq ranges *)
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [1; 3; 5; 7; ...]

&gt; seq {10 .. -1 .. 0};; (* descending *)
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [10; 9; 8; 7; ...]

&gt; seq { for a in 1 .. 10 do yield a, a*a, a*a*a };; (* seq comprehensions *)
val it : seq&lt;int * int * int&gt;
= seq [(1, 1, 1); (2, 4, 8); (3, 9, 27); (4, 16, 64); ...]&lt;/source&gt;

Sequences have an interesting property which sets them apart from lists: elements in the sequence are ''lazily evaluated'', meaning that F# does not compute values in a sequence until the values are actually needed. This is in contrast to lists, where F# computes the value of all elements in a list on declaration. As a demonstration, compare the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let intList =
    [ for a in 1 .. 10 do
        printfn &quot;intList: %i&quot; a
        yield a ]
        
let intSeq =
    seq { for a in 1 .. 10 do
            printfn &quot;intSeq: %i&quot; a
            yield a };;

val intList : int list
val intSeq : seq&lt;int&gt;

intList: 1
intList: 2
intList: 3
intList: 4
intList: 5
intList: 6
intList: 7
intList: 8
intList: 9
intList: 10

&gt; Seq.nth 3 intSeq;;
intSeq: 1
intSeq: 2
intSeq: 3
intSeq: 4
val it : int = 4

&gt; Seq.nth 7 intSeq;;
intSeq: 1
intSeq: 2
intSeq: 3
intSeq: 4
intSeq: 5
intSeq: 6
intSeq: 7
intSeq: 8
val it : int = 8&lt;/source&gt;
The list is created on declaration, but elements in the sequence are created as they are needed.

As a result, sequences are able to represent a data structure with an arbitrary number of elements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; seq { 1I .. 1000000000000I };;
val it : seq&lt;bigint&gt; = seq [1I; 2I; 3I; 4I; ...]&lt;/source&gt;

The sequence above represents a list with one trillion elements in it. That does not mean the sequence actually contains one trillion elements, but it can ''potentially'' hold one trillion elements. By comparison, it would not be possible to create a list &lt;code&gt;[ 1I .. 1000000000000I ]&lt;/code&gt; since the .NET runtime would attempt to create all one trillion elements up front, which would certainly consume all of the available memory on a system before the operation completed.

Additionally, sequences can represent an infinite number of elements:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let allEvens = 
    let rec loop x = seq { yield x; yield! loop (x + 2) }
    loop 0;;

&gt; for a in (Seq.take 5 allEvens) do
    printfn &quot;%i&quot; a;;
0
2
4
6
8
val it : unit = ()&lt;/source&gt;
Notice the definition of &lt;code&gt;allEvens&lt;/code&gt; does not terminate. The function &lt;code&gt;Seq.take&lt;/code&gt; returns the first &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; elements of elements of the sequence. If we attempted to loop through all of the elements, fsi would print indefinitely.

: '''Note:''' sequences are implemented as state machines by the F# compiler. In reality, they manage state interally and hold only the last generated item in memory at a time. Memory usage is constant for creating and traversing sequences of any length.

== Iterating Through Sequences Manually ==
The .NET Base Class Library (BCL) contains two interfaces in the &lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.generic.aspx System.Collections.Generic]&lt;/code&gt; namespace:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type IEnumerable&lt;'a&gt; =
  interface
   (* Returns an enumerator that iterates through a collection *)
    member GetEnumerator&lt;'a&gt; : unit -&gt; IEnumerator&lt;'a&gt;
  end

type IEnumerator&lt;'a&gt; =
  interface
   (* Advances to the next element in the sequences. Returns true if 
      the enumerator was successfully advanced to the next element; false
      if the enumerator has passed the end of the collection. *)
    member MoveNext : unit -&gt; bool

    (* Gets the current element in the collection. *)
    member Current : 'a

    (* Sets the enumerator to its initial position, which is 
       before the first element in the collection. *)
    member Reset : unit -&gt; unit
  end
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt; type is defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type seq&lt;'a&gt; = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable&lt;'a&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt; is not a unique F# type, but rather another name for the built-in &lt;code&gt;System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable&lt;/code&gt; interface. Since &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&lt;/code&gt; is a native .NET type, it was designed to be used in a more imperative style, which can be demonstrated as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System
open System.Collections

let evens = seq { 0 .. 2 .. 10 } (* returns IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; *)

let main() =
    let evensEnumerator = evens.GetEnumerator() (* returns IEnumerator&lt;int&gt; *)
    while evensEnumerator.MoveNext() do
        printfn &quot;evensEnumerator.Current: %i&quot; evensEnumerator.Current
    
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
            
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;evensEnumerator.Current: 0
evensEnumerator.Current: 2
evensEnumerator.Current: 4
evensEnumerator.Current: 6
evensEnumerator.Current: 8
evensEnumerator.Current: 10&lt;/pre&gt;

Behind the scenes, .NET converts every &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop over a collection into an explicit while loop. In other words, the following two pieces of code compile down to the same bytecode:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
| width=&quot;50%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let x = [1 .. 10]
for num in x do
    printfn &quot;%i&quot; num&lt;/source&gt;
| width=&quot;50%&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let x = [1 .. 10]
let enumerator = x.GetEnumerator()
while enumerator.MoveNext() do
    let num = enumerator.Current
    printfn &quot;%i&quot; num&lt;/source&gt;
|}

All collections which can be used with the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; keyword implement the &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&lt;'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; [[F Sharp Programming/Interfaces|interface]], a concept which will be discussed later in this book.

== The &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; Module ==
Similar to the List modules, the &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; module contains a number of useful functions for operating on sequences:

'''val append : seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt;'''
: Appends one sequence onto another sequence.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let test = Seq.append (seq{1..3}) (seq{4..7});;
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [1; 2; 3; 4; ...]
&lt;/source&gt;

'''val choose : ('T -&gt; 'U option) -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; seq&lt;'U&gt;'''
: Filters and maps a sequence to another sequence.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let thisworks = seq { for nm in [ Some(&quot;James&quot;); None; Some(&quot;John&quot;) ] |&gt; Seq.choose id -&gt; nm.Length }
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [5; 4]
&lt;/source&gt;

'''val distinct : seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt;'''
: Returns a sequence that filters out duplicate entries.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let dist = Seq.distinct (seq[1;2;2;6;3;2])
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [1; 2; 6; 3]
&lt;/source&gt;

'''val exists : ('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; bool'''
: Determines if an element exist in a sequence.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let igualADois x = x=2
&gt; let existe = Seq.exists igualADois (seq{3..9})
val igualADois : int -&gt; bool
val it : bool = false
&lt;/source&gt;

'''val filter : ('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt;'''
: Builds a new sequence consisting of elements filtered from the input sequence.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; Seq.filter (fun x-&gt; if x%2=0 then true else false) (seq{0..9})
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [0; 2; 4; 6; ...]
&lt;/source&gt;

'''val fold : ('State -&gt; 'T -&gt; 'State) -&gt; 'State -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; 'State'''
: Repeatedly applies a function to each element in the sequence from left to right.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let sumSeq sequence1 = Seq.fold (fun acc elem -&gt; acc + elem) 0 sequence1
Seq.init 10 (fun index -&gt; index * index)
|&gt; sumSeq
|&gt; printfn &quot;The sum of the elements is %d.&quot;
&gt; 
The sum of the elements is 285.

val sumSeq : seq&lt;int&gt; -&gt; int
&lt;/source&gt;

: '''Note:''' sequences can only be read forward-only manner, so there is no corresponding &lt;code&gt;foldBack&lt;/code&gt; function as found in the List and Array modules.

'''val initInfinite : (int -&gt; 'T) -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt;'''
: Generates a sequence consisting of an infinite number of elements.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; Seq.initInfinite (fun x -&gt; x*x)
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [0; 1; 4; 9; ...]
&lt;/source&gt;

'''val map : ('T -&gt; 'U) -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; seq&lt;'U&gt;'''
: Maps a sequence of type &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; to type &lt;code&gt;'b&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; Seq.map (fun x-&gt;x*x+2) (seq[3;5;4;3])
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [11; 27; 18; 11]
&lt;/source&gt;

'''val nth : int -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; 'T'''
: Returns the ''nth'' value of a sequence.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; Seq.nth 3 (seq {for n in 2..9 do yield n})
val it : int = 5
&lt;/source&gt;

'''val take : int -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt;'''
: Returns a new sequence consisting of the first ''n'' elements of the input sequence.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; Seq.take 3 (seq{1..6})
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [1; 2; 3]
&lt;/source&gt;

'''val takeWhile : ('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt;'''
: Return a sequence that, when iterated, yields elements of the underlying sequence while the given predicate returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, and returns no further elements.
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let sequenciaMenorqDez = Seq.takeWhile (fun elem -&gt; elem &lt; 10) (seq {for i in 0..20 do yield i+1})
val sequenciaMenorqDez : seq&lt;int&gt;
&gt; sequenciaMenorqDez;;
val it : seq&lt;int&gt; = seq [1; 2; 3; 4; ...]
&lt;/source&gt;

'''val unfold : ('State -&gt; ('T * 'State) option) -&gt; 'State seed -&gt; seq&lt;'T&gt;'''
: The opposite of &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt;: this function generates a sequence as long as the generator function returns &lt;code&gt;Some&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let fibs = (0I, 1I) |&gt; Seq.unfold (fun (a, b) -&gt; Some(a, (b, a + b) ) );;

val fibs : seq&lt;bigint&gt;

&gt; Seq.iter (fun x -&gt; printf &quot;%O &quot; x) (Seq.take 20 fibs);;
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181&lt;/source&gt;

The generator function in &lt;code&gt;unfold&lt;/code&gt; expects a return type of &lt;code&gt;('T * 'State) option&lt;/code&gt;. The first value of the tuple is inserted as an element into the sequence, the second value of the tuple is passed as the accumulator. The &lt;code&gt;fibs&lt;/code&gt; function is clever for its brevity, but its hard to understand if you've never seen an unfold function. The following demonstrates &lt;code&gt;unfold&lt;/code&gt; in a more straightforward way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let test = 1 |&gt; Seq.unfold (fun x -&gt;
    if x &lt;= 5 then Some(sprintf &quot;x: %i&quot; x, x + 1)
    else None );;

val test : seq&lt;string&gt;

&gt; Seq.iter (fun x -&gt; printfn &quot;%s&quot; x) test;;
x: 1
x: 2
x: 3
x: 4
x: 5&lt;/source&gt;

Often, its preferable to generate sequences using &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt; comprehensions rather than the &lt;code&gt;unfold&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_general_circuit_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;An op-amp implementation of the voltage compensation idea.]]__TOC__


&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== What the problem is ===

Negative feedback is a key concept of analog electronics that endows analog circuits with unique properties. So we can see this powerful idea everywhere in analog electronics; the great masses of analog circuits, mainly op-amp ones, are negative feedback circuits. The more interesting of them are circuits with ''parallel negative feedback'' (inverting negative feedback circuits) where the two voltage sources (the input and the output one) interact with each other through the feedback circuit.

[[Image:Classic transimp ampl 450.jpg|left|thumb|280px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1: Transimpedance amplifier.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Classic_r-c_integrator_450.jpg|right|thumb|280px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2: Op-amp RC inverting integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Maybe, [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|transimpedance amplifier]] (Fig. 1), [[#An inverting amplifier|inverting amplifier]] and [[#A negative capacitor|RC inverting integrator]] (Fig. 2) are the most popular of them (see the list [[#List of popular op-amp circuits based on this idea|below]] for more circuits). It seems paradoxical but it is true that although these circuits are extremely simple (they consist only of one or two passive elements and an op-amp) and they are invented many years ago... these circuits are still unexplained. Why?

In order to really understand these legendary circuits, we have to answer dozens of questions: &quot;What do the passive elements do in these circuits? What does the op-amp do? What is its function there? Where do the currents flow? Does the current depend on the values of the passive elements and how? Are the input and output sources connected or they are separated? Why are these circuits inverting? Why a virtual ground appears between the two passive elements? Is it desired or undesired phenomenon? What is the use of it? Does the op-amp need a differential input or only a bare single-ended input? What happens when the op-amp saturates? What is the total impedance of the two passive elements connected in series? Is there any connection between these circuits and negative impedance circuits? May we say that the op-amp of the inverting circuits acts as a negative resistor?&quot; Let's  answer these interesting questions.

=== The general structure ===

If we scrutinize circuits based on the voltage compensation idea, we will discern three kinds of such circuits. The most of them (inverting amplifier, RC inverting integrator - Fig. 2, etc.) consist of two consecutively connected devices: the first converts the input voltage to a current; the second converts back this current to an output voltage. So we can present them as a system of two consecutively connected dual converters: a ''voltage-to-current converter'' and a ''current-to-voltage converter''&lt;ref&gt;Here, we mean more ''general converters'', not only the classical linear [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|passive voltage-to-current converter]] and [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|active current-to-voltage converter]]&lt;/ref&gt;. There are also circuits consisting only of a voltage-to-current converter ([[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|classical op-amp voltage-to-current converter]]) and only of a current-to-voltage converter ([[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|transimpedance amplifier]] - Fig. 1). Well, let's build a typical circuit with voltage compensation step-by-step to reveal the truth about these circuits.

=== Converting voltage to current ===

In life, we may observe many [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter#Basic non-electrical idea: Pressure causes flow|situations]], where a pressure-like quantity puts in motion a flow-like one (''pressure causes flow''). In order to flow, in these cases we apply the pressure through an impediment. Some examples are ''mechanical'' (a motor drives a belt), ''pneumatic'' (a constant pressure pump moves air through a closed loop of pipes), ''water'' (the height difference between the two communicating vessels causes water to flow), ''thermal'' (heat flows from the warm to the cold end of a metal bar), ''informational'' (data flows through the phone line), ''money'' (the rich give money to the poor:) and other analogies. Let's convey this idea to the electrical area (Fig. 3).

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_1_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3: Converting voltage to current.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Well, what do we have in the beginning? We have an exciting voltage source producing a voltage V. What do we want to obtain? We want to produce a current I; we want to make a ''voltage-to-current converter''. So, in order to make a current flow, we have to close the circuit in some way. But we must nоt simply short the voltage source by a pice of wire as the current will be infinite and unpredicted. We want to obtain a current depending in some completely definite way on the voltage; we need some functional relation between the output current and the input voltage.

For this purpose, we have to close the circuit by an element setting the desired finctional relation so that it to set, form, shape the current as we want. Depending on the nature of this ''current-setting element'' we obtain various devices acting as ''voltage-to-current converters'': linear - a [[#An inverting amplifier|classic voltage-to-current converter]]&lt;ref name=v-to-i&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|Op-amp inverting voltage-to-current converter]] (compensating the external losses by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;w:v-to-i&quot;&gt;[[w:Voltage-to-current converter|Voltage-to-current converter]] introduces the passive and active versions of the circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; (resistor), non-linear - an [[#An antilogarithmic diode converter|antilogarithmic converter]] (a diode), time-dependent - an [[#An inductive integrator|integrator]] (an inductor) and a [[#A capacitive differentiator|differentiator]] (a capacitor), etc. We may also keep the voltage constant and to vary the magnitude of the element's attribute - we obtain a ''resistive sensor'' (a variable resistor). Finally, we may vary both the input voltage and the element's attribute thus obtaining an &quot;analog-digital divider&quot; (a DAC with R-2R ladder).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Converting current to voltage ===

Conversely, there are many [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter#Basic non-electrical idea: Flow causes pressure|situations]] in our routine where ''flow causes pressure''. In these cases, to make a pressure appear, we place an obstacle in front of something moving. Some examples are ''mechanical'' (if we try to stop a moving car with our, it exerts pressure to us:), ''pneumatic'' (imagine a constant flow pump moving air through a closed loop of flexible pipes - pinch the hose in the middle and you will see that a pressure appears across the bottleneck), ''social'' (stand in someone's way and you will experience a &quot;pressure&quot;:), etc. Let's convey this idea in the electrical area (Fig. 4).

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_2_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4: Converting current to voltage.&lt;/center&gt;]]

By connecting the Element 1 ([[#Converting voltage to current|Fig. 3]]) we have already obtained a current I as a function of the input voltage V and the Element 1's attribute (R, C, L). But we have not created this current without any purpose. We need this current; we would like to consume it for some purpose. In the simplest case, we connect another Element 2 (Fig. 4) acting as a current load (e.g., an active ammeter&lt;ref name = &quot;ammeter&quot;&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/building_circuits/ammeter/op-amp_ammeter/op-amp_ammeter.htm How do we build an op-amp ammeter?]&lt;/ref&gt;), LED, solenoid, electric motor, etc.) that consumes directly the current I.

More frequently, we want to obtain a voltage depending in a definite way on the current; we need some functional relation between the output voltage and the input current. For this purpose, we insert the Element 2 with the purpose to set the desired finctional relation so that it to form, shape, set the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; as we want. Again, depending on the nature of this ''voltage-setting element'' we can obtain various devices acting now as inverse ''current-to-voltage converters'': linear - a [[#A negative resistor|classic current-to-voltage converter]]&lt;ref name=i-to-v&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|Op-amp inverting current-to-voltage converter]] (compensating the internal losses by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;w:i-to-v&quot;&gt;[[w:Current-to-voltage converter|Current-to-voltage converter]] introduces the passive and active versions of the circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; (a resistor), non-linear - a [[#A negative diode|logarithmic converter]] (a diode), time-dependent - an [[#A negative capacitor|integrator]] (a capacitor) and a [[#A negative inductor|differentiator]] (an inductor), etc. We may also keep the voltage constant and to vary the magnitude of the element's attribute - we obtain a ''resistive sensor'' (a variable resistor). Finally, we may vary both the input current and the element's attribute thus obtaining an &quot;analog-digital multiplier&quot; (another DAC with R-2R ladder).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== A problem appears ===

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_2a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5: V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; is a disturbing but helpful voltage drop.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Unfortunately, a nasty problem appears... The Element 2 (resistor, capacitor or inductor) impedes the current by its inherent resistance, capacitance or inductance. As a result, a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; appears across it; it represents the energy losses. The Element 2 absorbs this energy from the input voltage source: it dissipates energy from the source to outside environment (if it is a resistor) or it accumulates energy into itself (if it is a capacitor, a secondary battery or an inductor). It is not so important for the input voltage source if the Element 2 dissipates or accumulates energy; it is only important for it that the Element 2 absorbs some part of its energy.

''The problem is that the output voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Element 2 enervates the input voltage V and thus affects the current (Fig. 5).'' Now the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;E1&lt;/sub&gt; = V - V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; instead only the excitation voltage V determines the current; as a result, the current decreases. So, from the point of view of the input voltage source the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; is troublesome and the input source &quot;would like&quot; this voltage not to exist. Contrary, from the point of view of the load, V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; is a useful voltage drop as it serves as an output quantity. So the load &quot;would like&quot; this voltage to exist and even to be as much as possible high.

Obviously, there is a contradiction here - ''the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Element 2 has to exist and, at the same time, not to exist''. How do we solve this contradiction?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Solving the problem: ''removing the disturbance by an equivalent &quot;antidisturbance&quot;'' ===

We know we may find a remedy in our routine. What do we do in real life when we solve some problem but a disturbance has stood in our way? First, we may brace our energies to overcome the disturbance. But there is another solution - someone can help us by adding as much efforts as it is needed to overcome the disturbance (''to remove the disturbance by an equivalent &quot;antidisturbance&quot;''). Here are some funny examples.

If someone has broken our window in winter, we may turn on a heater or turn on an air-conditioner in summer. If the windows become dirty, we switch on additional lamps inside the room to &quot;help&quot; the sun. When a car has come into collision with our car, the insurance company compensates the damages caused by the else's car. If someone (e.g., our wife) is spending money from our account, we begin depositing money into the account to restore the sum:) When we go to mountain, we stock with food, water, medicine, etc. to use them if a problem appears.

Note that in all these cases we ''do not increase the power of the main source to compensate the losses''; instead, we ''add energy by an additional &quot;helping&quot; power source to &quot;help&quot; the main source'' and, as a result, to compensate the losses. The reason of doing that is because in the most cases the first solution is just impossible. For example, we cannot increase the power of the sun to adjust the temperature or the light inside the room (we cannot control directly the sun); so we connect additional thermal or light sources inside the room to &quot;help&quot; the sun.

=== Connecting an additional &quot;helping&quot; voltage source... ===

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_3_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6: Where do we connect the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source?&lt;/center&gt;]]

Similarly, our circuit cannot increase the voltage of the input voltage source to compensate the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Element 2 (although this technique is used in bootstrapped current sources) since the input voltage source does not belong to the circuit. It may be distant; it is just inaccessible.

Then let's apply the second remedy - ''to connect an additional voltage source in order to compensate the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt;''. It will add an additional &quot;helping&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; to the input voltage V that will compensate the &quot;disturbing&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Element 2. As a result, the total current-creating voltage will remain unchanged: V - V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = V - V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; = V.

Well, we have to sum the &quot;helping&quot; voltage to the input one. So Kirchhoff's second law can give us the simplest idea how to sum the two voltages: we have to break somewhere the circuit and connect an additional &quot;helping&quot; voltage source in the same direction as the input voltage source travelling the loop (- V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; +, - V +). It is wonderful but where do we connect the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source (Fig. 6)?

At first glance, it is no matter where we will connect the &quot;helping&quot; source; wherever we connect it the problem will be solved (the current will remain unchanged). Only, in circuitry we have always to consider the ''common ground problem''. Let's then consider all the possible places where we may place the &quot;helping&quot; source.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== ...under the input voltage source? NO!... ====

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_4_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7: ...under the input voltage source? NO!&lt;/center&gt;]]

First, we may place the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source ''under the input voltage source'' - Fig. 7. We may think of the combination of the two connected in series voltage sources as a composed battery with total voltage V&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; + V or as a &quot;helped&quot; input voltage source. 

However, the input voltage source becomes &quot;floating&quot;; it has not connected to the common ground. This is inconvinient for us since in circuitry we prefer to ground voltage sources, converters and loads. The reason of that is because we usually use devices with single-ended inputs and we supply many devices by one common power supply. So all these devices are preliminary connected in parallel to the common power supply and then we cannot connect them in series (very rarely, as an exception, we may use &quot;floating&quot; driving devices&lt;ref name=Sheingold&gt;[http://www.philbrickarchive.org/1964-1_v12_no1_the_lightning_empiricist.htm Impedance and admittance transformations using operational amplifiers] is a genuine source from Philbrick Reserches (written by D. H. Sheingold).&lt;/ref&gt;). So we refuse this solution.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== ...above the input voltage source? NO!... ====

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_5_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8: ...above the input voltage source? NO!&lt;/center&gt;]]

With the same success we may place the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source ''above the input voltage source'' - Fig. 8 (again, the combination of the two connected in series voltage sources serves as a composed battery with total voltage V + V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt;).

However, now the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source becomes floating. This is inconvinient for us as we frequently use the &quot;helping&quot; voltage as an output one that drives a device (a converter or a load) with a single-ended input (examples are the [[#A negative resistor|current-to-voltage converter]], the [[#A negative diode|logarithmic converter]], the [[#A negative capacitor|integrator]], the [[#A negative inductor|differentiator]], etc.) In this case we have to use a load with a differential input. So we refuse this solution as well.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== ...above the Element 2? NO!... ====

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_6_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9: ...above the Element 2? NO!&lt;/center&gt;]]

Then, we may place the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source ''above the Element 2'' - Fig. 9. Again the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source becomes floating. This is inconvinient for us as we will use its voltage as an output one and we have to use a load with a differential input. So, again we refuse this solution...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== ...under the Element 2? YES! ====

Finally, we may place the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source ''under the Element 2'' - Fig. 10. Eureka! Now both the input and the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source are grounded and the famous virtual ground appears above the Element 2. The input voltage source V &quot;sees&quot; only the impedance of the Element 1 since the latter is grounded virtually from the right.

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_7_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10: ...under the Element 2? YES!&lt;/center&gt;]]

From another viewpoint, we may think of the combination of the input voltage source and Element 1 as an input current source that is just...&quot;fooled&quot;:) It doesn't &quot;understand&quot; that a disturbing element is connected; it has the &quot;feeling&quot; that its output is shorted. So this simple current source works at ideal load conditions and, as a result, the current depends only on the input voltage and on the Element 1's attribute (R, C, L).

What a magic! The Element 2 has disappeared; it is nothing more than a piece of wire! Imagine now we may think of this circuit as consisting only of two components - the input voltage source V and the Element 1! This is wonderful... but where do we take the output voltage from? Let's begin thinking...

&lt;center&gt;'''Where to take the output voltage from'''&lt;/center&gt;

'''Remedy 1. NO!''' We cannot use the [[#A problem appears|old circuit output]] (the point between the Element 1 and Element 2) just because we have already destroyed this voltage and this point has become a [[w:Virtual ground|virtual ground]]. 

'''Remedy 2. NO!''' Then let's try using the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Element 2. However, in order to connect a load in parallel to the &quot;floating&quot; Element 2, the load has to have a differential input. Moreover, if the load has some resistance, it will shunt the Element 2 thus affecting the current. What do we do then?

'''Remedy 3. YES!''' Recall to mind the cases from our routine when we prefer to estimate indirectly some quantity X. For this purpose, we first destroy the unknown quantity by an equal &quot;anti-quantity&quot; Y = X; then, we measure the &quot;anti-quantity&quot; Y, in order to know the magnitude of the initial quantity X. An example - classic weighing by using a balance. Let's convey this powerful idea in the electrical area (Fig. 10).

Eureka! ''We use the &quot;copy&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; of the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source as an output instead the &quot;original&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Element 2''! What a great idea! First, the load is connected to the common ground; second, it consumes energy from the &quot;helping&quot; source V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; instead from the input source V!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Generalization ==


'''Circuits with voltage compensation consist of three components connected in series: a ''passive Element 1'', a ''passive Element 2'' and a ''&quot;helping&quot; voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' (Fig. 10). The Element 1 converts the exciting (input) voltage V into a current I and the Element 2 converts back the current into a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt;. We need this voltage drop... but it disturbs the current. So the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; compensates the &quot;disturbing&quot; voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; by adding the same voltage to the exciting voltage source V. As a result, the Element 2 is &quot;neutralized&quot;; it has disappeared and the current depends only on the exciting voltage and the Element 1. If we need a current output, we connect the current load in the place of the Element 2; if we need a voltage output, the compensating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; can serve as a perfect &quot;mirror&quot; output voltage - powerful, grounded and inverting.'''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Limitations ==

=== Maximum voltage drop across the Element 2 ===

In our world power sources are limited; in electricity, voltage sources are limited too. So, in circuits with voltage compensation, the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source can produce a compensating voltage in some finite operating range. It can compensate maximum voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Element 2 that is equal to its maximum &quot;helping&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;Hmax&lt;/sub&gt;. When V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds V&lt;sub&gt;Hmax&lt;/sub&gt; the magic of voltage compensation ceases. They name the maximum voltage drop across the Element 2 (the load) ''compliance voltage''.

In the passive circuit ([[#A problem appears|Fig. 5]]), the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Element 2 is always less than the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. It is interesting that here - in the voltage compensated circuit ([[#...under the Element 2? YES!|Fig. 10]]), the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; and its &quot;mirror copy&quot; - the compensating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H2&lt;/sub&gt;, can exceed at that many times V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. An inverting amplifier is an example of this situation.

=== Maximum current through the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source ===

In the voltage compensated circuit ([[#...under the Element 2? YES!|Fig. 10]]), the input current flows through the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; as well; so the latter must endure this current. That is why the popular digital multimeters do not work that way. In order to measure current, they use the imperfect passive current-to-voltage converter instead of the almost ideal [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|op-amp current-to-voltage converter]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|Op-amp inverting current-to-voltage converter]]&lt;/ref&gt;. The reason for applying such an old-fashioned approach to current measurements is that all the input current flows through the op-amp output and its power supply; so the latter has to be able to endure the input current measured. The conclusion is the op-amp current-to-voltage converter is a perfect circuit but it is suitable only for low-current applications.

== Real op-amp implementations ==

=== General circuits ===

==== ...without using negative feedback... ====

[[Image:Follower_volt_comp_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 11: A voltage follower creates the compensating voltage.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Element E2 is &quot;flying&quot;. So we might use a voltage follower with differential input that &quot;copies&quot; the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; and adds an equivalent voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; in series to the input voltage V (Fig. 11). In this arrangement, the voltage drop across the Element E2 is an &quot;original&quot; and the  following voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; is its &quot;mirror copy&quot;.

Is there any negative feedback in this arrangement? No, it is not. Instead, a slight positive feedback can exist if the Element 2 is a kind of a resistor. Look at Fig. 11 again to convince yourself of this assertion. When, for example, the input voltage increases the current I, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt;, the follower output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; and the total current-creating voltage V + V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; increase as well. This increases additionally the current I; we name this phenomenon ''positive feedback''.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== ...by using negative feedback. ====

[[Image:Flying_follower_volt_comp_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 12: A voltage follower with floating power supply can create the compensating voltage.]]

In circuitry, we implement voltage followers exceptionally by applying a negative feedback. First, we may use a classic op-amp voltage follower (with a ''local'' negative feedback between its output and inverting input) as a &quot;helping&quot; voltage source (Fig. 12). For this purpose, we have to supply the op-amp with floating voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; and to reverse its output terminals, in order to add its output voltage to the input one. In this way, the local op-amp's ground serves as an output while the very op-amp's output is connected to the common circuit ground. Although we have guessed for ourselves at this trick, it is proposed as far back as in early 1960s&lt;ref name=Sheingold&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Note although we have applied a local negative feedback between the op-amp's output and its inverting input the op-amp does not &quot;observe&quot; the virtual ground in this arrangement. In addition, the op-amp has to have a differential input.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_general_circuit_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 13: In all the op-amp inverting circuits with negative feedback the op-amp creates a compensating voltage.]]

The most reliable arrangement (Fig. 13) is if we make the op-amp compare its output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; (by subtracting) with the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; across the Element 2 and change it so that to keep a zero difference between them. That means we have applied a ''global'' negative feedback. Note in this arrangement, we have made the op-amp &quot;observe&quot; the virtual ground. As a result, the op-amp output voltage is a &quot;mirror&quot; copy of the &quot;disturbing&quot; voltage drop across the Element 2. The op-amp may have a bare single-ended input as its input voltage (the difference V&lt;sub&gt;OA&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt;) is measured regarding to the ground.

Actually, all the practical [[#List of popular op-amp circuits based on this idea|op-amp circuits with voltage compensation]] are based on this arrangement.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Limitations ====

We have already discussed [[#Limitations|above]] the limitations of the general voltage compensation arrangement. Let's now only concrete them.

'''Compliance voltage.''' It is more than obvious that the ''compliance voltage'' of the op-amp circuits with voltage compensation is less than the supply voltage V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;. So, in order to enlarge the &quot;magic&quot; region of voltage compensation, we have to increase the supply voltage and, of course, to use high-voltage op-amps.

'''Maximum input current.''' Also, it is obvious that the maximum input current entering the op-amp circuits with voltage compensation has not to exceed the maximum op-amp output current. If we want to pass bigger input current, we have to put a power booster after the op-amp's output and into the feedback loop.

=== Concrete op-amp circuits ===

Now let's consider some typical op-amp circuit applications implementing the great voltage compensation idea. In this section, we will investigate four legendary circuits where various Elements 1 (linear, non-linear and time-dependent) are connected between the input voltage source and the inverting input. Also, the same Element 2 - an ohmic resistor R (R2), is connected between the op-amp output and the inverting input. In this arrangement, the op-amp compensates the voltage drop across the resistor R by an equivalent &quot;mirror&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = -V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. For this purpose, the op-amp adjusts its output voltage so that to keep zero voltage V&lt;sub&gt;(-)&lt;/sub&gt; at the inverting input (the virtual ground). 

==== An inverting amplifier ====

Let's first investigate the famous inverting amplifier where another ohmic resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; serves as Element 1 (Fig. 14a). For this purpose, let's drive the circuit with a linearly increasing through time voltage (the ramp on the first drawing at Fig. 14b).

[[Image:Inv_ampl_volt_comp_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 14a: An op-amp inverting amplifier (a circuit diagram).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Inv_ampl_graph_volt_comp_1000.jpg|left|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 14b: An op-amp inverting amplifier (operation).&lt;/center&gt;]]

Starting at the instant t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the current flowing through the resistors begins changing linearly. As a result, the voltage drop across the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the second drawing) changes linearly toward the positive rail, the output voltage (the fourth drawing) changes linearly with the same rate to the negative rail and their difference - the voltage of the inverting input (the third drawing), stays always zero (this point behaves as a virtual ground). The resistance R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as though disappears and the input source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;sees&quot; only the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; so the current depends only on the input voltage and the resistance R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; according to Ohm's law (I = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). We may think of all the circuit as consisting only of two elements - a voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; driving the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Actually, the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; acts as a perfect voltage-to-current converter&lt;ref name = &quot;w:v-to-i&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

This &quot;magic&quot; lasts till to the instant t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; while the op-amp succeeds to compensate the voltage drop across the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with its output voltage. As they say, the op-amp operates in active (linear) mode. Unfortunately, at the moment t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the output voltage reaches the negative rail. The op-amp saturates and begins serving just as a steady voltage source (think of it just as a bare battery). The resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;appears&quot; again and begins affecting the current; so the voltage drop across it begins changing slowly through time. You may think of the two resistors as a voltage divider supplied by a total voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;. So the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)*(U&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;) and the voltage of the inverting input begins changing according to this voltage drop (already there is no virtual ground).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== An antilogarithmic diode converter ====

The antilogarithmic diode converter is another legendary circuit where a non-linear &quot;resistor&quot; - the diode D, serves as Element 1 (Fig. 15a). Again a voltage that increases linearly through time (the first drawing at Fig. 15b) is the most suitable input signal.

[[Image:Antilog_volt_comp_graph_1000.jpg|left|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 15b: An op-amp antilogarithmic converter (operation).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Antilog_volt_comp_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 15a: An op-amp antilogarithmic converter.&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the beginning, the current through the diode is insignificant but approaching the moment t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, it begins changing considerably (exponentially). Accordingly, the voltage drop across the resistor R (the second drawing) changes exponentially toward the positive rail, the output voltage (the fourth drawing) changes exponentially to the negative rail and there is a virtual ground at the inverting input (the third drawing). The resistance R disappears and the input source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;sees&quot; only the diode D; so the current depends only on the input voltage and the diode D according to its exponential IV characteristic. We may think of all the circuit as consisting only of two elements - a voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; driving the diode D.

But is this circuit correct? No, it is not because we have connected a voltage source to a voltage-stable element. As a result, the circuit is very sensitive to input voltage variations; it loads the input source and it has a very limited operating region.

As above, the op-amp succeeds to compensate the voltage drop across the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with its output voltage till to the instant t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. At this moment, the output voltage reaches the negative rail and the op-amp saturates. The resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; appears and the voltage drop across it begins following the input voltage. The diode transfers the input voltage variations to the inverting input and the voltage of the inverting input begins following the input voltage (already there is no virtual ground).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A capacitive differentiator ====

In this popular circuit a time-dependent element - the capacitor C, serves as Element 1 (Fig. 16a). Let's now apply a steady input voltage at the moment t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the first drawing at Fig. 16b).

[[Image:Cap_dif_volt_comp_graph_1000.jpg|left|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 16b: An op-amp capacitive differentiator (operation).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Cap_dif_volt_comp_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 16a: An op-amp CR differentiator.&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the beginning, the capacitor transfers the whole input voltage jump to the op-amp inverting input. The op-amp, trying to keep up the virtual ground, changes sharply its output voltage (the fourth drawing) toward the negative rail and finally saturates. At the initial moment t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; maximum current flows through the capacitor; then the current begins decreasing exponentially with a big [[w:Time constant#Time constants in electrical circuits|time constant]] RC. The voltage drop across the resistor R (the second drawing) decreases exponentially as well. The voltage of the inverting input (the third drawing) changes in the same way and there is no virtual ground at this point.

At the moment t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the voltage drop across the resistor R becomes equal to +V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; and the op-amp enters the linear region. It manages to compensate the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; by its output voltage and a virtual ground appears at the inverting input. The resistance R disappears and the input source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;sees&quot; only the capacitor C; so the current depends only on the input voltage and the capacitor according to its exponential (through time) characteristic. As above, we may think of all the circuit as consisting only of two elements - a voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; driving the capacitor C. From the moment t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the time constant becomes almost zero (since R is almost zero); so the current, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and the op-amp output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; change exponentially and almost instantly.

But is this circuit correct? No, it is not because we have connected a voltage source to another &quot;voltage source&quot; (the capacitor); there is a conflict between two voltage sources. As above, the circuit is very sensitive to the input voltage variations; it loads considerably the input source and it has a very limited operating region.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== An inductive integrator ====

Finally, let's consider another time-dependent circuit with voltage compensation but, for the sake of variety, based on the dual time-dependent element - the inductor L, serving as Element 1 (Fig. 17a). As above, we will apply a steady input voltage at the moment t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the first drawing at Fig. 17b).

[[Image:Ind_int_volt_comp_graph_1000.jpg|left|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 17b: An op-amp inductive integrator (operation).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Ind_int_volt_comp_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 17a: An op-amp acting as an inductive integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Starting at the instant t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the current flowing through the inductor L and the resistor R begins changing linearly. As a result, the voltage drop across the resistor R (the second drawing) changes linearly toward the positive rail. The output voltage (the fourth drawing) changes linearly to the negative rail and their difference - the voltage of the inverting input (the third drawing), stays always zero (this point behaves as a virtual ground). The resistance R disappears and the input source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;sees&quot; only the inductor L; so the current depends only on the input voltage and the inductor L. We may think of all the circuit as consisting only of two elements - a voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; driving the inductor L. Now the inductor L acts as a ''perfect inductive integrator''. 

This wonder lasts till to the instant t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; while the op-amp succeeds to compensate the voltage drop across the resistor R with its output voltage. At the moment t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the output voltage reaches the negative rail and the op-amp saturates. The resistor R appears again and begins affecting the current; so the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across it begins changing slowly and exponentially through time with a time constant R/L. The voltage of the inverting input begins changing according to this voltage drop (already there is no virtual ground). The combination of the inductor L and the resistor R acts as an ''imperfect inductive integrator''.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Generalization ===

'''Most of the circuits with voltage compensation are implemented as op-amp circuits with parallel negative feedback where the op-amp (including the power supply) serves as a &quot;helping&quot; voltage source. It compensates the &quot;disturbing&quot; voltage drop across the Element 2 by adding the same voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = -V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; to the exciting voltage source V. For this purpose, the op-amp output voltage is negative with respect to the ground; so, all these op-amp circuits are inverting. The op-amp output voltage usually serves as a perfect circuit output voltage - powerful, grounded and inverting.'''

== Negative impedance viewpoint at voltage compensation ==

=== General circuit ===

[[Image:Neg_imp_volt_compensation_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 18: The &quot;helping&quot; voltage source acts actually as a negative impedance element.&lt;/center&gt;]]

We might use another viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Revealing the Mystery of Negative Impedance#An op-amp behaving as a simple negative impedance element|Revealing the mystery of negative impedance]] is a general story about the mystic phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; at the role of the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source in this arrangement. Look at the right part of the generalized circuit showing the voltage compensation idea ([[#...under the Element 2? YES!|Fig. 10]]). It consists of two series connected elements: the Element 2 and the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. The same current flows through the two elements and the same voltage appears across them; so, they process the same energy and they have the same impedance. But while the first of them is a passive element that consumes energy from the input voltage source, the second is an active element that adds the same energy to the input voltage source! Then, if the first element has a &quot;positive&quot; impedance Z, the second one has a negative impedance -Z (Fig. 18)! Eureka! We have &quot;invented&quot; the simplest technique for creating a negative impedance:

''Copy the voltage drop across an &quot;original&quot; passive element by a voltage follower and &quot;insert&quot; the &quot;copy&quot; voltage into the circuit to obtain a negative impedance''.

Imagine how powerful this negative impedance viewpoint is! Now we may draw important conclusions:

''In electronic circuits with voltage compensation, the compensating voltage source acts as a negative impedance element.'' More particularly, ''in op-amp circuits with parallel negative feedback (op-amp inverting circuits), the combination of the op-amp and the power supply acts as a negative impedance element.''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Concrete op-amp circuits with negative impedance ===

==== A negative resistor ====

[[Image:Neg_imp_volt_compensation_1_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 19: An op-amp acting as a negative resistor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

We have already considered the popular circuits of the [[#An inverting amplifier|inverting amplifier]], [[#An antilogarithmic diode converter|antilogarithmic diode converter]], [[#A capacitive differentiator|capacitive differentiator]] and [[#An inductive integrator|inductive integrator]] containing a resistor with &quot;positive&quot; resistance R connected between the op-amp's output and the inverting input. In all these circuits, the combination of the op-amp and the power supply actually acts as a ''negative resistor'' with negative resistance -R that &quot;neutralizes&quot; the positive resistance R. For this purpose, the negative resistor -R adds as much voltage as it loses across the positive resistor R.

----

Now let's look at further three legendary op-amp circuit with voltage compensation (op-amp [[#A negative diode|logarithmic converter]], [[#A negative capacitor|capacitive integrator]] and [[#A negative inductor|inductive differentiator]]) from this negative impedance viewpoint. In these circuits, the same Element 1 - an ohmic resistor R, is connected between the input voltage source and the op-amp inverting input. Also, various Elements 2 (linear, non-linear and time-dependent) with &quot;positive&quot; impedance are connected between the op-amp output and the inverting input. In these circuits, the combination of the op-amp and the power supply acting as an element with negative impedance &quot;neutralizes&quot; the positive impedance of the according Elements 2 in the same way - ''by adding as much voltage as it loses across the positive element''.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A negative diode ====

In a logarithmic converter containing a diode with &quot;positive&quot; non-liner resistance R&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, the combination of the op-amp and the power supply acts as a ''negative diode'' with negative resistance -R&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;. Let's investigate the circuit operation by driving the circuit with a linearly increasing through time voltage (the first drawing at Fig. 20b).

[[Image:Log_volt_comp_graph_1000.jpg|left|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 20b: An op-amp logarithmic converter (operation).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Neg_imp_volt_compensation_2_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 20a: An op-amp acting as a negative diode.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Starting at the instant t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the current passing through the diode begins changing linearly. In the beginning, the voltage across the diode (the second drawing) increases quickly; then it continues increasing slightly approaching V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. The output voltage (the fourth drawing) changes in the same way but with a negative polarity. Their difference - the voltage of the inverting input (the third drawing), stays always zero (this point behaves as a virtual ground). The diode as though disappears and the input source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;sees&quot; only the resistor R; so the current depends only on the input voltage and the resistance R according to Ohm's law (I = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R). We may think of all the circuit as consisting only of two elements - a voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; driving the resistor R. The circuit behaves actually as a perfect constant current source.

In this circuit the op-amp always succeeds to compensate the voltage drop across the diode. So, it never saturates and operates in an active (linear) mode all the time.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A negative capacitor ====

Similarly, in the legendary op-amp inverting integrator containing a capacitor with capacitive reactance X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; the combination of the op-amp and the power supply acts as a ''negative capacitor'' with negative capacitive reactance -X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. As at the circuit of an [[#An inductive integrator|inductive integrator]], we will apply a steady input voltage at the moment t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the first drawing at Fig. 21b).

[[Image:Cap_int_volt_comp_graph_1000.jpg|left|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 21b: An op-amp capacitive integrator (operation).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Neg_imp_volt_compensation_3_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 21a: An op-amp acting as a negative capacitor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

At the beginning - the instant t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, we apply a steady input voltage to the circuit and the current begins flowing through the resistor R and the capacitor C. The voltage drop across the capacitor (the second drawing) changes linearly through time toward the positive rail. The output voltage (the fourth drawing) changes linearly through time toward the negative rail and their difference - the voltage of the inverting input (the third drawing), stays always zero (this point behaves as a virtual ground). The capacitor disappears and the input source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;sees&quot; only the resistor R; so the current depends only on the input voltage and the resistance R according to Ohm's law (I = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R). We may think of all the circuit as consisting only of two elements - a voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; driving the resistor R. As above, the circuit behaves as a perfect constant current source.

This wonder lasts till to the instant t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; while the op-amp succeeds to compensate the voltage drop across the capacitor C with its output voltage. Uunfortunately, at the moment t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the output voltage reaches the negative rail and the op-amp saturates:( The capacitor appears again and begins affecting the current; so the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; across it continues changing but now exponentially through time with a time constant RC. The voltage of the inverting input begins changing according to this voltage drop (already there is no virtual ground). The combination of the resistor R and the capacitor C acts as an ''imperfect capacitive integrator''.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A negative inductor ====

Finally, in the dual op-amp inverting differentiator containing an inductor with inductive reactance X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; the combination of the op-amp and the power supply acts as a ''negative inductor'' with negative inductive reactance -X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. As at the circuit of a [[#A capacitive differentiator|capacitive differentiator]], we will apply a steady input voltage at the moment t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the first drawing at Fig. 22b).

[[Image:Ind_dif_volt_comp_graph_1000.jpg|left|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 22b: An op-amp inductive differentiator (operation).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Neg_imp_volt_compensation_4_1000.jpg|right|thumb|320px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 22a: An op-amp acting as a negative inductor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

At the initial moment t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the input source raises its voltage and tries to increase the current through the inductor L. The inductor reacts to this &quot;intervention&quot; by increasing the voltage across its terminals. The op-amp, trying to keep up the virtual ground, changes sharply its output voltage (the fourth drawing) toward the negative rail and finally saturates. 
So, the inductor produces a total voltage V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;.

Then, in the interval t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the current increases slowly and exponentially with a big time constant R/L; the voltage across the inductor (the second drawing) decreases exponentially. The voltage of the inverting input (the third drawing) changes in the same way and there is no virtual ground at this point.

Fortunately, at the moment t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; across the inductor becomes equal to +V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; and the op-amp enters the linear region:) It manages to compensate the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; by its output voltage and a virtual ground appears at the inverting input. The inductor just disappears and the input source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;sees&quot; only the resistor R; so the current depends only on the input voltage and the resistance R according to Ohm's law (I = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R). Again, we may think of all the circuit as consisting only of two elements - a voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; driving the resistor R. As above, this circuit behaves as a perfect constant current source. From the moment t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the time constant becomes almost zero (since R is almost zero); so the current, the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; across the inductor and the op-amp output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; change exponentially but almost instantly.

We ask ourselves again, &quot;Is this circuit correct?&quot; And we answer, &quot;No, it is not correct again because we have connected a current source to another current source (the inductor); so there is a conflict between two current sources. As the [[#A capacitive differentiator|capacitive differentiator]], this circuit is very sensitive to the input variations and it has a very limited operating region.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Re: Update ==

Thanks Weberna! I'll definitely check out the new version. I think I would eventually like to turn this into a site-wide gadget to make installation easier. Would that be okay with you? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:57, 8 December 2008 (UTC)

:I've added your script as a gadget. You can see it at [[MediaWiki:Gadget-collectionparser.js]]. Only admins can edit this page, so if you update your script let me know and I will update the gadget. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:16, 8 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Human Evolution ==
&lt;center&gt;''&quot;In the distant future ... psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history&quot;'' -- Charles Darwin, 1859&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C. 1859. On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (1st ed.), London: John Murray&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Biological evolution has led to the emergence of humans as a distinct species from other primates. The term &quot;human&quot;, in the context of human evolution, refers to the genus ''Homo'', but studies of human evolution usually also include other groups, such as the australopithecine hominids.

The distinct lineage of humans split off from among the other great apes around 4-7 million years ago, most likely in Eastern Africa. The earliest undisputed hominins emerged 4.4 million years ago, the earliest members of ''Homo'' arose 2.5 million years ago, while our species, ''Homo sapiens'', is not older than 200,000 years. Although considerable questions remain, a consistent picture is slowly emerging. Ancestral hominins occupied mostly forested habitats, depended on a largely fruit-based diet, and lived in small, migratory, male dominated, social groups. Around 5 million years ago geological uplifting along the rift valley, along with increasingly drier and cooler climatic conditions of the pliocene, resulted in an expansion of savanna ecosystems across eastern Africa. Trees became more widely spaced, and allowed sufficient light to reach the ground for an unbroken herbaceous layer dominated by grasses. Australopithecines appear to have ventured out into these more open woodlands in search of the ungulate fauna thriving there. A variety of ecological demands contributed to rapid specializations in a host of morphological and behavioral traits. Footprints, preserved at Laetoli, Tanzania, when rain cemented powdery volcanic ash from a recent eruption into a layer of tuff, evidence that autralopithecines already lacked the mobile big toe of apes, had an arch more typical of modern humans, and habitually walked upright. With the advent of bipedal walk, the acquisition of a larger skull cavity helped balance the head during running. Australopithecines included meat into an increasingly omnivorous diet and coordinated group hunting efforts may have hastened the development of many critical skills ranging from communication, group cohesion, sophistication in hunting, to general problem solving. The emergence of fairly small, complex social units, with increasingly egalitarian roles of the sexes, encouraged the development of skills for allowing members to better navigate alliances, deception, warfare, cannibalism, as well as sharing, teaching, and compassion.

The divergence of the genus ''Homo'' from the australopithecines about 2.5 million years ago marks the beginning of the '''Palaeolithic''' epoch (i.e. the Old Stone Age). The discovery of a hominid fossil named Turkana Boy&lt;ref&gt;Brown F, Harris J et al. (1985). Early Homo erectus skeleton from west Lake Turkana, Kenya. Nature. 4;316(6031):788-792&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, of 1.5M year old hominid tracks at Lake Turkana&lt;ref&gt;Bennet MR, Harris JWK, et al. 2009. Early Hominin Foot Morphology Based on 1.5-Million-Year-Old Footprints from Ileret, Kenya. Science 323(5918): 1197-1201&lt;/ref&gt; evidence that ''Homo erectus'' (including the sister taxa ''Homo ergaster'' and ''Homo heidelbergensis'') combined into the characteristics of an efficient, endurance runner, including a highly efficient bipedal walk, a surprisingly modern foot, elongated limbs, decreased body hair with improved ability to cool down using sweat, and an increased brain case volume. The earliest known stone tools, dated to around 1.8 million years&lt;ref&gt;Lepre CJ, Roche H et al. 2011. An earlier origin for the Acheulian. Nature (): &lt;/ref&gt;, are credited to this lineage. Behaviorally driven adaptations of food processing through tools and cooking appear to have dramatically enhanced feeding efficiency&lt;ref&gt;Organ C, Nunn CL et al. 2011. Phylogenetic rate shifts in feeding time during the evolution of Homo. PNAS 108 (35): 14555–14559&lt;/ref&gt;. This technologically advanced, now extinct, lineage exhibited a particular curiosity for exploring new terrains and it accounts for early expansions into Asia and Europe. With it fossils begin to emerge in the record in a number of new locals as diverse as Spain, Germany, Georgia, and Indonesia. 

Denisova hominids were recently discovered as members of a distinct subspecies of ''Homo sapiens'' from a cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia&lt;ref&gt;Krause et al. (2010). The complete mitochondrial DNA genome of an unknown hominin from southern Siberia. Nature 464: 894–897&lt;/ref&gt;. They are viewed as direct descendants of ''Homo erectus''' expansion into Europe and elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Meyer M, Fu Q et al. (2013). A mitochondrial genome sequence of a hominin from Sima de los Huesos. Nature 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. Subsequent study of the nuclear genome suggests that this group shares a common origin with Neanderthals, that they ranged from Siberia to Southeast Asia, and that they lived among and interbred with the ancestors of some present-day modern humans, with up to 6% of the DNA of Melanesians and Australian Aborigines deriving from Denisovans. A comparison with the genome of a Neanderthal from the same cave revealed significant local interbreeding, with local Neanderthal DNA representing 17% of the Denisovan genome, while evidence was also detected of interbreeding with an as yet unidentified ancient human lineage. The lineage '''Neanderthals'''  (''Homo neanderthalensis'') may have also descended from the ''Homo erectus'' (also ''Homo heidelbergensis'') lineage around 500-300k years ago. As hunter-gatherers they moved across Europe following the advancing and retreating glaciers of the ice age. Adapted to temperate, northern climates success largely hinged on warmer interglacial periods. Total population probably never exceeded 100,000. The presence of Neanderthal weapons in animal bone show a level of hunting sophistication that allowed them to harvest even such large game as elephants, rhinoceros, and horses. It is also now clear that Neanderthals must have cared for injured group members, conducted simple burials, and showed an appreciation for art including carvings, beads, and music. Discussion continues on whether Neanderthals were able to communicate using a spoken language, but their hyoid bones, involved in speech, were basically identical to those of modern humans. 

40,000 years ago another major African expansion of hominins lead '''modern humans''' from the taxon ''Homo sapiens'' to Europe which eclipsed Neanderthals with a number of advanced and sophisticated technologies, The rise of the new arrivals (Cro-Magnons) parallels the decline and eventual vanishing of Neanderthal culture, although whether through extinction or by intermixing with modern humans remains unclear. 

The '''mesolithic''' (i.e. the Middle Stone Age), running roughly from 10,000 to 6,000 years ago, marks the transition from a hunter-gatherer to a largely agricultural society. Different Mesolithic people began the initial stages of domestication. settled into villages of huts, developed basic tools into an industry of small implements, and invented ceramics.  

The '''neolithic'''  (i.e. the New Stone Age), marking the remaining period up to the beginning of the bronze age, witnessed the emergence of domestication of animals, including sheep and dogs, cultivation of plants, irrigation, writing, architecture, and government.&lt;ref&gt;Childe, VG. 1942.

  puts &quot;Filename: &quot;        #This is here for convenience, it simply prints the filename you are parsing to the screen.
  puts  file

Regular expressions are used to parse through the traceroute file.  The items that are parsed out of the traceroute file are the hostname, time, hop count, and the ip address.  The time or hop count items are not utilized in this script.
   hostname_regexp =       Regexp.new('(\S+)\.[a-z]*(\d)*')
   time_regexp =           Regexp.new('(&lt;*\d+\s*ms\s*){1,3}')
   hop_regexp   =          Regexp.new('(\d){1,3}')
   ipv4_regexp =           Regexp.new('((\d){1,3}\.(\d){1,3}\.(\d){1,3}\.(\d){1,3})')

All items used to store data in the database are set to nil. 
   hostname = nil
   source_addr = nil
   source_hostname = nil
   dest_addr = nil
   dest_hostname = nil
   list = File.open(file)
   firstline = list.gets()

For each line in the traceroute file, the records in the database are checked to ensure that the hostname or ip address don't already exist so that they could be added into the database.  This is happening as each ip address and hostname are parsed from the traceroute file.  
   source_addr = ipv4_regexp.match(firstline)
   source_hostname = hostname_regexp.match(firstline)
   list.each do |line|
    dest_addr = ipv4_regexp.match(line)
    dest_hostname = hostname_regexp.match(line)
    if dest_hostname
      if ipv4_regexp.match( &quot;#{dest_hostname}&quot; )
          dest_hostname = nil
      end
    end 
    source_iface = IpInterface.find_or_initialize_by_address(&quot;#{source_addr}&quot;)
                  if source_iface.new_record?
                    source_iface.node_name = &quot;#{source_addr}&quot;      #Assign the node name in the database to the source address
                    source_iface.node_device_type = 'TRACEROUTE'   #Informing the database this is from TRACEROUTE data 
                    source_iface.save false
                  end
                  dest_iface = IpInterface.find_or_initialize_by_address(&quot;#{dest_addr}&quot;)
                  if dest_iface.new_record?
                    dest_iface.node_name = &quot;#{dest_addr}&quot;
                    dest_iface.node_device_type = 'TRACEROUTE'
                    dest_iface.save false
                  end

The following is used to feed the information extracted from the traceroute file into the database.  The source_iface.layer3_interface.id refers to the source address and the dest_iface.layer3_interface.id refers to the destination address.
    traffic = Traffic.first(:conditions =&gt; { :source_layer3_interface_id =&gt; source_iface.layer3_interface.id,
                                             :target_layer3_interface_id =&gt; dest_iface.layer3_interface.id })
   unless traffic
    traffic = Traffic.create :source_layer3_interface =&gt; source_iface.layer3_interface,
                             :target_layer3_interface =&gt; dest_iface.layer3_interface,
                             :description =&gt; &quot;TRACEROUTE&quot;
   end 

The following 3 puts statements are not required, they are used for convenience and to verify that the correct hostnames and associated ip addresses are being placed in the correct table in the database.     
    puts &quot;Source Hostname Addr  #{source_hostname}  #{source_addr} &quot;
    puts &quot;Dest Hostname Addr  #{dest_hostname}  #{dest_addr}&quot;
    puts &quot;end of line&quot;

The source address and hostname must become the destination address and hostname for the next iteration of the loop (and for the graphic produced by Antfarm to make sense).
    
     source_addr = dest_addr
     source_hostname = dest_hostname
    end
  end

  if ARGV[0] == '--help'
    #print_help
  else
    ARGV.each do |arg|
      if File.directory?(arg)
        Find.find(arg) do |path|
          if File.file?(path)
            parse(path)
          end
        end
      else
        parse(arg)
      end
    end

'''Rope splicing''' is the forming of a semi-permanent join between two [[rope]]s or two parts of the same rope by partly untwisting and then interweaving their strands. Splices can be used to form a stopper at the end of a line, to form a loop or an eye in a rope, or for joining two ropes together. The resulting join is stronger than the equivalent using knots although it usually results in a thickening of the line and if subsequently removed a distortion of the rope. Most types of splices are used on 3 strand rope, but some can be done on 12 or greater strand braided rope.

==Types of splices==
*'''back splice''' (also called an '''end splice''') - A splice where the strands of the end of the rope are spliced directly back into the end without forming a loop. It is used to finish off the end of the rope to keep it from fraying. The end of the rope with the splice is about twice the thickness of the rest of the rope.  With nylon and other plastic materials, the back splice is often no longer used; the rope strands are simply fused together with heat to prevent fraying.
[[image:Cut splice.PNG|right|thumb|A cut splice]]
*'''cut splice''' (originally called cunt splice) - A splice similar to the eye splice.  It is typically used for light lines (e.g., the log-line) where a single splice would tend to come undone, the rope being frequently wet.  It makes a very strong knot.  A cut splice is a join between two ropes, made by splicing the ends slightly apart, to make an eye in the joined rope which lies shut when the rope is taut.

[[Image:Splitsar.png|frame|right|500px|Some examples of splices and splices in progress. a)  a long splice almost complete b) the steps in a tapered short splice c) an eye splice d) a short splice]]

*'''[[eye splice]]''' - A splice where the working end is spliced into the working part forming a loop.
*'''horseshoe splice'''
*'''long splice''' - A '''splice''' used to join two rope ends forming one rope the length of the total of the two ropes. The long splice, unlike most splice types, results in a splice that is only very slightly thicker than the rope without the splice, but sacrifices some of the strength of the short splice. It does this by replacing two of the strands of each rope end with those from the other, and cutting off some of the extra strands that result. The long splice allows the spliced rope to still fit through the same pulleys, which is necessary in some applications.
*'''short splice''' - Also a splice used to join the ends of two ropes, but the short splice is more similar to the technique used in other splices and results in the spliced part being about twice as thick as the non spliced part, and has greater strength than the long splice. The short splice retains more of the rope strength than any knots that join rope ends.
*'''side splice'''

'''Tapering''' is also sometimes done to make the thicker splice blend or taper into the rest of the rope. It is does either by cutting off a lengthwise part of the end of each strand to make the end of the spliced part thinner or by staggering the strands so that the 2nd strand is interweaved one more time than the first and the third is interweaved an additional time after the 2nd. The staggering brings the splice from twice as thick as the rest of the rope to nearly the same thickness.

A '''fid''' is a tool (basically a hollow spike) that can be fit over the end of a strand and used to feed it through each loop as needed. It may be required for very tightly wound or large ropes. 

A '''marlin spike''' is a tool, commonly part of a sailor's pocketknife, used to separate strands of rope from one another. It is basically a 3&quot;-4&quot; steel spike, slightly curved, with a non-sharp point that tapers quickly out to a 1/4&quot; to 3/8&quot; shaft in the space of the first 1&quot; length.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Parsing a PCAP file using Antfarm:'''

For your PCAP file:
     1. Save your PCAP file as a text file (this will be further referred to as &lt;pcap filename&gt;)

NOTE: Your customized script will be automatically saved in the following location:
     .antfarm/scripts
When you run the following command at the prompt ($):
     $ antfarm
you will see the name of your customized script under &quot;custom&quot;.

Run Antfarm pcap script on your pcap file (do not include brackets in filenames unless they are a part of the filename):
     2. Run the following command at the prompt:
     $ antfarm -e &lt;[[../Traceroute/Commands/Environment name|environment name]]&gt; custom &lt;PCAP script filename&gt; &lt;PCAP text file&gt;

     3. For Antfarm version 0.3.0, the parse-pcap-file requires that network entries already exist in the database
        for BOTH the source IP and destination IP for any record in the pcap file or it will quietly ignore the record.
        For the newer version of Antfarm, if you use the --create-new-networks flag, it will create the network entry for 
        any new IPs.

For use on a single PCAP file, use:      
     $ antfarm -e &lt;[[../Traceroute/Commands/Environment name|environment name]]&gt; custom &lt;PCAP script&gt; --create-new-networks &lt;PCAP text file&gt;

For use on a whole directory of PCAP files, use:
     $ antfarm -e &lt;[[../Traceroute/Commands/Environment name|environment name]]&gt; custom &lt;PCAP script&gt; --create-new-newtorks &lt;PCAP directory name/&gt;

At this point, you have parsed your pcap file (&lt;PCAP text file&gt;)using a custom PCAP script in Antfarm (&lt;PCAP script filename&gt;) and the parsed information is saved in your environment (&lt;environment name&gt;).

You can view the output on Antfarm by running the following command (4. For traffic view, 5. For network view):

     4. $ antfarm -e &lt;[[../Traceroute/Commands/Environment name|environment name]]&gt; viz display-traffic
     5. $ antfarm -e &lt;[[../Traceroute/Commands/Environment name|environment name]]&gt; viz display-networks

When displaying the traffic flow from a larger PCAP file, the visual becomes harder to read on the screen.  Luckily there is an option that will help minimize this.  The &quot;collapse-ports&quot; option allows you to only include one node for each port number discovered in the PCAP file.

     6. $ antfarm -e &lt;[[../Traceroute/Commands/Environment name|environment name]]&gt; viz display-traffic --collapse-ports

The latest version of Antfarm the display is static, using the command above.  If you wish to see an animated version of the display, use the following command (using display networks as an example):

     7. $ antfarm viz display-networks --active

Sometimes, the PCAP files that are produced are much too large, use the following command to downsize the PCAP file to a more 
reasonable size (through the number of packets):

     8. $ editcap -r &lt;Original PCAP Filename&gt; &lt;New PCAP Filename&gt; &lt;range of packets&gt;

     Example:
     $ editcap -r Old_PCAP_File New_PCAP_File 5001-7200
     This example only takes packet numbers 5001-7200 from the old PCAP file and puts them in the new PCAP file.

== Books Needing Content ==

The most common need among books on Wikibooks is the need for more content. More words, sentences, and paragraphs. Even a book that is great in every other way will be worthless if it doesn't have enough content. Keep in mind that there is a difference between books who need general content expansion and books that need specific content additions in specific places. Books that have large content volume but need more specific types of content probably need help with [[../Accuracy|Accuracy]] instead. Books needing general content expansion typically fall into the '''stub''' or '''expand''' states. To fix a book whose biggest problem is a lack of content, there are several methods an author could employ:

== Write Content ==

Almost seems silly to say it, but the most direct way to get more content in a book is to write it yourself. Write lots of content, just dump it out of your page onto the keyboard. Don't worry about formatting, organization, or style. Put content onto the page as quickly as you can and go back to fix it later.

== Import from Wikipedia ==

Go to [[WB:RFI]] and request imports of related pages from Wikipedia. Dump the content into your book, but remember that it's going to take a lot of work to dewikify everything. Don't import more pages than you are able to dewikify in a reasonable amount of time, or they could get deleted.

== Merge Related Books ==

If there are other books on the same topic, and they aren't doing so hot either, consider a merger. Mergers can be quick: Copy the text from one book to the other, and then delete the unneeded pages. Don't worry about integrating the text into the book at first, proper integration and narrative flow can be handled in one step later.

== Improve Content ==

Here are some steps you can take to increase the amount of content in a book.

# Find related books in similar condition and suggest a merger. Use {{tlx|mergeto}} and {{tlx|mergefrom}}, or just use {{tlx|merge}} if you don't have a preference.
# Import related content from Wikipedia by making a request at [[WB:RFI]]
# Write more content. Nothing fancy, just start dropping words from your head into the book.
# Search [[commons:|Commons]] for related images, and post them in the book

== What to Work on Next ==

After the book has sufficient volumes of content, here are some tasks to do next:

# Improve the [[../Style|Style]] of the content by editing and revising
# Improve the [[../Accuracy|Accuracy]] of the content by adding discussion, examples, and clarification
# Improve the [[../Formatting|Formatting]] of the content by using headings, lists and templates
# Improve the [[../Visuals|Visuals]] of the book by adding more images, diagrams, and tables</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The collection-parser is a small tool, designed to simplify the process of converting a wikibook (content page) into a collection. It tries to detect pages and chapters and emits a collection page.

When using this tool do not to rely completely on the software. There are so many different ways how content pages of wikibooks are structured. This tool tries to help and MAY shorten your work, but manual checking is required and optional post processing may be necessary.

== Installation == 

# Log in
# Copy to your clipboard:  &lt;code&gt;importScript( 'User:Pediapress/collection-parser.js');&lt;/code&gt;     
# navigate to [[Special:MyPage/monobook.js]] and add above text to this (newly created) page 
# refresh your browser (ctrl- or shift-reload)!

== Usage == 

* navigate to a wikibook
* click &quot;get collection&quot; in the upper right corner
* select a ''name'' for your collection (e.g. the name of the book) in the appearing dialog
* press &quot;save page&quot;
* now a collection will be saved at: &quot;User:username/Collections/''collectionname''&quot;
* check the collection, as there is no guaranty for proper conversion
* optionally move the page to the global namespace</text>

== Introduction ==

The existence of any source which generates a volumetric expansion/contraction, force or circulation, results in generation of acoustic waves. These sources show up on the right hand side of the wave equation. In this section, we introduce three elementary category of sources (monopoles, dipoles, and quadruples) which represent a wide spectrum of aerodynamic noise sources.

== Monopole ==
Assume that we have a source at point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_0&lt;/math&gt; which generates some volumetric expansion or contraction. The corresponding wave equation for such case is

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c_{0}^2}\frac{\partial^{2} \phi}{\partial\, t^2}-\nabla^2\phi=-q(t)\delta(\mathbf{x-x_0})&lt;/math&gt;

Using the free space Green's function that was introduced before [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aeroacoustics/Wave_Equation_and_Green%27s_function#Green.27s_Function]
, the velocity potential will be

&lt;math&gt;\phi(x,t)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{q(\mathbf{y},t-|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|/c_0)\delta(\mathbf{y-x_0})}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|} d^3\,\mathbf{y}d\tau=-\frac{q(t-|\mathbf{x-x_0}|/c_0)}{4\pi\,|\mathbf{x-x_0}|}&lt;/math&gt;

The above solution looks like the following picture if the source is located at the origin. As you can see this type of source generates symmetric spherical waves. This omni-direction source is called a '''monopole'''.

== Dipole ==
A dipole is a source which appears in the wave equation as


&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c_{0}^2}\frac{\partial^{2} p}{\partial\, t^2}-\nabla^2 p=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(f_j(t)\delta(\mathbf{x-x_0})\right)&lt;/math&gt;


[[Image:Dipole.GIF]]

== Quadrupoles ==
A quadruple is a source distribution involving two space derivatives

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c_{0}^2}\frac{\partial^{2} p}{\partial\, t^2}-\nabla^2 p=\frac{\partial^2 T_{ij}}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}&lt;/math&gt;

An acoustic field generated by a point quadrupole is shown below

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Enzymes assist reactions and increase the speed of formation of the products by decreasing the activation energy required for a reaction. Most fundamentally, enzymes are still just mechanisms that react catalytically in a chemical equation. Therefore, enzyme reactions also possess the basics of these step-wise mechanism reactions which of course includes the rate-limiting or rate determining step. 

It is simple to assume correctly that each step of the mechanism does not proceed at the same rate, and so the rate-limiting step is merely the one reaction of the mechanism that has the slowest rate of reaction. An amusing real-life analogy in the spirit of Black Friday is: say a complete reaction is the time it takes for all the shoppers to make their purchases in Circuit City, then the rate-limiting step would be the shopper who is most indecisive and buys the most stuff. If one was to view a reaction coordinate graph of the entire reaction, the rate-limiting step is usually the one with the highest activation energy hump or highest energy transition state.

Particularly, by Michaelis-Menten kinetics of enzymes, the rate-limiting step is usually the product formation step.

For example:
The reaction NO2(g) + CO(g) → NO(g) + CO2(g) occurs in two elementary steps:

1. NO2 + NO2 → NO + NO3 (slow step)

2. NO3 + CO → NO2 + CO2 (fast step)

As the second step consumes the NO3 produced in the slow first step, it is limited by the rate of the first step. For this reason, the rate-determining step is reflected in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Rate equation|rate equation]] of a reaction. Another simple situation analogous to a rate-limiting step is a family of four getting ready to go somewhere. Regardless of how fast everyone else is, because the family has to wait for everyone, the slowest person is going to determine how fast everyone else will be able to leave the house.

==The role of rate-limiting step==
The concept of the rate-determining step is very important to the optimization and understanding of many chemical processes such as catalysis and combustion.
Furthermore, it may help determine if that mechanism is correct for the reaction. This is because the rate law for the rate limiting step should equal the rate law for the reaction. If this is not the case, then either the experimental rate law was determined incorrectly or the proposed mechanism is wrong.

The role of the rate-limiting step also has application in the study of alcohol in people.  The body will naturally convert alcohol (ethanol is the alcohol consumed in beverages) into acetaldehyde which is later converted into acetate.  Once it is an acetate, the body can naturally dispose of the acetate through waste.  This is two step process which is:

Alcohol --&gt; Acetaldehyde  (very fast)
Acetaldehyde --&gt; Acetate   (very slow, rate-limiting step)

Since alcohol is converted into acetaldehyde quickly, consumption of too much alcohol will cause acetaldehyde to escape into the bloodstream.  This acetaldehyde will build up much faster than it can be converted into acetate.  Once acetaldehyde is in the bloodstream, physiological effects begin to show.  Eventaully, the acetaldehyde is converted to acetate and the effects wear off.  In this case, the rate-limiting step is the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate since it is much slower and causes a buildup of acetaldehyde in the bloodstream.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Feedback inhibition is the phenomenon where the output of a process is used as an input to control the behavior of the process itself, oftentimes limiting the production of more product.  Although negative feedback is used in the context of inhibition, negative feedback may also be used for promoting a certain process.  An everyday example of negative feedback is the cruise control in automobiles.  The faster a car goes above the cruise control speed, the stronger the brakes are applied to slow the car down.  If the car is going to slowly, more gas is fed to the engine to speed the car up.  In a biological context, the more product produced by the enzyme, the more inhibited the enzyme is towards creating additional product.

Many enzyme catalyzed reactions are carried out through a biochemical pathway. In these pathways, the product of one reaction becomes the substrate for the next reaction. At the end of the pathway, a desired product is synthesized. In order to tightly regulate the concentration of that product, the biochemical pathway needs to be shut down. This is done through feedback inhibition. The product of the final reaction in that pathway reacts with an enzyme somewhere along the pathway at the enzyme's allosteric site, changing the conformation of the enzyme. That enzyme can no longer binds to its substrate as effectively due to the conformational change, closing down that pathway and stopping the final product from synthesizing. The higher the concentration of the final product, the more likely that product will bind to the allosteric site of the enzyme, shutting down that pathway.

[[Image:Feedback inhibition pathways.JPG‎]]

There are many intermediates and pathways in feedback inhibition. Often the final product Z will inhibit the initial reactant A. 

==Mechanism of Negative Feedback==

Each metabolic reaction or process is regulated by several enzymes. These enzymes control the rate of these reactions and thus are fundamental in maintaining homeostasis. Below is a universal map of how this type of inhibition works. We will start with a substrate that is attacked by enzyme 1, forming product A which then acts as the substrate for enzyme 2 forming product B. Product B then becomes the substrate for the attack of enzyme 3 forming our final product.

substrate ---enzyme 1--&gt; product A ----enzyme 2---&gt; product B ----enzyme 3----&gt; Final Product

Keep in mind that the final product is usually something the body uses up and is necessary for homeostasis. In this reaction, the purpose of the intermediates, product A and product B, is to move the reaction along to reach the final product therefore the inhibition mechanism does not start at these intermediates but at the final product. As the amount of final product becomes elevated, the system imposes a halting effect on enzyme 1, slowing down the production of intermediates A and B, reducing the formation of the final product.  When levels of the final product fall below a threshold, the effect of negative feedback diminishes and enzyme 1 is reactivated and the reaction process will be started again. 

So what forces are responsible for creating these feedback responses? There are several regulators that affect a given process.  Hormones and chemical signals produced and distributed by the hypothalamus and pituitary glands, for example, are the regulators that act in feedback loops. To illustrate the concept of this section, let's investigate the regulation of blood sugar levels. The hormones insulin and glucagon are two regulators that are intimately related in regulating sugar levels. Insulin is responsible for triggering different cells in the body to absorb glucose from the blood and to store the excess as glycogen for later utility. Conversely, glucagon's function is to convert glycogen supply into glucose. When blood glucose level is too low, the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas release glucagon.  Glucagon subsequently activates the conversion of glycogen to glucose until the sugar level in the blood is back to its normal state.  When blood glucose is too high the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans release insulin which causes cells in the body to take up sugar quickly, lowering the blood sugar level to its normal level.

==Positive Feedback==

In contrast to negative feedback, positive feedback occurs when an output is used as a signal to increase further response of the output. In other words, if process A results in consequence B, B reinforces process A, resulting in a cascade where more of B occurs, which causes more of A to occur, and so on. An example of a positive feedback loop is evolution, where an organism evolves and becomes better at hunting prey, for example, prey evolve better defense mechanism like faster running, which causes predators to adapt by evolving better chasing skills, and so forth. Note that a positive or negative feedback mechanism is not necessarily beneficial or harmful; they only refer to the mechanism by which inhibition or propagation occurs.

==Examples of Feedback Inhibition==

Feedback inhibition controls the production of amino acids. The benefits of feedback inhibition are that the building blocks such as 3-phosphoglycerate, which is crucial to other processes such as the Calvin cycle and glycolysis, are used optimally and without waste. 

[[Image:3-phosphoglycerate.png]]
''Note: the structure of 3-phosphoglycerate is shown here'' 

Feedback inhibition also controls nucleotide production. The pyrimidines (Thymine, Cytosine, and Uracil) have different pathways and feedback mechanisms than the Purines (Adenine and Guanine). Aspartate transcarbamoylase [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PDB_1fb5_EBI.jpg] regulates pyrimidine synthesis in bacteria. The regulation for purine production begins as PRPP or 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate which is converted into Phosphoribosylamine. This pathway is inhibited by IMP, AMP, and GMP. Then Phosphribosylamine is converted into IMP. IMP is a common precursor to both Adenosine and Guanine. The pathways from IMP to the Adenosine and Guanine precursors of AMP and GMP, respectively, are separated. IMP to AMP is inhibited by AMP(adenosine precursor) and IMP to GMP(guanine precursor) are inhibited by GMP, thus the products are inhibiting the precursors. 

Cholesterol production in the liver is catalyzed when cholesterol levels are low. This is done on the mRNA level of transcription through a transcription factor called the sterol regulatory element binding protein or SREBP. The role of SREBP is to increase the rate of transcription of mRNA by binding to a short DNA strand called sterol regulatory element or SRE. Conversely translation of reductase is inhibited by consumed cholesterol and other derivatives.

Negative feedback results in inhibition, but another powerful tool in biological systems is the positive feedback cycle.  This process is the opposite of negative feedback.  We can find an example of it in catalytic cascade processes, such as blood clotting.  An initial factor will begin the cascade, say catalyzing or activating proteases, and which each step, additional steps will follow due to the chain reaction.  Each step will amplify the signal first given, until it reaches its destination or purpose.  In this sense, a very little amount of the initial factor is needed since the steps following provides efficient magnification.

Feedback inhibition is a form of allosteric regulation in which the final product of a sequence of enzymatic reactions accumulates in abundance. With too much of this product produced, the final product binds to an allosteric site on the first enzyme in the series of reactions to inhibit its activity. This halts the reaction at the first step so that no more excess product is produced. In the images above, the second to last product is the one that halts the reaction by biding allosterically to the active site on the first enzyme. This is done to illustrate that not all feedback inhibition is exactly clear cut. Different processes will be regulated differently depending on a variety of factors such as the enzymes and substrates involved, and the conditions in which the reaction takes place.

=ATCase=
Aspartate transcarbanoylase catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of pyrimidines. As mentioned above, after aspartate transcarbamoylase catalyzes the committed step, also known as,the condensation of asparatate and carbamoyl phosphate takes place to form N-carbamoylaspartate, in pyrimidine synthesis. This will yield pyrimitdine nucleotides such as cytidine triphosphate (CTP)(See Figure Below).  [[File:ATCase Reaction.jpg|thumb|ATCase Reaction]][[File:CTP Inhibits ATCase.jpg|thumb|CTP Inhibits ATCase]][[File:ATCase Sigmoidal Kinetics.jpg|thumb|ATCase Sigmoidal Kinetics]][[File:Modifications of Cysteine Residues.jpg|thumb|Modifications of Cysteine Residues]]

The molecule CTP is also known to be used in feedback inhibition in conjunction with aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase)(See Figure: CTP Inhibits ATCase). CTP, which is the final product of the metabolic pathway started by ATCase, inhibits ATCase when there is CTP in excess. When there is excess CTP, the enzyme activity decreases which explains why CTP favors the T state which is less active. This type of inhibition regulates that N-carbamoylaspartate and other subsequent intermediates in the pathway are not unnecessarily formed when the concentration of pyrimidines is large. 

Allosterically regulated enzymes, such as ATCase do not follow Michaelis-Menten Kinetics. Allosteric enzymes are differentiated from other enzymes due their response to changes in substrace concentration levels and their suceptibility to regulation by other molecules. The plot of rate of product formation as a function of substrate concentration for ATCase differs from that expected for enzymes that obey the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Instead, the curve for ATCase is in the form of a sigmoidal curve, which is due to the fact that  binding of substrate to one active site of the enzyme increases the activity at the other active sites. This means that they enzyme has cooperative properties, similar to that of hemoglobin, the protein in our blood that transports oxygen molecules throughout our body. (See Figure: ATCase Sigmoidal Kinetics). 

CTP has a structure that is different from the substrates of the reaction. Thus, CTP must bind the different active sites called regulatory sites.

p-Hydroxymercuribenzoate separates the catalytic (c chain) and the regulatory subunits (r chain) of ATCase, in which the p-hydroxybenzoate reacts with sulfhydryl groups on the cysteine residues in ATCase.(See Figure: modification of cysteine residues). Ultracentrifugation studies have shwon that mercurials can dissociate ATCase into these two kinds of subunits, in which the subunits can be separated by ion-exchange chromatography. Ion-exchange chromatography is effective in this case because the subunits differ in their charge. The subunits can also be separated by centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient since the subunits differ in size. ATCase is 6subunits of two trimers . Here is a regulatory dimer and a catalytic trimer. CTP is an allosteric inhibitor, and it binds to regulatory subunits of the less active T state, which is favored by CTP binding. CTP decreases the activity of the enzyme. ATP competes with CTP because ATP stimulates the reaction by binding to where CTP will bind. 

Two c chains are stacked on one another and linked to three r chains. The contact between the r chains and c chains are stabilized by a Zinc ion bound to four cysteine residues. To separate the r and c chains, the mercurial compound p-Hydroxmercuribenoate can be used. This compound can separate the chains because it has mercury, which strongly binds to cysteine residues, displays the Zinc ion, and destabilizes it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General==
Proteolytic Activation is the activation of an enzyme by peptide cleavage.  The enzyme is initially transcribed in a longer, inactive form. In this enzyme regulation process, the enzyme is shifted between the inactive and active state.  Irreversible conversions can occur on inactive enzymes to become active.  This inactive precursor is known as a zymogen or a proenzyme.  The enzyme is subsequently cut to yield the active form. The benefit of this type of regulation is that ATP is not needed for the cleavage to occur. Therefore, enzymes can use this system of regulation even outside of the cell. This type of regulation can only be done once to an enzyme. It can only be activated once and will stay activated for the enzyme's entire life span. Unlike allosteric control and reversible covalent modification this occurs just once in an enzyme's lifetime. Although the zymogen activation is irreversible, there are specific inhibitors that control those proteases.

Specific proteolysis is a frequent way of activating enzymes and certain other proteins in biological systems. For instance, digestive enzymes which hydrolyze proteins are made as zymogens in the stomach and pancreas, in which pepsinogen is the inactive precursor (zymogen) and pepsin is the activated form of the enzyme. Another example is seen in blood clotting which is carried out by a cascade of proteolytic activations. Also, certain protein hormones are synthesizes as the inactive precursors such as proinsulin which then leads to the activated form insulin by proteolytic cleavage. In addition, Collagen, a fibrous protein and the major component of skin and bone is made from the zymogen procollagen. 

Several developmental process are mediated by activation of inactive precursors such as the metamorphosis of a tadpole to a full grown frog in which increases amounts of collage are reabsorbed from the tail. Similarly, collage is decomposed in mammaliam uterus after birth. Both of these examples rely on the conversion of procollagenase to collagenase which is the active protease and is very accurately timed. 

Lastly, apoptosis, or programmed cell death is another example that illustrates the importance of proteolytic enzymes, in this case caspases. Caspases are synthesized in the inactive form called procaspases and when activated by different signals, caspases cause cell death in many organisms.

==Common uses in Biological Systems==
Digestive enzymes are activated in the stomach and pancreas using this methodology. They are synthesized first as zymogens. Pepsinogen is the inactive protein which is initially transcribed.  Then, it is cleaved in the stomach to produce Pepsin, a digestion enzyme.  The purpose of this regulation is to prevent the Pepsin from digesting proteins in the body before it is introduced into the digestive tract. Many protein hormones in the body originate from inactivated forms of the actual enzymes. A prime example is [[w:insulin|insulin]]. Insulin arises from an inactive form known as [[w:proinsulin|proinsulin]]. It is activated by proteolytic cleavage of a specific peptide. Proinsulin is first synthesized in the [[w:endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] where the peptide chain is folded and the [[w:disulfide bonds|disulfide bonds]] oxidized. It is then packaged in the [[w:Golgi Apparatus|Golgi Apparatus]] and it is also proteolyically cleaved by series of proteases to form insulin. The matured insulin has 39 less amino acids than the proinsulin: 4 are removed and recycled and the remaining 35 amino acids form the [[w:C-peptide|C-peptide]]. 
Collagen is a fibrous protein that makes up the majority of the components of [[w:connective tissues|connective tissues]] in animals that arises from a inactive form known as procollagen. Also many developments and processes are activated by proenzymes.  Programmed cell death is also mediated by these types of proteolytic enzymes.

===Chymotrypsin===

[[Image:Chymotrypsin_4cha.png|left|thumb|chymotrypsinn structure|200px]][[Image:ChymotrypsinActivation.png|right|thumb|Proteolytic activation of chymotrypsinogen. The final α-chymotripsin is linked by interchain disulfide bonds.]]
An enzyme that hydrolyzes proteins, cleaving the peptide bond.  The inactive form of this enzyme is '''''chymotrypsinogen'''''. The zymogen is synthesized in the pancreas, where most of the secreting proteins are synthesized. Chymotrypsinogen consist of the 245 amino acids.  In order to activate it, the bond in between the 15th amino acid (Arg) and 16th amino acid (Ile) has to be cleaved by the enzyme (trypsin). The simple cleavage of the single bond activates the enzyme. Later on, the two dipeptides can be removed to produce ''α-chymotrypsin''. Three chains in α-chymotrypsin are bonded by disulfide bonds.
The cleavage of a single bond leads to the structure conformation and creation of the active side of the chymotrypsin (catalytic triad).  It also creates a pocket where the aromatic or long hydrophilic side chain of the amino acid can be inserted for the future cleavage. In addition, structural change locates the NH group that stabilized the tetrahedral intermediate in the ''“oxyanion hole”'' in the appropriate position.

As a proteoplytic activation, chymotrypsin has been biologically known to work as digestive enzymes, blood clotting, protein hormones, and procaspases (a programmed cell death).

===Trypsin===

[[Image:tinozymogen.jpg|300px|Interaction between Proteins|left|thumb]]
Important enzyme in the biological systems because it activates many enzymes. However, trypsin by itself is activated from the '''''trypsinogen''''' with help of the [[w:enteropeptidase|enteropeptidase]]. Enteropeptidase is a [[w:serine protease|serine protease]] just like trypsin and chymotrypsin, and it breaks Lys-Ile bond in the trypsinogen and activates it. As a result of such process, the small amount of the trypsin enzyme is produced. Later, this amount of activated trypsin activates more trypsin and other enzymes too. The formation of trypsin by enteropeptidase is considered the master activaion step since trypsin participates in a variety of zymogen activation. Examples include the activation of proelastase to elastaase, procarboxypeptidase to carboxypeptidase, and prolipase to lipase.








===Thrombin===

[[Image:BLOOD_CLOTTING_CASCADE_CHEM114A.jpg|300px|thumb|left|A use of Thrombin:Blood Clotting]] An important role of zymogen activations occurs in blood clotting. For blood clotting, the response time must be fast in order to achieve clotting at the right spot and time to prevent excessive bleeding. Enzymatic cascades are therefore employed to achieve that rapid response. A cascade of zymogen activations activates a clotting factor, which is then responsible for activating another clotting factor and so forth until the final clot is achieved. The blood clotting process is driven by a series of proteolytic events. When trauma exposes tissue factor, [[w:thrombin|thrombin]], also a serine protease and a key enzyme in clotting, is synthesized. This event leads to the production of more thrombin by positive feedback. Thrombin then activates enzymes and factors such as fibrinogen and forms fibrin, the key part in blood clotting. Thrombin cleaves four arginine-glycine peptide bonds on the in the central globular region of fibrinogen, releasing fibrinopeptides. The fibrinogen molecule that has lost these fibrinopeptides are then called fibrin monomers. They are called monomers because they spontaneously come together and assemble into fibrous arrays known as fibrin. The fibrins are then crosslinked by the enzyme transglutaminase, which was activated by thrombin from protransglutaminase.

=====Breakthroughs in Elucidation of Clotting Pathways=====

Because of the breakthrough in the elucidation of blood clotting pathways, hemophilia can be revealed early in clotting. Classic hemophilia (a.k.a. Hemophilia A) is a clotting defect. It is genetically transmitted as a sex-linked recessive characteristic. The antihemophilic factor, factor VIII of the pathway is missing or has reduced activity. Even though factor VIII is not a protease, it stimulates the activation of factor X which is the final protease of the intrinsic pathway by the serine protease factor IX&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. The activity of factor VIII is increased by limited proteolysis by thrombin. This type of positive feedback amplifies the clotting singal and accelerates clot formation after a threshold has been reached. Therefore the activation of the intrinsic pathway is impaired in classic hemophilia. 

Before, hemophiliacs were treated with transfusions of concentrated plasma fraction with factor VIII but this therapy always had the risk of infection of diseases such as hepatitis and AIDS. However, with advancements in biochemical techniques such as biochemical purification and recombinant DNA, the gene that encodes factor VIII was isolated and expressed in cell cultures. Since then recombinant factor VIII purified from the cultures has replaced plasma concentrates to treat hemophilia.

===Vitamin K-Dependent Modification readies the activation of prothrombin===

[[Image:VitaminK.gif|thumb|right|Reduction of Vitamin K]]Thrombin is produced as a zymogen known as prothrombin.  The inactive molecule has four domains.  The first domain is the gla domain ( a gamma-carboxyglutamate-rich domain).  Kringle domains consist of the next two domains.  Kringle domains keep prothrombin in an inactive form and guide it towards appropriate site for activation by factor Xa (serine protease) and factor Va (stimulatory protein).  The activation begins with proteolytic cleavage of the arginine 274 and threonine 275 bond, which releases a fragment containing the first three domains.  Similar cleavage of the arginine 323 and isoleucine 324 bond generates an active thrombin molecule.  

Vitamin K has an important role in the synthesis of prothrombin.  Nuclear magnetic resonance reveals that prothrombin contains gamma-carboxyglutamate.  The first 10 glutamate residues in the amino-terminal region of prothrombin are carboxylated to gamma-carboxyglutamate by a vitamin K-dependent enzyme.  This reaction converts glutamate, a weak chelator of Ca 2+, into gamma-carboxyglutamate, a strong chelator.  Consequently, prothrombin is able to bind calcium.  This binding fixes the zymogen to the phospholipid membrane surface from blood platelets at the injury site. This is important because the prothrombin is now in close proximity to two clotting proteins that catalyze its conversion to thrombin.  The calcium-binding domain is removed during activation, which frees the thrombin from the membrane.  Now, it is free to cleave targets such as fibrinogen.

Prothrombin synthesized in the absence of [[w:vitamin K|vitamin K]] or in the presene of vitamin K antagonists such as [[w:dicoumarol|dicourmaorl]] gives rise to an [[w:anticoagulant factor|anticoagulant factor]] as opposed to the regular thrombin that is a [[w:coagulant factor|coagulant factor]]. An anticoagulant factor prevents the blood from clotting and is used to treat patients with [[w:thrombosis|thrombosis]].

The abnormal prothrombin lacks the γ-Carboxyglutamate and that explains its anticoagulant properties.

'''&lt;big&gt;26S Proteasome&lt;/big&gt;'''

The 26S proteasome is an enzyme that is known to cleave intracellular proteins in order to maintain cell functioning and homeostasis. One of the pathways that the 26S proteasome is known for is the degradation of ubiquitin. This proteasome is composed of over 30 subunits and all of their units have specific functions that are not limited to unfolding, translocating, and cleaving. As the 26S proteasome recognizes the correct ubiquitin, it forms the UPS-ubiquitin-proteasome system. The UPS is now polyubiquinated and Ubiquitin chains are formed. The chains are now available to be picked out by the proteolytic core of the UPS, which will continue on with the cleaving of ubiquitin into small peptides. This process is more complicated than it appears, even with the structure of the 26S proteasome not fully understood. It is composed of two subunits: the 20S proteasome core particle and the 19S regulatory particle. The proteasome core particle is where substrate proteolysis occurs and then regulatory particle is where selecting and unfolding of ubiquitin substrates occurs. The core particle has a barrel type of structure with many alpha and beta subunits arranged in alternating fashion. Such a complex structure also defines its function because it requires great amounts of cellular energy to assemble and degrade the molecule of interest. The regulatory particle is just as complex, for it contains of a base and a lid. The base is made up of six different AAA ATPases and by three non ATPase subunits. This helps the regulatory particle control the entry of substrates into the previously mentioned core particle, and hence control the overall pace of the assembly and rate of the substrate-enzyme complex mechanism.

==Proteolytic Enzyme Inhibitors==
Since activating proteolytic enzymes is irreversible, how can one prevent a proteolytic enzyme from functioning? These types of enzymes need very specific inhibitors to prevent the enzyme from running catalysis. A prime example is '''''pancreatic trypsin inhibitor'''''. This inhibits trypsin by binding really firmly to the active site of the enzyme. What makes it bind firmly to the active site is interactions with the aspartate side chain with the side chain of lysine 15 on the inhibitor. This along with many hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and the active site creates a relatively firm binding on the active site.

Trypsin inhibitors are essential in that they prevent severe damage such as inflammation in the pancreas known as pancreatitis. Because trypsin engages in activation of several zymogens, inhibiting trypsin can prevent unwanted or premature cascades such as inflammation. Other inhibitors, such as antielastase, are important as well. When the body contains excess elastase, the enzyme destroys alveolar walls in the lungs by breaking down elastic fibers and other connective tissue proteins in the lungs. This disease is called emphysema, containing symptoms such as difficulty in breathing. Therefore, the body needs elastase inhibitors to prevent the damage from occurring.

When the body forms blood clots, there also needs to be regulation that makes sure the clot is limited only to the site of injury. An example includes thrombin, which not only catalyzes the formation of the clot through fibrin, but also deactivates the clotting cascade by activating protein C, which digests clot stimulating factors. Other specific clotting inhibitors include antithrombin III, which forms an irreversible complex with thrombin, and thus preventing thrombin from activating any more fibrinogen. Antithrombin III can also be amplified by heparin, a polysaccharide found in the walls of blood vessels and endothelial cells. Heparin amplifies antithrombin III by increasing the rate of formation of the irreversible antithrombin III-thrombin complex.

The ratio of thrombin to antithrombin is crucial in normal blood clotting. A mutation that occurs in [[w:α1-antitrypsin|α1-antitrypsin ]], a protease inhibitor, which replaces the methionine 358 with arginine, alter the inhibitor's specificity from [[w:elastase|elastase]] to thrombin and causes the level of thrombin to drop at the injury site. [[w:Neutrophils|neutrophils]] produce large quantities of elastase at sites of injury and those excess proteases must be inhibited by α1-antitrypsin, however, the mutant α1-antitrypsin will inhibit the coagulation factor thrombin instead of elstase thus the blood clot will fail to form and the patient can die of potential hemorrhage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
[[File:Plant cell structure.png|right|thumb|An overview of plant cell.]]
Plants are prokaryotes, multicellular organisms that have membrane-bound organelles.  Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus.  A plant cell is different from other eukaryotic cells in that it has a rigid cell wall, a central vacuole, plasmodesmata, and plastids.  Plant cells take part in photosynthesis to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, oxygen, and water.  Plants are producers that provide food for themselves (making them autotrophs) and other organisms.

==Parts==

These are some of the parts common to plant cells:

•&lt;u&gt;'''Cell Wall'''&lt;/u&gt;- tough layer that provides shape and protection from osmotic swelling.

•&lt;u&gt;'''Cell (''Plasma'') Membrane'''&lt;/u&gt;- it is composed of a phospholipid [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|lipid bilayer]] (including polar hydrophilic heads facing outside and hydrophobic tails facing each other inside) that makes it semipermeable and thus capable of selectively allowing certain ions and molecules in/out of the cell.

•&lt;u&gt;'''Cytoplasm'''&lt;/u&gt;- it consists of the jelly-like fluid in and around the organelles.

•&lt;u&gt;'''Cytoskeleton'''&lt;/u&gt;- is made up of microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments. It provides shape the shape of the cell and helps in transporting materials in and out of the cell.

•[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Golgi Apparatus|&lt;u&gt;'''Golgi Apparatus'''&lt;/u&gt;]] (''body/complex'')- it is the site where membrane-bound vesicles are packed with proteins and carbohydrates. These vesicles will usually leave the cell through secretion.

•&lt;u&gt;'''Vacuole'''&lt;/u&gt;- stores metabolites and degrades and recycles macromolecules.

•[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Mitochondria|&lt;u&gt;'''Mitochondria'''&lt;/u&gt;]]- is responsible for cellular respiration by converting the energy stored in glucose into ATP.

•[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Ribosome|&lt;u&gt;'''Ribosome'''&lt;/u&gt;]]- contain RNA and proteins for protein synthesis. One type is embedded in Rough ER and another type puts proteins directly into the cytosol.

•&lt;u&gt;'''Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum'''&lt;/u&gt; (''rough[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]]'')- covered with ribosomes, it stores, separates, and transports materials through the cell. It also produces proteins in cisternae, which then go to the Golgi apparatus or insert into the cell membrane.

•&lt;u&gt;'''Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum'''&lt;/u&gt; (''smooth ER'')-  it has no ribosomes embedded in its surface. Lipids and proteins are produced and digested here. Smooth ER buds off from rough ER to move newly-synthesized proteins and lipids. The proteins and lipids are transported to the Golgi apparatus (where they are made ready for export) and membranes.  

•&lt;u&gt;'''Peroxisome'''&lt;/u&gt;- is involved in metabolizing certain fatty acids and producing and degrading hydrogen peroxide.

•&lt;u&gt;'''Nuclear Membrane'''&lt;/u&gt; (''envelope'')- the an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum that wraps around the nucleus. Its many gaps allow traffic in/out of the nucleus.

•[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Nucleus|&lt;u&gt;'''Nucleus'''&lt;/u&gt;]]
- it contains DNA in the form of chromosomes or chromatin and controls protein synthesis.

•[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Nucleolus|&lt;u&gt;'''Nucleolus'''&lt;/u&gt;]]
- it is the site of ribosomal RNA synthesis.

•&lt;u&gt;'''Centrosome'''&lt;/u&gt;- consisting of a dense center and radiating tubules, it organizes the microtubules into a mitotic spindle during cell division.

•&lt;u&gt;'''Chloroplast'''&lt;/u&gt;- conducts photosynthesis and produces carbohydrates, oxygen, and internally ATP and NADPH from captured light energy.

•&lt;u&gt;'''Starch Granule'''&lt;/u&gt;- temporarily stores produced carbohydrates from photosynthesis. Depending on the organism, it can be inside or outside of the chloroplast (if present).

==Exclusive to Plant Cells==

===Cell Wall===
The cell wall is a tough, usually flexible but fairly rigid layer that surrounds the plant cells. It is located just outside the cell membrane and it provides the cells with structural support and protection. A major function of the cell wall is to act as a pressure vessel, preventing over-expansion when water enters the plant cells. The strongest component of the cell wall is a carbohydrate called [[/Cellulose/|cellulose]], a polymer of glucose. 

The cell wall gives rigidity and strength to the plant cells which offers protection against mechanical stress. It also permits the plants to build and hold its shape. It limits the entry of large molecules that may be toxic to the cell. It also creates a stable osmotic environment by helping to retain water, which helps prevent osmotic lysis. 

While the cell wall is rigid, it is still flexible and so it bends rather than holding a fixed shape due to its tensile strength. The rigidity of primary plant tissues is due to turgor pressure and not from rigid cell walls. This is evident in plants that wilt since the stems and leaves begin to droop and in seaweed that bends in water currents. This proves that the cell wall is indeed flexible. The rigidity of healthy plants is due to a combination of the cell wall construction and turgor pressure. The rigidity of the cell wall is also affected by the inflation of the cell contained. This inflation is a result of the passive uptake of water. 

Cell rigidity can be increased by the present of a second cell wall, which is a thicker additional layer of cellulose. This additional layer can be formed containing lignin in xylem cell walls, or containing suberin in cork cell walls. These compounds are rigid and waterproof, making the secondary cell wall very stiff. Secondary cell walls are present in both wood and bark cells of trees. 

The primary cell wall of most plant cells is semi-permeable so that small molecules and proteins are allowed passage into and out of the cell. Key nutrients, such as water and carbon dioxide, are distributed throughout the plant from cell wall to cell wall via apoplastic flow. 

The major carbohydrates that make up the primary cell wall are cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The secondary cell wall contains a wide range of additional compounds that modify their mechanical properties and permeability. Plant cell walls also contain numerous enzymes, such as hydrolases, esterases, peroxidases, and transglycosylases, that cut, trim and cross-link wall polymers. The relative composition of carbohydrates, secondary compounds and protein varies between plants and between the cell type and age. 

There are up to three strata, or layers, that can be found in plant cell walls:

The '''middle lamella''', which is a layer rich in pectins. This is the outermost layer that forms the interface between adjacent plant cells and keeps them together.

The '''primary cell wall''' which is generally a thin, flexible layer that is formed when the cell is growing. 

The '''secondary cell wall''' which is a thick layer that is formed inside the primary cell wall after the cell is fully grown. It is only found in some cell types. 

[[File:Plant_cell_structure_svg_vacuole.svg|right|thumb|A vacuole inside a plant cell.]]

===Vacuole===
The vacuole is essentially an enclosed compartment that is filled with water containing inorganic and organic molecules including various enzymes in solution. Vacuoles are formed by the fusion of multiple membrane vesicles and are effectively just larger forms of these vesicles. This organelle does not have a basic shape or size since its structure is determined by the needs of the cell. The functions of the vacuole in the plant cell include isolating materials that may be harmful to the cell, containing waste products, maintaining internal hydrostatic pressure within the cell, maintaining an acidic internal pH, containing small molecules, exporting unwanted substances from the cell, and allowing plants to support structures such as leaves and flowers. Vacuoles also play an important role in maintaining a balance between biogenesis and degradation of many substances and cell structures in the organism. Vacuoles aid in the destruction of invading bacteria or of misfolded proteins that are building up within the cell. They have the function of storing food and assist in the digestive and waste management process for the cell. 

Most mature plant cells have a single large central vacuole that takes up approximately 30% of the cell's volume. It is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast, which is the cytoplasmic membrane separating the vacuolar contents from the cell's cytoplasm. It is involved in regulating the movements of ions around the cell, and isolating substances that may be harmful to the cell. 

Other than storage, the main function of the central vacuole is to maintain turgor pressure against the cell wall. The proteins that are found in the tonoplast control the flow of water into and out of the vacuole through active trasnport, pumping potassium ions into and out of the vacuolar interior. Because of osmosis, water will flow into the vacuole placing pressure on the cell wall. If there is a significant amount of water loss, there is a decline in turgor pressure and the cell will plasmolyse. Turgor pressure exerted by the vacuole is required for cellular elongation as well as for supporting plants in the upright position. Another function of the vacuole is to push all contents of the cell's cytoplasm against the cellular membrane which helps keep the chloroplasts closer to light.

===Plasmodesmata===
Plasmodesmata are microscopic channels that traverse the cell walls of plant cells enabling the transport and communication between the cells. Plasmodesmata enable direct, regulated intercellular transport of substances between the cells. There are two forms of plasmodesmata, primary ones that form during cell division and secondary ones that form between mature cells. They are formed when a portion of the endoplasmic reticulum is trapped across the middle lamella as a new cell wall is laid down between two newly divided plant cells and this eventually becomes the cytoplasmic connection between the two cells. It is here that the cell wall is thickened no further and depressions or thin areas known as pits are formed in the walls. Pits usually pair up between adjacent cells. 

Plasmodesmata are constructed of three main layers, the plasma membrane, the cytoplasmic sleeve, and the desmotubule. The plasma membrane part of the plasmodesmata is an extension of the cell membrane and it is similar in structure to the cellular phospholipid bilayers. The cytoplasmic sleeve is a fluid-filled space that is enclosed by the plasma membrane and is an extension of the cytosol. The trafficking of molecules and ions through the plasmodesmata occurs through this passage. Smaller molecules, such as sugars and amino acids, and ions can pass through the plasmodesmata via diffusion without the need for additional chemical energy. Proteins can also pass through the cytoplasmic sleeve but it is not yet known just how they are able to pass through. Finally, the desmotubule is a tube of compressed endoplasmic reticulum that runs between adjacent cells. There are some molecules that are known to pass through this tube but it is not the main route for plasmodesmatal transport. 

The plasmodesmata have been shown to transport proteins, short interfering RNA, messenger RNA, and viral genomes from cell to cell. The size of the molecules that can pass through the plasmodesmata is determined by the size exclusion limit. This limit is highly variable and is subject to active modification. There have been several models that have been proposed for the active transport through the plasmodesmata. One suggestion is that such transport is mediated by the interactions with proteins that are localized on the desmotubule, and/or by chaperones partially unfolding proteins which allows them to fit through the narrow passage.

[[Image:Plastids_types.svg‎|right|thumb]]

===Plastid===
Plastids are the site of manufacture and storage of important chemical compounds that are used by the cell. They often contain pigments used in photosynthesis and the types of pigments present can change or determine the color of the cell. Plastids are responsible for photosynthesis, storage of products like starch, and the ability to differentiate between these and other forms. All plastids can be traced back to proplastids, which happen to be present in the meristematic regions of the plant. In plants, plastids may differentiate into several forms depending on what function they need to play in the cell. Undifferentiated plastids, the proplastids, can develop into the following types of plastids:

•Chloroplasts: for photosynthesis 

•Chromoplasts: for pigment synthesis and storage

•Leucoplasts: for monoterpene synthesis

[[File:Chloroplast diagram.svg|right|thumb|Ths inside of a chloroplast.]]
Chloroplasts are the organelles that conduct photosynthesis. They capture light energy to conserve free energy in the form of ATP and reduce NADP to NADPH. They are observed as flat discs usually 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter and 1 micrometer thick. The chloroplast is contained by an envelope that consists of an inner and outer phospholipid membrane. Between these layers is the intermembrane space. The material within the chloroplast is called the stroma and it contains many molecules of small, circular DNA (though it is often found in branched linear form, such as in corn). Within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids, which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids are arranged in stacks called grana. A thylakoid has a flattened disk shape and has an empty space called the thylakoid space or lumen. The process of photosynthesis takes place on the thylakoid membrane. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are antenna complexes that consist of the light-absorbing pigments, such as chlorophyll and carotenoids, as well as the proteins that bind the pigments. These complexes increase the surface area for light capture and allows the capture of photons with a wider range of wavelengths. The energy of the incident photons is absorbed by the pigments and funneled to the reaction center of the complex through resonance energy transfer. From there, two chlorophyll molecules are ionized, which produces an excited electron which passes on to the photochemical reaction center. 


Chromoplasts are responsible for pigment synthesis and storage. They are found in the colored organs of plants such as fruit and floral petals, to which they give their distinctive colors. This is always associated with a massive increase in the accumulation of carotenoid pigments. Chromoplasts synthesize and store pigments such as orange carotene, yellow xanthophylls and various other red pigments. The most probably main evolutionary role of chromoplasts is to act as an attractant for pollinating animals or for seed dispersal via the eating of colored fruits. They allow for the accumulation of large quantities of water-insoluble compounds in otherwise watery parts of plants. In chloroplasts, some carotenoids are used as accessory pigments in the process of photosynthesis where they act to increase the efficiency of chlorophyll in harvesting light energy. When leaves change color during autumn, it is because of the loss of green chlorophyll unmasking these carotenoids that are already present in the leaves. The term &quot;chromoplast&quot; is used to include any plastid that has pigment, mainly to emphasize the contrast with leucoplasts which are plastids that have no pigments. 

Leucoplasts lack pigments and so they are not green. They are located in roots and non-photosynthetic tissues of plants. They can become specialized for bulk storage of starch, lipid or protein and are then known as amyloplasts, elaioplasts, or proteinoplasts, respectively. In many cell types, though, leucoplasts do not have a major storage function and are present to provide a wide range of essential biosynthetic functions, including the synthesis of fatty acids, many amino acids, and tetrapyrrole compounds such as haem. Extensive networkds of stromules interconnecting leucoplasts have been observed in epidermal cells of roots, hypocotyls and petals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Oxidoreductases''' are a class of enzymes that facilitates (catalyzes) the transfer of electrons from reductants (electron donors) to oxidants (electron acceptors). This type of reaction is also known as a oxidoreduction reaction. The reaction generally follows the following scheme: A– + B → A + B– where A is the reductant and B is the oxidant.

=== Definition ===

Oxidoreductases catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions. For example, an alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation reaction of ethanol to form an aldehyde. In the reaction, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced. the two electrons in the C-H bond of ethanol are transferred to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Besides alcohol and aldehyde functional groups, dehydrogenases also act as electron donors on functional groups, such as -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-, -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and -CH=NH, and on coenzymes NADH, NADPH, FADH, and FMNH.

Oxidoreductases specifically catalyze the transfer of electrons from one molecule (the oxidant) to another molecule (the reductant).  Oxidoreductases catalyze reactions similar to this example: A– + B → A + B– where A is the oxidant and B is the reductant.  Oxidorecuctases can be oxidases or dehydrogenases.  Oxidases are enzymes involved when molecular oxygen acts as an acceptor of hydrogen or electrons. On the other hand, dehydrogenases are enzymes that oxidize a substrate by transferring hydrogen to an acceptor that is either NAD+/NADP+ or a flavin enzyme.  Other oxidoreductases include peroxidases, hydroxylases, oxygenases, and reductases. Peroxidases are localized in peroxisomes, and they catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Hydroxylases add hydroxyl groups to its substrates. Oxygenases incorporate oxygen from molecular oxygen into organic substrates. Reductases catalyze reductions, and in most cases reductases can act like an oxidases.

Oxidoreductase enzymes also play an important role in both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism.  They can be found in glycolysis, TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and in amino acid metabolism.  In glycolysis, the enzyme glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reduction of NAD+ to NADH.  In order to maintain the re-dox state of the cell, this NADH must be re-oxidized to NAD+, which occurs in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. The product of glycolysis, pyruvate enters the citric acid cycle in the form of acetyl-CoA.  During anaerobic glycolysis, the oxidation of NADH occurs through the reduction of pyruvate to lactate.  The lactate is then oxidized to pyruvate in muscle and liver cells, and the pyruvate is further oxidized in the citric acid cycle.  All twenty of the amino acids, except leucine and lysine, can be degraded to citric acid cycle intermediates.  This allows the carbon skeletons of the amino acids to be converted into oxaloacetate and subsequently into pyruvate.

'''Oxidases''' transfer two electrons from the donor to oxygen, forming hydrogen peroxide.

'''Cytochrome oxidase''' produces water molecules rather than hydrogen peroxide by reducing the oxygen. Cytochrome P-450 catalyzes oxidation reactions in the liver and adrenal cortex, helping to detoxify some substances by adding hydroxyl groups that make the compounds more water-soluble and more susceptible to further reactions. Unfortunately, at times this process has the reverse effect because some relatively safe molecules are converted into potent carcinogens. A group of cytochromes serve as oxidation-reduction agents, converting the energy of the oxidation process into the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which makes the energy more available to other reactions. 


'''Oxygenases''' oxidize a substrate by incorporating oxygen to it. Monooxygenases incorporate a single oxygen atom, and the other oxygen is reduced by electrons from substrate to water. Dioxygenases transfer two oxygen atoms in a molecule of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the substrate.

'''Peroxidases and Catalases''' etoxify hydrogen peroxide, which acts as both electron donor and acceptor. Peroxidases and catalases are Fe (III)-heme compounds that decompose hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides. The reactions seem to proceed through Fe(IV) compounds with another unpaired electron electron on the porphyrin, which becomes a radical cation. Similar intermediates are also known in simpler porphyrin molecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hydrolases''' are a class of enzymes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a chemical bond. The enzymes disrupt the chemical bond by adding water; this step is known as the acylation step. The following scheme is indicative of a hydrolase enzyme: A–B + H2O → A–OH + B–H.

Hydrolases reactions can be used to cleave many types of chemical bonds. They can be used to cleave peptide bonds to break down proteins and polypeptides. Such reaction involve protease. Other hydrolase reactions can be used to cleave phosphodiester bonds to degrade DNA molecules. Such reaction is performed by restriction enzymes, also known as restrictive endonuclease.

In terms of free energy, it is found that hydrolases forms more entropy and is typically an exergonic reaction.

Hydrolases help induce degradative reactions in the body. For example, during digestion lipases hydrolyze lipids and proteases convert proteins to amino acids. Hydrolases also cleave large molecules into fragments used for synthesis, the excretion of waste materials, or as sources of carbon for the production of energy. In each of these reactions, biopolymers are converted to monomers. Some hydrolases also expel a considerable amount of energy as they act.

One of the most important hydrolases is cholinesterase. Acetylcholine is a potent neurotransmitter for voluntary muscle. Nerve impulses travel along neurons to the synaptic cleft, where acetylcholine stored in vesicles is released, carrying the impulse across the synapse to the postsynaptic neuron and propagating the nerve impulse. After the nerve impulse moves on, the action of the neurotransmitter molecules must be stopped by cholinesterase, which hydrolyzes acetylcholine to choline and acetic acid. Dangerous toxins exist such as the exotoxin of Clostridium botulinum and saxitoxin that interfere with cholinesterase, and a considerable number of nerve agents such as tabun and sarin act by blocking the hydrolytic action of cholinesterase.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Isomerases''' are a class of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of one isomer into another. Isomerases catalyze reactions of the form A to B. Triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) is a prime example of an isomerase.  TPI catalyzes the isomerization of a ketose into an aldose by catalying the transfer of a hydrogen atom from carbon-1 to carbon-2.  Isomerases can also be used to catalyze the isomerization of aldoses to ketoses. 

TPI uses glutamate as a base to abstract a proton from the carbon-1.  Histidine is used as an acid to donate a proton to the oxygen bonded to carbon-2, this intermediate is known as the enediol intermediate.  The glutamic acid then donates a proton to carbon-2 while histidine removes a proton from the hydroxyl group on carbon-2, forming an aldose.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Homeostasis is the mechanism by which an organism maintains its body in dynamic equilibrium. A slight change in a concentration of a fluid within the organism may cause major changes within its body. In living cells, there are different kinds of enzymes working together. Living cells synthesis or break down molecules for normal metabolism and growth. Enzyme regulation is one example. Enzymes are used to catalyze (speed up) reactions within the body. The regulation of enzymes help maintain the body's equilibrium. An enzyme can be in either one of two modes: on or off. That is controlling the synthesis of enzymes and controlling the activity of enzymes ([[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Regulation/Feedback inhibition|feedback inhibition]]). Basically enzyme regulation takes advantage of these two modes. When a concentration of one product is too high, a negative feedback loop can occur and stop the enzyme that catalyzes that specific product. Enabling a lowering of reaction rate and lowering the concentration over time.

Enzymes activities are regulated by five basic techniques.

1. [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Regulation/Cooperativity|'''Allosteric control.''']] Allosteric proteins have different regulatory and catalytic binding sites. Allosteric proteins are cooperative proteins, where binding of a substrate in one active site affects the activity of the rest of the binding sites. Some substrate binding will favor the protein to be in the inactive T (tense) state, while other substrate binding will favor the protein to be in the active R (relaxed) state, depending on the biological needs.  Allosterically regulated enzymes do not however obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics but instead follow sigmoidal kinetics. 

Example of allostery:[[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Allostery_in_Glycogen_Phosphorylase.JPG]]

2. '''Isoenzymes.''' Isoenzymes have different animo acid sequences but catalyze the same reaction as enzymes. They usually have different K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values, and different regulatory techniques. The advantages of isoenzymes is that it can catalyze the same reaction under the different environments within the different organelles. [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Regulation/Isozymes|Isozymes]] are an important entity in metabolism for servicing a specific tissue or developmental sequence.  For example lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has two isozymes that have an amino acid sequence that is 75% similar.  The H isozyme is present in the heart muscle and the M isozyme is expressed in the skeletal muscle.

Example of isoenzymes and their structure: [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PDB_1qat_EBI.jpg]]

3. '''Reversible covalent modification.''' An enzyme's activity can be altered by covalently attaching a different group to its active site. It blocks the natural substrate from binding to the active site.  The most common forms of covalent modification are phosphorylation and dephosphorylation as well as aceylation and deacylation.  Not all forms of covalent modification are readily reversible.  For example, an attachment of a lipid group will inhibit the signal-transduction pathway in some proteins.

Example of dephosphorylation: [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phosphodephosphoinverto.jpg]]

4. [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Regulation/Proteolytic activation|'''Proteolytic Activation.''']] Many enzymes are present in the body in their inactive forms call zymogen or proenzyme. They are not activated until a digestive enzyme cleaves it. The cleavage alters the three dimension shape of the enzyme, forming the active site in the right orientation. The zymogens become active enzymes in an irreversible reaction, typically the hydrolysis of bonds in the zymogen.  

Example of zymogen structure: [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Factor_XI_2F83.png]]

5. '''Control by Limiting Amount of Enzyme.''' The amount of enzymes gets produced can be controlled at the transcription level.

In Double Displacement (Ping Pong reaction), two compounds switch places to form new compounds. Two reactants yield two products. 


== Ping Pong Mechanism ==

[[File:Ping_pong_mechanism.jpg|thumb|400px|One or more products are release prior to all substrantes bind the enzymes]]In the Ping Pong mechanism substrate S binds to the enzyme transferring a chemical component to the active site making a modified enzyme. Once substrate S leaves active site substrate T can bind and react with the newly modified active site. Once the newly formed product leaves the enzyme it returns to its original state ready to accept substrate S.

Enzymes that exhibit this mechanism include thioredoxin peroxidase, cytydilytransferase, and chymotrypsin. 
Serine proteases which cleave polypeptide bonds is an example of this mechanism where the enzyme accepts the amino acid and modifies the serine residue by acetylating it. The modified enzyme accepts water as which liberates the product and liberates the original enzyme. 

{{BookCat}}

In Ping-Pong Reactions, one or more products are released before all substrates bind the enzyme. The defining feature of double-displacement reactions is the existence of a substituted enzyme intermediate, in which the enzyme is temporarily modified. Reactions that shuttle amino groups between amino acids and a-ketoacids are classic examples of double displacement mechanisms. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from aspartate to a-ketoglutarate. 
 
After aspartate binds to the enzyme, the enzyme accepts aspartate’s amino group to form the substituted enzyme intermediate. The first product, oxaloacetate, subsequently departs. The second substrate, a-ketoglutarate, binds to the enzyme, accepts the amino group from the modified enzyme, and is then released as the final product, glutamate. In the Cleland notation, the substrates appear to bounce on and off the enzyme analogously to a Ping-Pong ball bouncing on a table.

==The potential threats==
As scientific researchers have proved that enzymes are central for metabolic pathways in organisms, they have also pointed out that those very enzymes could also potentially threaten the survival of the organisms. For example, in DNA transcription, if the enzyme carrying out the work malfunctions, it can give rise to an errant gene that codes faulty proteins or no proteins at all (these occurrences are known as ''mutations''). Therefore, such proteins may result in out-of-control cell divisions, which can lead to dire consequences, which most of the time are related to cancer.

==Conclusion==
Enzymes play a vital role in organisms' ability for survival. They create the abilities of moving, thinking, sensing, and so on. Besides, enzymes are central for almost any metabolic reactions in any organisms: they can catalyze a series of lengthening lab-conducting chemical reactions in seconds with high levels of complexity and precision, thus earning the name &quot;natural catalysts&quot;. Biochemists' goals are trying to study and understand the mechanisms, by which only such enzymes can do their wonderful magic for organisms' survivability.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Background =

There have been many applications that deals with sound propagation in a compliant wall duct.  These range from hydraulic applications(i.e. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hammer water hammer]) to biomechanical applications (i.e. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse pressure pulse in an artery]).  In working with sound propagation in a circular duct, the duct wall is often assumed to be rigid so that any pressure disturbance in the fluid has no effect on the wall.  However, if the wall is assumed to be compliant, i.e. wall deformation is possible when a pressure disturbance is encountered, then, this will change the speed of the sound propagation.  In reality, the rigid wall assumption will be valid if the pressure disturbance in the fluid, which is a function of the fluid density, is very small so that the deformation of the wall is insignificant.  However, if the duct wall is assumed to be thin, i.e. ~ 1/20 of the radius or smaller, or if the wall is made of plastic type of material with low Young’s modulus and density, or if the fluid contained is “heavy”, the rigid wall approximation is no longer true.  In this case, the wall is assumed to be compliant.  

In the book by Morse &amp; Ingard [1], the wall stiffness is defined as K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;, and this is the ratio between the pressure disturbances, p, to the fractional change in cross-sectional area of the duct, produced by p.  Of course this pressure disturbance p is not static and the inertial of the wall has to be considered.  Because the deformation of the wall is due to the pressure disturbances in the fluid, this is a typical fluid-structure interaction problem, where the pressure disturbances in the fluid cause the structural deformation, which in turn, modifies the pressure disturbances.

Unlike sound propagate in a duct with a rigid wall where sound pressure travels down the tube axially; part of the pressure is used to stretch the tube radially.  Clearly, because of the inclusion of tube wall displacement, this becomes a fluid-structure interaction problem.

= Analysis =

In this analysis, it is expected that the speed of the propagation will depend on the material properties of the tube wall, i.e. Young’s modulus and the density.  Also, as the analysis unfolds, it will become apparently clear that the speed of propagation will vary with excitation frequency, unlike wave propagation in a rigid-wall tube.  Keep in mind that the analysis presented here is a very simple one.  Of course depending on the fluid &amp; structure model, one can reach a more accurate results.  In the analysis presented here, the goal is to provide a basic physical understanding of sound propagation in a cylindrical duct with compliant wall. 

Assumptions:

# One-dimensional analysis
# All viscous &amp; thermal dissipation are neglected
# Analysis are per unit length
# No mean flow velocity is considered

== Fluid ==


Two simplified fluid equations will be considered here:

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\kappa \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}\dots \dots .Eq(1)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}={\rho }_f\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\dots \dots .Eq(2)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa =\frac{1}{{\rho }_fc^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid particle velocity and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid pressure. 

The first equation is the continuity equation, where the density term is replaced by the pressure term by applying the ideal gas law &lt;math&gt;p=\rho RT&lt;/math&gt; and the isentropic gas law &lt;math&gt;c^2=\gamma RT&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of the compliant wall, the fluid experiences an additional compressibility effects, and according to Morse &amp; Ingard [1] , this additional compressibility is derived based on the wall stiffness (K).   The wall stiffness is defined as the ratio between the pressure and the fractional change in cross-sectional area.   By introducing K into Eq. 1 , it yields 

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\left(\kappa +\frac{1}{K}\right)\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}\dots \dots Eq\left(3\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If the mass of the tube is considered, then additional mass parameter, M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;, must be included.

The total stiffness impedance of the wall is then: 

&lt;math&gt;Z_w=j\omega M_w+\frac{K_w}{j\omega }=j\frac{M_w}{\omega }\left({\omega }^2-{\omega }^2_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Treating this wall impedance as a compliance term (i.e. &lt;math&gt;K=j\omega Z_w&lt;/math&gt;), and substitute back into Eq 3 yields

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\left(\kappa +\frac{1}{M_w({{\omega }^2_n-\omega }^2)}\right)\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_n=\sqrt{\frac{K_w}{M_w}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Furthermore, by taking out &lt;math&gt;{\kappa }&lt;/math&gt;, the expression becomes 

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\kappa \left(\frac{M_w\left({{\omega }^2_n-\omega }^2\right)+{\rho }_fc^2}{M_w({{\omega }^2_n-\omega }^2)}\right)\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

After some manipulation, it yields

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\kappa \left(\frac{{{\omega }^2_1-\omega }^2}{{{\omega }^2_n-\omega }^2}\right)\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\omega }^2_1={\omega }^2_n+\frac{{\rho }_fc^2}{M_w}&lt;/math&gt;

For rigid wall, as &lt;math&gt;K_w\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\omega }^2_n\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\omega }^2_1\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, hence, &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\kappa \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;, which leads back to Equation 1 .

If the impedance analogy is used, i.e. pressure is the voltage and the velocity the current, then

&lt;math&gt;C=\ \kappa \left(\frac{{{\omega }^2_1-\omega }^2}{{{\omega }^2_n-\omega }^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
,where C is the compliance of the wall per unit length.

The speed of the sound is then determined by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;, hence

&lt;math&gt;c_p=c\sqrt{\left(\frac{{{\omega }^2_n-\omega }^2}{{{\omega }^2_1-\omega }^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is the phase velocity and it depends on the excitation frequency,&lt;math&gt; {\omega }&lt;/math&gt;, the acoustic wave is dispersive.  When the excitation frequency is below the natural frequency, &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_n&lt;/math&gt;, the phase speed is lower than that of the free wave speed in fluid.   

The next step is to identify K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;, which will be determined through structural response.

== Structure ==

Assume the undeformed tube has a diameter of D and after deformation, it becomes &lt;math&gt;D+\triangle D&lt;/math&gt;.  The area change in this case is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi }{4}\left(2D\triangle D+{\left(\triangle D\right)}^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  The ratio between the two is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\triangle A}{A}=\frac{2\triangle D}{D}+{\left(\frac{\triangle D}{D}\right)}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the wall stiffness is then

&lt;math&gt;K_w=\frac{\triangle pD}{2\triangle D}&lt;/math&gt;.
 
where the inverse of this is known as the compliance or [http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Distensibility distensibility](a bio-medical term).   

To determine the term &lt;math&gt;\frac{\triangle D}{D}&lt;/math&gt;, it is necessary to look at the structural response by using Newtown's Law and Hook's Law.

Consider a cross section of a half tube with diameter D, thickness h and tension T,

[[Image:TCS.JPG|300px|A cut away cylindrical tube]]

The hoop stress in a cylindrical tube is given by, 

&lt;math&gt; \sigma =p\frac{D}{2h} &lt;/math&gt; 
Applying Hook's Law, it is possible to determine the strain, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, by

&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon =\frac{\sigma}{E}&lt;/math&gt;. 

With some substitutions,  

&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon =\frac{pD}{2hE}&lt;/math&gt;

For small strain, 

&lt;math&gt;\Delta \varepsilon =\frac{\Delta pD}{2hE}=\frac{\Delta D}{D}&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, 

&lt;math&gt;K_w=E\frac{h}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the wall stiffness, a function of only the tube elastic properties.

Mass of the tube per unit length is considered, then 

&lt;math&gt;M_w={\rho}_s\pi h(D+h)&lt;/math&gt;.


Finally, it is possible to plot the phase speed and the wall impedance verse the excitation frequency.

=Discussions=

In the simulation the thickness to diameter ratio,&lt;math&gt; \frac{h}{D}&lt;/math&gt; is 0.1, the material is steel with &lt;math&gt; \rho = 7800 \frac{kg}{m^3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; E = 2x10^{11} Pa&lt;/math&gt;.  The fluid contained inside is assumed to be air with &lt;math&gt; \rho = 1.21 \frac{kg}{m^3}&lt;/math&gt; and the free wave speed of &lt;math&gt; c = 343 \frac{m}{s}&lt;/math&gt;. 


[[Image:Tws1.jpg|600px]]

In this diagram, the 'o' denotes the real part of the phase speed and the '+' denotes the imaginary part of the phase speed. The straight line shows the sound speed in air with a numerical value of &lt;math&gt; c = 343 \frac{m}{s}&lt;/math&gt;.  In this plot, propagation of wave is possible only if the phase speed is real.  There are two important frequencies that deserves a close attention.  The first is the natural frequency of the empty structure, i.e. &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_n&lt;/math&gt; and the natural frequency of the fluid loaded structure, &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_1&lt;/math&gt;.  In this plot, &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_n = 450 Hz&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_1 = 550 Hz &lt;/math&gt;.  

Unlike 1-D wave propagation in a rigid duct where the propagation speed is a constant, the phase speed depends on the excitation frequency.  It shows that the propagation speed decreases as the excitation frequency approaches to &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Between &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_1&lt;/math&gt;, the phase speed is imaginary, which means no wave can propagate in between these two frequencies.  As soon as the frequency increases pass &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_1&lt;/math&gt;, the phase speed is greater than the free wave speed of 343 m/s.  As the excitation frequency increases, the phase speed approaches to the free wave speed.  

When the excitation frequency is increased, the parts of the fluid energy is used to excite the tube, until the excitation frequency matches &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Beyond &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_n&lt;/math&gt;, no true wave propagation is possible because in between these two frequencies.

For a very rigid tube, i.e. &lt;math&gt; E = 2x10^{20} Pa&lt;/math&gt; , the phase speed is exactly the free wave speed in air, which is a constant.  This agrees with what have been discussed before for a 1-D wave propagation in a rigid duct.

[[Image:Tws2.jpg|600px]]

When the stiffness is reduced to 1/100 of the steel, there are numerous differences than the steel tube.  First, at the low frequency, the phase speed is slower.  This is because the lower wall stiffness, the more the wall can be stretched, hence can absorb more energy. Also, the system has a much lower &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\omega }_1&lt;/math&gt;. 

[[Image:Tws3.jpg|600px]]

From the above analysis, it is possible to conclude the following:

1. The stiffness, the wall thickness and the density of the tube affects the phase speed dramatically.  

2. A reduction in stiffness, reduces the propagation speed at low frequencies.  The wave also becomes evanescent at much lower frequency. This is because the natural frequency is reduced.  As the stiffness increases, the propagation speed approaches to that of the free wave speed regardless of the frequency region.  This is the case of rigid wall.   

3. The propagation speed of a wave in a duct with compliant wall is dispersive as it depends greatly on the frequency.  The phase speed differs significantly than that of in a rigid wall.

4. The non-propagating zone is known as the stop band.  Here, the wall properties can be modified to create a larger stop band. Hence, a duct with compliant wall can be considered as a type of band filter.

|Categorical variables in R are stored as a special vector object known as a '''factor'''. This is ''not'' the same as a character vector filled with a set of names (don't get the two mixed up). In particular, R has to be told that each element can only be one of a number of known ''levels'' (e.g. ''Male'' or ''Female''). If you try to place a data point with a different, unknown level into the factor, R will complain. When you print a factor to the screen, R will also list the possible levels that factor can take (this may include ones that aren't present)

The &lt;code&gt;factor()&lt;/code&gt; function creates a factor and defines the available levels. By default the levels are taken from the ones in the vector***. Actually, you don't often need to use &lt;code&gt;factor()&lt;/code&gt;, because when reading data in from a file, R assumes by default that text should be converted to factors (see [[../R/Data frames]]). You may need to use &lt;code&gt;as.factor()&lt;/code&gt;. Internally, R stores the levels as numbers from 1 upwards, but it is not always obvious which number corresponds to which level, and it should not normally be necessary to know.

Ordinal variables, that is factors in which the levels have a natural order, are known to R as '''ordered factors'''. They can be created in the normal way a factor is created, but in addition specifying &lt;code&gt;ordered{{=}}TRUE&lt;/code&gt;.

|Much statistical theory uses [[w:matrix algebra|matrix algebra]]. While this book does not require a detailed understanding of matrices, it is useful to know a little about how R handles them.
 
Essentially, a '''matrix''' (plural: matrices) is the two dimensional equivalent of a vector. In other words, it is a rectangular grid of numbers, arranged in rows and columns. In R, a matrix object can be created by the &lt;code&gt;matrix()&lt;/code&gt; function, which takes, as a first argument, a vector of numbers with which the matrix is filled, and as the second and third arguments, the number of rows and the number of columns respectively.

R can also use '''array''' objects, which are like matrices, but can have more than 2 dimensions. These are particularly useful for '''tables''': a type of array containing counts of data classified according to various criteria. Examples of these &quot;contingency tables&quot; are the &lt;code&gt;HairEyeColor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Titanic&lt;/code&gt; tables shown below.

As with vectors, the indexing operator &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; can be used to access individual elements or sets of elements in a matrix or array. This is done by separating the numbers inside the brackets by commas. For example, for matrices, you need to specify the row index then a comma, then the column index. If the row index is blank, it is assumed that you want all the rows, and similarly for the columns.|m &lt;- matrix(1:12, 3, 4)      #Create a 3x4 matrix filled with numbers 1 to 12
m                            #Display it!
m*2                          #Arithmetic, just like with vectors
m[2,3]                       #Pick out a single element (2nd row, 3rd column)
m[1:2, 2:4]                  #Or a range (rows 1 and 2, columns 2, 3, and 4.)
m[,1]                        #If the row index is missing, assume all rows
m[1,]                        #Same for columns
m[,2] &lt;- 99                  #You can assign values to one or more elements

      <text xml:space="preserve">The transition state is the highest energy intermediate of a reaction and thus tends to be the shortest-lived intermediate along a reaction coordinate. Upon formation of the transition state, the intermediate can spontaneously proceed to product formation.

This transition state of intermediates are indicated by double dagger. Transition state has a higher free energy or delta G than reactants and products. Therefore, the intermediates are less stable than reactants and products.

The energy difference between reactant and transition state is called activation energy. The activation energy determine the rate of reactions. Since the activation energy is the difference in energy between the reactant and the intermediate, it acts as a barrier for the reactant to overcome. As a result, enough energy must be added to the reactants in order to overcome the activation energy and transform into product. Therefore, the higher the activation energy, the harder it will be for the reactant to be converted into product. The rate limiting step, which is sometimes related to formation of the highest energy intermediate determines the rate of the reaction. The activation energy depends on a number of factors including temperature, the specific reaction involved and the presence of catalysts. 

An enzyme generally accelerates the rate of reaction by stabilizing the transition state intermediate. Enzymes simply lower the activation energy of the intermediates by changing the conformation of the intermediates into a more favorable and stabilized conformation. A stabilized intermediate means lower activation energy and as mentioned above, lower activation energy means lower activation barrier so the reactants can form products at a faster rate. The result is generally a very large increase in reaction rates on the order of millions of times.

Enzymes do not alter reaction equilibrium because they do not change the potential energy of either starting material or products. Furthermore, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are changed equally, meaning that the ratio of k&lt;sub&gt;forward&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;reverse&lt;/sub&gt; is the same at all times.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In other words, Isozymes are ezymes that catalyze the same chemical reactions but have the different in amino acid consequences. They are displayed in different kinetic parameter and different regulatory properties.

== Definition ==

Isozymes (also known as isoenzymes) are homologous enzymes that catalyze the same reaction but differ in structure. The differences in the isozymes allow them to regulate the same reaction at different places in the specie. In particular they differ in amino acid sequences. They display different kinetic parameters as well as regulatory properties. For example, isozymes have different K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values, and can be distinguished from one another by biochemical properties such as electrophoretic mobility.

Isozymes are encoded by different genes and expressed in a distinct organelle or at a distinct stage of development. The purpose of isozymes is to allow fine adjustment of metabolism to meet the need of different development stages and help the different tissues and organs function properly depending on their physiology make up and in what kind of environment which they function. For example, the isoenzymes of lactate dehydrogenase in animal organs are different in term of their amino acid sequences and the level of their expression. The level of the different isozymes in a certain organ is related to the level of oxygen supply.  Isozymes appear in specific regions of the body; differing in specifics organelles or tissues.

In terms of kinetics, isoenzymes have the capability to fine tune their enzymatic rate constants K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;. This adaptation allows for the proper use of the enzyme based on its environment (e.g. lactate dehydrogenase isozymes present in the heart and in the liver, where O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is abundant in heart but not so in the liver).

== Differentiating Isozymes ==

As mentioned above, isozymes are enzymes that have different structures but carry out the same tasks. A biochemical assay is needed to differentiate between different isozymes. Another method one could use is gel electrophoresis. This method takes advantage of the fact that isozymes have substituted amino acids and that provides a change in electrical charge of the enzyme. This difference in electrical charge between two different isozymes can be readily detected by gel electrophoresis. This provides a basis for molecular markers because these isozymes can easily be detected. 

For identifying isozymes, a crude protein produced from grounded animal/plant tissue and buffer is used. The components of this protein is then extracted according to its electrical charge via electrophoresis. Since all the proteins from the tissue are present in the gel, an assay used to identify the individual enzymes by linking their functions to staining reactions. This method requires the enzyme to be active and functional after separating them via gel electrophoresis.

== Applications ==
[[Image:Figure B.JPG‎|right|thumb|Lsozymes of lactate dehydrogenase]]

Isozymes in general can be used to meet the metabolic needs of different tissues and developmental stages. An example of an enzyme with different isozymes is lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This enzyme is used to catalyze the synthesis of glucose in anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The isozymes of this enzyme are divided into two forms, the H isozyme and the M isozyme. The H isozyme is expressed more in the heart, whereas the M isozyme is expressed more frequently in the skeletal muscle. Both isozymes have two polypeptide chains, and each isozyme share 75% of the amino acid sequence for the chains. Both isozymes metabolize glucose, but the difference is that the H isozymes have a higher affinity for their substrates than the M isozyme does. Another difference is that the H isozyme functions better in aerobic environments such as the heart, whereas the M isozyme functions better in anaerobic environments such as the muscle, where strenuous activity may deplete the oxygen supplies. For example, when a rat heart is developing, the amount of H and M isozymes in the rat heart tissue begins to change because of the switch from an anaerobic environment to an aerobic one. This can be seen in figure A. This chart describes the rat heart's lactate dehydrogenase isozyme profile changes as the rat heart tissue develops. The H isozyme is shown as squares and the M isozyme is shown as circles. the negative numbers are the days before birth and the positive numbers are the days after birth. The amount of M isozymes decreases dramatically as the rat grows into the adult stage.

Isozymes may also be utilized to diagnose tissue damage such as damaged heart muscle cells during a heart attack or myocardial infarction. When heart muscle cells are damaged, they release the cellular material such as the H isozyme. When taking blood samples, if the H isozymes appear in increased levels, then there is a possibility that the heart cells are damaged.

Another example of an isozyme is hexokinase.  The substrate is usually glucose and the product is glucose-6-phosphate.  The six-carbon sugar is also known as a hexose.  Glucokinase is one isozyme of hexokinase.  A kinase is an enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from NTP to NMP.  ATP is often used in these types of reactions.  Glucokinase is important in metabolism, and regulating carbohydrates in the human body.  The difference of the Glucokinase enzyme is that it has a much lower affinity for glucose.  Most Glucokinase activity is found in the liver.  This is where it catalyzes the conversion of glucose to triglycerides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
A key feature of nearly all enzymes is that they bind their substrates with a high affinity or high degree of specificity. For example, because hexokinase binds glucose very well, we say it has a high affinity for glucose. On the other hand, hexokinase has a low affinity for other sugars, such as fructose, and galactose, which have similar structures to glucose. The interactions between enzymes and their substrates have been studied by a German scientist, Emil Fischer, who proposed that the recognition of a substrate by an enzyme resembles the interaction between a lock and key: only the right-sized key (the substrate) will fit into the keyhole (active site) of the lock (the enzyme). Further studies revealed that the interaction between an enzyme and its substrates also involves movements or conformational in the enzyme itself. These conformational changes cause the substrates to bind more tightly to the enzyme, a phenomenon called induced fit. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of reactants to products only after this conformational change takes place. 
==Enzyme==
Enzymes are used to accelerate reactions.  Most enzymes provide accelerated reaction mechanisms by reducing the energy required to obtain the transition state between reactants and products.  For example, carbonic anhydrase, one of the fastest enzymes known, is capable of transforming carbon dioxide into carbonic acid at a rate of 1 million molecules per second&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;.  The reactants used in a reaction are also known as substrates. These substrates require enzymes to be specific so that enzymes act on the correct substrate or bond to catalyze the desired reaction.  More precisely, the specificity of an enzyme is due to the precise interaction of the substrate with the enzyme.  This precision is a result of the intricate three-dimensional structure of the enzyme protein&lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Enzyme-ligand complex==
Enzyme specificity results from the binding site features. In other words, the specificity of an enzyme and substrate could be analogous to a lock and a key. The key will not open a lock if the key does not have the compatible shape. The active site is often characterized by complementarity in which the shape matches the substrate to which it binds.  It also contains a specialized microenvironment in which certain amino acid side chains contribute to its general properties such as hydrophobic preferences or polarity.  This environment allows the active site to be more compatible with the substrate.  The enzyme and substrate complex is held together by weak noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, hydrophobic effect or Van der Waals interactions which makes the exact arrangement of atoms in the active site and on the substrate necessary for proper binding.

==Inhibitors==
The concept of specificity is what allows enzyme inhibitors to work.  Many inhibitors make use of specificity by having structures that are very similar to the substrate.  They are therefore able to bind to the enzymes and deactivate them by either modifying part of the active site, covalently binding to the active site, or causing the enzyme to begin catalysis, generating an intermediate that inactivates the enzyme.  

Some highly potent inhibitors make use of specificity by the mimicking the transition state of a catalyzed reaction.  An example of this is pyrrole 2-carboxylic acid.  The α-carbon of pyrrole 2-carboxylic acid resembles the trigonal α-carbon of the transition state of the racemization of proline.  Pyrrole 2-carboxylic acid is therefore known as a transition-state analog.  Since proline has a tetrahedral α-carbon, the inhibitor more closely resembles the transition state of the reaction than the substrate.  Because the enzyme's ultimate goal is the formation of the transition state, the enzyme has a greater specificity to the transition state-analog than the substrate.

When an enzyme is applied to a reaction, it allows for the reactants to quickly produce the products.  However, over time the use of an enzyme on substrates does not continue to accelerate the reaction. This occurs when the enzyme is fully saturated with the substrate.  At this point, all of the active sites of the enzymes are occupied.  Thus, the reaction reaches a maximal velocity asymptotically and eventually levels off to a constant rate. The maximum velocity is evidence that the enzyme-substrate complex exists. The maximum velocity is also known as the turnover rate, or the number of substrate molecules it can convert to product per unit time. When the enzyme is saturated, all enzymes in the solution are found in ES complexes and thus the formation of the intermediate no longer affects the rate. This means that Vmax is determined only by the rate constant for the formation of product from the ES complex.


[[Image:Maximum velocity.GIF]]

There is an older method to determine K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. It is used before the invention of computer because it was hard to draw the curve of Michaelis-Menten equation. Therefore, it is impossible to get the exact values of K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; from the curve. This method transforms the Michaelis-Menten equation to a linear line by taking the reciprocal of both sides of the MichaeliS-Menton equation. The y-axis is 1 / V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and the x-axis is 1 / [S]. The slope is K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; / V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.

1 / V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; / V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) • (1 / S) + (1 / V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;)

==Effects of Reversible Inhibitors==
Since the maximum velocity is essentially derived from the rate of product formation from the enzyme-substrate complex (k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the initial enzyme concentration ([E&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;]), the maximum velocity is affected by certain types of reversible inhibitors. (Note: ''V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[E&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;]''.) Out of the different types of reversible inhibitors—competitive, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive—V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is affected only by uncompetitive inhibitors and noncompetitive inhibitors. For uncompetitive inhibitors, the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex decreases the full potential of product formation from initial enzyme concentration, which lowers the maximum velocity. As for noncompetitive inhibitors, the maximum velocity is also lowered because the inhibitor lowers the concentration of the enzyme.  A new maximum velocity is formed in the presence of a pure noncompetitive inhibitor, which will be referred to as ''V&lt;sub&gt;max,i&lt;/sub&gt;'' here. This new value can be related to the maximum velocity by: ''V&lt;sub&gt;max,i&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;*1/(1+[I]/K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)'', with [I] representing the concentration of the inhibitor and ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the rate constant of the formation of the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Search Algorithms in AI ==
 
Search techniques are general problem-solving methods. When there is a formulated search problem, a set of states, a set of operators, an initial state, and a goal criterion we can use search techniques to solve the problem (Pearl &amp; Korf, 1987).
A search algorithm is explained in simple terms by Cawsey (1998): Suppose that you are trying to find your way around in a small town, which has many one way streets. Your initial state (A) to the target destination (B) there are many routes, but you do not know which ones to take. You can try as many in real life, although it might be a difficult process. There might be much inconvenience in the whole picture: Once you have passed though one street you may not be able to go back, as it is one way, or you may be stuck in a park. This simplified idea of searching for a place indicates that we can actually map out all the possible routes in such an example; even it is exhausting you eventually find a way. In small scale search problems, as introduced above, simple search techniques are sufficient to do systematic search. However, sometimes we need systematically search for such a route, for instance, on a much more complex map. How do we do that?
Search algorithms are good for solving such problems. The problems could refer to physical problems such as walking or driving from A to B; or it could be abstract actions such as in a set of steps in a theorem, which will allow us to prove from a set of facts.

'''A* Search Algorithm'''

Heuristics search makes use of the fact that most problem spaces provide some information that distinguishes among states in terms of their likelihood of leading to a goal. This information is called a heuristic evaluation function (Pearl &amp; Korf, 1987). In other words, the goal of a heuristic search is to reduce the number of nodes searched in seeking a goal (Kopec &amp; Marsland, 2001).

Most widely used best first search form is called A*, which is pronounced as A star. It is a heuristic searching method, and used to minimize the search cost in a given problem (Bolc &amp; Cytowski, 1992). It aims to find the least-cost path from a given initial node to the specific goal. It is an extended form of best-first search algorithm. Best first-search algorithm tries to find a solution to minimize the total cost of the search pathway, too. However, the difference from Best-First Search is that A* also takes into account the cost from the start, and not simply the local cost from the previously been node. Best-first search finds a goal state in any predetermined problem space. However, it cannot guarantee that it will choose the shortest path to the goal (Pearl &amp; Korf, 1987). For instance, if there are two options to chose from, one of which is a long way from the initial point but has a slightly shorter estimate of distance to the goal, and another that is very close to the initial state but has a slightly longer estimate of distance to the goal, best-first search will always choose to expand next the state with the shorter estimate. The A* algorithm fixes the best first search’s this particular drawback (Pearl &amp; Korf, 1987).

In short, A* algorithm searches all possible routes from a starting point until it finds the shortest path or cheapest cost to a goal. The terms like shortest path, cheapest cost here refer to a general notion. It could be some other alternative term depending on the problem. For instance, in a map problem the cost is replaced by the term distance (Cawsey, 1998). This may reduce the necessity to search all the possible pathways in a search space, and result in faster solution.
A* evaluates nodes by combining g(n) and  h(n). In the standard terminology used when talking about A*: 

'''f(n)= g(n)+h(n)'''


The purpose of this equation is to obtain the lowest f score in a given problem. n being node number crossed until the final node,

'''f(n) is the total search cost, 
g(n) is actual lowest cost( shortest distance traveled) of the path from initial start point to the node n, 
h(n) is the estimated of cost of cheapest(distance) from the node n to a goal node. This part of the equation is also called heuristic function/estimation.'''

At each node, the lowest f value is chosen to be the next step to expand until the goal node is chosen and reached for expansion. (Pearl &amp; Korf, 1987). Whenever the heuristic function satisfies certain conditions, A* search is both complete and optimal (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003).

'''

== Characteristics of A* Search Algorithm ==

'''''Admissibility.''''' 
Strategies which guarantee optimal solution, if there is any solution, are called admissible. There are few items which are needed to be satisfied for A* to be admissible. If a tree-search is in use, the optimality of A* is straightforward to be analyzed (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003). In this case, A* is optimal, if h(n) is an admissible heuristic. 

'''h*(n) = the true minimal cost to goal from n. 
'''
A heuristic h is admissible if h(n) &lt;= h*(n) for all states n.
''

'''''Convergence.''''' 
A search strategy is convergent if it promises finding a path, a solution graph, or information if they exist (Bolc &amp; Cytowski, 1992). If there is a solution, A* is it will always find a solution. The convergence properties of A* search algorithm are satisfied for any network with a non-negative cost function, either finite or infinite. For a finite network with a non-negative cost function, If A* terminates after finding a solution, or if there is no solution, then it is convergent. The number of the paths in a cyclic path is finite. A node which is previously examined node, lets say w, is revisited only if the search finds a smaller cost than the previous one.  The cost function is non-negative; therefore an edge can be examined only once. Thus, A* is convergent (Bolc &amp; Cytowski, 1992).


'''Problem with A* Search Algorithm'''

According to Pearl &amp; Korf (1987) the main shortcoming of A*, and any best-first search, is its memory requirement. Because the entire open pathway list must be saved, A* is space-limited in practice and is no more practical than breadth first search. For large search spaces, A* will run out of memory. Fortunately, a mass of memory could be saved with IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*).

== Pseudo-code A* ==
 
(Anonymous, 2006)

&lt;pre&gt;
create the open list of nodes, initially containing only our starting node
create the closed list of nodes, initially empty

while (we have not reached our goal) {
	consider the best node in the open list (the node with the lowest f value)

	if (this node is the goal) {
		then we're done
	}
	else {
		move the current node to the closed list and consider all of its neighbors

		for (each neighbor) {
			if (this neighbor is in the closed list and our current g value is lower) {
				update the neighbor with the new, lower, g value 
				change the neighbor's parent to our current node
			}
			else if (this neighbor is in the open list and our current g value is lower) {
				update the neighbor with the new, lower, g value 
				change the neighbor's parent to our current node
			}
			else this neighbor is not in either the open or closed list {
				add the neighbor to the open list and set its g value
			}
		}
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Practical Applications of A* ==

A* is the most popular choice for path finding, because it's fairly flexible and can be used in a wide range of contexts such as games (8-puzzle and a path finder).

* Variations of A*
* Bidirectional search
* Iterative deepening
* Beam search
* Dynamic weighting
* Bandwidth search

      <text xml:space="preserve">The protein function of binding is very specific. The ability of binding is dependent on the tertiary structure of the protein, also known as the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The area of the protein that is bound to another molecule, such as a ligand, is called the binding site. The binding site is often a crevice on the surface of the protein. The molecule that binds to the protein changes the chemical conformation of the protein. 

•The active site is also the site of inhibition of enzymes 

•The active site of an enzyme contains the catalytic and binding sites

•The structure and chemical properties of the active site allow the recognition and binding of the substrate

•Protein functions such as molecular recognition and catalysis depend on complementarity

•Molecular recognition depends on specialized microenvironments that result from protein tertiary structure

•Specialized microenvironments at binding sites contribute to catalysis

An example of binding with a protein is the ligand-binding protein of hemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other important organs and tissues within humans.

==Protein properties that affect binding==
===Recognition/Specificity===
An enzyme is specific to the substrate it binds to. It is dependent on structure and placement as well as the sequence of amino acids of the substrate. If the sequence is complementary then it ensures the binding of the two components. In the case of proteases, the residues that are not responsible for [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Catalysis|catalysis]] may be responsible for the recognition and alignment of the molecule, setting it up so that it can have one of its bonds hydrolyzed by the enzyme.

Proteases in particular tend to recognize the side chains of the amino acid it intends to cleave. Oftentimes it is the carbonyl carbon - amide group that succeeds the recognized side chain. 

''Note: image is the protease of an HIV-1''

It is possible to gauge whether an amino residue plays a role in the enzymatic activity of a protease by inducing site-directed mutagenesis to the amino acid in question. If the amino acid in question does play a role in specificity or catalysis, post-mutation the enzyme will have a decrease in its enzymatic activity.

===Complementarity===
The concept of complementarity can be understood in terms of the lock and key model of protein binding (as shown in the figure below). Essentially, the surface of the protein involved in binding exhibits a shape that is complementary to the binding ligand. This allows for protein recognition, binding specificity and affinity. Protein binding can be further explained by the induced fit model. In this model, the protein's binding site also exhibits complementarity, but to a lesser degree than the lock and key model. Once, the ligand is already at the binding site, the protein can adjust the shape of its binding site to better fit and bind the ligand. This concept of protein flexibility is explained in more details in the next section.

[[Image:Proten ligand binding.PNG‎]]

===Surface===
Binding usually occurs at the surface of the protein. See Nature of Binding Sites (below) for more detailed information. The image below shows an example of how a protein's surface recognizes molecules. This is the binding between a sex hormone and globulin. 

===Non-Covalent Forces===
Ligand to protein binding typically occurs through non-covalent forces. The weak interactions of non-covalent forces allow for easy exchange between molecules. For instance, hemoglobin traps oxygen in its binding site at the lungs and releases it to the tissues. It is able to perform the task very efficiently because the binding is strong enough to tightly hold on to the oxygen when it is in the oxygen-saturated lungs, yet weak enough to allow for an easy release of oxygen to the oxygen-deficient tissues.

===Flexibility===
The concept of flexibility can be demonstrated through the idea of induced fit. An enzyme that has a site that originally is not complementary to a substrate may become complementary upon the binding of the substrate. The site of binding changes to a shape that accepts the substrate. This indicates that the enzyme is indeed flexible and the conformation can be changed by the influence of the substrate.

The induced fit model asserts that the binding site of an enzyme is optimized for the transition state of the substrate, not the normal state. This is so that it can easily stabilize the transition state once it is bound to the enzyme, thereby decreasing the activation energy of the reaction and bringing the reaction to equilibrium much quicker .

==Nature of Binding sites==
The binding sites of enzymes has several common features. The active site is a site formed by amino acids that are connected to different parts of the protein. The specific positioning of the amino acids work together to form a three dimensional cleft or crevice. The active site of an enzyme takes up a very small portion of the total volume of the enzyme. The amino acids that do not play a role in enzymatic activity are there to make up for the structure. The many amino acids form a three dimensional structure of the molecule that allows the interaction of the active sites to work with each other and to have reactions with other molecules. Active sites also possess unique micro environments. These unique environments may contain polar or nonpolar residues that each have their own ways for interacting with nearby substrates. In addition, substrates are bound to enzymes by many weak forces that include van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. Although these forces may be weak individually, the large number of forces acting together contributes to the stability of the binding site of the enzyme-substrate complex. Finally, the specific binding sites of an enzyme depend on the specific arrangement of the molecule. Here is an example where one structure leads to an specific function.

Binding sites for large ligands can be either flat, convex, or concave while binding sites for small ligands tend to be exclusively concave. One characteristic of binding sites is that it contain a significantly greater amount of exposed hydrophobic surfaces than other parts. In addition, it is also important for binding sites to possess the ability to bound to ligands firmly, but not so firmly that it will be hard for the ligand to be released. Therefore, weaker non-covalent interaction is characteristic of binding sites because it allows for an easy exchange. This concept is particularly important for hemoglobin because its major function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. In order to efficiently do its job, its binding affinity to oxygen must be sufficiently strong, but at the same time, not too strong otherwise the hemoglobin would not be able to release the bound oxygen once it's in the tissue. Aside from binding affinity, binding specificity is also very important. Specialized and specific micro environments at binding sites are necessary for efficient binding. Lastly, the displacement of water is often typical for binding sites because it is able to promote the binding process.

==How Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Binding relates to Pharmaceutical field==
Pharmaceutical drugs work the same way Enzymes work. They bind to a specific binding site that either inhibits or activates a specific biological action. Caffeine for example is a really known molecule that a lot of people use every day, by drinking coffee or tea, to keep them awake. The reason behind the relationship between Caffeine and alertness and wakefulness is the big structural similarity between the caffeine molecule, adenosine and cyclic adenosine phosphate. The structures similarity allows caffeine molecules to bind to the same binding site of receptors or enzymes that reacts with adenosine derivatives. 
Adenosine has a very important role in the regulation of brain activity. The human brain builds up adenosine molecules during the day. When the level of built up adenosine increases in the human brain, adenosine starts binding to its binding sites (receptors) in the human brain which activates mechanisms that lead to drowsiness and sleep.
Since caffeine has the same structural molecule it binds to the same receptors that adenosine binds to, preventing adenosine to bind to that specific receptor in the human brain and delaying the sleeping and drowsiness process. 

[[File:Wikibook.jpg]]
 
Pharmaceutical drugs have pretty much the same role. They bind to a protein, enzyme, or a receptor that prevents binding of a specific molecule in the human body to bind to that specific receptor and therefore they inhibit a specific mechanism. A specific drug or molecule can bind to more than one binding site as mentioned earlier in the caffeine case. That means that the same drug can inhibit more than one biological mechanism at the same time by binding to two different binding sites. Binding to more than one binding site can explain the side effects of a specific prescribed drug. Furthermore, pharmaceutical and drug development scientists are currently trying to correlate and create a large network of the current drugs with their side effects, binding sites, structures, and role. The reason there is so much research is done in that field is that scientists strongly believe that discovering drugs that are already there that can cure some other diseases has a very high probability because of the presence of a wide range of drugs. Spending enough money on such projects can save a huge amount of money spent on drugs discovery. Discovering a drug can cost $800 million that is not including the huge amount of time and hassle it takes to test out the drug and then goes in market.
Tamoxifen for instance has thirty six discovered binding sites in the human body. Tamoxifen’s molecule has structural similarity to estrogen but it is missing a part that activates breast cancer cells production. Tamoxifen’s secondary binding sites suggest that the drug can be used to cure some other diseases. 
Through bioinformatics, researchers are working hard developing websites and databases that helps ease drug discovery process and makes it more effective and less costly. Promisuous([http://bioinf-apache.charite.de/promiscuous/index.php?site=home ]) database is a tool that has a lot of information about drugs, their structures, binding sites (targets) and metabolic pathways that a specific drug goes through. The tool is really helpful and it has all the needed information that were collected through other important websites and databases like PubChem, Protein Data Base, and Uniprot. It a great tool that helps researchers find more information about drugs in just one place faster and eases drug discovery process in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

An animal cell is a type of eukaryotic cell that dominates most of the tissue cells in animals. Animal cells are different from plant cells because they lack cell walls and chloroplasts, which are pertinent to plant cells. Without the structure of a cell wall, animal cells can be a variety of shapes as they are instead surrounded by a plasma membrane.
One thing that animal cells have exclusively that plant cells do not are centrioles. Centrioles are important for DNA segregation when the cell undergoes the process of mitosis, a process of dividing a cell. Centrioles are important in the structure of the spindles, which helps to pull the chromosomes apart.

Both animal and plant cells have vacuoles, however, in animal cells, vacuoles are very tiny or absent while the vacuole in plant cells are quite large.

'''&lt;u&gt;Cell Membrane:&lt;/u&gt;''' The cell membrane is a fluid mosaic structure which is composed of a phospholipid bilayer and other important macromolecules such as proteins. The cell membrane separates the cell from the environment and allows the movement of materials in and out of the cell.

[[File:Animal.gif|thumb|Animal Cell]]

'''&lt;u&gt;Cytoplasm:&lt;/u&gt;''' the liquid within the cell where the different organelles are found. It is here where many functions occur. Including cell division and glycolysis.

[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Golgi Apparatus|'''&lt;u&gt;Golgi Apparatus:&lt;/u&gt;''']]  The organelle in which proteins are modified, sorted, and sent to various parts of the cell. Modifications on the protein include but are not limited to, [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Protein Glycosylation|glycosylation]]. 

[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Mitochondria|'''&lt;u&gt;Mitochondria:&lt;/u&gt;''']]  does the cellular respiration of the cell by converting glucose into ATP (cellular energy).

[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Ribosome|'''&lt;u&gt;Ribosome:&lt;/u&gt;''']]  The [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Messenger RNA (mRNA)|mRNA]] from the nucleus are used by Ribosomes in a process called translation. Translation is when the Ribosome joins amino acids together according to the sequence of the mRNA.  The more ribosomes in a cell, the proteins it synthesizes.  They are located in two areas, on the ER or in the cytosol.  

'''&lt;u&gt;Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum:''':&lt;/u&gt;  is used to store and transport material through the cell. Proteins are produced here in the ribosomes bound to the rough [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]].

'''&lt;u&gt;Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum:'''&lt;/u&gt; Functions in the synthesis of lipids, detoxification of drugs and poisons, storage of calcium ions, and metabolism of carbohydrates. In contrast to the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum, the smooth ER is not studded with proteins.

'''&lt;u&gt;Peroxisome:&lt;/u&gt;''' A specialized metabolic compartment bounded by a single membrane. Additionally, it possesses enzymes that transfer hydrogen atoms from substrates to oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide as a by-product. Then, hydrogen peroxide is converted to water by another enzyme. 

[[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Nucleus|'''&lt;u&gt;Nucleus:&lt;/u&gt;''' ]]The nucleus is usually the largest organelle in a cell.  It consists of different parts such as the nuclear envelope, chromosomes, and the nucleolus.  The nuclear envelope surrounds the nucleus while segregating the chromatin from the cytoplasm and consists of two membranes each made of a lipid bilayer. The membranes have pores that regulate what goes in and out of the nucleus. Inside the nucleus is the nucleolus which holds the genetic material DNA. Using this DNA, transcription is carried out making mRNA. 

'''&lt;u&gt;Vacuole:&lt;/u&gt;'''  the &quot;storage space&quot; that stores water, salt, and other important substances. There are also food vacuoles that are cellular organelles in which food is broken down by hydrolytic enzymes. These food vacuoles are the simplest digestive compartments. The process of intracellular digestion occurs inside vacuoles, which is the process of hydrolysis of food. This process begins after a cell engulfs food materials through phagocytosis (solid food) or pinocytosis (liquid food). 

'''&lt;u&gt; Lysosome:&lt;/u&gt;''' considered the &quot;digestion compartment&quot; of the cell. Lysosomes break down cellular wastes such as fats, proteins, or carbohydrates. The rid of the cellular materials that are no longer useful in the cell.

'''&lt;u&gt;Cytoskeleton:&lt;/u&gt;'''  is a structure made out of protein to give the cell its shape and structure.  It also helps cellular motion with the use of flagella, cilia, or lamelllipodia.

'''&lt;u&gt;Centrioles:&lt;/u&gt;''' are used through cell division.  They organize the mitotic spindle during the end of cytokinesis. The centrioles are located within the centrosome and come in pairs. Each pair of centrioles are compiled of nine sets of triplet microtubules assembled into a ring. Prior to animal cell division, the centrioles replicate. Although centrosomes with centrioles may assist the organization of microtubule construction in animal cells, they are not crucial for this particular function in all eukaryotes; e.g. the fungi and the majority of plant cells lack centrosomes with centrioles, but still contain well-assembled microtubules. &lt;ref&gt;Biology 9th edition, Campbell&lt;/ref&gt;

==1. What trees in your area are used for building canoes? Name them in your language. Are they considered softwoods or hardwoods? ==
In the Pacific Islands, dugout canoes are very large, made from whole mature trees and fitted with outriggers for increased stability in the ocean, and were once used for long-distance travel. Such are the very large waka used by Māori who ventured to New Zealand many centuries ago. Such vessels carried 40 to 80 warriors in sheltered waters or smaller numbers thousands of miles across the Pacific ocean. In Hawaii, canoes are traditionally manufactured from the trunk of the koa (''Acacia koa'') tree. They typically carry a crew of six: one steersman and five paddlers.

In Africa, African Teak is the timber favored for their construction, though this comprises a number of different species, and is in short supply in some areas.

==2. What trees are used for building canoes, softwoods or hardwoods? ==
Canoes are made from both, depending on the regional preferences.

Trees belonging to the genus ''Acacia'' are used in both the South Pacific and in Africa.  Acacias are hardwoods.  Canoes were made in the Pacific Northwest of North America from Douglas fir, which is a softwood.  In eastern North America, dugouts were made from chestnut, tulip tree (both hardwoods), or pine (a softwood).  In Venezuela, the Ye'kwana make canoes from Spanish Cedar (''Cedrela odorata'') which is another softwood.

==3. What tools are used for building canoes? Start with felling the tree up to completion. ==
*Ax
*Machete
*Adze
*Scrapers
*Wedges (to hold the canoe in place)
*Scaffolding
*Drill and bit

==4. Choose a good canoe tree about four meters in length and observe the correct felling of it. Explain what happened. ==
The Wampanoag (a Native American tribe) felled canoe trees by packing mud around the trunk and building a fire around the base.  The mud would prevent the upper portion of the trunk from burning while the lower portion was consumed.  Eventually, the tree would fall.  

Other cultures simply cut the tree down with an ax.  In doing this, care must be taken to control the direction in which the tree falls when it comes down.  This is done by cutting a notch on the side corresponding to the direction of fall.  This notch should be cut until it is just over half way through the trunk.  Then another notch is cut on the other side, but higher than the first.  

==5. Describe how a log is prepared to build a canoe. ==
First the log is cut to the desired length and the bark is removed from the exterior. 

In South America, the bulk of the hollowing of the trunk is done right where the tree falls.  It is turned in place until the portion of the trunk that will become the keel is on the ground, and then rocks, dirt, and other debris are packed around the trunk to keep it from rolling.  The tree is then mostly hollowed out with adzes.  This is done to reduce the weight of the log before an attempt is made to drag it out of the jungle.

==6. With the help of others properly shape the outside of the canoe and hollow out the inside. Correctly smooth both surfaces inside and outside. ==
[[File:Dcp 5863.jpg|thumb|400px|Building a sea-going dugout canoe 10 meters (33 ft) long]]
Before the appearance of metal tools, dugouts were hollowed-out using controlled fires. The burnt wood was then removed using an adze. Another method using tools is to chop out parallel notches across the interior span of the wood, then split out and remove the wood from between the notches. Once hollowed out, the interior is dressed and smoothed out with a knife or adze.

The ends are tapered to reduce drag in the water.

To shape the hull so that it has an even thickness, bore several small, evenly spaced holes in the hull.  These are then plugged with pegs, the length of which equals the desired thickness of the hull.  The pegs are inserted from the outside until they are flush with the surface of the hull.  The inside is then hollowed until the ends of the pegs are reached.  When the boat is placed in the water, the pegs will swell and the holes will be water-tight.

As the hull becomes thin, the canoe is inverted over a fire to heat the wood, making it more pliable.  The gunwales are then spread apart,  greatly increasing the interior room in the craft.  Spacers are then placed over the gunwales to hold them apart as the log cools, and the boat retains this shape.

==7. Assist in the making of paddles, seats, poles and fittings for the canoe.==
===Paddles===
Paddles are typically carved from long wooden poles.  The blade is made wide and thin, tapering out at the edges.  The shaft is rounded, and is thicker than the blade to give it extra strength.  The grip will be another wide, flat section and is parallel to the blade and fitted to the user's hand.

When making a paddle, the craftsman will be trading strength for weight, and this is a delicate balance to strike.  If the paddle is too heavy, it will easily and unnecessarily tire its user.  But if it is too light, it will lose strength and may break when stressed.  Usually a paddle is stressed at the most inopportune times - they experience very little stress in calm, flat water when it wouldn't be much of a problem if it broke.

===Seats===
The seats are made from wood which is shaped and fitted over the gunwales.  They are shaped such that the bottom of the seat is lower than the gunwales.  The seat will lift off the gunwales.  When the canoe is dragged up onto the beach, the paddler will take both the paddle and the seat into his home.

===Poles===
The poles, like the paddles trade weight for strength.  They are typically the same (or nearly the same) diameter from top to bottom.  The length depends on the depth of the water in which they are used.  Poles are used from a standing position, and the length reflects this.

==8. Assist in the construction of decking, outrigger, mast and sail if the canoe is of a double hull or outrigger type. ==
===Decking===
Not all dugouts were outfitted with decks, but when present, decking is placed at both ends of the canoe to keep breaking waves from filling the boat.  They help the boat to shed water.  Decks are flat pieces of wood connected to the edges of the canoe and can be lashed in place by boring holes in both the hull (near the upper edge) and the deck.  Once the deck has been lashed in place, the holes are sealed with pitch.

===Outrigger===
Outriggers of New Zealand consist of three parts: a pair of booms, connecting pegs, and a float.  One boom is lashed to the canoe near the bow, and the other is lashed near the stern.  Holes are bored into the hull directly below the booms so that cordage can be passed through them when lashing.  

Each boom receives long pegs which are then connected to the float.  The length of the pegs is adjusted so that the float will be positioned at the surface of the water.  The pegs are lashed both to the booms and to the float.  When lashing the pegs to the floats, a hole is bored through the float and the cordage is passed through it.  This prevents the lashing from being positioned at the bottom of the float where it would be subjected to extreme wear and tear as the canoe is dragged across rocks and up onto beaches.  

The float is typically pointed at the bow end and square at the stern.

===Mast and Sail===
If a canoe is outfitted with a mast and sail, it should also have outriggers.  Otherwise, it can easily be toppled by the wind.

The mast is roughly {{units|4 meters|160 in}} long and tapers from {{units|28 mm|1.125 inches}} at the top to {{units|45 mm|1.75 in}} at the bottom.  It is inserted into a hole in the seat, and then into a socket cut into the bottom of the boat to receive it.  
[[File:Dugout boom.png|thumb|300px|Boom shoulders.  The right side is the mast-end.]]
A few inches above the seat it is fastened to a boom.  The boom is the same length and diameter as the mast.  Shoulders are cut near both ends, with the mast-end having a deeper shoulder (see illustration).

The boom is simply tied to the mast, and the sail is tied to both the mast and the boom.  The sail itself is triangular.

See http://www.mit.edu/people/robot/lepalepa/index.html for detailed drawings.

==9. Make a tree model of the type of canoe used in your district. ==
Choose a soft wood and shape the model as closely as you can to match your canoe.  People will often carve a scale model before beginning to shape the log.  The model can then be used as a reference.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The process of catalysis increases the rate of a chemical reaction with the use of a catalyst. A catalyst lowers the activation energy of a reaction, which allows for a different reaction pathway to be followed. This new pathway requires less energy, which as a result, increases the rate of the reaction. A catalyst does not affect the equilibrium of the overall reaction, or make the reaction more favorable by any means. It simply serves to speed up the reaction rate, often exponentially. During the reaction, the catalyst is not consumed and thus the same enzyme may be used to catalyze the same reaction again in the future. This is the reason why catalysts generally affect the kinetic state of a substrate converting into a product, but is not mentioned in terms of thermodynamics of an overall reaction as it plays no role in affecting change in energy.
An enzyme lowers the activation energy of a reaction by easing the formation of the transition state between the reactants and the products.  When an enzyme binds to its proper substrate, it releases binding energy; that is, the free energy released in forming many weak bonds (hydrophobic, H-bonds, electrostatic interactions). Only an enzyme's intended substrate can release the maximum binding energy, explaining why enzymes demonstrate such a high level of specificity.   The substrate in the enzyme-substrate complex must reach its transition state, though, for the most binding energy to released.   Once the transition state has been achieved and the binding energy released, its high instability requires it to shift either to the side of the reactants or to the side of products--with more transition-state substrate shifting to whichever state is more thermodynamically favorable. In other words, the equilibrium of a catalyzed reaction depends solely on the free energy of the reacting substrate relative to that of the products: delta-G.

==Covalent Catalysis==
In [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Covalent Catalysis|Covalent Catalysis]], the substrate forms a temporary covalent bond with a reactive group, usually a good nucleophile, in the active site, and the complex is then incorporated into the catalysis of the reaction. The covalent complex is more reactive than the substrate itself originally was. This may serve to reduce the energy required for later states of the reaction. The enzyme, of course, is not used up during the reaction and thus must be regenerated at some point by breaking the temporary covalent bond. An example of an enzyme following such a mechanism is chymotrypsin, which is an enzyme that cleaves peptide bonds by a hydrolysis reaction, or a protease. Some examples of good nucleophilic groups in proteins are serine and tyrosine (presence of a hydroxyl group), histidine (imidazole group), lysine (amino group), cystine (thiol group), and aspartate and glutamate (carboxylate group).

==Acid-Base Catalysis==
In [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Acid-Base Catalysis|Acid-Base Catalysis]], an acid or base catalyzes a reaction by being a proton donor or acceptor. The acid is often a donor whereas the base is often an acceptor (e.g. a hydroxyl ion). This is often seen in organic chemistry, when a catalyst donates a proton to a hydroxyl group to create water, a very good leaving group compared to the hydroxyl, which is a poor leaving group. This idea applies for other reactions in organic chemistry as well, even if water is not involved - the catalyst donates or accepts a proton to create a better leaving group in order to jump start the reaction. Again, the catalyst is ultimately formed again at some point in the reaction and is not consumed.

In specific acid-base catalysis, water serves as the catalyst. The hydronium ion (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) serves as the proton donor while the hydroxide ion (OH&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;) serves as the proton acceptor.

In general acid-base catalysis, molecules other than water take the role of the catalyst. Examples may be cofactors, or residues of protons from amino acid side chains. Histidine, for example, is an effective catalyst since its pKa is very close to physiological pH.

==Catalysis by Approximation==
[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Catalysis By Approximation|Catalysis By Approximation]] is described by two substrates bound to one another so that they are close together near the site of reaction along the enzyme, thus increasing the reaction rate. A substrate may also be brought into contact with a catalytic group rather than with another substrate. The orientation of the two molecules involved here are important to the process.

==Metal Ion Catalysis==
In [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Metal Ion Catalysis|Metal Ion Catalysis]], metal ions function as the catalyst, hence the name. Metal ions may bind to substrates to enhance their interaction with an enzyme by ensuring a proper orientation. The metal ion acts as a bridge between the substrate and the enzyme increasing the binding energy. Alternatively, the metal ion may bridge the substrate to a nucleophilic group. The metal ion may stabilize negative charges on a leaving group to make it a better leaving group, or shield negative charges on the molecule to allow for nucleophilic attack which otherwise may have been repelled. It may also participate in oxidation-reduction reactions by changing their oxidation state.

      <comment>Re: Open Loop vs Closed Loop - new improved diagram!</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Open Loop vs Closed Loop:==
There are some signs wrong in this section - the junction shown in the block diagram is a summing one, and so the transfer function should have a negative in it.  (Feedback is typically negative, and so the form of the equation is what is usually seen, so maybe the block diagram is what needs changing) 

I also thought the open loop would just be KGp(s) not KGp(s)Gb(s) a shown but I don't know how authors are using these representations in later parts of this book and so leave it to someone else to figure out what the correction should be.

:Thanks for the comment. You're right that maybe this diagram is a little confusing. However, even if the sign is &quot;+&quot; at the adder, the gain of the feedback path ''Gb(s)'' could still be negative. Using a &quot;+&quot; sign is just a general form, and changing the sign of the gain term can give both positive and negative feedback. Negative feedback is much more common in control systems, but positive feedback has uses in other types of system modeling. The focus here is obviously on controls, but having a little bit of generality is never a bad thing. We could leave an explanatory note here to clarify the situation, you can do it if you want or I can add it later.
:I've always read that the open loop gain was ''KGp(s)Gb(s)'', and that's how it's used throughout the rest of the text. Again, if there are alternatives we should probably leave an explanatory note about it. Do you want to do it or should I? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:17, 2 December 2008 (UTC)

::I have now modified the diagram to show the negative feedback explicitly, which is a better match to the transfer functions in my opinion. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 23:32, 18 June 2012 (UTC)

== Elevator Example ==

In the Elevator Example the following text appears:


&quot;Where we are measuring in units of &quot;floors&quot;. At time t0, the error signal is:

e(t0) = x(t1) − y(t1) = 5 − 1 = 4

Which means that the elevator needs to travel upwards 4 more floors. At time t1, when the elevator is at the second floor, the error signal is:

e(t1) = x(t1) − y(t1) = 5 − 2 = 3&quot;


I think that there must be an error here, shouldn't e(t0)=x(t0)-y(t0), rather than e(t0) = x(t1) − y(t1)?
I'm probably failing my controls class right now, so I didn't want to edit the page, just thought I'd bring this point up.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The rate equation of a reaction maps out the rate of disappearance/appearance of a compound over time. 

rate = k[A]

Where [A] is the molar concentration of compound A, and 'k' is the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Rate constant|rate constant]]. Rates can have a certain order to them. They can be zero, first, second, etc. depending on the reaction. First order reactions (like the one above) are directly proportional to the concentration, so its 'k' value has a unit equal to (1/s) so as to make the rate (M/s). 

Second order reactions could look like so:

rate = k[A]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

where the constant 'k' units are (1/M•s).

Though reaction orders are often whole numbers, they may also be fractions or negative in value.

==Zero Order Reaction==

A zero-order reaction is independent of the concentration of the reactants, in which even a higher concentration of reactants will not speed up the rate of the reaction. This kind of reaction if found when a catalyst or other material required for the reaction is saturated by the reactants. Zero-order reactions frequently have to occur first in order to provide reactive substances for the higher order reactions.

The rate equation of this reaction is illustrated as: &lt;big&gt;Rate = K&lt;/big&gt;

Furthermore, a plot of concentration versus time should yield a straight line.

[[Image:Order0.gif]]

=First Order Reaction=
A first-order reaction depends on the concentration of only one reactant. This order occurs mostly in the reactions where there is only one reactant.  

The rate equation of this reaction is illustrated as: &lt;big&gt;Rate = K[A]&lt;/big&gt;

Furthermore, a plot of the natural log of concentration versus time should yield a straight line.

[[Image:Order1.gif]]

=Second Order Reaction=

A second-order reaction is characterized by the property that their rate is proportional to the product of the concentrations of two reactants. 

The rate equation of this reaction is illustrated as: &lt;big&gt;Rate = K[A][B]&lt;/big&gt;

This means that if you double the concentration of the reactants, it will result in a four time increase in rate.

Furthermore, a plot of the inverse of concentration versus time should yield a straight line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The pre-steady state is the first few milliseconds in a reaction before anything significant happens (aka before it reaches its steady state). This occurs during the moment when the enzyme is mixed with the substrate, but products have not yet been formed. It concerns the kinetics for the reaction to reach the steady-state.

Can somebody elaborate on this ? 
&quot;The difference between \textcolor and \color is the same difference between \texttt and \ttfamily, you can use the one you prefer.&quot;

I couldn't find the difference between \texttt and \ttfamily on the Formatting page either.

:Checkout following example:
&lt;pre&gt;
\texttt{Hello} World\\
{\ttfamily Hello} World\\
\textfamily{Hello} World
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Background (bg) color of text; headings==
A nice article! Just a few requests:
* Could somebody elaborate more on bg color for the text?
* How to change the bg color of headings (\section, \subsection)?
* is it possible to color '''only one line''' in LaTeX? E.g. the very first line on each page is colored in some color and not the successive lines?

Thank you,

== This article is useless.  ==

 
It doesn't even show where you're supposed to enter what colour you want. There's no distinction between when you have to type &quot;color&quot; and when you have to type &quot;red&quot;. It won't help anyone, just a waste of time. It's a good start, someone fix it please and put examples.
=== Not at all ===
Well, not everyone can explain things in such diverse ways as to make it universally understood. It also helps if you read the article then consider what it is trying to say and testing stuff out. The command sequences are placed where they are needed, for example, to color a table place the line:
  \begin{center}
  \rowcolors{1}{PaleGreen}{Tan}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline  
before the \begin{tabular}. Or somewhere in the body of text you might want a line that looks something like: 
  \color{red}This text will appear red \color{black} Which returns text to the default color, black anyway.

So no, the article is not useless, just perhaps not as clear as it could be.--[[User:Henry Tallboys|Henry Tallboys]] ([[User talk:Henry Tallboys|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Henry Tallboys|contribs]]) 03:53, 22 April 2012 (UTC)

== Color names are not proper names, should not be capitalized ==

This is quite a helpful article, but I found that using the color names as shown (with capital letters) didn't work.  I had to use lower case throughout.  Perhaps this could be clarified in the tables of colors provided?</text>

The classification of an enzyme is shown within the table as it's class and the type of reduction the enzyme goes through.  An example of a name is glucose phosphotransferase. In this reaction ATP transfers one of its phosphates to glucose: ATP + D-glucose -&gt; ADP + D-glucose 6-phosphate. Since this process &quot;transfers&quot; a phosphate group to glucose, it is within the classification of transferases, hence the name &quot;glucose phosphotransferase.&quot; Since many enzymes have common names that do not refer to their function or what kind of reaction they catalyze, a enzyme classification system was established. There are six classes of enzymes that were created with subclasses based on what they catalyze so that enzymes could easily be named. Depending on the type of reaction catalyzed, an enzyme can have various names. These classes are Oxidoreductases, Transferases, Hydrolases, Lyases, Isomerases, and Ligases. This is the internation classification used for enzymes. For example, a common oxidoreductase is dehydrogenase. Dehydrogenase is known as an enzyme that oxidizes a substrate and transferring protons.  Enzymes are normally used for catalyzing the transfer of functional groups, electrons, or atoms. Since this is the case, they are assigned names by the type of reaction they catalyze. This allowed for the addition of a four-digit number that would precede EC(Enzyme Commission) and each enzyme could be identified. The reaction that an enzyme catalyzes must be know before it can be classified.

Oxidoreductases catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions where electrons are transferred. These electrons are usually in the form of hydride ions or hydrogen atoms. When a substrate is being oxidized it is the hydrogen donor. The most common name used is a dehydrogenase and sometimes reductase will be used. An oxidase is referred to when the oxygen atom is the acceptor.

Transferases catalyze group transfer reactions. The transfer occurs from one molecule that will be the donor to another molecule that will be the acceptor. Most of the time, the donor is a cofactor that is charged with the group about to be transferred.

Hydrolases catalyze reactions that involve hydrolysis. This cases usually involves the transfer of functional groups to water. When the hydrolase acts on amide, glycosyl, peptide, ester, or other bonds, they not only catalyze the hydrolytic removal of a group from the substrate but also a transfer of the group to an acceptor compound. These enzymes could also be classified under transferaes since hydrolysis can be viewed as a transfer of a functional group to water as an acceptor. However, as the acceptor's reaction with water was discovered very early, it's considered the main function of the enzyme which allows it to fall under this classification.

Lyases catalyze reactions where functional groups are added to break double bonds in molecules or the reverse where double bonds are formed by the removal of functional groups.

Isomerases catalyze reactions that transfer functional groups within a molecule so that isomeric forms are produced. These enzymes allow for structural or geometric changes within a compound. Sometime the interconverstion is carried out by an intramolecular oxidoreduction. In this case, one molecule is both the hydrogen acceptor and donor, so there's no oxidized product. The lack of a oxidized product is the reason this enzyme falls under this classification. The subclasses are created under this category by the type of isomerism.

Ligases are used in catalysis where two substrates are litigated and the formation of carbon-carbon, carbon-sulfide, carbon-nitrogen, and carbon-oxygen bonds due to condensation reactions. These reactions are couple to the cleavage of ATP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Desolvation, in biochemistry, is the process where in an aqueous solution containing an enzyme and a substrate, water that is surrounding the substrate is replaced by the enzyme. In other words, water molecules that were once in between the substrate and the enzyme are displaced to allow the interaction of the substrate with the enzyme. The process also increases the entropy of the reaction, making the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex more thermodynamically favorable.

The method of desolvation involves drying a sample in a solution. An example of this involves electro-statically bound particles to dissociate by releasing water in an aqueous solution. This method is commonplace in atomic absorption spectroscopy, in which an atomic gas is created through a liquid sample. It can also be used in vaporization.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

''Revealing the secret of circuits with voltage compensation (op-amp inverting circuits with negative feedback) is my first great achievement in teaching analog electronics. I would like to dedicate all my insights about this legendary idea that I will expose in this story to my love who inspires me to continue revealing the secrets of electronic circuits.

== History ==

[[Image:Oehmichen_1971_400.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. The first meeting with the inverting amplifier, 1976.&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the beginning of our discussion I would like to tell how I have managed to reveal the truth about these legendary electronic circuits as my story is quite indicative for education. This was not one-act process; I needed many years (from 70's to 90's) to think about these so popular circuits before to grasp the fundamental idea behind this great phenomenon. By presenting the evolution of my thinking about this great idea through time I would like to show how hard and even painfully is to reveal great circuit ideas. Maybe, this is the reason why nobody does this thankless job and why lecturers continue trying to &quot;explain&quot; circuits with formal methods&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Why Circuit Ideas are Hidden#Looking for an answer in second-hand sources|Why Circuit Ideas are Hidden]] elucidates why inventors, authors, lecturers, professionals and producers hide circuit ideas.&lt;/ref&gt;. Imagine I published the truth about these circuits 12 years ago but I haven't still seen it somewhere on the web or in electronics books! Regretfully, circuits with parallel negative feedback remain still unexplained! If you don't believe me, write [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1T4GGLL_enBG301BG302&amp;q=op-amp+inverting+circuits&amp;start=10&amp;sa=Nop-amp ''op-amp inverting circuits''] or some similar key words in Google window and try to find what the basic idea is behind them. Please, let me know if you have found even some rudiments of the basic idea; I'm eager to get familiar with the author! Well, here is my story...

[[Image:Student_manual_1991_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. Beginning to reveal the secret of circuits with parallel negative feedback, 1986.&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Learning without understanding ===

In 1976, as a student in Technical university of Sofia, I was working in a research laboratory where I had to design an electronic instrument for measuring mechanical vibrations. Then, for the first time, I struck the circuit of op-amp inverting amplifier and the concept of virtual ground in the book ''Emploi Rationnel Des Circuits Integres'' by ''Oehmichen J.P.'' (Fig. 1). I remember it looked quite strange for me; I didn't understand what the concept of virtual ground was, what it meant and how it arose. Two years later I began studying analog electronics; then I was trying without success to grasp the great idea behind this class of op-amp circuits with parallel negative feedback (op-amp inverting circuits). I remember I stayed after lections and asked the lecturer what was hidden behind all these formulas on the black board...but she can't answer me. I passed this examination perfectly and yet I didn't understand what the great idea was; I knew these circuits but actually I didn't understand them...

=== Teaching without knowing ===

In 1986, when I began teaching analog electronics to my students, I continued trying to reveal the secret of parallel negative feedback. The paradox was that I was accurately teaching them to pure students but...actually I didn't still understand them:) Now, I don't feel worried about this &quot;educational phenomenon&quot; as thousands of lecturers continue teaching their students in this manner - teaching without actually knowing the ideas behind circuits. What is more, thousands of electronic designers create well-working circuits without knowing the ideas behind them as well. So, I have finally stopped wondering at these paradoxes nowadays...

Gradually, I began sensing some rudiments of the great idea. In the circuit of op-amp inverting amplifier (Fig. 2a), I discerned the humble but so useful and elegant circuit of [[Circuit Idea/Parallel Voltage Summer|passive parallel voltage summer]] R1-R2 acting as &quot;electrical scales&quot; (Fig. 2b). Then, I understood how important is to show where currents flow in these circuits (Fig. 2c) and showed these insights in the student manual for laboratory exercises. Finally, I understood that the essence of the great ''voltage compensation'' idea is hidden in the two elements: the very op-amp and the element connected between the op-amp's output and its inverting input. In the case of op-amp inverting amplifier, they constitute the famous op-amp inverting current-to-voltage converter&lt;ref name=i-to-v&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter]] (compensating the internal losses by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; (transimpedance amplifier).

I remember, it was maybe in 1988, I showed to students that the two voltage sources in the op-amp inverting amplifier (the input voltage source and the op-amp output acting as another voltage source) are connected in series with opposite polarities. Then, a curious student that was looking at Fig. 2b cried out, &quot;But the two voltages are summed!&quot; I was deeply impressed by his insight and began thinking about this strange fact.

[[Image:Volt_comp_old_idea_1992_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3. Realizing the great idea of voltage compensation, 1992.&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Realizing the great idea ===

It looked strange but although the two voltages had opposite polarities they were summed; the output voltage was added to the input one! &quot;What did it mean?&quot;, I began thinking with feverish haste. Thus, in the end of 80s, I began realizing the great &quot;input voltage helping&quot; idea:

'''''In all the op-amp circuits with parallel negative feedback (op-amp inverting circuits) the op-amp is connected with the purpose to &quot;help&quot; the input voltage source. The op-amp adds as much voltage to the input voltage as it loses across the &quot;disturbing&quot; element connected between the op-amp's output and its inverting input.'''''

This was the truth about these legendary circuits! Imagine I needed as many as 15 years to reveal it! I suppose this insight into the great idea conceived in my mind in the early 1990s. Then I was writing down all the ideas arising in my mind on squared sheets of A5 paper. I have scanned especially for you the yellowed record (Fig. 3) that I made on May 14, 1992 at my home. As you can see, I have written there the same 3 stages of building the circuit of a current-to-voltage converter that I have showed in the [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|present story]] about this legendary circuit (see also [http://circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/transimpedance_amplifier/transimpedance_amplifier.htm another story]).

[[Image:Electronics_2007_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. The first paper about the voltage compensation idea, 1997.&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Generalizing the &quot;helping&quot; idea ===

In the middle 90's, I realized how great the &quot;helping&quot; idea was; I had the feeling that I had managed to reveal a great natural phenomenon that was widely used in analog electronics. I began seeing it everywhere around me where people overcome various disturbances by injecting additional energy; that was the ubiquitous &quot;removing a disturbance by an antidisturbance&quot; idea&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/philosophy/examples-of-inventing.html How I revealed the secret of parallel negative feedback circuits] reveals the philosophy of circuits with parallel negative feedback.&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus I gradually managed to build my own philosophy about how to transform any passive circuit into an inverting op-amp one, the relation between passive and active versions.

In the end of 90's, I had the good fortune to buy the Hayes's student manual&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0521377099/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-2698374-4372039#reader-page Student manual for the art of electronics] by Tom Hayes contains some interesting thoughts about op-amp inverting circuits&lt;/ref&gt; where I saw some interesting thoughts about these op-amp circuits. Then I was impressed by his insights about passive circuits (page 185 - ''...the circuit of passive RC integrator failed to the extent that Vout moved away from ground but the output had to move away from ground, in order to give an output signal...'') although he hadn't revealed the secret of the corresponding active versions (page 185 - ''...the op amp integrator solves the problem elegantly, by letting us tie the cap's charging point to 0 volts, while allowing us to get a signal out; &quot;virtual ground&quot; lets us have it both ways...'') and he hadn't showed the relation between the passive and active versions. Nevertheless, I had the feeling that I had finally met an adherent and I sent my work to him. Alas, Mr. Hayes had lost an interest in revealing the basic circuit ideas...

[[Image:Students 68b.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. Investigating a circuit with negative feedback, 2008.&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Disseminating the great idea ===

In 1997, I began propagating the &quot;helping&quot; idea. First, I decided to show my philosophy (Fig. 4) to my colleagues at ELECTRONICS'2007 conference&lt;ref&gt;Mechkov C., Heuristic methods for converting passive analog devices into negative feedback active circuits, Proceedings of The Sixth Int. Conference ELECTRONICS'97, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; but I hadn't their approval. Nevertheless, I continued presenting these circuits to students in this way...

During 2000-2001, I created two animated Flash tutorials about this phenomenon and a year later I uploaded them on my site of [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com circuit-fantasia.com]. In the first tutorial, I showed how to combine the elementary voltage-to-current converter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/v-to-i-old.html Passive voltage-to-current converter] is an animated tutorial about the most elementary passive converter.&lt;/ref&gt;, current-to-voltage converter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/i-to-v-old.html Passive current-to-voltage converter] is another animated tutorial about the inverse passive converter.&lt;/ref&gt; and current summer, in order to build a compound passive voltage summer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/v-to-v-sum-old.html Passive parallel voltage summer] is an animated tutorial about the elementary summing circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; and then how to transmute it to the famous op-amp inverting summer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/v-to-v-active-sum-old.html Op-amp inverting summer] is an animated tutorial about the famous op-amp summing circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;. The second was an interactive ''Flash'' tutorial that showed how to transform any passive circuit into an inverting op-amp one&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html Op-amp circuit builder] is an interactive ''Flash'' tutorial that shows how to transform any passive converter into the corresponding active one.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the beginning of 2006, I started [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/combined_list_of_circuits.htm Circuit stories on the whiteboard] where I placed seven stories about this great phenomenon 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/virtual_ground/virtual_ground.htm How do we create a virtual ground?] reveals the secret of the great circuit phenomenon&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name = &quot;ammeter&quot;&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/building_circuits/ammeter/op-amp_ammeter/op-amp_ammeter.htm How do we build an op-amp ammeter?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/transimpedance_amplifier/transimpedance_amplifier.htm Transimpedance amplifier]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/active_v-to-i_converter/active_v-to-i_converter.htm How to transform the passive voltage-to-current converter into an active one]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/understanding_circuits/current_source/inv_op-amp_current_source/inv_op-amp_current_source.htm What is the idea behind the op-amp inverting current source?] - reveals the &quot;helping&quot; idea by using voltage bars and current loops&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name = &quot;RC integrator&quot;&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/building_circuits/integrator/op-amp_rc_integrator.htm How do we build an op-amp RC integrator?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, I joined Wikipedia and created three stories dedicated to this idea and its applications&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Virtual ground|Virtual ground]] scrutinizes the basic phenomenon behind the circuits with parallel negative feedback.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Current-to-voltage converter|Current-to-voltage converter]] introduces the passive and active versions of the circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;w:v-to-i&quot;&gt;[[w:Voltage-to-current converter|Voltage-to-current converter]] introduces the passive and active versions of the circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2007, I started [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] and created three similar but more informal stories&lt;ref name=i-to-v&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter]] (compensating the internal losses by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter Visualized|Presenting the Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter in a More Attractive Manner]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=v-to-i&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|Op-amp inverting voltage-to-current converter]] (compensating the external losses by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Circuit Idea]].

In 2008, I joined my students to [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] and we were studying this phenomenon during the laboratory excercises
&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Group 68b#Lab 4: How to make perfect components by parallel NFB|How to make perfect components by parallel NFB]] in the educational laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Group 67a#Lab 5B: &quot;Inventing&quot; the op-amp inverting integrator (a teacher's version:)|&quot;Inventing&quot; the op-amp inverting integrator]] during a laboratory excercise&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Basic implementation ==

=== The purpose of this story ===

[[Image:Voltage compensation technology.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. Creating the story about voltage compensation.&lt;center&gt;]]

Here, I would like finally to generalize all these 20 [[#References|specific stories]] into one great &quot;philosophical&quot; story about the voltage compensation idea; that is why I have started this discussion. In this story we have to extract the essence of the phenomenon and to present it in the most general way. Here, as usual, I will use my favorite [[Circuit_Idea/How_to_Contribute#Images|hand-drawn pictures]], in order to visualize the evolution of the idea. I draw them only by using color fiber pens (Fig. 6).

In the beginning, we might say that there are a great number of op-amp circuits that are grouped in various classifications. Usually, they are divided according to formal attributes e.g., according to their applications (amplifying, generating, converting, etc.) or according to their implementations (tube, transistor, op-amp, etc.) However, in [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] we look for general principles behind circuits; so, we have to classify circuits according to these ideas. This classification is more meaningful than the formal classifications above.

What are these circuits based on the voltage compensation idea? These are all the op-amp ''circuits with parallel negative feedback'' or, in other words, all kinds of op-amp inverting circuits with negative feedback. In the first place, we might mention here the famous [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|transimpedance amplifier]], inverting amplifier, integrator and differentiator, logarithmic and antilogarithmic converter. It would be appropriate to place a [[#List of the most popular op-amp circuits based on this idea|list]] of the most popular circuits based on this idea.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== What the problem is ===

If we scrutinize and generalize the operation of all these circuits, we will realize that ''they produce a current depending on a voltage in some definite way'' - constant, linear, non-linear, time-dependent, quantity-dependent. The first of them - &quot;creating a constant current&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;constant current&quot;&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step6 Keeping a constant current by adding an additional voltage]&lt;/ref&gt; is the most popular task. So, we might think of this module as a story about the famous constant current source. Well, let's begin building, step-by-step, a generalized circuit with voltage compensation.

=== Converting voltage to current ===

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_1_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig.7. Converting voltage to current by a ''current-setting element''.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What do we have? We have a voltage source. What do we want? We want to produce a current. So, in order to make a current flow, we have to close the circuit in some way. But we mustn't simply short the voltage source by a pice of wire as the current will be infinite and unpredicted. We want to obtain a current depending in some completely definite way on the voltage; we need some functional relation between the output current and the input voltage.

For this purpose, we have to close the circuit by an Element 1 setting the desired finctional relation (Fig. 7) so that it will set, form, shape the current as we want. Depending on the nature of this ''current-setting element'' we can obtain various devices acting as ''voltage-to-current converters'': linear - a classic ''voltage-to-current converter''&lt;ref name=v-to-i&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|Op-amp inverting voltage-to-current converter]] (compensating the external losses by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;w:v-to-i&quot;&gt;[[w:Voltage-to-current converter|Voltage-to-current converter]] introduces the passive and active versions of the circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; (a resistor), a non-linear - an ''antilogarithmic converter'' (a diode), a time-dependent - an ''integrator'' (an inductor) and a ''differentiator'' (a capacitor), etc. We may also keep the voltage constant and to vary the magnitude of the element's attribute - a ''resistive sensor'' (a variable resistor). Finally, we may vary both the input voltage and the element's attribute - an &quot;analog-digital multiplier&quot; (a DAC with R-2R ladder).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Converting current to voltage ===

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_2_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig.8. Converting current to voltage by a ''voltage-setting element''.&lt;/center&gt;]]

By connecting the Element 1 (Fig. 7) we have already obtained a current I as a function of the input voltage V and the Element 1's attribute. But we need this current; we would like to consume it. In the simplest case, we connect the Element 2 acting as a current load that consumes directly the current I (an active ammeter&lt;ref name = &quot;ammeter&quot;&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/building_circuits/ammeter/op-amp_ammeter/op-amp_ammeter.htm How do we build an op-amp ammeter?]&lt;/ref&gt;). More frequently, we want to obtain now a voltage depending in a definite way on the current; we need some functional relation between the output voltage and the input current.

For this purpose, we have to insert another Element (2) setting the desired finctional relation (Fig. 8) so that it will set, form, shape the output voltage as we want. Again, depending on the nature of this ''voltage-setting element'' we can obtain various devices acting now as the inverse ''current-to-voltage converters'': linear - a classic ''current-to-voltage converter''&lt;ref name=i-to-v&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter]] (compensating the internal losses by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;w:i-to-v&quot;&gt;[[w:Current-to-voltage converter|Current-to-voltage converter]] introduces the passive and active versions of the circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; (a resistor), a non-linear - a ''logarithmic converter'' (a diode), a time-dependent - a ''differentiator'' (an inductor) and an ''integrator'' (a capacitor), etc. We may also keep the voltage constant and to vary the magnitude of the element's attribute - a ''resistive sensor'' (a variable resistor). Finally, we may vary both the input current and the element's attribute - an &quot;analog-digital multiplier&quot; (a DAC with R-2R ladder).

Here, we solve the well-known problem - [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm how to obtain a constant current]. There isn't any problem, if we [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/building_circuits/integrator/op-amp_rc_integrator.htm#Step1 drive the imperfect current load by a perfect current source] or, if we [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/building_circuits/ammeter/op-amp_ammeter/op-amp_ammeter.htm#Step2 drive a perfect current load (shorted output) by an imperfect current source]. There is a problem in our situation as we [http://circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/building_circuits/ammeter/op-amp_ammeter/op-amp_ammeter.htm#Step3 drive the imperfect current load by an imperfect current source]. How to solve the problem?

You say, &quot;A current source is a current source, the voltage required to create the current is continuously varying (if necessary) to produce the desired current.&quot; Right, this is one of the possible ways of creating a constant current source - by [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step5 simple varying the excitation voltage] or by [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step8 negative feedback] (the best solution). In this arrangement, the excitation voltage source (as a part of a constant current source), increasing additionally its voltage, compensates the losses into the imperfect current load (and not only them). It is wonderful! Unfortunately:(, in the most cases, we can't do that trick as we just can't reach (can't drive) the excitation voltage source! An analogy: can we control the sun, in order to adjust the light or the temperature inside the room:)? 

That is why, we apply more frequently the other trick - we connect an additional voltage source, which compensates (only the local) losses into the imperfect current load. An analogy: we connect additional light or thermal sources inside the room, in order to &quot;help&quot; the sun (instead to control directly it): In this way, we actually convert the imperfect current load into a perfect one with zero resistance (a kind of an active &quot;superconductor&quot;:) You probably guest that using this technique, we can make almost ideal diodes without VF, [http://circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/building_circuits/ammeter/op-amp_ammeter/op-amp_ammeter.htm &quot;botomless&quot; capacitors with infinite capacitance], [http://circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/building_circuits/ammeter/op-amp_ammeter/op-amp_ammeter.htm perfect ammeters with zero resistance] etc. Another advantage of this trick is using the compensating &quot;anti-voltage&quot; as an output voltage; so that we can connect as much low resistance load as we want - see the explanations below. --[[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 10:30, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

=== Connecting an additional &quot;helping&quot; voltage source... ===

[[Image:Voltage_compensation_7_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig.13. ...under the Element 2? YES!&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Generalization ==

Circuits with voltage compensation consist of three components connected in series: a ''passive Element 1'', a ''passive Element 2'' and a ''&quot;helping&quot; voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''(Fig. 13). The Element 1 converts the exciting (input) voltage V into a current I and the Element 2 converts back the current into a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt;; we need it... but it disturbs the current. So, the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; compensates the &quot;disturbing&quot; voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; by adding the same voltage to the exciting voltage source V; as a result, the Element 2 is &quot;neutralized&quot; and the current depends only on the exciting voltage and the Element 1. If we need a current output, we connect the current load in the place of the Element 2; if we need a voltage output, the compensating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; can serve as a perfect &quot;mirror&quot; output voltage - powerful, grounded and inverting.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Real op-amp implementation... ==

=== ...without using negatife feedback... ===


=== ...by using negative feedback. ===

[[Image:Op_amp_integrator_volt_comp_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;An implementation of  the [[Circuit_Idea/Voltage_Compensation|voltage compensation]] idea.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Generalization ===

Most of the circuits with voltage compensation are implemented as op-amp circuits with parallel negative feedback where the op-amp (including the power supply) serves as a &quot;helping&quot; voltage source. It compensates the &quot;disturbing&quot; voltage drop across the Element 2 by adding the same voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;E2&lt;/sub&gt; to the exciting voltage source V. The compensating voltage is negative with respect to the ground; so, all these op-amp circuits are inverting.

== A negative impedance viewpoint at the voltage compensation idea ==

=== A generalized electrical circuit ===

[[Image:Neg_imp_volt_compensation_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 14. Great insight - the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source acts actually as a negative impedance element!&lt;/center&gt;]]

Yesterday morning, strolling along the park, thinking aloud and recording my thoughts about the voltage compensation idea, I gained suddenly a new insight into this great phenomenon. I realized that ''the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source in this arrangement acts actually as an element with negative impedance''! I am deeply moved by my new insight and would like to share it with you! [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 10:35, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

Look again at the right part of the generalized circuit showing the voltage compensation idea (Fig. 14). It consists of two series connected elements: the Element 2 and the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. The same current flows through the two elements and the same voltage appears across them; so, they process the same energy and they have the same impedance. But while the first of them is a passive element that consumes energy from the input voltage source, the second is an active element that adds the same energy to the input voltage source! Then, if the first element has &quot;positive&quot; impedance Z, the second one has negative impedance -Z. The negative impedance element neutralizes the positive impedance element; the result is zero impedance and a virtual ground appears between Element 1 and Element 2!

Eureka! I have finally realized the simplest technique for creating negative impedance:

''Copy the voltage drop across an &quot;original&quot; passive element by a voltage follower and &quot;insert&quot; the &quot;copy&quot; voltage into the circuit to obtain negative impedance''.

Imagine how powerful this negative impedance viewpoint is! Now we may draw important conclusions:

''In electronic circuits with voltage compensation, the compensating voltage source acts as a negative impedance element.'' More particularly, ''in op-amp circuits with parallel negative feedback (op-amp inverting circuits), the combination of the op-amp and the power supply acts as a negative impedance element.''

How simple it is! I wonder how I have not never yet realized this simple truth about op-amp invertin ciruits! Well, let's consider some examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Polyadenylation''' occurs in Eukaryotes to prevent RNA trasncript degradation. A number of enzymes are involved, which add hundreds to thousands of adenines to the 3' end of an mRNA transcript. Many of these adenines will be lost before translation - but enough are added to prevent degradation of the script prior to translation.

      <comment>/* Levels of Oxygen in a Tissue */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Bohr effect was first discovered by a physiologist Christian Bohr in 1904.  This effect explains how hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide effect the affinity of oxygen in Hemoglobin.  If pH was lower than it normally was (normal physiological pH is 7.4), then the hemoglobin does not bind oxygen as well. In other words, the ''lower'' the pH, the ''more'' Hydrogen ions, the ''higher'' the carbon dioxide level and the LESS affinity Hemoglobin has for oxygen.
The opposite explains: the ''higher'' the pH, the ''lower'' the H ion concentration, the ''lower'' the carbon dioxide level, and the GREATER affinity hemoglobin has for oxygen. The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in the lungs is not affected by changing the pH and the oxygen will continue to be loaded normally. This does not prove to be true in tissues however, and a change in the pH results in a lower percent saturation of hemoglobin. More oxygen is delivered to tissues at a lower pH even when the amount of oxygen available remains unchanged. 

==Levels of Oxygen in a Tissue==
How can it be determined if a tissue is more active and thus requires more oxygen? One way to determine this is by the amount of oxygen present in a tissue. If a tissue is using more oxygen, then one would expect that the amount of oxygen would be lower. When this is the case, more oxygen is delivered to the tissue. 
Another indicator that a tissue has a high metabolic rate, meaning that there is a need for increased oxygen delivery, is the production of Carbon Dioxide. When a tissue is more active, the amount of carbon dioxide produced will be increased. 
Carbon dioxide reacts with water as is shown in the following equation:  
 
CO2+ H2O &lt;---------&gt; H+ + HCO-3       

This shows that as the amount of carbon dioxide increases, more H+ is formed and the pH will decrease. In other words, the more CO2 present, the more H+ is formed (so the lower the pH; remember pH is inversely related to the H+ concentration by the equation pH = -log[H+])

A lower pH in the blood is suggestive of an increased carbon dioxide concentration which in turn, is suggestive of a more active tissue that requires more oxygen. According to Bohr, the lower pH will cause hemoglobin to deliver more oxygen. If the amount of oxygen and pH should drop together, even more oxygen will be delivered than if only one of the these factors were changed.  If the pH of the tissues should rise due to a drop in the carbon dioxide concentration, then less oxygen will be delivered. 

The Bohr Effect is dependent upon cooperativity between the hemoglobin tetramer and the Heme group; it is key to note that although myoglobin and hemoglobin are very similar, myoglobin does not exhibit this effect because Myoglobin, a monomer, does not exhibit any cooperative interactions.  If the hemoglobin's cooperativity is weak, then the Bohr effect will in turn be low.

This phenomenon explains why Hemoglobin can readily release oxygen in human tissue.  The pH of the tissue is much lower than in the human lungs, so the blood will want to release the oxygen creating hemoglobin in its t-state.  Once the blood travels back to the lungs, where the pH is higher, the blood will pick up more oxygen for transport.  Myoglobin holds onto its oxygen in the tissue because it is not influenced by the Bohr effect.  On average, the hemoglobin can release 66% of its oxygen, whereas myoglobin only releases about 7%.

If a person were to increase their physical activity, and take in more oxygen. The transport of oxygen per red blood cell would increase as well because the CO2 levels would rise in the body, leading to a lower pH in the tissues. Another factor that will also affect the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is temperature, which may be affected due to physical activity among many other factors. A more active tissue will be producing more heat and will be warmer. This increased temperature may lead to changes in hemoglobin's affinity to oxygen in a similar fashion as would be expected from a decrease in pH.

==pH==
The affinity that hemoglobin has on oxygen is decreased when the pH of the solution is decreased. When the solution is at a lower pH, hemoglobin tends to release more oxygen because it doesn't have as much affinity to keep the oxygen binded to the heme group. The main reason for this is shown by what occurs in deoxyhemoglobin. If the pH is lowered the histidine can be protonated. This triggers salt bridges to form between the now-protonated and positively charged imidazole group on the histidine with the negatively charged carboxylate group on a nearby aspartate. This causes the stabilizing of the deoxyhemoglobin or T state. This causes the T state, which has less affinity for oxygen, to be more prominent which pushes for oxygens to be released from hemoglobin.  

[[Image:PH_effect.jpg‎||Effect of pH on the oxygen affinity of Hemoglobin|400px]]

==Carbon Dioxide==
The presence of Carbon dioxide gives rise to the release of oxygen from hemoglobin. The first way it does this is that at high concentrations the carbon dioxide reduces the pH. This occurs due to the fact that carbon dioxide reacts with water and forms carbonic acid, and carbonic acid dissociate to release proton H and bicarbonate ion, so it will decease pH. This reaction is sped up very quickly with a enzyme present in red blood cells, Carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic acid is a relatively strong acid, so it tends to dissociate causing an increase in hydrogen ion presence. This results in a decrease in pH. 
The second way it aids in releasing oxygen from hemoglobin is that there is a direct interaction that carbon dioxide has with the hemoglobin itself. What occurs is that carbon dioxide stabilizes the deoxyhemoglobin form by reacting with the terminal amino groups. It basically forms a carbamate group which is negatively charged. These negatively charged groups participate in salt bridges. Due to this the deoxyhemoglobin or T state is stabilized pushing for oxygen to be released from hemoglobin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|F Sharp|Sequences|Discriminated Unions}}

{{fsharpTitle|Sets and Maps}}
In addition to lists and sequences, F# provides two related immutable data structures called '''sets''' and '''maps'''. Unlike lists, sets and maps are ''unordered'' data structures, meaning that these collections do not preserve the order of elements as they are inserted, nor do they permit duplicates.

== Sets ==
A set in F# is just a container for items. Sets do not preserve the order in which items are inserted, nor do they allow duplicate entries to be inserted into the collection.

Sets can be created in a variety of ways:

'''Adding an item to an empty set'''
The &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; module contains a useful function &lt;code&gt;Set.empty&lt;/code&gt; which returns an empty set to start with.

Conveniently, all instances of sets have an &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; function with the type &lt;code&gt;val Add : 'a -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, our &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; returns a set containing our new item, which makes it easy to add items together in this fashion:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; Set.empty.Add(1).Add(2).Add(7);;
val it : Set&lt;int&gt; = set [1; 2; 7]
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Converting lists and sequences into sets'''
Additionally, the we can use &lt;code&gt;Set.ofList&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Set.ofSeq&lt;/code&gt; to convert an entire collection into a set:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; Set.ofList [&quot;Mercury&quot;; &quot;Venus&quot;; &quot;Earth&quot;; &quot;Mars&quot;; &quot;Jupiter&quot;; &quot;Saturn&quot;; &quot;Uranus&quot;; &quot;Neptune&quot;];;
val it : Set&lt;string&gt; = set [&quot;Earth&quot;; &quot;Jupiter&quot;; &quot;Mars&quot;; &quot;Mercury&quot;; ...]&lt;/source&gt;

The example above demonstrates the unordered nature of sets.

=== The &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; Module ===
The [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee340244.aspx Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.Set] module contains a variety of useful methods for working with sets.

'''&lt;code&gt;val add : 'a -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new set with an element added to the set. No exception is raised if the set already contains the given element.

'''&lt;code&gt;val compare : Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Compare two sets. Places sets into a total order. 

'''&lt;code&gt;val count : Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return the number of elements in the set. Same as &quot;size&quot;.

'''&lt;code&gt;val difference : Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new set with the elements of the second set removed from the first.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let a = Set.ofSeq [ 1 .. 10 ]
let b = Set.ofSeq [ 5 .. 15 ];;

val a : Set&lt;int&gt;
val b : Set&lt;int&gt;

&gt; Set.difference a b;;
val it : Set&lt;int&gt; = set [1; 2; 3; 4]

&gt; a - b;; (* The '-' operator is equivalent to Set.difference *)
val it : Set&lt;int&gt; = set [1; 2; 3; 4]&lt;/source&gt;

'''&lt;code&gt;val exists : ('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Test if any element of the collection satisfies the given predicate.

'''&lt;code&gt;val filter : ('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new collection containing only the elements of the collection for which the given predicate returns &quot;true&quot;.

'''&lt;code&gt;val intersect : Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Compute the intersection, or overlap, of the two sets.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let a = Set.ofSeq [ 1 .. 10 ]
let b = Set.ofSeq [ 5 .. 15 ];;

val a : Set&lt;int&gt;
val b : Set&lt;int&gt;

&gt; Set.iter (fun x -&gt; printf &quot;%O &quot; x) (Set.intersect a b);;
5 6 7 8 9 10&lt;/source&gt;

'''&lt;code&gt;val map : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new collection containing the results of applying the given function to each element of the input set.

'''&lt;code&gt;val contains: 'a -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the given element is in the given set.

'''&lt;code&gt;val remove : 'a -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new set with the given element removed. No exception is raised if the set doesn't contain the given element.

'''&lt;code&gt;val count: Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; int&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return the number of elements in the set.

'''&lt;code&gt;val isSubset : Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Evaluates to &quot;true&quot; if all elements of the first set are in the second.

'''&lt;code&gt;val isProperSubset : Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Evaluates to &quot;true&quot; if all elements of the first set are in the second, and there at least one element in the second which is not in the first.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let a = Set.ofSeq [ 1 .. 10 ]
let b = Set.ofSeq [ 5 .. 15 ]
let c = Set.ofSeq [ 2; 4; 5; 9 ];;

val a : Set&lt;int&gt;
val b : Set&lt;int&gt;
val c : Set&lt;int&gt;

&gt; Set.isSubset c a;; (* All elements of 'c' exist in 'a' *)
val it : bool = true

&gt; Set.isSubset c b;; (* Not all of the elements of 'c' exist in 'b' *);;
val it : bool = false&lt;/source&gt;

'''&lt;code&gt;val union : Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Compute the union of the two sets.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let a = Set.ofSeq [ 1 .. 10 ]
let b = Set.ofSeq [ 5 .. 15 ];;

val a : Set&lt;int&gt;
val b : Set&lt;int&gt;

&gt; Set.iter (fun x -&gt; printf &quot;%O &quot; x) (Set.union a b);;
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 val it : unit = ()

&gt; Set.iter (fun x -&gt; printf &quot;%O &quot; x) (a + b);; (* '+' computes union *)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15&lt;/source&gt;

=== Examples ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let shakespeare = &quot;O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?&quot;
let shakespeareArray =
    shakespeare.Split([| ' '; ','; '!'; '?' |], StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)
let shakespeareSet = shakespeareArray |&gt; Set.ofSeq
    
let main() =
    printfn &quot;shakespeare: %A&quot; shakespeare
    
    let printCollection msg coll =
        printfn &quot;%s:&quot; msg
        Seq.iteri (fun index item -&gt; printfn &quot;  %i: %O&quot; index item) coll
        
    printCollection &quot;shakespeareArray&quot; shakespeareArray
    printCollection &quot;shakespeareSet&quot; shakespeareSet
    
    Console.ReadKey(true) |&gt; ignore
            
main()&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
shakespeare: &quot;O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?&quot;
shakespeareArray:
  0: O
  1: Romeo
  2: Romeo
  3: wherefore
  4: art
  5: thou
  6: Romeo
shakespeareSet:
  0: O
  1: Romeo
  2: art
  3: thou
  4: wherefore
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Maps ==
A map is a special kind of set: it associates ''keys'' with ''values''. A map is created in a similar way to sets:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let holidays =
    Map.empty.
        Add(&quot;Christmas&quot;, &quot;Dec. 25&quot;).
        Add(&quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Oct. 31&quot;).
        Add(&quot;Darwin Day&quot;, &quot;Feb. 12&quot;).
        Add(&quot;World Vegan Day&quot;, &quot;Nov. 1&quot;);; (* Start with empty Map *)

val holidays : Map&lt;string,string&gt;

&gt; let monkeys =
    [ &quot;Squirrel Monkey&quot;, &quot;Simia sciureus&quot;;
        &quot;Marmoset&quot;, &quot;Callithrix jacchus&quot;;
        &quot;Macaque&quot;, &quot;Macaca mulatta&quot;;
        &quot;Gibbon&quot;, &quot;Hylobates lar&quot;;
        &quot;Gorilla&quot;, &quot;Gorilla gorilla&quot;;
        &quot;Humans&quot;, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;;
        &quot;Chimpanzee&quot;, &quot;Pan troglodytes&quot; ]
    |&gt; Map.ofList;; (* Convert list to Map *)

val monkeys : Map&lt;string,string&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can use the &lt;code&gt;.[key]&lt;/code&gt; to access elements in the map:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; holidays.[&quot;Christmas&quot;];;
val it : string = &quot;Dec. 25&quot;

&gt; monkeys.[&quot;Marmoset&quot;];;
val it : string = &quot;Callithrix jacchus&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; Module ===
The [http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/manual/FSharp.Core/Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.Map.html Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.Map] module handles map operations.

'''&lt;code&gt;val add : 'key -&gt; 'a -&gt; Map&lt;'key,'a&gt; -&gt; Map&lt;'key,'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return a new map with the binding added to the given map. 

'''&lt;code&gt;val empty&lt;'key,'a&gt; : Map&lt;'key,'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Returns an empty map.

'''&lt;code&gt;val exists : ('key -&gt; 'a -&gt; bool) -&gt; Map&lt;'key,'a&gt; -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Return true if the given predicate returns true for one of the bindings in the map.

'''&lt;code&gt;val filter : ('key -&gt; 'a -&gt; bool) -&gt; Map&lt;'key,'a&gt; -&gt; Map&lt;'key,'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Build a new map containing only the bindings for which the given predicate returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.

'''&lt;code&gt;val find : 'key -&gt; Map&lt;'key,'a&gt; -&gt; 'a&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Lookup an element in the map, raising &lt;code&gt;KeyNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt; if no binding exists in the map.

'''&lt;code&gt;val containsKey: 'key -&gt; Map&lt;'key,'a&gt; -&gt; bool&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Test if an element is in the domain of the map.

'''&lt;code&gt;val remove : 'key -&gt; Map&lt;'key,'a&gt; -&gt; Map&lt;'key,'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Remove an element from the domain of the map. No exception is raised if the element is not present.

'''&lt;code&gt;val tryfind : 'key -&gt; Map&lt;'key,'a&gt; -&gt; 'a option&lt;/code&gt;'''
: Lookup an element in the map, returning a &lt;code&gt;Some&lt;/code&gt; value if the element is in the domain of the map and &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; if not.

=== Examples ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

let capitals =
    [(&quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Canberra&quot;); (&quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;Ottawa&quot;); (&quot;China&quot;, &quot;Beijing&quot;);
        (&quot;Denmark&quot;, &quot;Copenhagen&quot;); (&quot;Egypt&quot;, &quot;Cairo&quot;); (&quot;Finland&quot;, &quot;Helsinki&quot;);
        (&quot;France&quot;, &quot;Paris&quot;); (&quot;Germany&quot;, &quot;Berlin&quot;); (&quot;India&quot;, &quot;New Delhi&quot;);
        (&quot;Japan&quot;, &quot;Tokyo&quot;); (&quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Mexico City&quot;); (&quot;Russia&quot;, &quot;Moscow&quot;);
        (&quot;Slovenia&quot;, &quot;Ljubljana&quot;); (&quot;Spain&quot;, &quot;Madrid&quot;); (&quot;Sweden&quot;, &quot;Stockholm&quot;);
        (&quot;Taiwan&quot;, &quot;Taipei&quot;); (&quot;USA&quot;, &quot;Washington D.C.&quot;)]
    |&gt; Map.ofList

let rec main() =
    Console.Write(&quot;Find a capital by country (type 'q' to quit): &quot;)
    match Console.ReadLine() with
    | &quot;q&quot; -&gt; Console.WriteLine(&quot;Bye bye&quot;)
    | country -&gt;
        match capitals.TryFind(country) with
        | Some(capital) -&gt; Console.WriteLine(&quot;The capital of {0} is {1}\n&quot;, country, capital)
        | None -&gt; Console.WriteLine(&quot;Country not found.\n&quot;)
        main() (* loop again *)
            
main()
&lt;/source&gt;

 Find a capital by country (type 'q' to quit): &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/span&gt;
 The capital of Egypt is Cairo
 
 Find a capital by country (type 'q' to quit): &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Slovenia&lt;/span&gt;
 The capital of Slovenia is Ljubljana
 
 Find a capital by country (type 'q' to quit): &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Latveria&lt;/span&gt;
 Country not found.
 
 Find a capital by country (type 'q' to quit): &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;
 The capital of USA is Washington D.C.
 
 Find a capital by country (type 'q' to quit): &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;
 Bye bye

== Set and Map Performance ==
F# sets and maps are implemented as immutable AVL trees, an efficient data structure which forms a self-balancing binary tree. AVL trees are well-known for their efficiency, in which they can search, insert, and delete elements in the tree in O(log ''n'') time, where ''n'' is the number of elements in the tree.

Here an excellent dish from the 407 restaurant in Jerusalem, Israel.  I'm told it was adapted from a Caribbean cookbook.  Here is my best attempt at recreating it at home.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 to 3 chicken breasts sliced into strips
&lt;li&gt;3 cloves garlic, fine minced
&lt;li&gt;1 medium green pepper, cored and chopped
&lt;li&gt;1 med onion, peeled and chopped
&lt;li&gt;800g can chopped tomatoes
&lt;li&gt;1 c. uncooked long-grain white rice 
&lt;li&gt;3 c. chicken broth 
&lt;li&gt;¼ c. all-purpose flour
&lt;li&gt;½ tsp. salt 
&lt;li&gt;1 tsp. black pepper 
&lt;li&gt;½ tsp. dried oregano
&lt;li&gt;¼ tsp hot pepper
&lt;li&gt;2 - 3 tbsp. oil or margarine
&lt;li&gt;lemon juice, white wine, parsley&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a wide, shallow bowl combine flour, salt, black pepper, hot pepper, oregano and garlic. Roll chicken pieces in flour mixture. 

&lt;li&gt;In a large kettle, melt margarine over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook for 3 to 5 or until brown. Remove from kettle and set aside.  Add a bit of white wine or grappa to deglace and pour drippings over chicken

&lt;li&gt;Add green pepper and onion to kettle and sauté until onion is transparent. 

&lt;li&gt;Add rice, tomatoes, broth, and a dash of lemon juice. Stir.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and cook over low heat for 12 minutes. 

&lt;li&gt;Return chicken to kettle. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until chicken is tender.  Add a bit more oregano and some chopped parsley.&lt;/ol&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Every cell in a multicellular organism contains the same identical genome - yet in a human being there are eye cells, bone cells, and brain cells - which all serve different purposes yet genetically are identical. How can this be?

There are two key differences between cells that we call differentiated.
#Cells differentiate through a complex system that involves the establishment of positional information and cell differentiation through paracrine signaling and other processes.
#The genome interacts with proteins which enable or disable certain genes. Due to the initial developmental processes, a different set of proteins is maintained in a given cell, allowing for an identical genome but with entirely different functions, and proteins.
 
When development begins, positional information must be established. &lt;!-- Put more on this here! Include Totipotent --&gt;

Once positional information is established, cells begin to change due to differences in gene transcription among the developing zygote. Some cells become intermediates - cells that would never be found in an adult organism but nonetheless act as a starting point for a number of other cells. These are known as '''pluripotent''' cells.

There are 204 different cell types in Human beings - so not every cell can be &quot;unique&quot;. When development occurs, pluripotent cells divide and through signalling prescribe a '''cell fate''' to a set of cells, known as a '''developmental field'''. The end result is a large number of grouped cells all develop identically, into a muscle for example, while a set somewhere else will develop into something else altogether.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If a cell is to make use of an enzyme, its chemical activity must be tightly monitored so that a great deal of energy will be conserved rather than wasted. Thus, like a switch, there must be a way to turn the enzyme on or off depending on when a reaction is needed. One method for regulation is allosteric control. 

=Definition=
Allosteric control refers to a type of enzyme regulation involving the binding of a non-substrate molecule, known as the allosteric effector, at locations on the enzyme other than the active site. The name &quot;allo&quot;  means other and &quot;steric&quot; refers to a position in a certain amount of space. In other words, allosteric means &quot;at another place.&quot;   
An allosteric site is a site at which a small regulatory molecule interacts with an enzyme to inhibit or activate that specific enzyme; which is different from the active site where catalytic activity occurs.  The binding of the allosteric effector is in general noncovalent and reversible. This interaction thus changes the shape of the enzyme which, in turn, changes the shape of the active site.  This change in conformation will either inhibit or enhance the catalysis of a reaction.  So the allosteric control allows the cell to regulate the needed substances quickly through inhibition and or enhancement.

== ATCase ==
[[Image:ATCaseTop.png‎|thumb|right|Top view of ATCase]]
[[Image:ATCaseSideview.png‎|thumb|right|Side view of ATCase]]
The enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) is an allosteric enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of pyrimidines.

===Structure===
ATCase is made of six regulatory subunits and six catalytic subunits.  The 3 regulatory subunits (r) are dimers made of 2 chains of 17 kd each.  The smaller of the two, the regulatory subunit can bind to CTP and thus shows no catalytic activity.  The 2 catalytic subunits (c) are trimers consisting of 3 chains, each 34 kd.  The catalytic subunit is unresponsive to CTP thus does not follow a sigmoidal behavior.
*The quaternary structure of ATCase is composed of the two catalytic trimers stacked one on top of another. The inhibitory effect of CTP, the stimulatory action of ATP, and the cooperative binding of substates are all accompanied by large changes in the quaternary structure of ATCase.
*Each r chain of each the regulatory subunit binds with a c chain of the catalytic trimer.  The region of contact on between the r chain and c chain is stabilized by a domain of zinc bound to histidine residues in the r chain.  All c chains have contact with the regulatory subunit.

The catalytic and regulatory subunits can be separated by first adding a mercurial compounds and then by ultracentrifugation.  Mercurial compounds breaks the connection because it displaces the Zinc ion, destabilizing the r-subunit domain.  The reaction does not follow a Michaelis-Menten behavior, instead it produces a sigmoidal curve because of the response changes in the substrate concentration via regulation by other molecules and of the changes in binding probability. The addition of more substrate has two effects on increasing the probability that the enzyme will bind more than one substrate molecule while increasing the average amount of substrates bound to each enzyme. More substrate ultimately favors the R-state of ATCase since equilibrium depends on the number of active sites that are occupied by the substrate which is completely opposite of Michaelis-Menten behavior.

=== Kinetics ===
[[Image:T&amp;R states.png|thumb|left|Transition between T state to R state upon bisubstrate analog (PALA) binding to ATCase]]
Allosteric enzymes exhibit sigmoidal kinetics rather than Michaelis-Menton kinetics.  This is because the enzyme oscillates between two distinct conformational states, much like hemoglobin.

*The T state is characterized by low substrate affinity and low catalytic activity.
*In the R state conformation, there is a 12Å separation between catalytic trimers, and a roughly 10° rotation about central axis. There’s also a roughtly 15° rotation by the regulatory subunits. The R state conformation is characterized by an increase in substrate concentration simultaneously increasing the reactivity of ATCase in preparation for the enzymatic pathway of producing CTP.

==== Allosteric Activation ====
[[File:EFFECT oF ATCase Kinetics1234567.JPG|thumb|Effect of ATP on ATCase kinetics|200px]] 
Upon substrate binding at the active site located at pocket between the c chains in the trimer, ATCase has a greater likelihood of shifting to the R state due to substrate binding stabilizing the R state.   The binding of substrates shifts the equilibrium more towards the R-state by increases the probability

that each enzyme will bind and increasing the average number of substrates bound (cooperativity). 

ATP can also bind to the regulatory site of ATCase, but ATP does not inhibit the activity of ATCase in fact ATP increases the activity of ATCase. So at high levels of ATP, the ATP can act as a competitor,for the regulatory site, against CTP. So the activity of ATCase can increase with increased concentration of ATP. This increase in activity can have potential physiological explanations. High levels of ATP means that there is a high concentration of purine nucleotides, so the increased ATCase activity will increase the concentration of pyrimidines. So the concentration of both purines and pyrimidines will be more balanced. Also having a lot of ATP in the cell means having energy for processes such as mRNA synthesis and also DNA replication, so the ATCase can increase amounts of pyrimidines that can then be used in these processes.

====PALA====
In the presence of N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-asparate (PALA), a bisubstrate analog which resembles the substrate intermediate upon the enzymatic pathway, PALA inhibits ATCase which binds to the active sites. The inhibition however, revealed the change in the quaternary stucture upon the binding of PALA. Two catalyic trimers are isolated into their respective T and R states. This inhibition is not allosteric, but instead, introduces the catalytic subunits that are responsible for the allosteric inhibition of this complete feedback inhibition pathway.

'''T-state vs. R-state'''
The T-state is known to tense up the molecule which raises the amount of substrate needed to bind to the enzyme at 1/2 V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;). T-state is less active and is favored by CTP binding. The effect of CTP is T-state becomes stabilized. This means it is harder to convert enzyme to the R-state. On the other hand, the R-state is known to be more relaxed and decreases the K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. As the concentration of the substrate increase, the equilibrium will shift from T-state to R-state. At R-state, the molecule is more active, which means substrate binding is favored. The effect of ATP on the R-state is that it is stabilized, which makes binding substrates easier.

'''Homotropic effects ''' --- substrate effects on allosteric enzymes.

'''Heterotropic effects '''---The effects of nonsubstrate molecules on allosteric enzymes such as CTP and ATP on ATCase

==== Allosteric Inhibition ====

[[Image:CTP.JPG‎|thumb|Effect of CTP on ATCase kinetics]]

Cytidine triphosphate (CTP), the end product of ATCase acts as a allosteric regulator.  Carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate condense into N-carbamoylaspartate intermediate which then forms CTP.  CTP binds to the r chain of the regulatory subunit not in contact with the c chains.  The binding of CTP stabilizes the T state and decreases substrate affinity.  Even though the binding site at the regulatory subunit is distant from the catalytic subunit, the binding will result in quaternary structural changes which promotes the stabilization of the T-state and inhibition.  Thus, it causes the sigmoidal curve to shift to the right.  The reaction will occur fast at a low concentration of [CTP], but at higher concentrations, CTP will act as an inhibitor to ATCase by regulatory or allosteric sites, not active sites.  This is an example of negative feedback, where the end result will terminate the starting reaction. The feedback inhibition of CTP on ATCase can be reversed by ATP. 

'''Heterotropic effects''' --– effects of non-substrate molecules on enzyme

===Cooperativity===
The rate of the product formation N-carbamoylaspartate increase  as the concentration of Aspartate increases. Since it has cooperative character, you can see its curve has the sigmodal feature that means the binding of substrate on one site of the molecules increases the affinity for the other substrates to bind to the other binding sites of the molecules. The sigmodial curve of ATCase incorporates a mix of two Michaelis-Menten curves-one with a high value of KM (shown through the T state), the other with a low value of KM (shown through the R state). The binding of a substrate to a subunit and the consequent alteration of all other subunits is called cooperativity. In cooperativity, binding at one site increases or decreases binding in another site of the enzyme. This is due to the conformational changes of the neighboring sub-unit residues that affect the change in shape of the other catalytic sub-unit. This process is analogous to how hemoglobin cooperatively binds oxygen molecules.

== Mechanism ==
The enzyme has two active sites. One is for substrate and the other is for the allosteric activator which is at the regulatory site. The active site of the enzyme can't bind the substrate when allosteric activators are not bound to regulatory site. On the other hand, if the allosteric activator binds to the enzyme, the shape of the active site, it enables the substrate to bind allowing products to be produced. The enzyme will remain active until the allosteric activator leaves the enzyme.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is driving mobile work?}}

Mobile work allows organizations to hire employees who will be working outside of the business’s usual office. These employees, instead of working in a formal office, work from home, on the road, or at meeting places. This allows the organizations to lower their real estate budget since the employees provide their own workplaces. Furthermore, organizations are driven to employ mobile workers because the companies feel that mobile work results in an “elimination or reduction of commute time, improvement of worker concentration, better control of workload, and better adherence to deadlines as key benefits” (Venezia, Allee). Employees are driven to engage in mobile work for different reasons than those of employers. Employees enjoy mobile work because of “a greater enthusiasm for work, increased commitment to the company, and better relationships with customers” (ibid). Moreover, as technology expands and the world becomes more mobilized, the efficiency of mobile workers is also increasing.

==Costs==
Employers are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of hiring mobile workers to work for their company. One of the major resulting benefits to employers is the lower costs of real estate. As real estate prices are increasing, employers are looking towards mobile workers to increase the company’s profits. By creating a mobile organization, companies must change their infrastructure in order to meet the needs of those workers. Instead of providing office space for each worker, the company will require virtual workplaces where virtual meetings can be held. These workplaces require a lot less space and will save the company a lot of money.

==Productivity==
Furthermore, many employees feel that they are more productive while working outside of the company office. Results of the 2006 Knoll survey conducted by Camille Venezia showed that “most mobile workers are very enthusiastic about their work and often work long hours. (Hood)” For many people, it is easier as well as more motivating to work alone. Often times, mobile workers will perform more effectively because they are free from all the distractions present in a busy office workplace. When working from home the commute time is virtually eliminated and therefore, a larger percentage of an employer’s workday can actually be spent working. For example, someone who works in downtown Montréal may live in Sainte Therese due to cheaper home prices. This can result in three-hour round-trip commute. 

==Relationships==
Both of these issues have increased the popularity of mobility in the workforce. Both, employers and employees have recognized the benefits and have begun to make use of this opportunity. For the employer, it is a way to increase revenues and decrease costs and for the employee, it facilitates workdays and decreases stress. Employers and employees both want to become part of the globalized world. Working from home allows the employers to build better relationships with their clients (Venezia, Allee). This is because employees will spend time speaking on the phone with the client and will then; often times meet face-to-face in locations outside of the office such as coffee shops which allows for more informal conversations leading to better relationships.

==Conclusion==
As the Knoll survey suggested, mobilizing the workforce has had many benefits over the past two decades (Hood). This demonstrates that as the world becomes flatter and globalization continues, companies will demand more and more mobile workers. This survey further showed that only 24 percent viewed it (“office as we know it”) as the &quot;most productive location&quot; (ibid). To improve efficiency, employees, in the future, will seek to work in the most productive environment which studies show is not the usually workplace.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Using Technology to Re-invent K-12 Homework'''

Imagine having your students cheer when they’re given another assignment.  Sound impossible?  Well, maybe it is, but the technology middle school students use to keep in touch with their friends, download their favorite music, and take photos of their families can be put to use for homework, too!

	Blogging can replace journal writing in almost every case.  Several free services allow students to create and name their own on-line web log. Check into Blogger.com, wordpress.com, or livejournal.com to get started.  These are just a few suggestions, there are many to choose from.  Each of your students can create, name and customize his or her webblog to reflect their taste or interests.  Students make entries into their own personal blog rather than writing with pen and paper.  The entries can be used to answer specific questions from a reading assignment or to address current events or personal reflections.  Photos or videos can be added to blog entries to amplify the messages.  As the teacher, you simply subscribe to each student’s blog.  You’ll be notified each time an entry is made or updated.  You can review the entries from your own PC or laptop.

	An expansion on blogging is to assign entries to one central, classroom blog or message board as part of an online discussion.  Students can watch the discussion develop and make additional comments as the topic is explored.  An online debate can be ensured by assigning certain students to take a “pro” or “con” position on a given topic.  Be sure to establish rules for polite debating that must be followed even in the semi-anonymous realm of the internet.  Personal attacks must be proscribed completely.  Students will learn to craft their entries to have the maximum effect in the debate.  You may want to limit the number of entries per student to ensure that all are heard.

	E-mail can be used to send hyperlinks to your students.  Links can connect students to desired websites.  The opportunities are as limitless as the internet itself.  Maps, news items, cultural institutions like museums or galleries, all can be designated as a reading assignment.  To expand on this idea, assign articles from the websites of reputable news magazines.  Ask students to summarize the main article and also expand on the background of the topic with additional web research.  Ask students to follow ongoing news stories through a variety of websites.  Perhaps look for variations in coverage from one news service to another.
	 
Rather than the typical essay detailing summer vacations, ask students to create a slide show of photographs that carries the same meaning.  The project can include shots from family trips, summer camp, or just time spent at the community pool.  Students can use programs like Microsoft MovieMaker or Apple iMovie to piece their presentations together.  Microsoft PowerPoint can achieve the same slide show type of presentation and may be easier for students to grasp the basics quickly.  Online photo albums, like Flickr or shutterfly are another option. Digital cameras will make this project easiest, but photographs can also be taken on most cellular phones.  The technology will allow them to create meaning through the use of a different media, other than the written word.  

	Encourage students to include images that capture the emotions that their time away from school evoked in them.  A photo of a blue sky filled with balloons could be used to represent joy, for example.  Other images could represent different feelings the students may have experienced.  The students’ creations can be e-mailed to their teacher and shown in class.  Consider using these same techniques for photo-journalism assignments.  Ask students to capture images that tell the story of some event.  This could be a local fair, high school sporting event, or a national news story.  The same technology enables students to make meaning through media texts other than written or spoken words.

	Lectures or project instructions can be sent to students via podcasts.  Digital recordings can be created that will allow students to listen to course materials on their own time.  You as the instructor decide what content to include.  This can be your own lectures or assignment instructions, broadcasts whether they are current or historical, music of any type, whatever you decide.  Podcasts can be used for video lectures, solutions of math problems on a white board, demonstration of cultural elements, virtually anything that can fit on a screen.The “podcasts”, in the form of mp3 files that you send out, are collected by students and played on an iPod or other mp3 player.  Students will have access to the course content and your instructions whenever they decide to approach the assignment.  You can prepare multiple units of study far in advance as you make lesson plans.

	Many teachers have had success creating class wiki-books, like the one you’re reading now.  A wiki is a website or collection of web pages that anyone can contribute to or modify.  Depending of the amount of research required, students can be assigned chapters or sections of the wiki-book to create, edit, and complete.  You can determine the topic, division of subsections, and length of the assignment based on the time allowed.  Just like any other book project, students can add text or photos, but also video and links to other supporting sources. 

	Consider creating a class glossary by using a wiki-book.  When students encounter important terms in their reading, reward them for adding the term and its definition to the wiki-glossary.  With each assigned reading new terms will be added to the book.  This will over time create a useful document that all class members can access to enhance their understanding of course materials.  Future classes can rely on the same student-made text or create their own.  Participants will be interested in their classmate’s entries and will understand that their own will be viewed by others.  Hopefully this will encourage careful work.  If necessary, glossary terms can be assigned to each student to ensure equal participation.
	
	Consider using pdf’s (portable document format) to send documents and assignments home with students.  The Adobe Acrobat file reader is available all over the internet for free.  And, the pdf format makes send file attachments faster than sending other file types.  Students can download the latest version to open and read documents you create.  Not only will you save paper and time, but students will have direct access to the information you send them.  Pdf’s can contain magazine pages, journal articles, maps, book chapters, documents that contain graphics and videos, and virtually anything else you wish.  Each week’s assignments can be put neatly together in a compact file.  These files can be sent to students via e-mail or added to a class website for students to access them there.  It is still up to the students to open the files and read them, but the excuses about not having time to get to the library are a thing of the past.

Rather than arguing with students over and over to stop texting in class, harness that technical knowledge and put it to use.  Look for ways to use the communication that is already taking place and apply it to group activities.  Team building exercises can rely on cell phone, Blackberry, or other Palm device to facilitate communication.  Students today carry powerful technology in their pockets.  Much can be done to take advantage of these devices at no cost to schools.  

	 Not all distance learning techniques rely on technology, the vocabulary lists that go home with students to be completed are a form of distance learning.  These, however, are suggestions that require little more than a family PC and a digital camera of some kind.  The affordances of broadcast e-mail, podcasts, pdf files, and digital photography can be applied to any subject.  The only limits are the imagination of the teaching professional and the willingness of the student to pursue their education goals through participation in new delivery methods that reflect the demands of the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the environmental impact of mobile living?}}

We all know and feel the pulse of our times; we need to effectively manage every moment, we need to be fast, flexible (mobile), and connected. Using a cell phone or a Blackberry, a laptop or a PDA, we need to be continuously connected to what happens each and every moment. Access to the new technologies and mobile technology in particular has dramatically influenced our personal lives as well as our work. We all take advantage of the obvious improvement in our lives in communicating and learning things, with the possibility of being continuously connected to almost any network, when we want and where we want. Unfortunately, not all of us are aware of the impact that the manufacturing, usage, and disposal of the computers, cell phones, and other must-have devices have on the environment. Let's identify the phases and the factors with a high impact on the environment. 

==Manufacturing==
Extracting the raw materials and manufacturing components is probably the main factor in creating environmental pollution; this phase makes up more than half of mobile devices' environmental impact. The materials that are extracted, such as precious metals, involve mining to obtain the materials for phone circuit boards. This also involves energy loss and  contamination to air, ground, and water with a big impact on biodiversity. Assembly of these products also creates energy loss and uses water, and their transport has an impact through pollution and creates waste via packaging . Computer and phone companies can work on improving their manufacturing processes in order to decrease the impact on the environment. For example, producing smaller, lighter laptops and cell phones reduces material used in their construction cuts down on the emissions released.

==Usage==
While using our computers, Blackberries, or cell phones, we use a considerable amount of energy. Energy use is another impact that our mobile devices have on the environment. Consumption of energy by burning fossil fuels has an impact on climate change. Certain gases emissions damage the ozone layer, which protects us from the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. These emissions make us more vulnerable to diseases provoked by the harmful effect of the ultraviolet radiations. We can help on saving energy by learning how to effectively choose and use our devices. The newer generations of devices implement better power supplies to help save energy. Newer smaller and lighter laptops and cell phones last longer on a charge and comply with new environmental regulations. In contrast, the heavier-weight, larger footprint products consume more energy to provide the desired performance. Big companies like Sony, Dell, and HP have designed their products to consume less energy. &quot;Footprint and weight are key drivers of life cycle environmental impact on PC products&quot; says David Hallisey, a Gateway representative.  
 
==Disposal==
Finally, the end of use of a device is another phase of a product life cycle. With the need to upgrade or replace equipment as technology continuously advances, the lifecycle of our devices can be very short. That is why the waste is another factor that has an impact on the environment. All the computer and cell phone producers have developed strategies on reusing and recycling materials to reduce waste, energy consumption, and pollution. These companies encourage customers to return their old devices for reuse or recycle when purchasing new products.

==Conclusion==

::[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' Are you sure that you are remembering it correctly ? I know we delete stubs if they are stalled projects with no useful content, this page was &quot;completed&quot; in 2006, all work here was done by a single editor and the Wikipedia article is far superior to this page. I do not take deletion of pages as a casual matter and respect any contributors work but I see no motive to keep this page, I don't see it evolving beyond the current status and if we examine the content carefully it is debatable if it fits [[WB:WIW]], I haven't tagged it for speedy because it is a non profitable organization (I did check it), but that was my personal decission. I wouldn't have opposed some other Wikibookian doing so...     --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:57, 31 October 2008 (UTC)
:::I think so.  [[Wikibooks:Deletion_policy#What_to_keep.2C_what_to_delete]] - &lt;i&gt;&quot;In general, keep stubs.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 23:33, 2 November 2008 (UTC)
::::Practice shows otherwise (That was my point I know what policy says). I also defend and have protected stubs in the past but in this case this is not really a stub, the text can be argued to be in a complete stage, since it is not a framework nor is it clearly missing any content that the creator intended to add later, this is further helped by it not having a defined scope and only one contributor that stopped editing in 2006. Could it evolve further? Of course it could, but is the existing content relevant and irreplaceable? Clearly not. I already mentioned that the Wikipedia article is far superior. But if you feel so strongly that keeping it will serve any purpose, that is worth the existing discussion please point it out to me and I will change my vote, as I said the content is non commercial and not offensive, I was just being consistent. If not please do consider changing yours.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:02, 3 November 2008 (UTC)
::::: I wholeheartedly disagree with this &quot;let's follow convention rather than policy&quot; attitude. If people want to change the way we do things, change the policy. What are people who come to Wikibooks supposed to think? Do we not point newcomers to the policy pages, [[WB:WIW]] in particular, for them to see whether their project would fit within the scope of Wikibooks?
::::: As for a reason for why to keep this book, you need not look any further than the reasons for why it is a policy. It provides the possibility of reducing the work and providing an alternative view of how to present the material to future editors. Seeing how many projects lie dormant between spurts of activity, keeping stubs is the first step for these in climbing the ladder to a fully-fledged book. The wiki, after all, is a collaborative platform allowing contributors to be not only spatially, but also temporally separated. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:39, 3 November 2008 (UTC) 
:::::: Sir, you are certainly joking. Did you see who wrote the post ?!? I know that I'm older than you here , but not that old that you don't recognize me as stickler for policy (and guidelines), against inconsistency and very much against personal interpretation over clear definition. Your words do me much harm...
:::::: Lol :). Jeez did you only read the first paragraph?
:::::: I was just pointing that what is on policy/guidelines isn't what is always done as a reply to AdRiley premise &quot;...last time I looked we don't delete stubs...&quot; that is demonstrably incorrect. To what he pointed out the policy. I doubt that he has only been looking to the policy over all this time, not noticing previous VFDs.
:::::: As for the second part. I again state that the Wikipedia article [[w:Royal Canadian Air Cadets|Royal Canadian Air Cadets]] has better (some is shared) and more content. We can always use that content in the future without problem, nothing will be really lost. 2 years of stalled incubation of a project clearly indicates that the project development should be considered concluded or of no further  interest, not only to the editors of the project but to any Wikibookian in the present day. In this regard the keep decission is only useful considering any future development of the project but the content present isn't worth even this debate.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 11:33, 3 November 2008 (UTC) 
:::::::You are of course right: it is what we do which forms policy not the exact wording of the policy page (as can be seen in the naming convention grandfathering discussion).  The vdf which always sticks in my mind for the &quot;we don't delete stubs&quot; argument is this one: [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion/Delphi Programming]] a stub which at the time I nominated it for deletion I firmly believed should be deleted.  Looking at what the book has become now, then I think perhaps a keep was correct.  It looks like it has structure and direction, 2 things which were missing when I nominated it.  This book also lacks structure and direction, but a structure could be added quite quickly I think (I was tempted to add one myself but did not want to overcomplicate this discussion by having a changing version which we were voting on).  
:::::::The main reason for my keep vote was that until your comment &lt;i&gt;&quot;Are you sure that you are remembering it correctly...&quot;&lt;/i&gt; we didn't really have any kind of full argument as to why we were deleting this stub.  And if we are to start deleting stubs and effectively creating policy (which at some stage I hope will be written down) then we need to be able to justify why we are deleting this particular stub and not all of them.--[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 13:53, 3 November 2008 (UTC)
::::::::In this respect I'm with Swift. I don't agree with the notion that actions shape already existing policies if conflicting, that is we can't in any way  disregard parts of a policy text on any implementation of it. When I say policies this time is only policies, not guidelines. I give distinction between the two, if interested see the talk on the subject on the last policy vote. There are also a predating discussion of this subject on my talk history between myself and WitheKnight were he strongly refutes this interpretation. I don't know if he has changes his mind on the subject and there is no clear definition (in policy or guideline) but historically the distinction is evident and I think I proved it in both instances.
::::::::Action can and should serve to establish future policies, if not in conflicting with any already existing ones, or serve as a base for further refinement. I think that is what you imply above, if so, I agree with it, and this is very important even if not to generate more policies, previous actions should serve validate future actions and provide consistency if clearly not objected. This was why for example I strongly disagreed also to the interpretation used at times (and even presently in the last policy draft, were I removed that bit) that administrator are in any respect above the normal Wikibookian or should be granted a special high ground when discussing policy, guidelines and on the shaping of the project in general, this is particularly funny since characteristics keep creeping in texts to exalt them as a special class, even if policy clearly states the opposite. Even if recently we have elevated the bar to provide the flag, and removing old inactive admins but that is another discussion. Again I was just illustrating several instances were actions have been used to shape or define procedures.
::::::::In regard to halting changes to a page during a  VFD discussion, I don't think you should give a VFD such consideration, if the edits will serve to prevent a deletion that is a good thing and I have done it in the past (keeping people on the discussion informed of what I was doing), kinda like we do for drafts of policies and guidelines. The VFD will only affect those that decide to participate in it, people can just ignore the proceedings and continue to go at it, a non productive example is the continuing edits to the [[Traveling around colombia]], that fail to address the issues of the VFD.
::::::::As for the text under discussion and the other example you gave [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Delphi Programming]], it isn't a very good comparison for the point you are making, examine the discussion and the timeline, if we look the nominated version [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Delphi_Programming&amp;oldid=1080949 here] at least I agreed with you and my comments are consistent to my actual position, I did change the vote based not on any argumentation bu on the changes done to the content [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Delphi_Programming&amp;oldid=1229321 here] when I changed opinion it was clearly a stub, and the subject matter of that project had potential, things that are missing on this one.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:12, 3 November 2008 (UTC)
::::::: I assure you that I meant you no harm. Thanks for your clarifications, I misunderstood your position on the matter. Your comment was in reply to a &quot;keep&quot; vote based on the argument that policy dictated the inclusion of stubs. In that comment you say that you &quot;''see no motive to keep this page''&quot;. The policy has no caveat for stalled books. If you want this book deleted because you don't see it going anywhere, then your argument seems to be in violation of policy.
::::::: If you want it deleted because there is no valuable content, then that is another matter and you should direct your arguments that way. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:23, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
:::::::: I was jesting, hope it got across. But that is what I say on my vote, the above dialog, deals only to this thread as a reply and an attempt to refute the keep argumentation given. I will extend &quot;not a book&quot; below, since we seem to agree that interpreting the brochure reference can be confusing, but I infer that you accept my interpretation (laking any direct clarification from the user) as valid to what it intends to mean in the context it was given.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:18, 4 November 2008 (UTC)  
::[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I've been attempting to understand why this came to a VFD, I made some posts to Mike to see if he could extend his rational, but failed to obtain a constructive reply. The Wikibookian that tagged it for speedy did it so by the rules and his point has merit as seen in the votes already made. It clearly fits in propaganda or advertising  as it doesn't raise or address any question/subject, nor does it point alternatives or downsides. Besides the points I already made I don't see any need to obstruct the speedy.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:41, 2 November 2008 (UTC)
::: If there is any doubt of whether to speedy, it goes to discussion. We shouldn't speedy anything other than blatant violations of policy. None has been offered here. Mike's decision was correct.
: [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I don't think this is a useful book nor do I see much likelihood that it will ever be expanded (though I see several ways in which it might be done). At the same time, I fail to see the breach of policy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:39, 3 November 2008 (UTC)
: [[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' How is this being a brochure justify deletion. A brochure can be informative without being propaganda or advertisement. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:39, 3 November 2008 (UTC)
:: A brochure by definition is a high cost pamphlet, used for marketing purposes (due to cost, relates to profit) in a booklet format, mostly in color and high quality paper. On the other hand a pamphlet may or may not be used for advertisement but is almost always recognized as a method for propaganda. Defining the distinction of propaganda from advertising is a bit hard but can be resumed to the focus. Advertising deals with services or material things, propaganda to causes or sociological dogmas, they can be mixed. In any case a brochure by definition is not a book nor it aims to be, that lead it to not being fit for Wikibooks. Hope that answers or at least provides some alternative views to the above post. ::(More could be said but we would be digressing from the discussion) 
:: I don't think that what is on the table is not only the format, and think that the brochure classification was used to make the distinction of what is present on the page, in length and content quality from a &quot;real&quot; book, even to resume the idea that it is not a stub. Being the keywords &quot;...like a brochure&quot;.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 11:05, 3 November 2008 (UTC)
::: We have nothing on brochures in our policy. If people want to equate brochures with propaganda we'll fall into the trap of discussing the validity of these analogies, and the precise meanings of these words. Let's rather stick to the wording in policy. Sorry if I appear to be snubbing your argument, but I don't think semantic debate serves much purpose.
::: I don't see the propaganda in this stub of a book. &quot;Join us, we're fun&quot; is an advertisement. &quot;This is what it's about&quot; is informative but becomes propaganda when it conceals relevant information for the sake of an agenda. I don't see the motives for the latter in this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] :]([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:23, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
:::: Here is the were we diverge, how we define and validate stubs. We don't have a consensual definition on Wikibooks, so your suggestion that &quot;We shouldn't speedy anything other than blatant violations of policy.&quot; can't consistently be applied, but literary a stub is something cut short or arrested in development. As it is I argue that the page is not incomplete. I can't comment on the intentions of the creator but it is self contained and no lose end can be perceived. Would you agree to call it as an article, similar to a Wikipedia article ? Should we duplicate Wikipedia objective on Wikibooks ?  Whatever it is it clearly is not a book nor a project for one, that is all that I stated.
:::: If we skip attributing any label to the page and take the majority opinion expressed on this discussion we can clearly  state that since the page lacks any direction or educational purpose and defines only an entity, giving information about it, it is somewhat an advertisement, since it publicize it, given the local were it exist and a due to a non profit intention the information can be considered propaganda, for what I read on existing content, the entity deals with social formation of youth in a militaristic fashion and structure, without pointing alternatives or downsides (as I said somewhere above), since it doesn't give a personal view it doesn't fit [[WB:SOAP]]. It can clearly be shaped into a stub, that would lead to a book but the scope and structure would have to be changed and but only if Wikibookians have interest on the subject (2 years have passed without such indication). I have done my share of reformats and restructures on similar pages that I have interest in or see as possible for extension, AdRiley gave an example were a similar process occurred.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:18, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' I don't see how this has any real useful information. Plus, everything in this &quot;book&quot; can be found on Wikipedia. --[[User:Nick.anderegg|Nick.anderegg]] ([[User talk:Nick.anderegg|talk]]) 21:06, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==


One major concern for distance learning efforts, especially for K-12 education, involves the loss of the interpersonal connections that are developed by face to face interactions.  Non-Verbal communication can be extremely expressive and for many cultures learning the appropriate cues and mores of non-verbal communication is an important part of developing a well rounded and productive member of society.  The distance learning tool that is often suggested as a substitute for the loss of face to face communication has been live streaming, web conferencing software.  Certainly, this kind of tool brings to distance learning the ability to mimic a face to face classroom or seminar experience, but it also takes away one of the most positive attributes of a great many distance learning frameworks; asynchronicity. 

For students who are located in geographically separated areas or for those students who have scheduling difficulties due to a disability or for some other reason, organizing around a fixed live streamed classroom can be limiting.  More importantly, however, the asynchronous format that allows for an educational focus that rewards student reflection and gives shyer students or students who are slower in forming their thoughts the ability to participate on equal footing with their peers.  One free, web hosted tool that allows distance educators the ability to combine asynchronous learning is the already widely known and used video sharing site, YouTube.


== Video in Education ==

The 2008 Horizon Report lists &quot;grassroots video&quot; as the first of it's &quot;key emerging trends&quot; in educational technology. This is both for distance learning and for traditional face to face classrooms open to incorporating distance learning tools into their practice.  The popularity of YouTube amongst both adults and children at a level that has been described as &quot;viral&quot; speaks to it's ease of use.  A widely cited report on Digital Youth sponsored by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation stated that &quot;Social network sites, online games, video-sharing sites, and gadgets such as iPods and mobile phones are now fixtures of youth culture.&quot;  The familiarity of YouTube also ensures that when used for educational purposes it will not remain unused due to difficulties in set up or negative reactions to the inclusion of a &quot;new&quot; product with a steep learning curve prior to use. 


''Some tasks may be easier with some technologies than with  others, and thus the introduction of a new technology may inspire certain uses.Yet, these activities become widespread only if the culture also supports them, if they fill recurring needs at a particular historical juncture. It matters what tools  are available to a culture, but it matters more what that culture chooses to do with those tools.  (Henry Jenkins)''


For the most part, YouTube has not yet entirely made the jump from &quot;cultural phenomenom for entertainment&quot; to &quot;respected platform for academic discourse&quot; in the way that products such as iTunes and iTunes University have.  (Though there is a site called TeacherTube that acts as a repository for educational videos, it does not have all the functionality of YouTube.)  One of the reasons why the video platform may not have gained the academic credibility that iTunes University has may have to do with the video media versus audio media.  The adoption of iTunes as a platform for academic and educational materials did not challenge the constructionist (and sadly, often traditional educational) norms of teacher as content expert and the student as passive recipient of information.  Lectures and speeches could easily be put into iTunes for students to access at any time and anywhere.  Certainly, more constructivist approaches have also emerged in the audio platform that is accorded by iTunes, but the replicating of &quot;taped&quot; lecture was nothing new even if iTunes allows for a more widely distributed audience. 

Video, however, may not be an area that teachers are familiar with especially in creating video content that utilizes the visual medium in an asynchronous manner.  The need to produce a video over an audio recording suggests that the speaker is doing something more than simply giving a lecture behind a desk.  Face to face teachers need to be at least fluent in understanding the ability of how to convey a message effectively through the visual medium of video.  The benefit of this fluency is that this powerful medium alllows for asynchronous learning that does not sacrifice the ability for both students and teachers to benefit from non-verbal communication. 


== Example in Action: ==
http://www.youtube.com/v/V96_PjlrVQc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1


In the YouTube video linked above a teacher uses music, rap and dance to explain fractions in a way that certainly appeals to students differently than would a video of a demonstration at the chalkboard.  While this video may have been created for viewing in a face to face classroom, for distance learners, the students might be encouraged to ask their questions either textually or to reflect on their learning by creating a video response or creating their own video explaining a different mathematical concept.

== Visual Literacy ==

Bleed in an article about the role of visual literacy in higher education states that &quot;Visual literacy is often considered trivial, transitory, or even nonacademic. Visual literacy is outside any mainstream literacy curriculum, taught only in specialized courses in disciplines such as art and architecture.  How can colleges be relevant when they ignore this major force in society?&quot;  The same can be said of K-12.  Television's popularity has been undisputed now for decades and broadband internet access has increased the amount of visual information that is widely available.  Regardless of the content being taught, in this day and age it would be hapless not to incorporate visual literacy into the curriculum.  For distance learning, using video as the medium lends itself to the perfect way to incorporate video literacy into the educational practice. 


''New Literacy theorists argue that social context  and cultural diversity significantly affect the literacy  process. Often, the failure of urban students  to develop “academic” literacy skills stems not  from a lack of intelligence but from the  inaccessibility  of the school curriculum to students who  are not in the “dominant” or “mainstream”  culture.  These theorists believe that such students  are literate but that their literacies have little  connection with the dominant literacies promoted in  public schools&quot; (Ernest Morrell)''


Students will learn criticism, persuasion, and communication not only through the written medium afforded by the wikis, blogs, text messages, comment boards, and assignment papers sent by email and the postal service, but also through the format of visual expression through video. 


''One important goal of media education should be to  encourage young people to become more reflective about the  ethical choices they make as participants and  communicators and the impact they have on others.  (Henry Jenkins)''

 

== Using YouTube==

Beyond the ability for teachers to convey information out to students in a manner that is asynchronous and utilizing visual medias ability to convey a message through non-verbal cues of the speakers and rich use of visual information, YouTube allows for comments to be posted in response to any video.  These comments can be in either written form or in a video response.  This means that YouTube provides a platform to encourage video &quot;conversations&quot; in which both student and teacher interact.  The student who is better able to express themselves in through the visual medium can gain experience participating in the discourse often available only to those who are more fluent in writing and/or public speaking.  The beauty of YouTube is that multiple mediums are available. 


''We are moving away from a world in which some produce  and many consume media, toward one in which everyone has a  more active stake in the culture that is produced.  (Henry Jenkins)''


The open, public nature of YouTube also allows for students to gain a sense of real life performance.  No longer are assignement only to be seen by the instructor, but they may be shared with othe class participants, peers and the world at large.  This concept of real world applicability may in fact, give students an incentive to feel more or a sense of ownership over the assignments they produce and the responses they contribute to a course discussion. 


== Looking Forward ==

As cell phones become more ubiquitous in their capability to play and record video, YouTube as a plaftform for distance learning may become even more valuable.  Student studying science may find themselves more likely to capture through video an example of weather conditions as they are happening or documents signs of environmental impact of pollution, students studying current politics or journalism may find themselves able to video document local news events as they take place, and students studying languages might have the ability to record themselves engaged in conversations with tourists they encounter who are native speakers of the language.

== Introduction ==

The proliferation of electronic devices is becoming increasingly apparent to anyone who has stepped inside an American school in recent years.  Even in the nation’s inner-cities, many students flaunt their ipods and sidekicks and display a fluency in all things digital.  These digital natives are growing up in an exciting new world, but the ubiquity of new technology and the most recent developments on the World Wide Web—increasing the capacity for more people to publish and participate online—present new social, cultural and educational challenges and implications (Palfrey &amp; Gasser, 2008).  The context in which education was (at least conceived to be) confined within the walls of a classroom has shifted to a more globally connected reality, in which the innovative uses of technology highlight the fact that learning occurs all around us.  Indeed, Web 2.0 has opened doors to distance learning and foreshadowed, for some, a refinement of the learning process altogether.  Yet despite the inherent educational qualities of Web 2.0 applications and software, their adaptation for formal educational practices has had varying results (Bernard et al., 2004).  In light of the shifting identities stemming from the advent of these revolutionary features of Web 2.0, it is imperative that educators are cognizant of both the benefits and consequences of using them to promote learning and ultimately, to promote cross-cultural awareness.  This section provides a brief overview of two features of Web 2.0—blogs and wikis—that may be useful for promoting literacy and language acquisition through K-12 distance learning projects, while considering technical and social benefits and precautions.  Through this brief exposition, it is hoped that the concluding section will provide a starting point for further reflection and consideration of how these technologies are impacting the lives of generations new and old.

== Introduction ==

The proliferation of electronic devices is becoming increasingly apparent to anyone who has stepped inside an American school in recent years.  Even in the nation’s inner-cities, many students flaunt their iPods and sidekicks and display a fluency in all things digital.  These digital natives are growing up in an exciting new world, but the ubiquity of new technology and the most recent developments on the World Wide Web—increasing the capacity for more people to publish and participate online—present new social, cultural and educational challenges and implications (Palfrey &amp; Gasser, 2008).  The context in which education was (at least conceived to be) confined within the walls of a classroom has shifted to a more globally connected reality, in which the innovative uses of technology highlight the fact that learning occurs all around us.  Indeed, Web 2.0 has opened doors to distance learning and foreshadowed, for some, a refinement of the learning process altogether.  Yet despite the inherent educational qualities of Web 2.0 applications and software, their adaptation for formal educational practices has had varying results (Bernard et al., 2004).  In light of the shifting identities stemming from the advent of these revolutionary features of Web 2.0, it is imperative that educators are cognizant of both the benefits and consequences of using them to promote learning and ultimately, to promote cross-cultural awareness.  This section provides a brief overview of two features of Web 2.0—blogs and wikis—that may be useful for promoting literacy and language acquisition through K-12 distance learning projects, while considering technical and social benefits and precautions.  Through this brief exposition, it is hoped that the concluding section will provide a starting point for further reflection and consideration of how these technologies are impacting the lives of generations new and old.

== Defining Web 2.0 and Distance Learning ==

Ten years ago, there was not a single country where the majority of its people accessed the Internet, and very few utilized it in the collaborative and imaginative ways it is currently used (Warschauer, 2003).  Today, there are at least 47 countries with an Internet penetration rate above 50 percent (Miniwatts Marketing Group, 2008), and online publishing and participation is no longer limited to an erudite and select few.  Simple and easily accessible software has spawned the development of wikis, blogs, podcasts and social networking sites.  The amalgamation of these new features—some which had existed before, albeit less accessibly—has been coined the second generation of the World Wide Web, or more simply, Web 2.0.  The most conspicuous qualities are its capacities for fostering widespread publication and participation  (Warschauer &amp; Grimes, 2007; Freedman, 2006).  

The expanded capacities of Web 2.0 are inherently conducive to distance learning, the definition of which is often contested and hardly explicit.  However, the following section will work under the assumption that distance learning encompasses the ways in which new telecommunications technologies, particularly those afforded by computer-based software, allow learners and educators to communicate, interact and construct knowledge together in a way that was not once possible due to geographic limitations (Taylor, 1991).  

== Selected Features of Web 2.0 for Distance Learning ==

Inventions such as social networking and video-sharing sites are characteristic of the new Web 2.0 era in which innovation is merged with practicality.  Web 2.0 software and applications afford revolutionary mediums of communication and interaction through their various features.  The discussion below aims to highlight two features of Web 2.0—blogs and wikis—that are particularly conducive to distance learning and the teaching of literacy and language.  The discourse is not comprehensive and does not offer a how-to, but rather serves as a catalyst for thoughtful contemplation for educators and technology coordinators before embarking upon the exciting educational experiences that Web 2.0 has to offer.    

''Blogs''

A popular form of one-to-many communication (Freedman, 2006), a blog (derived from the word Weblog), in its most basic form, is essentially an online journal with the most recent post listed first.  This medium has quickly grown in use throughout the world, with over 112.8 million blogs being tracked today (http://technorati.com), and it now takes shape in various forms including newspaper columns or pamphlets, especially with regard to political topics (Baron, 2008; Warschauer &amp; Grimes, 2007).  Participation in blogs can take place in several ways, depending on the popularity and structure of the blog.  Sophisticated blogs can have several editors, regular writers and contributors who begin a thought process to generate threads, comments and responses from other users
(Warschauer &amp; Grimes, 2007).

The potential for blogs to aid distance learning is far greater than one-to-one communication mediums such as emailing or instant messaging due to its inherent capacity to reach wider audiences and foster collaboration.  Whether the blog is utilized for knowledge collaboration across classrooms in different countries or for students to supplement class work and delve further into topics at home, this medium provides a phenomenal way for students to endeavor and experience publishing their own work.  

Successful blogs, regardless of the size of audience, “tend to have a strong authorial voice” (Warschauer &amp; Grimes 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;8).  As such, this medium affords a great way for educators to teach writing styles.  There are myriad possibilities.  Students, for example, could find pen pals in other parts of the world and engage in cross-cultural exchange through letter writing.  Teachers could help guide the process by proposing themes or topics.  Students could also develop writing skills and voice by completing writing assignments at home.  This last point has some positive implications for struggling students in particular.  It is increasingly apparent that formal schooling is not the exclusive factor affecting students' academic development; what happens at home is equally as important as what happens at school.  Using blogs for at-home writing assignments, especially over the summer or other holidays when students are not in school, can help bridge this achievement gap.  Moreover, in allowing for authorship and empowering students to contribute to a global information network, blogs enhance student participation and motivation (November, 2006). 

Another potentially exciting area for blog use is in second language (L2) writing or foreign language study.  Immersion is often cited as the best way for one to learn another language.  Although this may be the case, recent technology and features like blogging allow for students without the time or resources to travel, to do the next best thing.  

The benefits of blogs for educational and distance learning purposes are many, although they require educators and technology coordinators to be cognizant of equally numerous threats and dangers—both traditional and new.  The ease and convenience for publication is both an appeal of the technology as well as a source for caution.  The danger for plagiarism is nothing new, but this medium requires educators to understand the new ways in which information is readily available to students and how entire genres of writing are being transformed.  Indeed, in many ways, blogs and other Web 2.0 features are reconstructing what constitutes legitimate knowledge.  Publication no longer necessarily entails laborious vetting processes.  Thus, the ease of authorship for the masses creates new challenges to ensure that students are cognizant of what authorship means.  With the freedom of expression and publication also comes the possibility of exposure to many different and conflicting points of view and, at times, inappropriate posts and abuses. Karchmer (2001) studied the best practices of pioneering educators who have been successfully adapting technology in the classroom to promote literacy and found that these teachers spent significant time finding reading level- and age-appropriate text.  Textual aids and interactive features were important for capturing students’ interest.  And teaching responsibility and reminding students of the world lens for which they are publishing is essential (November, 2006).   Educators and technology coordinators should create rubrics in a concerted effort to provide students with guidelines and evaluation criteria for choosing sources of information (Karchmer, 2001).  It is also extremely easy to get lost in the immense network of the World Wide Web.  As students learn to develop a voice in their writing, they should always be reminded of both the target and potential audience that is accessible through this technology.   
  

''Wikis''

Wikis are also great resources for students and educators to use for learning through time and space.  They are similar to blogs in that they are websites that allow for collaboration, but wikis allow for expeditious editing of the site as well, intertwining the role of author and reader/editor (Terrill, 2006).  Although there are not as many wikis in cyberspace as there are blogs, their presence is inescapable, and most students in the US undoubtedly already access the highly popular open-source, public encyclopedia: Wikipedia (Warschauer &amp; Grimes, 2007).  Many students use this site for quick reference, and they would be astonished to learn that since it was created in 2001, 5.77 million users have made over 250 million edits to Wikipedia (Wilkinson &amp; Huberman, 2007). 

Wikipedia is quickly shaping the manner in which digital natives retrieve, understand and use information and can serve as a great educational tool.  Because Wikipedia is translated and/or created in several languages, it can be a useful resource for foreign language teachers.  Students and teachers can reference various topics and themes and compare them in disparate languages, thus allowing for an integrated topical as well as language study. Although there have been studies equating and validating the accuracy of Wikipedia with more reputable encyclopedias (Warschauer &amp; Grimes, 2007), Wikipedia has yet to be acknowledged as a credible academic source.  It provides a great starting point and reference for discovery and learning, but educators must be extremely cautious about working with students to develop an understanding about authorship and credibility.  

Much of the research and analysis regarding wikis has focused on the legitimacy of information presented in wikis (Warschauer &amp; Grimes, 2007), implying the importance of understanding authorship and credibility.  But educators and learners can also utilize wikis to construct their own knowledge collaboratively. Wikis are extremely easy to use and some are designed specifically for educational purposes; its design lends itself to collaborative group work, requiring the inputting and editing of information by a team of students and teachers.  On sites like PB Wiki, users enjoy a number of other convenient and beneficial attributes.  Wikis allow for safe storage of work and a referencing back to past course work.  They also allow students and teachers to share digital files, including video and audio features for learning enhancement.  Both teachers and students can post homework assignments, helping to alleviate the potential for miscommunication or irresponsibility.  By moving to a virtual medium, parents can also be more involved in the dialogue and their children’s learning.  Furthermore, teachers also have important control options.  Changes to the wiki are visible and access controls can be set to ensure privacy (http://pbwiki.com/).  All of these can facilitate everything from cross-cultural exchange to an at-home expansion of classroom activities, engaging students in learning in unconventional spaces.  What makes this even more appealing to educators is that wiki software is often equipped with tracking devices to record individual contributions, allowing for seamless individual assessments (Warschauer &amp; Grimes, 2007).  

The possibilities for using such applications for distance learning and literacy and language education are unlimited, and the highly collaborative nature provides an ideal space for cross-cultural exchange.  For example, classes from different countries could work together on editing pages on particular themes.  Unlike blogs, which are also good for teaching writing, the space would allow literacy instruction to take place in a more interactive format.  Instead of the write and response format of the prior, wikis allow for educators to make marks right on the students’ work.  Furthermore, through tracking of changes, students, parents and educators can mark the progress of a writing assignment, effectively displaying the many steps involved in the crafting of an essay.  Using the technology for language instruction would also benefit from this style of interaction.  

The potential educational benefits of utilizing wikis for out of the classroom instruction are obvious, but educators should be also be aware of precautionary considerations in implementing any new technology.  Unlike blogs, wikis allow for a displacement of individual voice with collaboration on a given topic.   This warrants many discussions on authorship and knowledge construction.   Open wikis can also be susceptible to the risk of spamming and hacking from unwanted participants (Freedman, 2006).  Therefore, technology coordinators should be aware of privacy settings.  It is also advised that educators become familiar with the particular software or websites before implementing them into lesson plans.  The collaborative nature of wikis can make both the orchestration and product of the work extremely disorganized.  An instructor’s consistent involvement and knowledge of the technology is imperative.  Fortunately, most sites are designed to be extremely user-friendly.  

Cooperation with other classrooms and cultures is highly encouraged but should also be conducted with care.  Although such exchanges can provide extremely rich learning experiences, they have much potential for creating frustration as well.  For example, a study by Pfeil et al. (2006) found that editing styles and norms differed greatly across various languages and cultures.  This is also true with how argument and writing is constructed.  Understanding this and teaching students a particular form while preaching cultural sensitivity to various styles of writing, argument construction and editing, can be a challenge.  But doing so is essential and will ensure fulfilling experiences for all those involved.  

Finally, the use of information sources such as Wikipedia can also facilitate a move towards a convergence of information.  For example, if classes in China are translating work written in English, it could become an inadvertent move towards a globalization of information.  On the other hand, wikis and other Web 2.0 features have the potential for learners and educators to specialize their fields of study in ways that were never possible before.  The juggling act between these polar extremes is something that educators and technology coordinators will have to refine.

== For Further Consideration ==

The educational capacity of Web 2.0 is apparent with merely a quick glance at these two applications.  Additionally, Web 2.0 offers many more exciting possibilities, but in this digital age where a whole generation has been labeled digital natives (Palfrey &amp; Gasser, 2008), it is imperative to keep up with shifting technological and social changes to ensure that Web 2.0 is utilized for effective educational purposes.  Baron (2008) discusses some of the social consequences that we are already witnessing.  The over-stimulation caused by the ubiquity of computers and cellular phones means that Americans are always connected.  This has tremendous social implications as people learn to multi-task and make sense of the monumental access to information and communication.  As barriers shift, privacy and safety issues become apparent as well.  The bombardment of not only information but also the proliferation of advertisements and increase of cyberbullying highlights the important role that parents, teachers and technology coordinators play in promoting general Internet safety.  A concerted effort should involve all three constituents in dialogue and produce a formal written agreement (Karchmer, 2001).

Equally important is the need for parents, teachers and technology coordinators to understand the context in which digital natives are maturing.  From the use of emoticons to the general condensing of language, it is evident that these technologies are shifting language practices.  Baron (2008) goes so far as to reflect that the increase in online writing has contributed to the gradual deterioration of language in general.  This is compounded by the fact that text is increasingly supplemented with audio and visual elements.   Web 2.0 technologies are indeed affecting both language use as well as social relationships (Palfrey &amp; Gasser, 2008).  But rather than viewing the emergence of Web 2.0 as the deterioration of communicative practices, it is helpful to understand all of this in the context of the nature of language.  Evolving literacies highlight the inherently shifting nature of languages and remind us that languages are indeed human constructs.   In this environment that is so conducive to information overload, it is imperative to have conversations with students about discretion, responsibility and critical thinking.  

In addition to such dialogue, it is imperative to supply educators with the resources and expertise for effective implementation.  Cuban (1986) found that in addition to their own educational experiences, teacher practices are heavily influenced by classroom environment expectations.  This makes the task of technology coordinators a vital one, as they must work with teachers in breaking traditional molds and provide adequate training.

== Conclusion ==

Technology affords greater conveniences but the experiences are still fundamentally human.  Whether students are learning from each other via technology or reading a traditionally bound, physical book, it is important to recognize that distance learning occurs through myriad mediums, and mediums evolve with time.  Being aware of these issues and reflecting on how technology can enhance curricula, and in some cases, reinvent it, so that these mediums can be utilized positively is our responsibility.  Such discourse will lend itself to promoting citizenship in the global information age.  To this end, educators should encourage more openness.  Students should not only develop their digital literacies but also understand them in the context of our ever-interconnected world.  They should be encouraged to read and contribute to blogs and wikis from around the world.  They should be encouraged to reach out cross-culturally.  And they should be cognizant of their privilege and responsibility as those on the advantaged side of the digital divide.  Teaching context and fostering in students the need to be globally minded as we experience a further information convergence is imperative for promoting practical and ethical uses of Web 3.0.

----

When printing, this template starts a new page where it appears. The rest of the current page remains empty. The template uses {{tl|Page-break}} and {{tl|Page-break/end}}, which are not fully supported by most browsers; however, the particular usage in the template {{tl|Newpage}} is supported by several popular browsers.

This template is particularly useful to start modules on new pages in print versions of multi-module wikibooks. In order to avoid completely blank pages, there should be no empty lines (nor any other form of white space) right ''before'' {{tl|Newpage}}. 

There is an optional parameter &lt;tt&gt;noprint&lt;/tt&gt;. If specified, the value of this parameter is printed with the noprint class; thus, it should appear in the HTML version of the print version but not in the final print out. This is useful to indicate page breaks and add vertical space in the HTML version without adding any extra white space in the final print out. For example, the following code includes a horizontal line with vertical space in the HTML version where a new page is started in the final print out:
&lt;pre&gt;{{Newpage|noprint=&amp;amp;nbsp;

=== some comments ===
*The book title might look bad on screen, but it should print fine. I don't worry about this, because the print version of the final wikibook will need a new front cover anyways.
*I've included {{tl|Newpage}} templates before each lesson. This appears to be the only platform-independent way of guaranteeing that lesson headings are not alone at the end of a page for any paper format. Starting each lesson on a new page also allows for printing of individual lessons without any text from other lessons. This is particularly important if you want to reorder the lessons or remove certain lessons (either from a stack of paper or from a PDF file).
*By the way, {{tl|Newpage}} doesn't work with the PDF version link on the left nor with the printing of collections, but since this whole book doesn't print well with this kind of PDF generation, I don't worry too much.
*The {{tl|Newpage}} is placed at the end of the prior page to make sure that there are no completely blank pages. I'm not sure whether there is now any guarantee but it seems to be quite unlikely.
*I'm generating PDFs with Firefox and the MacOS X PDF printing. The page numbers are inserted manually in the table of contents for generating the final PDF and then removed again.

=== title ===
I realized that “SpanishPod” probably shouldn't be used in the title since the cc-by license requires this attribution: “You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse you or your use of the work).” Thus, I guess it's better to remove it from the title. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 23:16, 7 December 2008 (UTC)

=== adjustment of page breaks with {{tl|SbcOptionalNewline}} ===
I added {{tl|SbcOptionalNewline}} for nicer page breaks (see the documentation of {{tl|SbcOptionalNewline}} for a description of the workflow). It turned out to be quite tricky where to place this template in the lessons and how many of them are necessary at particular places. The rule of thumb is: add it at the beginning of the first line of the paragraph that should go onto the next page. If that is not enough, add further templates at the same position (in particular the image credit section always seems to need two of them). I should emphasize that the current use of the templates is only good for the special PDF generation I'm currently using (PDF printing of FireFox on MacOS X on letter format with a centered footer for the page number). I'd suggest to use the template {{tl|SbcOptionalNewline}} only for adjusting the PDF generation of the uploaded PDF. For PDF versions on other formats, create a new template with the same functionality but a different name. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 13:12, 10 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Lessons ==

Each level has a given set of grammar points and vocabulary chosen for it.  In rare exceptions an advanced grammar point may be introduced at the lower levels where unavoidable or appropriate.  Each lesson will cover a small set of grammar points and vocabulary (including expressions and kanji). The prerequisites for each lesson are clearly stated with links to material that covers it. Review sections have links to the lessons they cover.

We suggest you follow these rough guide when progressing through the lessons:
# Make sure you fulfill the requirements.
# Complete the lesson and read through it again if something was unclear. Contact us on the talk page if you still have problems.
# Complete any excercises or recommended material which the page links to, such as that at the Wikiversity [[v:Japanese|Japanese]] portal.
# Add the new vocabulary, kanji or grammar rules to any memorization application you may use and drill yourself on these.

For more suggestions on language study specific to Japanese, please refer to [[Japanese/Study methods]].

== Reading ==

To understand and become acquainted with a language, you'll need to read any and all material.  The material in this lesson shall be low enough such that you'll understand the material without having to constantly revert to a dictionary, an assisted reading tool (e.g., Rikaichan), or relying on the reading lesson.  Most of the reading material will be children stories for new learners to masterpieces for advanced students.  If you have problems with the grammar, try reviewing the grammar categories linked within the reading lesson.  If you have problems with the vocabulary, review the vocabulary section or use Rikaichan (Firefox only) to read the vocabulary.

== Contributing ==

This book is an open-project.  Anyone may contribute to this book as they see fit, whether the contributions are for new lessons or adding to lessons.  Here are a few guidelines for contributors.

* '''Grammar''': Introduce only a few grammar points per lesson.  If you need to do so, split the grammar points to several lessons.  
* '''Vocabulary''': Try to keep the introduced vocabulary to under 10 words.
* '''Topics''': Pick topics based on your day-to-day activities (e.g., buying stamps at the post office), a recent event (either in your life, the world, or anywhere else), or a stereotypical event.
* '''Reading''': Natural text is great for language learning.  Please only submit public-domain material.  Be mindful of the material (i.e., grammar, kanji and vocabulary) and your target audience.  

This is the recommended layout:

'''Lessons'''
# Dialogue (by posters, conversations, or whatever.)
# Discussion of Vocabulary in Dialogue
#* Discuss various uses of vocabulary if necessary (e.g., politeness)
#* Optional links to dialogues for previously learned vocabulary
# Grammar
#* Discuss grammar points, giving more examples if necessary.
#* Link to previous grammar points (maybe by categories)
# Optional Quick Review
# Optional link to Wikiversity for practice work.

'''Reading Material'''
# Reading material (can be a sign, menu, a story, or anything with text)
# Translated reading material
#* If you're going to use literal translations, try to explain this and the approximated English translation.
# Vocabulary
#* Note peculiar vocabulary (obsolete kanji, readings, and etc.)
#* May link to wiktionary
#* Use templates.
# Link to appropriate lessons with the grammar using the category.
#* If the grammar point category does not exist, make a new one.
#* Do not worry if no lessons exist for the grammar point.  You could make a lesson, or wait for someone else to do so.

I am Doug on all Wikimedia projects, [[tswiki:User:Doug|toolserver-wiki]], [[wikilivres:User:Doug|Wikilivres]], and [[botwiki:User:Doug|Botwiki]].

In addition to my activities on this project, I am a grapheocrates (bureaucrat) and măgistrātus (administrator) on the [[s:la:|latin wikisource]], an administrator on the [[s:en:|english wikisource]] and the [[w:|english wikipedia]], a transwiki importer on the [[s:|multilingual wikisource]], an editor and transwiki importer on [[mw:|mediawiki.org]], and a file mover on [[:commons:|commons]].  I am also active on the [[m:|MetaWiki]].  Outside of WMF project, I am an administrator on [[wikilivres:|wikilivres]] (a non-WMF wikisource auxiliary project) and a developer and bureaucrat on [[botwiki:|botwiki]], as well as a system administrator for a private/test installation of the mediawiki software.

==Bots==
I run two bots:
*[[s:en:User:DougBot|DougBot]], which runs on all of the above projects except the english wikipedia, and 
*[[s:de:Benutzer:InterwikiBot|InterwikiBot]], which performs interlanguage linking on all wikisources, though it has been largely supplanted by [[s:it:User:Candalua|Candalua]]'s more general purpose bot with a customized interwiki script, [[s:User:CandalBot|CandalBot]].  Both of my bots run on the [[mw:Manual:Pywikipediabot|Pywikipediabot]] framework, the [[mw:Manual:Pywikipediabot|official documentation for which]] I help maintain.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/New Book Page}}

== General Cleanup ==

Some books just need general cleanup. You can't even pinpoint it and say &quot;The content needs to be improved&quot; or &quot;The formatting needs to be fixed&quot;. Instead, what's needed is a good editor to go over the page line by line and fix all sorts of different things. Books needing general cleanup are typically in the '''Stub''' or '''Expand''' development stages.

{{Info|Notice that books needing general cleanup may also need all sorts of other improvements to [[../Style|Style]], [[../Content|Content]], and [[../Formatting|Formatting]], among other things.}}

== Reasons for Cleanup ==

There are a lot of reasons why a page might need general cleanup.

=== Content Dumps ===

Sometimes authors just dump content onto a page rapidly, and don't worry about making everything perfect. Once the book is large and has content, all the details can be gone over and made better.

=== Page Imports ===

Pages imported from Wikipedia or other projects will use different styles of formatting, different styles of writing, different templates, different categories, etc. These all need to be removed from the page.

=== Automatic Translations ===

Automatic translations from different languages, or translations from other formatting styles (HTML, LaTeX, DocBook, XML, etc) can leave unwanted artifacts in the generated Wikitext. These need to be cleaned by hand.

== Cleaning a Book ==

Here are things you can do to cleanup a book:

# Address any cleanup templates that have been put on the book. Either discuss the issues on the talk page, or read, review, and edit pages to fix the problems.
# Remove cleanup templates when they are no longer applicable.
# Add the book to any necessary categories with {{tlx|Subject}}, and make sure it shows up in the necessary subject pages.
# Fix poor spelling and grammar
# Integrate images into the body of text by styling it with &quot;thumb&quot; or &quot;frame&quot; and other modifiers and referencing the image from the text of the page</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat_Recipes|Meat recipes]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Cuisine of the United Kingdom]]

This recipe comes from [[w:Mrs Beeton|Mrs Beeton]]'s famous [[w:Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management|Book of Household Management]].

==Ingredients==
* 900g/2lb rump steak
* 2 kidneys
* salt and black pepper
* suet-crust made with milk, in the proportion of 175g/6oz of suet to each 450g/1lb of flour

==Method==
# Procure some tender rump-steak, and divide it into pieces about 2.5cm/1in square, and cut each kidney into 8 pieces. 
# Line the basin with crust made with suet and flour in the above proportion, leaving a small piece of crust to overlap the edge.
# Then cover the bottom with a piece of the steak and a few pieces of kidney; season with salt and pepper, and then add another layer of steak, kidney and seasoning. Proceed in this manner until the basin is full, when pour in sufficient water to come within 5cm/2in of the top of the basin. 
# Moisten the edges of the crust, cover the pudding over, press the two crusts together, so that the gravy does not escape, and turn up the overhanging pastry.
# Wring out a cloth in hot water, flour it and tie up the pudding; put it int boiling water and let it boil for at least 4 hours. If the water diminishes, always replenish with hot water from a jug, as the pudding should be kept covered all the time, and not allowed to stop boiling.
# When the cloth is removed, cut out a round piece in the top of the crust, to prevent the puddign bursting, and send it to table in the basin, either in an ornamental dish or with a napkin pinned round it. Serve quickly.</text>

== GFDL 1.3 is here ==

It allows a transition to CC-BY-SA 3.0, but with a catch:

Any content submitted to Wikibooks after November 1st '''must''' either have no coypright or be licenced under the GFDL, and '''any content copied from GFDL sources, must be now from a Wiki or similar collabrative site''', or we legally cannot transition.

Its weird, but still, I WANT MY CC-BY-SA please. [[User:ViperSnake151|ViperSnake151]] ([[User talk:ViperSnake151|talk]]) 16:06, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
:This is being discussed heavily on [[mail:foundation-l|foundation-l]], and there will be a referendum to determine what we're going to do. That will probably not happen for some time, but it is nevertheless an exciting possibility. I'll try to make sure that Wikibooks is kept informed as this process chugs along. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:29, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

:[http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/fdl.html http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/fdl.html] a FAQ on the changes is available ([http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3-faq.html http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3-faq.html]), that limitation ViperSnake151 mentions (with some errors) is in section 11 of the license, and creates a real conundrum, since works aren't static it may require rollbacks to make a license change on Wikipedia this is a possibility here it would have to be done project by project in this case works that are thinking on the possibility of changing the license should seriously consider not to use any GFDL content (even transwikis from Wikipedia) or new edits in scale (with copyrights) until the options are made. I particularly dislike the use of that restriction since it doesn't serve the users nor authors but only the license itself.
:Another interesting aspect is that here at Wikibooks we can make the changes now, project by project since the license we use states [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Copyrights &quot;Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation&quot;] changes automatically take effect upon this release people are now free to move content outside of the project under the new license, but until the Wikibooks project removes or restates the existing GFDL note in each page/contribution new edits will have to be rolled back if the CC will be used on site, an avenue to solve this conundrum is to make use of the authors page and clearly state on each book (as we have already done in dual licensed books) so to preserve any recenter contributions.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:08, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
:Here is the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/legalcode Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 United States] if anyone has the curiosity to take a look. It is more detailed than the GFDL and has support for more mediums, while the GFDL attempts to simplify the legal code to be usable for all the Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 provides two faces a simpler one (but for me more open to misinterpretation) and another with lengthy and hard to read legal code. I still prefer the GFDL even if I dislike the move of the FSF on the limitations imposed in section 11.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:43, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
== IE6 Browser Fails for Collapsible Tables ==

Hi, I notice that the collapsible table example on [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables|Tables]] does not do the usual thing when viewed in IE6.

Opera normally opens it such that it is in the closed state; i.e. the collapsed state.   In IE6 it is always open and the link does not work.

Any ideas?

:IE6 is like a JavaScript travesty, and it's no surprise to me that it doesn't support the collapsible javascript functions. In general I like the idea of supporting a broad array of browsers with all our tools and scripts, but some older browsers like IE6 are so standards-non-compliant that it doesn't make sense for us to pander to them with all our stuff.
:If we can fix the script (and I will definitely look into it) to work on IE6, we should try. If it's going to be a big pain in the butt I say we don't even worry about it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:07, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

Hi Whiteknight,

Be glad if the IE6 thing could be fixed.
It is a bit more than usually difficult with IE6 since ''it represents an ownership threshold''; the next browser up from that version, IE7, needs later Windows versions to install it, and I suspect many people around the globe still are using their older Windows versions.  Thanks for any effort brought to bear.

On a more proactive note; those with such routine rendering problems on legacy platforms can solve them by downloading a version of either the free '''Opera''' browser, or the free '''Firefox''' browser without having to make a Windows upgrade for that reason alone.   These two are also well up to date with CSS rendering standards.

== Spurious rendering ==

Hi, from time to time I have found very minor errors cropping up on the [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables|Tables]] page.   They confuse me.   They consist of semi-colon insertions into &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, and as a result they are shown as text on the page.   They seem always to be associated with tags.  So far I have corrected a few of these but have not found any history entry to account for it.

Can anybody please shed light on this matter?

== US History Editor ==

How Do I engage a Rogue Editor whom doesn't register and won't discuss why he's changing a book?

As you all might now I am in the midst of a big rewrite of the book &quot;US History.&quot; Our reason for writing was to come much closer to college board requirements about what an AP history text would cover.  Thus organization and a succinct narrative with no irrelevant tangants is important to us.  I have had a 205 IP address repeatedably alter material, often including tangents and altering carefully thought out organization. 

Now I am not possessive of this book.  I welcome and REALLY want collaboration.  But a book should be true to its purpose, should it not?? and that books' purpose is to succinctly cover college board material.  I'm honestly not sure whether the user is a troll.  I've assumed he isn't and haven't undone any changes and altered as little as possible.  However today, he inserted the 'marco polo game' on the page about early explorers (if you check the logs you can see it).  I'm pretty dense but doesn't that seem like a joke?

It would be nice if the 205 user who's been recently editing this book, reads this notice.  if you are, PLEASE talk with me!  It is courteous and normal to discuss any upcoming changes in a discussion page.  I have done so with this project.  you can also click on my name and leave me a note on my talk page. 

Should I fail to get timely notice from this edior, WB community.  What should I do?
I've inserted a note to the editor on the page he's been altering.

== Any Useful Table Classes? ==

Hi, Does anybody know of any useful table classes, or at least classes that might be useful for quick tables?   So far the ones that I have tried are not too great.  They either have too many restrictions to overcome or simply have the important stuff missing.

I have at present:
*Wikitable class
*mw-metadata class
*gallery class
*toccolours class

Also, would some kind admin consider adding a table class in the form of Wikitable, only with increased cell padding and a heading background similar to the cells?   Why is it that this has not been implemented in the past, or is there one out there somewhere?

Any other classes that readers know?  Thanks to all, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 17:10, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

Question 1:   Where does the table class, (the default table), get its heading styles from?

Question 2:   If the padding were not specified in the proposed class at all, (and it is not specified in the basic table class), would that permit the use of the table attribute ''cellpadding'', for a user to add all round padding to suit themselves?   If so, would this be better?

== [[Wikibooks:Bots]] ==

[[Wikibooks:Bots]] is now a policy. It was a pretty non-controversial proposal that mostly documented the things that we already do here now, so nothing changes because of this. This proposal purposefully errs on the side of being &quot;too little&quot;, and we as a community can update it piecemeal as issues become apparent. There was a branch proposed and opened for voting, although it was more controversial and was raising some concerns. We can certainly continue discussion on the branch, and use points from it to update the new Bots policy as needed. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:03, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

I'm happily using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{print version notice}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for printable chapters of the wikibook [[:Spanish by Choice]] (since other books are doing the same thing). But now I'm realizing that I'm flooding the [[:Category:Books with print version]] with these chapters. Is this a problem? And if so, shouldn't either the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{print version notice}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; be renamed to something like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{print version of book notice}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or the mentioned category be renamed to Books and chapters with print versions? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 18:49, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

== User Stylesheets ==

Hi,

I have read that it is possible to make a user stylesheet to experiment with writing CSS styles.   Unfortunately, my efforts so far have not met with success.   Is there a foolproof description of how to do this, or is there some permission required?

My intention is just to add a couple of classes to the user sheet to see the effect of changes. Can anybody advise me on how to do this?

Thanks, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 15:54, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

: Well first you need to know what page to edit, this depends on what you've set your skin preferences to. For instance you might need to edit [[Special:MyPage/monobook.css]] or [[Special:MyPage/myskin.css]]. The first if you haven't changed it from the default skin, and the later if you've changed your skin preferences to use MySkin. After you know which page to edit, your set to add your CSS styles to that page to see the effect, unless you don't know [[CSS]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:15, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

::I copied the proposed &quot;plaintable&quot; class from the drop-box in the above section into my monobook.css and saved it, cleared the cache, and made a table in the sandbox, using the &quot;plaintable&quot; class, but the result was not expected.   The borders of both the headings and the data cells were missing, and all cell padding.

::Any ideas? [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 17:06, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

:::What do you see? I see a border around the table, but not the caption, and no border separating each cell. CSS for tables is a bit different than what you would probably expect. Like if you used:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
table.plaintable {
  border:5px solid #aaaaaa;
  border-spacing:5px;
  background:blue;
}
y. 
table.plaintable th,
table.plaintable td {
  background:red;
  padding:5px;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
:::You will end up with a gray border around the whole table. a blue border that separates each cell, and the cells themselves would be red.

::It may take some time. Wikibooks pages are aggressively cached at the server-end, and may be cached in your browser as well.

== Trouble with IE6 Browser ==

My IE6 browser is suddenly hanging-up when I try to open a WikiBooks page - it is OK for Wikipedia!
Other pages from WikiBooks of similar size opened normally that same day.   My Opera and Firefox browsers open the pages normally, even with a cleared cache.   Is there a problem for IE-related access? 

Happened 25 October 2008 at about 2200 GMT and again at 0830 GMT the next morning.

Any ideas?

Regards, Armchair, 0854 hrs , 26 October 2008.

Hi, more on the IE problem;  OPERA and FIREFOX have no problem getting the site whereas IE keeps latching up.   I checked at the library's IE6 installation and the sites load OK  --- mind you, I am on a dial-up and the library is broadband.   Also, I  reinstalled my IE and cleared the cache and cleaned the registry.   When the [[Editing_Wikitext]] site is accessed, it gets the banner at the top then the whole IE latches up and is unuseable.   I have to use a Ctrl-alt-del to close the browser down.   Any ideas?

== White margin on float images ==

Hi again,
&lt;poem&gt;I am getting a white margin to the right of left-floated images, and the converse for images on the right.
Does any kind person know how to get rid of it.   For an example of it see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_Wikitext/Pictures/The_Quick_Course The Quick Course].
I would normally use a frameless image in a table in an attempt to avoid it, but the object of the exercise is to show the basic floating image method, and it seems to fail with a coloured background.
Regards and thanks to all,&lt;/poem&gt; [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 18:06, 23 November 2008 (UTC)
== HideNseek template ==

I have created [[Template:HideNseek|HideNseek]] template to be used like this
{{HideNseek|title=Click for the list|text=
#Who
#Eye
#House
#Ice}}
I want only the [+] sign to appear in title text when the hideable portion is invisible and a [-] sign when it is visible. Is it it possible? If so can somebody guide me or change the template? I also want the dropdown image on the right to disapear.

== PDF upload failing ==

I have been trying to upload a PDF of the [[Special relativity]] book but when I attempt to view the uploaded file [[image:Special_relativity.pdf]] Adobe comes back with the message &quot;The file is damaged and could not be repaired&quot;, however, I can view the original PDF on my machine without problems.  Any ideas? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:25, 4 November 2008 (UTC)

:There have been plenty of problems in the past with the PDF uploads on the server. A better approach would be the print-on-demand PDFs from the new [[Help:Collections|collections extension]]. That way you don't need to worry about making PDFs by hand and uploading them (and then trying to download them from a buggy server), the PDFs generate and download themselves. I can try to make a collection for this book today so you can compare the performance of it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:09, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

::I just tested the PDF generation for collections and the &quot;Printable version&quot; and &quot;PDF version&quot; link in the &quot;toolbox&quot;. My results for pages of the [[Spanish by Choice]] wikibook are pretty bad: in particular images often have the wrong size. This is somewhat surprising because the &quot;traditional&quot; way of providing a print version handles images a lot better.

== What about quizzes? ==

Hello, I just wondered why the MediaWiki Quiz extension is not available on WikiBooks? [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Quiz (link to mediawiki)] I realized that several wikibooks use the [[:Template:Question-answer]], but the Quiz extension would be more suitable for some of the quizzes. (Although I have to confess that I really like the hide-show mechanism because it has a fresher look&amp;feel than clicking a submit button and only one click is required, while quizzes need at least two clicks.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:36, 20 November 2008 (UTC)

:The quiz extension is probably more suitable for [[v:|Wikiversity]]. We do books here, and books don't generally include interactive quizzes. Wikiversity does more &quot;learning modules&quot;, which can include tests and quizzes. I think they have the extension there. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:36, 26 November 2008 (UTC)

::Well, foreign language learning books generally include exercises. In the case of dead-tree books the readers are usually asked to answer the questions before comparing their answers with the solutions. This is a form of interactivity. The featured wikibooks [[Miskito]], [[Latin]] and [[Spanish]] all include interactive exercises using templates such as {{tl|Question-answer}} and I think that there is a consensus among most authors of foreign language learning wikibooks that interactive exercises are important. Yes, Wikiversity has the extension. As some language courses at Wikiversity refer their students to the corresponding wikibook, these wikibooks are an important part of &quot;learning modules&quot; and therefore it probably makes sense to support a similar set of extensions. As mentioned above, I have no strong feelings about this since I think that the {{tl|Question-answer}} template works well for my purposes, but for many of the exercises in language learning wikibooks, the Quiz extension would obviously offer some benefits. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 17:32, 26 November 2008 (UTC)

:::I'm not going to deny that sometimes the line between Wikibooks and Wikiversity is blurry. That doesn't mean we should not distinguish between the two. Exercises in a book are common, even outside of foreign languages, but that's not the same thing as a quiz, and they aren't really &quot;interactive&quot; in any sense. My suggestion to you would be to create Quizzes at Wikiversity, and link heavily between your book here and the related learning materials over there. That way you could have a book which can be printed neatly (for distribution to students without internet access) and interactive supplementary course materials. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:53, 26 November 2008 (UTC)

::::Well, I think I have to take the position of authors of language learning wikibooks here (in particular because there are only very few active authors on language learning wikibooks). When I refer to &quot;quizzes&quot; I refer to &quot;whatever is supported by the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Quiz Quiz extension]&quot;. And this includes for example [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Help:Quiz#Gapfill_.2F_cloze gapfill exercises], a typical form of exercises for language learning books. Of course, translation and conjugation of words is also supported by this extension. In a dead-tree book readers would have to look up the solutions and compare their answers themselves. An electronic wikibook with the Quiz extension could provide better support for such exercises by doing the checking automatically. I think wikibooks should be allowed to do better than dead-tree books. And I wouldn't like to put the exercises on Wikiversity, in particular because the exercises would be missing in the printed version. 
::::I agree that it is important to print books neatly for many reasons. If you compare [[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod newbie lesson A0001]] and [[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod newbie lesson A0001/Print version]] you will see that the interactive exercises at the end of the page print neatly by using a two-column format and instructions to uncover the solutions in the right column line by line. I agree that such a printable version should be provided for any kind of interactive exercise, including anything that is done with the Quiz extension. If authors are willing to provide such printable versions, why not include the Quiz extension to improve the electronic versions? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 18:28, 26 November 2008 (UTC)

== How to best cite references in wikibook pages? ==

howdy crowd,

i am citing a bunch of material from published work in the wikibook that i am working on and i see about a million different ways of doing things. the one that struck me as most useful was the one used in the wikipedia page [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle]] but i found nothing that summarized the official policy on this. would somebody be so kind to point me towards the currently acceptable way of doing things? thanks a stack [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] ([[User talk:Robert Huber|talk]]) 18:20, 24 November 2008 (UTC)

:All references tend to be collected together in one place, like a bibliography section in dead tree books, if used at all. Wikibooks doesn't really require that sources be cited and books are expected to be completely self contained, unlike encyclopedia articles. If Fisher's principle is relevant to the topic of the book your trying to contribute to, it would be better to mention Fisher's principle directly within the book as it applies to the scope of the book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:02, 24 November 2008 (UTC)

::The [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style#Footnotes and references]] appears to recommend to collect all references of each page/module/chapter at the end of the page/module/chapter. This is different from collecting all references of a whole(!) book in one place, which is probably the most common approach in traditional books, although some traditional books also have bibliography sections for each chapter. From the point of view of scientific textbooks and scientific writing in general, I strongly disagree with the comment that &quot;Wikibooks doesn't really require that sources be cited.&quot; The [[WB:PAG#Content guidelines|official content guidelines of wikibooks]] include: '''Cite your sources, and use proper references'''. Citing sources is a crucial element of any scientifc writing, including textbooks. If you have a single source: cite it! If you have two or three independent sources: cite them! You can omit some oral sources (e.g. lectures) and you can omit sources when there is a common consensus among many independent publications. If we apply this to children books then you will probably omit most sources because of the common consensus argument. But for textbooks on scientific topics, citing sources is crucial. And just to clarify my point: I think the concept of citing sources has absolutely nothing to do with the concept of writing a self-contained text. These are two completely independent concepts: you can write a perfectly self-contained text and give all your sources, and you can also write a non-self-contained text without giving any sources. In practice, it is usually easy to distinguish the specification of a source with bibliographic information (which should not be avoided in any scientific writing) from a hyperlink that serves as an explanation of a term (which should be avoided in wikibooks but not in wikipedia). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 13:06, 25 November 2008 (UTC)

:::Wikibooks does require that if you include material from other works that you provide proper credit, so a quote like in the manual of style example should include a reference to where that quote comes from. If material from a work is used within the book, you must credit the source of the information, in that sense does Wikibooks require that you cite your sources. However unlike Wikipedia, books are not required to provide evidence and backup every single piece of information included by referring to or linking to other sources. I am not aware of any attempt to require books to provide sources for every piece of information in order for information to be included, like is usually done on Wikipedia, are you? I only mentioned that books are self contained and should include all relevant information inside the book directly for completeness sakes. Books shouldn't rely on other works for explanations, for missing details, and for understanding the subject better. In that sense, using or citing sources shouldn't be done.
:::You could say I was trying to deal with the ambiguity of what citing sources can mean and was focused on what citing sources means on Wikipedia and how Wikibooks does things differently and does not have the same requirements as Wikipedia. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:19, 25 November 2008 (UTC)

::Reading what was asked again. I'm wondering now if by citing perhaps Robert Huber means actually using material from another work within a book. If this is true Robert, you do need to acknowledge the work. If a lot of the work is being used you should include an acknowledgment type page to acknowledge all works that were used in the book. On the other hand if say a quote from a book was used you could just use a footnote on the page the quote was used on to acknowledge the work. If the work isn't GFDL you cannot use the material in any book, and if the material is GFDL but didn't come from a wiki there might be implications down the road if the WMF decides to switch all projects to a CC-BY-SA license. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:19, 25 November 2008 (UTC)
thanks a major stack folks, the style manual ref did the job. i don't use references in wikibooks to refer to other critical material that the reader needs and which is located elsewhere. i use references mostly when i am faced with an important set of considerations which goes beyond the scope of the book. that way i include the most salient points needed for the book and refer the reader to the main source for anything that might be of interest beyond that. thanks a major stack for your comments and suggestions [[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] ([[User talk:Robert Huber|talk]]) 11:57, 26 November 2008 (UTC)
:If that's what you're using it for, you might consider templates like {{tlx|info}}, {{tlx|warning}}, and {{tlx|SideBox}}.

== Print version of module (2nd try) ==

I wrote two new templates {{tl|Print version of module}} and {{tl|Print version of module notice}}, together with a new [[:Category:Modules with print version]] (subcategory of [[:Category:Print Versions]]). As mentioned before, I think I'm flooding the [[:Category:Books with print version]] with the printable versions of lessons of the wikibook [[Spanish by Choice]]. To avoid this (and since the new printing possibilities don't work well for these lessons), I'm now using these two new templates for modules of that wikibook; thus, they don't appear in [[:Category:Books with print version]] (at least they won't appear after caches are updated; this might take some time). Of course, everyone may still use the templates {{tl|Print version}} and {{tl|Print version notice}} for modules. The new templates and category just offer a way to avoid flooding of the [[:Category:Books with print version]] with printable modules. Is this OK? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:57, 26 November 2008 (UTC)

:I guess I didn't quite understand what you were doing, but I've taken a good look at this book now and I think I see. You are creating a separate printable version of every single page, not a single printable version that contains all pages together. This isn't &quot;wrong&quot;, but I've never seen it before. What is the difference between a page and the printable version of that page? 
:On the left side of the page in the &quot;toolbox&quot; (you might need to scroll down a little), there should be links to &quot;Printable version&quot; and &quot;PDF version&quot;.

::Well, the page with the table of contents also provides a single printable version that contains all pages together: [[Spanish_by_Choice/SpanishPod_lessons]]. BTW the [[C++ Programming/TOC1]] book also provides printable versions of &quot;chapters&quot; of the book. In the particular case of [[Spanish_by_Choice/SpanishPod_lessons]] the pages can be studied in any order; thus, it made sense to me to make each page printable. The main difference between a page and the printable version is the abscence of audio players and a completely different format of the exercises. For the things that are not satisfied by the &quot;PDF version&quot;  see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Technical_Assistance#PDF_upload_failing above].

== [[Wikibooks:Collections Preface]] ==

I started working on this page today, which is going to be like a forward or preface that we can attach to our printed and published books to explain where the book comes from, who we are, and how to get involved. It's probably a little verbose (I have that tendency), so any help to make it shorter, better, more informative, etc would be appreciated.

There isn't an automatic way yet, but if you're going to be creating collections for print and distribution, a little page like this in the front as an explanation would be a big help. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:08, 5 November 2008 (UTC)

== Moving and Renaming Confusing or Lonely Pages ==

[[User:Darklama]], [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] and I were talking on IRC a little earlier today, and had a few things to say about the various discussion rooms we have. We've been living with the current Reading Rooms and discussion rooms for a while now, and I think some of the problems with it are becoming more apparent. On the bright side though, we can always learn from our mistakes and continue to move forward. Here are some observations that we've had:

# Popular and well-used rooms, such as [[WB:CHAT]] and [[WB:AN]] shouldn't be moved, renamed, merged, or whatever. People are already using them and we shouldn't change something that works.
# [[WB:VFD]] and [[WB:VFU]] should be merged together. The later receives hardly any traffic or exposure, and nobody uses it.
# [[WB:FBN]] has been very low-traffic too. This might be because it's too secluded, it's not well-advertised, etc. 
# [[WB:HELP]] seems to be a little confusing. It was originally intended as a place where announcements could be made about new users, new projects, and new books. Now, it seems to be a strange mixture of [[WB:CHAT]] and [[WB:AN]] and nobody seems to know waht kinds of discussions belong there.
# [[WB:PROJECTS]] is in the same boat. it was originally intended as a place where groups of people could work on collaborations, either in a single book or spanning multiple books. This hasn't panned out, yet. 

Here are some suggestions we mentioned for fixing these issues. some of these are contradictory (and this probably isn't a complete list so feel free to add more). I would like to get some feedback on these:

# [[WB:VFD]] and [[WB:VFU]] should be merged. They both deal with discussions about inclusion criteria and book deletions. They could both use the same templates and procedures, and attract the same audience. We might also like to rename the joint page to something like &quot;Book Inclusions&quot; or &quot;Deletion Discussions&quot; or something like that. I prefer a name with a more positive attitude (focus on inclusions instead of deletions). Also, Darklama suggested and I agree that we should remove the word &quot;Vote&quot; from the title to prevent mere voting and encourage more active discussions.
# I personally would like to see the [[WB:PROJECTS]] merged into [[WB:HELP]] and [[WB:FBN]]. We can revitalize the new room as a &quot;Books Discussion&quot; where people can announce new books, discuss novel ideas for books, get help with and collaborate on books and select books which are &quot;good&quot;, &quot;featured&quot;, etc. It would also be a good central place to discuss stable versions (once we get that damn extension installed).
# The [[WB:SHD]] room is terribly underutilized. Either it should be moved into the Reading Room where it can get better exposure, or it should be merged into an existing page. [[WB:HELP]] would seem like a good cnadidate for such a merger, if it hasn't gotten merged into something else already.

The point is to make sure that things are being well-utilized and are able to be found quickly by the people who would like to use them. These aren't the only ideas (if you have more, do share!), but I think they are good starting points for now. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:25, 7 August 2008 (UTC)
:While we're on the topic of Confusing Pages... I know we just renamed the Reading Room recently, but now that I've had six months (?) to think about it, I think it is a horrible name.  When you go to a library and want some help, do you go to the &quot;reading room&quot;? Didn't think so. That's where I'd go if I wanted to be left alone and ''read'' something.  I would expect a reading room to be a quiet place.  Maybe the reference desk? Perhaps, but there is surely a better name than that. I would like to hear from new users what they think of &quot;Reading Room&quot; being the name of the place you go for help.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 17:03, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

:Whiteknight, would you mind clarifying your proposals I do see some benefits on the merge of the [[WB:VFD]] and [[WB:VFU]] for example but what would become the target page and or how would you propose it to be named, the same clarification is needed for other actions you are proposing.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:12, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

::I wasn't really making any concrete proposals, just putting forward some ideas that were discussed. I think that [[WB:VFD]] and [[WB:VFU]] should be merged together because both of them are on the topic of deletion, and neither of them get a lot of traffic. I would like to see them merged and named something like &quot;Inclusion Discussions&quot; or &quot;Content Discussion&quot;. Most of the other proposals I agree with (to varying degrees), but I would like to get some more feedback before pushing forward any other issues.
::As far as Jomegat's idea about renaming the Reading Room, I don't think it's a terrible idea, but I would want to see a very compelling alternative before I got involved with the hassle to rename this all. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:57, 14 September 2008 (UTC)

:H€re we go...
# no problems but the acronyms can be confusing and geeky.
# good idea but not the part about changing the name to something like 'book inclusions' - would an occasional user have any idea what that page might be about?  And it should remain a 'vote'.  By encouraging discussions you are likely to only get input from those who've been on WB for years and are able to quote silly policies and guidelines and then shout down other people when they simply say 'support' or 'delete'.  If you want more people to contribute then you have to LET them get involved and people won't get involved when we use strange acronyms, quote unfamiliar and lengthy policies and tell people not to vote.
# there is no question posed
# why do we have so many pages for help, admin assistance, project stuff, etc.?  It's a small project and so many different pages are unnecessary and confusing especially when you have no idea where your question might belong.
# waste of space, delete it.

:::Pages that are being well-used have clear utility and should stay, regardless of their number. Pages that are not being used are superfluous and should be merged with pages that are more popular. What we want to do is reduce the number of pages that active Wikibookians need to watch and participate in, but keep the same amount of information available to people. There are a number of pages that are rarely used ([[WB:PROJECTS]], [[WB:VFU]], [[WB:SHD]], etc) and they should be merged or deleted because they aren't used.
:::The debate about whether we &quot;vote&quot; or not is a waste of time, I think. It's mincing words. What we don't do is ''majority-wins'' voting, or simple binary voting. People express their opinions on an issue, sometimes in the form of a simple yes/no, but sometimes in the form of a thoughtful explanation. It's very free form, unlike traditional &quot;voting&quot; that people are familiar with. I think it's confusing to tell people &quot;We ''do vote'', but not in a way that you might be familiar with&quot;, as opposed to the simpler &quot;We don't vote, we discuss&quot;. Again, it's mincing words, but we need to settle on a single terminology to prevent confusing new users. The learning curve around here is already steep enough.
:::That brings us to the issue of naming pages. Pages like [[WB:VFD]] and [[WB:VFU]] use the word &quot;vote&quot; which would imply to new users that it's an up/down binary vote where people can blindly cite policy and be lawyering assholes. It also brings to mind the issue of suffrage, which we really don't have here. I think the word &quot;Discussion&quot; makes it more clear that people should participate in it. So, we could merge these two pages into &quot;Wikibooks:Deletion Discussions&quot; or even &quot;Wikibooks:Reading Room/Deletion Discussions&quot;, whatever people want. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:51, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

::::I disagree that this page is unused. The point of the split up was because there was too much traffic to pages which required more frequent archiving, and to allow people to watch only what they are interested in while not being distracted by other things. I think this page should be kept. I propose for now WB:SHD be merged with WB:HELP to help give WB:HELP more focus on assisting users. I also agree with the proposal to merge WB:VFU with WB:VFD and to renamed it &lt;tt&gt;Wikibooks:Reading room/Deletion Discussions&lt;/tt&gt;. I think those two mergers is all we need right now, remember we can always improve things more later if a need arises, but for now I think this would be a good start. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:40, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

== PDF version ==

Nissan 240SX Performance Modification/Engine Swaps/SR20DE.   The info in the versions and specs section of this has all wrong info, the versions and specs are all wrong

Extremely respectuous to the daily creators of Wikipedia, 
I find however hilarious how impossible is the process of obtaining a pdf of a listed wikibook: 

I have been turning around the pot for 30 minutes before giving up, 
so promessing and irrelevant were the pages supposed to direct me to a pdf file. 

The technicity allowing readers to download a pdf should not be seen as a luxury, 
nor should it be perceived a thread to the popularity of their web equivalent: 
Everyone knows the web equivalent is regularly updated / corrected / improved, 
and wikibooks do serve the prestige and popularity of Wikipedia ! 

Yours,

== Flaggedrevs ==

I find the lack of more specific information regarding the Flaggedrevs system alarming. I am very involved in the internet community and a frequent visitor to the sister of wikibooks, wikipedia en. I was recently asked by a former teacher of mine who has been working on creating on online textbook since I was in the seventh grade, to assist in the setup and creation of this wikibook in it's final stages. I seek to, in time, upon the completion of the wikibook, remove the warning at the top of the page stating, 
&quot;There are no reviewed revisions of this page, so it may not have been checked for quality&quot;. I have read all of the information, but have found absolutely no information regarding becoming an editor or reviewer so that I can check articles upon their completion. Any information regarding how to become a reviewer or editor would be appreciated, as I seek to review many wikibooks, now and in the future. Thank you for your time.

== [[Using Wikibooks]] ==

I would like to get this book, which is like an instruction manual for new Wikibooks users, into better condition for printing. Eventually, I would like to be able to print copies of this book and distribute them to teachers and students, or other prospective Wikibookians. There are a few things that this book needs:

# More content. If everybody could write a few paragraphs about their &quot;specialty&quot;, that would be great. There are lots of details to be added.
# Images. We need screenshots of the Wikibooks interface, showing some of the things we talk about in the book.
# Editing. Book needs copyediting and general improvements of what is already there.
# Reviewing. There are a lot of pages written, and they need to be reviewed for quality.

If we had a concerted community effort to do it, this book could probably be [[WB:FBN|featured quality]] before 2009, and we could start getting copies printed. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:33, 29 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
Transcription activation is the regulation by which a change in the rate of DNA transcription may alter the expressed gene in question. Regulatory proteins are utilized to activate an expression of a certain gene or to repress it (regulate). The activators catalyze interaction of RNA polymerase in the synthesis or expression of the gene in hand. This is accomplished by increasing the binding affinity of the RNA polymerase to the promoter site, the region of DNA that is vital in the transcription process. Transcription factors are activated, and transcription occurs at the promoter site. Histone interactions occur during acylation as DNA is transcribed into RNA.

== Mechanism ==
First, the binding of a ligand to a certain receptor occurs, initiating a reaction signal. This activates a transcription factor, which is a protein that binds specific DNA sequences and controls the rate of the transcription process. The transcription factor additionally binds to other reagents necessary in transcription. These proteins (transcription factors) are then able to be regulated by reversible regulation processes such as phosphorylation or proteolysis. 

The transcription of DNA to RNA and its subsequent translation to proteins can be regulated by '''acylation''' and '''methylation'''.  DNA is negatively charged and is wrapped around positively charged '''histone''' proteins.  In order for transcription to occur the DNA must be unbound to the histones.  This is accomplished by acylating the positively charged residues found in the histones such as lysine.  This neutralizes the positive charge allowing for a looser binding with DNA.  This allows RNA polymerase to enter and transcribe the desired gene. In order to reverse this effect and tighten the binding, '''methylation''' occurs.  Methylation of the residues restores the positive charges to restore the electrostatic interactions between the histones and DNA and tighten the binding.  It is in this method that gene expression is regulated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Kenneth FitzGerald: NSU Joint Graduate Program'''
Kenneth FitzGerald (born December 7, 1960) is an &quot;artist, educator, and writer&quot;. Holds the title of Associate Professor of Art and Graduate Program Director in the Art department at Old Dominion University where he teaches in the undergraduate Graphic Design and graduate Visual Studies programs.


'''BIOGRAPHY'''
Kenneth FitzGerald obtained a Bachelor's of Fine Arts with a concentration in Ceramics at the Massachusetts College of Art in 1983. In 1996 he graduated yet again from Massachusetts College of Arts with a Master's of Fine Arts in Graphic Design. After graduation he went on to teach graphic design at Massachusetts College of Art for 11 years. In August of 2001 FitzGerald began working at Old Dominion University as the undergraduate Graphic Design Professor.

Throughout his career at Old Dominion University he has organized three exhibitions in Graphic Design and has participated in the many of the University Gallery installments.

FitzGerald has his own blog, http://www.ephemeralstates.com, in which he writes in frequently and expresses himself as an artist and a writer. You can also find a short write up and information about his classes and other involvements with Old Dominion on the ODU website at http://www.odu.edu/al/kfitzgerald/ 



'''SIGNIFICANT STORY'''
On September 11, 2001, the beginning of Kenneth's first semester with Old Dominion, and the day no American will ever forget, Kenneth had a night class. As he was preparing to leave, his daughter who was already tucked into bed for the night asked, &quot;What does dad do&quot;? Before he could explain she quickly answered her own question by saying &quot;Dad goes to sleep with his students&quot;! She exclaimed that she wished she could go with him to make graphic designs like his students. He replied that she couldn't and that he wasn't even sure if there would be students to teach that night. When he arrived at school he was perplexed with the thought all of that had transpired that day as well as the desire of his young daughter to make graphic designs like his students. This brought him to the idea of a typographical assignment about America: post 9/11. AS he looked for examples and references on past tragedies he came across of book that he had always enjoyed but had never had a second thought about. The book was ironically called ''Skyscraper I love you'', this transformed and controlled the meaning of the book as well as his teaching approach for him forever.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is Distance Learning

Broadly viewed, distance learning is an educational process that occurs when instruction is delivered to students physically remote from the location or campus of program origin, the main campus, or the primary resources that support instruction. In this process, the requirements for a course or program may be completed through remote communications with instructional and support staff including either one-way or two-way written, electronic or other media forms.http://web.syr.edu/~tgillard/dl/index.html 

Convenience is a key reason students enroll in distance learning courses. Other factors why schools are moving towards Distance Learning include; allowing children to learn through different teaching means as each individual has a specific style preference and motivation level, allows for teaching of time management skills, and improves overall computer and Internet skills as well as it teaches children how to become technologically competent.

Distance Learning or Distance Education is becoming a popular and viable way for teaching and learning.  K-12 teachers use it to enrich classroom instruction.  It allows independent study, group study or real-time interaction.  Secondary and elementary teachers are able to supplement classroom instruction with distance education.  Students can meet children from other countries or take a trip to the zoo without leaving the classroom.  It allows students to access a variety of courses or in the case of the Metroparks Zoo allows students to view an environment they may not otherwise experience.  

Metropark Zoo
The following is a synopsis of the Distance Learning program that I found very innovative, useful and fun for students in grades k-12.  The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo’s Conservation Education division believes that people, as lifelong learners, can positively impact wildlife and wild places, through their caring, decision-making, and actions. In order to achieve this, the Conservation Education program was designed to foster respect and appreciation of wildlife and coexisting human cultures. 

From its inception in the Fall of 1998, the Distance Learning Program has brought the excitement of the animal world to students who may not be able to easily visit a major zoo. By enabling children to experience the richness of the natural world from their schoolroom, led by experienced zookeepers who can communicate their love and respect for animals, the Distance Learning Program enriches the lives of children and leads them to a greater appreciation of the role of animals in their lives and the importance of the environment. 

Recently the zoo added a new wireless component to the Interactive Distance Learning Program, with the intend of expanding the reach of Distance Learning to actual exhibits within the Zoo, rather than relying on a single studio or video recordings, as in the case of animals whose size or environmental requirements (e.g., elephants or sharks) prevent studio use. Now, with the Cisco® wireless mesh technology supporting mobile video systems, keepers can present the animals directly from their exhibits in real time. This not only has greater impact on the students, but has greatly increased keeper interest and participation in the Distance Learning Program.

This new technology will enable children to communicate with the Zoo keepers allowing them to ask questions as they observe the animals in their environment.  What would be even more interesting and exciting would be if this type of technology was implemented into programs where wildlife experts and conservationists actually were in each animals habitat in the wilderness.  This would allow children to see how the animals live: procreate, prey, and any other real environmental characteristics they may display that the zoo environment may not facilitate.  This real-life interaction allows for wildlife experts to share their enthusiasm and excitement about the natural world with students around the world.  Not only will students get a chance to see animals in their natural habitat they will be able to communicate with wildlife experts from around the world, not only from their own country.  Students would be able to interact with the world renowned experts while being involved in real-time displays of animal behaviour, while the men and women leaders in the fields of wildlife biology and conservation would actively work to ensure the survival of endangered species. The scientific information and the personal observations these experts could share with students through distance education would enable people of all ages and socioeconomic status, to access live feed from experts on each specific species. This would help provide each and every students with the best wildlife encounter possible. http://www.cwhonors.org/viewCaseStudy2008.asp?NominationID=719

One major challenge with this concept would be designing a system that would be able to connect real time video with the animals habitat.  Not to mention that mobile support may not be accessible due to dead-zones.

What the Cleveland Metropark Zoo did to accomplish the feed was use the Cisco Aironet 1510 Outdoor Mesh access points, Total Systems Integration, Inc. (TSI) which was able to extend real-time video conferencing to the seven most popular exhibits in the zoo, including the primate, shark, and rain forest exhibits. This intelligent wireless mesh solution eliminates the need for additional cabling or line-of-sight access from a given exhibit, which made it easier and less expensive to deploy. This meant that the Zoo could offer real-time video distance learning from more exhibits. 

The seamless mobility offered by the self-configuring, self-healing mesh means that setting up a distance learning session is as simple as wheeling a mobile video cart to the exhibit and turning it on. This simplicity played a major role in building support for distance learning among keepers, as it permits them to share their excitement about their particular animals without requiring them to learn a complicated new technology. It also adds to the excitement for the children watching by making the experience even more like a real field trip, as the keeper can easily give them a “tour” of multiple exhibits simply by wheeling the cart, while still connected and broadcasting, to a new location.

So could this technology be used in the natural environment without disrupting their habitation?  It would be interesting to test out this possible route and see if the “real-time” could actually occur with the ‘real life’ of these animals.

This program has made students more excited than ever about the programs presented by the Distance Learning department. Seeing the animals live in their actual zoo habitat increases the impact and effectiveness of distance learning. The intimacy of this on-location capability also delivers an enhanced sense of connection to the zookeepers, which has always been an important part of student interest. 

The experience is far more dynamic than traditional distance learning, as well. The mobility of the video carts, which can move from place to place while still broadcasting, enables presenters to give children a “virtual field trip” that is far more vivid and memorable. 

For the Zoo, the new wireless system makes it much easier to set up and deliver a newly improved interactive Distance Learning course.  The keepers find it much easier to interact naturally with the children when teaching from their own exhibits, and the spontaneity of the animals in their usual setting generates many more “teachable moments” that the keepers can use to make the children’s experience even more memorable and valuable. 

In addition to the expansion of wireless distance learning, the expanded reach of videoconferencing is making it easier for the Zoo to reach out to and cooperate with other conservation and educational organizations. 

Other possibilities are opening up such as offering wireless Internet access to Zoo visitors, and even “at exhibit” programming that gives visitors the ability to access interactive modules via iPod, cell phones, or other mobile digital devices. Eventually, visitors may actually be able to “take the animals home” with them and keep track of animals they are interested in by signing up for virtual tours or access to “behind-the scenes” classes offered by keepers.

“This program allows the students to learn not just by hearing, but by seeing, doing, and being a part of the activity,” said Dianne Keller, librarian and high school technology coordinator for the Gladewater Independent School District in Texas. “This has been a very effective way for our students to learn about animals.” The number of requests for distance learning programs from school systems throughout the United States is increasing as news about the superior quality of the Zoo’s programs spreads among educators. .   http://www.cwhonors.org/viewCaseStudy2008.asp?NominationID=719

Conclusion

Although Distance Education such as the MetroPark Zoo programme has many positives there is still the fact that children need to experience real life (not virtual) environments.  Regardless of how advanced technology is being in the actual setting allows for the students to experience the environment more fully and in a different way than they would via television, satellite etc.  I am a advocate for Distance Learning and it is fantastic that these programmes exist for students that may not be able to afford to go to the zoo but virtual reality should never replace reality.

Irreversible enzyme inhibitor that is for covalent modification that inactivates enzyme; or chemical that modifies by reaction with functional groups of enzyme.

Group specific reagents are enzyme inhibitors that can covalently bond to a particular amino acid residue on the enzyme and irreversibly modify it.It is less specific compared with [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Affinity Labels (reactive substrate analogs)|affinity label]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Suicide Inhibitors|suicide inhibitor]]. It reacts with side chain of amino acid.
&lt;br/&gt;
Two examples of group-specific reagents are diisppropylphosphoflouridate (modifies a serine residue) and iodoacetamide (modifies cystein residue)

&lt;br/&gt;

[[Image:groupspecific.jpg|thumb]]

== Applications ==
[[Image:Group-specific reagent.jpg|70px|thumb|frame|right|''Group-specific reagent'']]Group specific reagents are not only used to inhibit enzymes, but are also used to deduce if certain amino acid residues are very reactive and actually take on an important role in the catalysis of the product. For example, diisopropylphosphofluoridate (DIPF) modifies only one serine residue out of all the amino acid residues on the enzyme, chymotrypsin. By measuring the turnover rate before and after inhibition, one can determine if that serine residue is essential to the catalytic power of the enzyme. (The pink x in the figure has no meaning and should be ignored.)

Transition state inhibitors, much like group specific reagents, resemble the substrate of the enzyme. Transitions state inhibitors are molecules which are originally derived from the substrate of the enzyme. They very much resemble the transition state of the substrate but are not 100% identical. Because of this, the transition state inhibitor is able to bind to the active site. However because of its subtle difference that makes it unique from the original substrate, the enzyme is unable to carry out its catalytic effects.  An example of a transition state inhibitor is the transition-state analog pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid.  This substance mimics the binding properties of D-proline; however, unlike D-proline, pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid is a trigonal molecule, whereas D-proline is tetrahedral.  This difference makes pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid an inhibitor that is bound 160 times more tightly to racemase than is D-proline.  The ability of transition-state analogs to bind so well to enzymes draws attention to the fundamental nature of catalysis: selective binding of the transition state&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;.    

One use of transition state inhibitors is the ability to create antibodies from them. By experimentally injecting transition state analogs in a rabbits, these rabbits were able to produce antibodies to the transition state analog as well as its intended converted substrate. These antibodies, however, were found to be not as efficient those antibodies which actually were created as a result of being injected with the actual substrate.

Affinity label or reactive substrate analog are molecules that have a similar structure to the substrate allowing them to covalently bind to the active site of the enzyme. They react with the substrate, inhibiting the enzyme. Essentially, affinity labels mimic the functional properties of the substrate, but consequently irreversibly inhibits the enzyme through the strong covalent bonding. Because of its similarity to the substrate, it initially binds at the active site; however, the covalent bonds it forms irreversibly modify the enzyme.  They are much more specific than group specific inhibitors. They are usually highly reactive. Also, there will be alkylate nucleophilic amino acids in the enzyme. However, their properties are rather non-selective and toxic, making them not as useful in many situations.

Substrate analogs that bind to active sites of enzymes to form product of covalent bond that is stable on binding site to inhibit chemical reaction; irreversible enzyme inhibitor that react with functional group of enzyme and has more specificity for enzyme.

==Use of Affinity Labels==
Affinity labelling can be used to localize a given site within a protein of a known amino acid sequence.  It allows comparisons to be made between the substrate sites of the enzyme in the solution and the sites localized within the crystalline form through X-ray diffraction.  This can test whether the compound that is bound irreversibly at the substrate site can influence the enzyme conformation, subunit interaction, or the reactivity of other ligand sites.

==Example of an Affinity Label==
Tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone is a substrate analog for chymotrypsin. This molecules binds at the active site and then react irreversibly with histidine residue at that site, inhibiting the enzyme.

Suicide inhibitors are also known as mechanism-based inhibitors. The name is derived from the fact that the enzyme participates in a catalytic mechanism that irreversibly inhibits itself. These inhibitors are substrates that have been modified.  Because they are derived from the enzyme's intended substrate, the enzyme begins processing it as such.  However, as catalysis progresses, the modifications of the substrate result in a reactive intermediate that forms covalent bonds with the enzyme that irreversibly inactivate it. In order for the modified substrate to bind to the active site and undergo the catalytic reaction, even more specificity is utilized compared to group-specific reagents and [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Affinity Labels (reactive substrate analogs)|affinity labels]]. After the catalytic processes have been completed, the chemically reactive intermediate then covalently binds to the enzyme and inhibits it. Suicide inhibitors are  bound to the active site and prevent further reactions that could have occurred with the active site and its substrates.

Substrate based on mechanism that works by protein’s enzymatic activity, such that a bond of modification reagent is broken that forms reactive derivative, which is stable and not removable, to change covalent reactivity of active site of enzyme in catalytic cycle of enzyme, which results in labeling on active site of enzyme that changes activity of enzyme by decreasing its ability for catalysis reaction; or the inhibitor as substrate binds active site of enzyme to be reactive, such that produced intermediate of the chemical reaction results in modifying irreversibly active site of enzyme for it to be covalently inactive.

== Example ==

An example of a suicide inhibitor is N,N dimethylpropargylamine. This compound inhibits the enzyme, monoamine oxidase (MAO). MAO is responsible for breaking down neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin and thus decreasing their concentrations in the brain. Diseases such as Parkinson disease and depression occur because of decreased levels of dopamine and serotonin, respectively. Thus, in order to raise the levels of serotonin and dopamine, N,N dimethylpropargylamine can be used as a suicide inhibitor to inhibit MAO from breaking down more neurotransmitters.

[[Image:Suicideinhibition.png|frame|This shows N,N dimethylpropargylamine (shown in purple) acting as a suicide inhibitor on the flavin prosthetic group of the enzyme monoamine oxidase.]]



Anonther example of a suicide inhibitor is the use of allopurinol to treat gout.  Gout is a disease caused by high serum levels of urate.  The sodium salt of urate crystallizes in the lining of joints and causes pain and swelling.  Xanthine oxidase oxidizes hypoxanthine to form uric acid.  Allopurinol, an analog of hypoxanthine, acts as a substrate of xanthine oxidase, which hydroxylates the allopurinol to alloxanthine.  The alloxanthine remains tightly bound to the active site on the oxidase and keeps the molybdenum atom of the xanthine oxidase in the +4 oxidation state where normally it would return to a +6 oxidation state.  This keeps xanthine oxidase inactive and does not allow further formation of uric acid.

Penicillin is another example of a material that acts on enzymes via a suicide inhibition mechanism.  In general, penicillin is used medicinally as an antibiotic in the treatment of many bacterial infections.  Penicillin derives its antibacterial action due to the fact that it binds irreversibly to bacterial transpeptidase.  Mechanistically, penicillin forms a penicilloyl-enzyme complex with a serine residue found in glycopeptide transpeptidase forming an ester, which is stable indefinitely&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[Category:Structural Biochemistry|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]

Another example of a suicide inhibitor is alpha-difluoromethylornithine or eflornithine, better known as DFMO.  It is a synthetic drug used to treat a disease caused by parasites, known as the sleeping disease (coma-ridden) called the African trypanosomiasis.  DFMO binds to the enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase, through covalent forces and thus inactivating the enzyme.  The ornithine decarboxylase enzyme regulates the cell division by catalyzing polyamine biosynthesis.  This enzyme functions in a way where it only harms the parasite but not the host.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reversible inhibitors can bind to enzymes through weak non-covalent interactions such as ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds. Because reversible inhibitors do not form any chemical bonds or reactions with the enzyme, they  are formed rapidly and can be easily removed; thus the enzyme and inhibitor complex is rapidly dissociated in contrast to irreversible inhibition. 

'''Examples of reversible inhibition:'''
** [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Competitive Inhibitor|competitive inhibition]] (Raises Km only)
** [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Uncompetitive Inhibitor|uncompetitive inhibition]] (Lowers Vmax and Km)
** [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Noncompetitive Inhibitor|noncompetitive inhibition]] (Lowers Vmax only)

'''Examples of irreversible inhibition:'''
** group specific: reacts only to certain chemical group.
** reactive substrate analogs (affinity label): inhibitor that are structurally similar to the substrate and will bind to active site.
** mechanism-based inhibitors (suicide inhibitors): enzymes converts the inhibitor into a reactive form within active site.

Competitive inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of substrate while uncompetitive and noncompetitive inhibition cannot.

Enzyme inhibitors are molecules or compounds that bind to enzymes and result in a decrease in their activity. An inhibitor can bind to an enzyme and stop a substrate from entering the enzyme's active site and/or prevent the enzyme from catalyzing a chemical reaction. There are two categories of inhibitors.
#irreversible inhibitors
#reversible inhibitors

Inhibitors can also be present naturally and can be involved in metabolism regulation. For example. negative feedback caused by inhibitors can help maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors include proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This is useful in eliminating harmful enzymes such as proteases and nucleases.

Examples of enzymes include poisons and many different types of drugs.

==Irreversible Inhibitors==
Irreversible inhibitors covalently bind to an enzyme, cause chemical changes to the active sites of enzymes, and cannot be reversed. A main role of irreversible inhibitors include modifying key amino acid residues needed for enzymatic activity. They often contain reactive functional groups such as aldehydes, alkenes, or phenyl sulphonates. These electrophilic groups are able to react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts. The amino acid components are residues containing nucleophilic side chains such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups such as amino acids serine, cysteine, threonine, or tyrosine.

[[Image:Irreversible inactivation2.svg|thumb|Kinetics of Irreversible Inhibitor]]

First, irreversible inhibitors form a reversible non-covalent complex with the enzyme (EI or ESI). Then, this complex reacts to produce the covalently modified irreversible comple EI*. The rate at which EI* is formed is called the inactivation rate or kinact. Binding of irreversible inhibitors can be prevented by competition with either substrate or a second, reversible inhibitor since formation of EI may compete with ES.

[[Image:DFMO mechanism.png|thumb|Example of a reversible inhibitor forming an irreversible product.]]

In addition, some reversible inhibitors can form irreversible products by binding so tightly to their target enzyme. These tightly-binding inhibitors show kinetics similar to covalent irreversible inhibitors. As shown in the figure, these inhibitors rapidly bind to the enzyme in a low-affinity EI complex and then undergoes a slower rearrangement to a very tightly bound EI* complex. This kinetic behavior is called slow-binding. Slow-binding often involves a conformational change as the exzyme &quot;clams down&quot; around the inhibitor molecule. Some examples of these slow-bindinginhibitors include important drugs such as methotrexate and allopurinol.

==Reversible Inhibitors==
Reversible inhibitors bind non-covalently to enzymes, and many different types of inhibition can occur depending on what the inhibitors bind to. The non-covalent interactions between the inhibitors and enzymes include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and ionic bonds. Many of these weak bonds combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to substrates and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors generally do not undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or dialysis.

There are three kinds of reversible inhibitors: [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Competitive Inhibitor|competitive]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Noncompetitive Inhibitor|noncompetitive]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Uncompetitive Inhibitor|uncompetitive]]/mixed inhibitors. 
*Competitive inhibitors, as the name suggests, compete with substrates to bind to the enzyme at the same time. The inhibitor has an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds to. This type of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentrations of substrate, out-competing the inhibitor. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate.

[[Image:Competitive inhibitor diagram.svg|thumb|Competitive Inhibitor]]

*Uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme at the same time as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice-versa. This type of inhibition cannot be overcome, but can be reduced by increasing the concentrations of substrate. The inhibitor usually follows an allosteric effect where it binds to a different site on the enzyme than the substrate. This binding to an allosteric site changes the conformation of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.

* Non-competitive inhibitors bind to the active site and reduces the activity but does not affect the binding of the substrate. Therefore, the extent of inhibition depends on the concentration of the substrate.

'''&lt;u&gt;Few examples of Reversible inhibitors&lt;/u&gt;:'''

&lt;u&gt;Acetylcholinesterase inhbitors&lt;/u&gt;: Often abbreviated AChEI or anti-cholinesterase it is a chemical that inhibits the enzyme [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Acetylcholinesterase|Acetylcholinesterase]] from breaking down acetylcholine. This ultimately leads to increase in both the level and longetivity of action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

&lt;u&gt;Reversible inhibitor of monoanime oxidase A(maoA)&lt;/u&gt;: maoA inhibitors compromise of a wide range of natural as well as psychiatric drugs that inhibits the enzyme monoamine oxidase temporarily and reversibly. maoA inhibitors are most commonly used to fight depression and dysthymia.

===Quantitative Description of Reversible Inhibitors===
[[Image:Reversible inhibition.svg|thumb|]]
Most reversible inhibitors follow the classic Michaelis-Menten scheme, where an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate(S) to form an enzyme-substrate complex (ES). km is the Michaelis constant that corresponds to the concentration of the substrate when the velocity is half the maximum. Vmax is the maximum velocity of the enzyme.

*Competitive inhibitors can only bind to E and not to ES. They increase Km by interfering with the binding of the substrate, but they do not affect Vmax because the inhibitor does not change the catalysis in ES because it cannot bind to ES.

File:Allosteric comp inhib 1.svg|Competitive inhibition can also be allosteric, as long as the inhibitor and the substrate cannot bind the enzyme at the same time
File:Allosteric comp inhib 2.svg|Another possible mechanism for allosteric competitive inhibition
&lt;/gallery&gt;

*Uncompetitive inhibitors are able to bind to both E and ES, but their affinities for these two forms of the enzyme are different. Therefore, these inhibitors increase Km and decrease Vmax because they interfere with substrate binding and hamper catalysis in the ES complex.

[[Image:Uncompetitive Image.jpg|thumb|Double Reciprocal Graph of Uncompetitive Inhibitor]]

*Non-competitive inhibitors have identical affinities for E and ES. They do not change Km, but decreases Vmax.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is It?==
Suicide inhibitors attach themselves to the enzyme's active site then inhibit its own irreversible inhibition. Rather than reversible forms of inhibition, suicide inhibitors bind as a substrate, and stay bound. This will begin a catalytic mechanism which will generate a fully functional and reactive intermediate. It is this intermediate that comes and inhibits the reaction by inactivating the enzyme through covalent modification, suggesting that the group being modified is very important for the catalysis functions of the enzyme.
The inhibitors are highly specific, One can use these inhibitors to modify an active site in a highly specific manner, in fact, it is one of the most specific methods scientists use for this purpose. 

== Examples ==
Examples of suicide inhibitors used in medicine include those that are involved with the  enzyme monoamine oxidase, associated with Parkinson disease through the levels of dopamine and serotonin levels in the  brain. (-)deprenly is a suicide inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and is used to treat both Parkinson disease and depression.

Over production of other suicide inhibitors can lead to microbial resistance. All beta-lactamase inhibitors are suicide inhibitors and an over production of these have been seen to be related to microbial resistance.</text>

[[Image:Ordered_Sequential.JPG‎|right|250px|thumb|Ordered Sequential]]
Sequential reactions are one of the classes involved in multiple substrate reactions. In these types of reactions, the all the substrates involved are bound to the enzyme before catalysis of the reaction takes place to release the products. Sequential reactions can be either ordered or random. In a bisubstrate reaction, a ternary complex of the enzyme and both substrates forms.  

'''Ordered Sequential Reactions'''

In ordered sequential reactions, all the substrates are first bound to the enzyme in a defined order or sequence. The products, too, are released after catalysis in a defined order or sequence.

An example is the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, which is a protein that catalyzes glucose metabolism. In this ordered mechanism, the coenzyme, NADH, always binds first, with pyruvate binding afterward. During the reaction, the pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by the enzyme. Lactate is then released first, followed by the release of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. 

[[File:LDH reaction.svg]]

[[File:Ordered Sequential.JPG]]

This is a characteristic of a ternary complex, which consists of three molecules that are bound together. Before catalysis, the substrates and coenzyme are bound to the enzyme. After catalysis, the complex consists of the enzyme and products, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and lactate. 

'''Random Sequential Reactions'''

In random sequential reactions, the substrates and products are bound and then released in no preferred order, or &quot;random&quot; order. An example is the creatine kinase enzyme, which catalyzes the substrates, creatine and ATP, to form the products, phosphocreatine and ADP. In this case, either substrates may bind first and either products may be released first.

[[File:Creatine kinase rxn.png|thumb]]

A ternary complex is still observed for random sequential reactions. Before catalysis, the complex includes the enzyme, ATP and creatine. After catalysis, the complex consists of the enzyme, ADP, and phosphocreatine.

      <comment>/* Enzymatic Double-Displacement Reactions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition == 

A double displacement reaction (also called a metathesis reaction) is the bimolecular mechanism, whereby two compound reactants AB and CD result in products of AC and BD. This is typically caused by nucleophilic attack of one group onto another, followed by the release of another group to form a different compound. A common example of this reaction is olefin metathesis, which is the rearrangement of fragments between alkenes about double bonds.

== Enzymatic Double-Displacement Reactions ==

Double displacement reactions occur when one or more products are released before all the substrates bind to the enzyme. Another name for double displacement reactions is &quot;Ping-Pong&quot; reactions. The name comes from the fact that substrates appear to bounce on and off the enzyme just like a ping-pong ball bouncing up and down on a table. An example of double displacement reaction can be seen with the enzyme, aspartate aminotransferase. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from aspartate to alpha-ketoglutarate to form oxaloacetate and glutamate. However, this reaction does not occur sequentially. Aspartate first binds to the enzyme and donates it's amino group to the enzyme, thus modifying the enzyme into what is called a substituted enzyme intermediate. After donating the amino group, aspartate becomes oxaloacetate and is then released. The second substrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, then binds to the enzyme and receives the amino group from the substituted enzyme intermediate. The reaction follows with the release of the final product, glutamate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Gibbs free energy graph shows whether or not a reaction is spontaneous-- whether it is exergonic or endergonic. ΔG is the change in free energy. Generally, all reactions want to go to a lower energy state, thus a negative change is favored. Negative ΔG indicates that the reaction is exergonic and spontaneous. 


Note that ΔG reveals nothing about the speed of the reaction. For example, diamond is supposed to be in a liquid state at room temperature, yet the rate of this reaction is so slow that this change does not seem to occur. Neither do peptide bonds spontaneously go through hydrolysis even though the reaction of such is highly exergonic. A positive ΔG indicates that the reaction is endergonic, or that it requires energy to go from reactants to products. The free energy graph can be used to determine whether the reaction will be spontaneous or not by evaluating the ΔG. ΔG can be found by subtracting the free energy of the reactants from the free energy of the products. 


&lt;big&gt;'''ΔG = G&lt;sub&gt;products&lt;/sub&gt; - G&lt;sub&gt;reactants&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;


[[Image:Gibbs free energy.JPG]]

Therefore, if the reaction goes from higher free energy to lower free energy, there will be a negative ΔG, and the reaction will be spontaneous. However, if the reactants have a lower ΔG than the products, there will be an increase in free energy, and the reaction is nonspontaneous. In this situation, some form of energy (in the form of heat, light, etc.) will be required for the reaction to take place. It should be noted that a spontaneous reaction will not necessarily occur on its own. This is because an initial activation energy is needed in order to start the reaction and thus even a spontaneous reaction may need some form of energy input. A good example of this is the very exergonic combustion of octane, which still needs a flame in order to initiate. 


Enzymes will affect this free energy graph by lowering the activation barrier, or the amount of energy needed for the reaction to occur, They do this by stabilizing the transition state, or the state of highest energy between reactants and products. Enzymes DO NOT affect the equilibrium constant in any way, shape, or form.

      <comment>/* Allosteric Control */general cleanup, typos fixed: to it's → to its using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Proteins are regulated through a variety of different ways; some are controlled allosterically, some use different forms of enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. There are enzymes that are regulated through reversible, or irreversible covalent modification, other enzymes use proteolytic activation, with zymogens that are inactive until cleaved, and finally, some enzymes are regulated by the control of the amount of enzyme present.

Strategies of Regulation:
- Allosteric Control
- Multiple forms of the same enzyme
- Reversible covalent modification
- Proteolytic activation
- Controlling the amount of enzyme present

==Allosteric Control==
Allosteric proteins have two different sites, regulatory and functional. As the name implies, regulatory sites are used by the protein to regulate protein function. This is done by having small signal proteins come and attach themselves to them, and send various signals to control their activity. The functional sites are sites that proteins use to perform its function. Because they contain more than one different site, these proteins often show cooperativity because one active site affects other nearby active sites.

One model of cooperativity is the concerted model, also known as the MWC model. It proposes that an enzyme can only exist in the tense (T) or relaxed (R) state but not both. They either exist completely in T state or completely in R state. When a substrate binds to one monomer of the enzyme, it shifts the equilibrium between the two states. For example, hemoglobin is a tetramer. When oxygen binds to one monomer, the equilibrium shifts from the T state to the R state. The R state favors oxygen binding whereas the T state is stabilized by a different component described later. When an oxygen is bound, the equilibrium of the other monomers also shift from the T state to the R state. As more oxygen is bound to hemoglobin, the affinity for oxygen increases. 

The second model of cooperativity is the sequential model. In this model, an enzyme is either in the T or R state. However, in this model, [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Binding|binding]] of a substrate to an enzyme causes a conformation shift that causes the other monomers in the enzyme to favor binding of the substrate. In hemoglobin, binding of oxygen to a monomer causes the proximal histidine to move closer to the porphyrin ring in the heme group causing one dimer to shift 15 degrees. This conformational change causes the other monomer's affinity for oxygen to increase, thus favoring the T state. 

An example of allosteric control is with the enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase or ATCase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that will produce cytidine triphosphate, or CTP. To control the amount of product formed, CTP will inhibit its own formation by inhibiting the catalyst, ATCase, in a process called &quot;feedback inhibition&quot;. It does this by making the unbound form, or the T state of the catalyst ATCase more stable. This results in shifting the equilibrium towards the unbound state, and thus lowing the affinity of ATCase to its substrate. This is one way proteins ensure they waste no energy producing excess product.

[[Image:ATCase and CTP.jpg‎]]

CTP is not the only NMP molecule that has an effect on ATCase, ATP also has its own effect. Whereas CTP stabilizes the T state ATP stabilizes the R state of ATCase. Stabilizing the R state of ATCase allows the substrate to bind easier and in turn the reaction rate is increased.

[[Image:ATP CTP ATCase.jpg‎]]

ATP as well as CTP are referred to as &quot;heterotropic effects&quot; on a allosteric enzyme such as ATCase. ATP is an allosteric activator of aspartate transcarbamolyase because it stabilizes the R-state of ATCase, effecting neighboring subunits by making it easier for substrate to bind.The increase of the concentration of ATP has two potential explanations. First being, at high concentrations of ATP signals a high concentration of purine and pyrimidine. second, a high concentration of ATP conveys that a source of energy is available for mRNA synthesis and DNA replication follow by the synthesis of pyrimidines needed for these processes.

==Isozymes==
These can also be called isoenzymes. Isozymes are homologous enzymes that have the same function, but are composed of different amino acid sequences, have slightly different structures, and or respond to different regulatory molecules or kinetic parameters such as kM and Vmax. Isozymes allow for &quot;fine tuning&quot; of the enzymes, resulting in enzymes that have the same function, but work in different environments, or respond to different signals. Isoenzymes may be the result of mutations that are preserved in the genome or a result of convergent evolution. 

An example of an isozyme is lactate dehydrogenase, or LDH. This enzyme catalyzes a step in anaerobic glucose metabolism and synthesis. People have two forms of this enzyme, the H and the M, existing in the heart and muscle respectively. These two isozymes differ in their affinity for the substrates and the levels of inhibitors needed to inhibit them. This makes sense because of the highly different environments that exist in the heart and the muscle; the heart is highly aerobic while the muscles are anaerobic. This allows for the same function to be preformed by two &quot;different&quot; enzymes in two different environments.

Since isoenzymes have different structures, they may be separated and identified techniques such as gel electrophoresis.

==Reversible Covalent Modification==
Enzymatic activity can be modified by attaching a modifying group, such as phosphorous, through a covalent bond. The new group then changes the enzyme's reactivity, size, charge, etc.

A good example of this is phosphorylation, catalyzed by protein kinases. Phosporylation is used in many different cells in many of life's organisms because it has many good attributes making it a good tool. 
Of these good attributes include:
~It adds two negative charges to the protein
~Forms 2-3 extra Hydrogen bonds
~Irreversible, due to the amount of energy required to phosphorylate
~has a varying speed that can be changed due to specific needs
~can cause a cascade effect, resulting in an amplified result

Protein kinases are the catalytic enzymes that phosphorylate a protein. They use ATP as the source of phosphoryl groups as well as energy. There are dedicated protein kinases that only phosphorylate a specific protein. They recognize a specific consensus sequence, which usually includes a serine or threonine residue. Other protein kinases are multifunctional protein kinases which can phosphorylate many different proteins. 

Protein Kinase A (PKA) is an example of an enzyme that is regulated by reversible covalent modification and allosteric control. The holoenzyme form of PKA forms an inactive R2C2 complex comprised of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits. The two regulatory subunits contain pseudosubstrate sequences that are bound to the active sites of the two catalytic subunits, inhibiting its function. PKA is activated when four cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) molecules bind to the two regulatory subunits, removing them from the catalytic active sites, thus freeing and activating the catalytic subunits. The protein kinase A is now free to carry on its function and phosphorylate other proteins. 
 
==Proteolytic Activation==
Enzymes can also be controlled by preventing them from functioning until a given time. For example, many enzymes are controlled by hydrolysis of certain bonds, making an inactive enzyme active. The inactive precursors are called zymogens; enzymes such as chymotrypsin, trypsin, and pepsin show this trait.
 
Take Chymotrypsin for example; the inactive form of it is called chymoprypsinogen which will be cleaved by trypsin to result in pi-Chymostrypin, which will in turn cleave others of its kind and result in the final alpha-chymotrypsin. This will control when and where chymotrypsin cleaves, so it does not cleave in the wrong environments or time.

Chymotrypsinogen is the zymogen (inactive precursor) to the digestive enzyme trypsin. It is synthesized in the pancreas. They are stored in zymogen granules in the acinar cells of the pancreas. When a nerve impulse reaches the pancreas, it stimulates the granules to release chymotrypsinogen into the lumen leading to the small intestine. Chymotrypsin activated when the peptide bond between arginine 15 and isoleucine 16 is cleaved by trypsin. This creates two pi-chymotrypsin peptides. The pi-chymotrypsin then cleaves other pi-chymotrypsin peptides. The final result is the active form alpha-chymotrypsin which is made up of three chains. 

Another example of proteolytic activation of enzymes can be seen in blood clotting. When trauma occurs to tissue, it starts a blood-clotting cascade. The activation of one clotting factor triggers the activation of other triggers which creates an amplified effect that allows the body to quickly respond to the injury. When blood vessels rupture, it activates tissue factor (TF). TF then activates thrombin, a protease that cleaves fibrinogen, the zymogen of fibrin. When fibrin is formed, it polymerizes to form clots.

==Controlling Enzyme Present==
This form of regulation is controlled with transcription, different protein will bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate the transcription of certain segments of DNA. The transcription of a certain enzymatic genes can be adjusted to the changes in a cells environment. This will affect the amount of enzyme present in the system, an thus regulate the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Catalysis|catalysis]] of the reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cysteine Protease==

This is part of a large family of peptide-cleaving enzymes or [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases|proteases]]. Cysteine Proteases is one of proteases enzyme that cleave protein by cleave the peptide bond. The strategy used by the cysteine proteases is most similar to that use to be [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin|chymotrypsin]] family that is to generate a nucleophile that attack the peptide carbonyl group. Also similar to chymotrypsin, it polarizes the peptide carbonyl group to get it activated for attack, and upon attack by the nucleophile, a stabilizing tetrahedral intermediate is generated. But different from chymotrypsin enzyme, in this enzyme, a cysteine residue, activated by histidine residue play a nucleophilic attack the peptide bond.

==Most common Cysteine Proteases==
Papain  is a protein-cleaving enzyme derived from papaya fruit (Carica papaya) and certain other plants. Papain is used as a meat tenderizer and in medicine as a digestive aid.
Cathepsins are  members of the lysosomal cysteine protease (active site) family and the cathepsin family name has been synonymous with lysosomal proteolytic enzymes.  In actuality, the cathepsin family also contains members of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Serine Proteases|serine protease]] (cathepsin A,G) and aspartic protease (cathepsin D,E) families as well.  These enzymes exist in their processed form as disulfide-linked heavy and light chain subunits with molecular weights ranging from 20-35 kDa. Cathepsins have a vital role in mammalian cellular turnover, e.g. bone resorption. They degrade polypeptides and are distinguished by their substrate specificite

      <comment>/* Common type of aspartyl protease */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Aspartyl proteases are one of the eukaryotic protease enzymes that catalyzes peptide substrates using aspartate residue. It is usually in a acidic pH range which are inhibited by pepstatin. Some examples of the aspartyl proteases are pepsins, cathepsins and renins. It exists in vertebrates, plants, plant virses and retrovirses. It has a sequence of Asp- Thr- Gly. It is usually represented as monomeric enzymes with twofold symmetry and has a tertiary structure with a N-terminal and a C-terminal. 

==Mechanism==
On the active sites of aspartyl proteases, there are aspartic acid residues that work together to promote a water molecule to attack the peptide bond. One of the aspartic acid residues (left on the diagram, deprotonated form) will activate the water molecule by attracting the hydrogen atom of water. The other aspartic acid (right on the diagram, protonated form) residue will polarize the carbonyl group on the peptide making it easier to attack. One of the aspartic acids usually has a lower pKa value. 

[[File:Aspartyl proteases.png|thumb|Aspartyl Protease Mechanism]]

Renin, an enzyme that supports the regulation of blood pressure, is an important member to this class of enzyme (Berg, 7th Edition)

==Common type of aspartyl protease==
'''Renin''' is a proteolytic enzyme synthesized, stored and secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney; it plays a role in regulation of blood pressure by catalyzing the conversion of the plasma glycoprotein angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. This, in turn, is converted to angiotensin II by an enzyme that is present in relatively high concentrations in the lung. Angiotensin II is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors known, and also is a powerful stimulus of aldosterone secretion.
'''Pepsin''' is a digestive enzyme found in gastric juice that catalyzes the breakdown of protein to peptides. Pepsin is one of three protein-degrading, or proteolytic enzymes in the digestive system; the other two being [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin|chymotrypsin]] and trypsin. The three enzymes work together to break proteins down to peptides and amino acids, which can be readily absorbed by the intestinal lining. Pepsin is most effective in cleaving the bonds of phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.

The '''HIV protease''' is an example of the ''aspartyl protease''. This protease is a dimer which consists of identical subunits. As a member of the ''aspartyl protease'' family, it contains two aspartic acid residues symmetrically located at the bottom of the binding pocket.  The function of this protease is to cleave the domain of the viral protein into their dynamic forms. Those forms spread the virus. This process can be stopped by using HIV protease inhibitors, which attack the '''HIV protease''', bind to it, and prevent cleavage of the domain. An example of an HIV protease inhibitor is Indinavir. Indinavir is used to treat HIV infection and AIDS, and is one of the most successfully used protease inhibitors in medicine.

Lopinavir is also one of the HIV protease inhibitors. The structure of HIV-1 protease with Lopinavir is shown. The hydroxyl group acts as a transition analog, mimicking the oxygen of the tetrahedral intermediate. The benzyl group, positioned next to the hydroxyl group, helps to properly position the drug in the active site.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Can you buy a real, working magic wand? ==

Some, probably young, editor posted this on the main article page.

The answer is, of course, no.

Let us leave aside the fact that the Potter books are fiction. If we assume that the Wizarding world, as described, exists, then in order to buy a wand, you must first find a wand shop, and second, display sufficient magical ability that a wand will select you. Both of these require magical abilities, and if none have shown up in you by the time you can gather enough money for a wand (recall, Harry was 11 and was already doing wandless magic), then it is very likely that you are a Muggle, and a wand would not work for you even if you had one.

Doesn't stop us from wishing, though, does it? Probably this is why Hagrid said that the wizarding world had to remain secret. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:03, 3 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

Metalloproteases contain an active site that has a bound metal ion; this metal is almost always zinc. Metalloproteases are enzymes which catalyze reactions.  Although the metal found is almost always zinc, the reactions can proceed with cobalt as well.  The metal ion activates a water molecule to carry out a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl peptide bond. A base is present to help deprotonate the metal-bound water.

There are two major types of metalloproteases: metalloendopeptidases and metalloexopeptidases. Some common metalloproteases that have been studied are carboxypeptidase A and B, as well as thermolysin, which are digestive enzymes. Thermolysin can be observed in its production from the bacteria by the bacteria Bacillus thermoproteolyticus.

[[Image:METALLOPROTEASES.jpg]]

==Mechanism of Metalloproteases==
Metalloproteases contain on their active site usually a bound metal ion (most of the time Zinc). The metal ion activates a water molecule to act as a nucleophile and attack the peptide carbonyl group. Bound to the active site is a base that pulls a proton from the water molecule bound to the metal in order to turn the water molecule into a nucleophile to attack the peptide bond.

      <comment>/* Inhibition Process */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
 

The basis of enzyme catalysis is the lowering of the enzyme activation energy to create a faster rate of 
reactants turning into products.  Enzymes do this by actually stabilizing the “middle” state in which reactants 
have to undergo before turning into products, called a transition state.  These transition states are in the 
highest energy state in the reaction making it the most unstable.  
Regulation of an enzyme is however required in physiological processes in order to prevent damaging results. 
 One way it can do this is by an irreversible method in which a modified substrate can bind to the enzyme 
and forever deactivate it.  However, knowing the fact that enzyme-substrate complexes undergo a transition 
states, we can therefore conclude that inhibition by a modified transition state is also possible; we call
 this transition state analog inhibition.

==Inhibition Process==

As a substrate binds to its enzyme we know that it undergoes chemical and geometric shifts attaining an intermediate state.  In this situation, a  transition state analog, one exhibiting the same properties such as shape and charge of the original transition molecule, may come in and bind.  Although the analog displays similar properties as the original transition molecule, because it is still slightly different it will not result to a product and will ultimately deactivate and inhibit the enzyme and prevent it from binding to a substrate.
The transition state analog is able to bind to the enzyme with ease because of the great affinity for it.  The transition state is the most unstable condition throughout the entire catalysis so the enzyme complex will seek out any molecule that will help stabilize it.  This is why when a mimic comes in it is fooled into believing that it is binding to the right molecule.

==Example==
Transition-state analogs are compounds that resemble the transition state of a catalyzed reaction. These compounds make for especially potent enzyme inhibitors that offer  insight into an enzyme's mechanistic behavior. One example of such a compound is pyrrole-2-carboxylate, a transition-state analog and consequent inhibitor of proline racemase. The mechanism for proline racemization is given below:
[[Image:JLDproline.gif‎ |frame|Isomerization of L-proline to D-proline via proline racemase]]

The racemization of L-proline to D-proline proceeds through a planar transition state, where the tetrahedral α-carbon becomes trigonal as a proton leaves the L-proline. The transition-state analog for this step is pyrrole 2-carboxylic acid. 
[[Image:Jtlog.gif‎ |frame|Transition-state analog]]

The α-carbon of this transition-state analog, like that of the planar transition state, is trigonal. The resemblance of the transition state rather than the substrate allows transition-state analogs to be highly potent and specific inhibitors of enzymes.

==Antibody==

Transition-state analogs are also ideal for generating catalytic antibodies (a bzymes). Antibodies (immunoglobins) may be created to recognize transition states, and thus function as catalysts for the reaction. The transition-state analog acts as an antigen (immunogen) to generate the antibody. An example of this process is the production of an antibody that catalyzes the insertion of an iron ion into the porphyrin plane, which must be bent in order to allow the iron to enter. Normally, this step is catalyzed by ferrochelatase, the final enzyme in the production of heme. N-methylprotoporphyrin was found to resemble the transition state because N-alkylation bends the porphyrin, much like the ferrochelatase enzyme. Therefore, an antibody catalyst was produced by using an N-alkylporphyrin as the immunogen. The produced antibody is able to distort the porphyrin in order to facilitate the entry of ferrous iron. Using a similar technique, antibodies that catalyze ester and amide hydrolysis, transesterification, and photoinduced cleavage, among other reactions, have been developed.

==Importance of Transition State Analogs==

Importance of Transition State analogs:
•	They are able to act as very powerful inhibitors


•	Transition state analogs are very important in understanding the kinetics and inner workings of enzyme catalysis.  The analogs can “function as antimetabolites” [1.]  One of their most important functions in biochemistry too is the role they play in identifying the mechanism a substrate undergoes during catalysis.  Since the analog is a structure intermediate, if it plays a part on a researched reaction, then determination of the actual structure and actual transformation of the original substrate is actually 
possible.

•	Transition State analogs also help in identifying the “binding determinants at the active site” [1.]

•	Transition State analogs are able to generate immunogens which displays catalytic nature.

=== Intent ===
Allow function overloading based on arbitrary properties of type

=== Also Known As ===
* Explicit Overload Set Management

=== Motivation ===
The '''enable_if''' family of templates is a set of tools to allow a function template or a class template specialization to include or exclude itself from a set of matching functions or specializations based on properties of its template arguments. For example, one can define function templates that are only enabled for, and thus only match, an arbitrary set of types defined by a traits class. The '''enable_if''' templates can also be applied to enable class template specializations. Applications of '''enable_if''' are discussed in length in the literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;jarvi1&quot;&gt;Jaakko Järvi, Jeremiah Willcock, Howard Hinnant, and Andrew Lumsdaine. Function overloading based on arbitrary properties of types. C/C++ Users Journal, 21(6):25--32, June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;jarvi2&quot;&gt;Jaakko Järvi, Jeremiah Willcock, and Andrew Lumsdaine. Concept-controlled polymorphism. In Frank Pfennig and Yannis Smaragdakis, editors, Generative Programming and Component Engineering, volume 2830 of LNCS, pages 228--244. Springer Verlag, September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensible operation of template function overloading in C++ relies on the [[More C++ Idioms/SFINAE|SFINAE (substitution-failure-is-not-an-error)]] principle:&lt;ref&gt;David Vandevoorde and Nicolai M. Josuttis. C++ Templates: The Complete Guide. Addison-Wesley, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; if an invalid argument or return type is formed during the instantiation of a function template, the instantiation is removed from the overload resolution set instead of causing a compilation error. The following example&lt;ref name=&quot;jarvi1&quot; /&gt; demonstrates why this is important: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int negate(int i) { return -i; }

template &lt;class F&gt;
typename F::result_type negate(const F&amp; f) { return -f(); }
&lt;/source&gt;

Suppose the compiler encounters the call ''negate(1)''. The first definition is obviously a better match, but the compiler must nevertheless consider (and instantiate the prototypes) of both definitions to find this out. Instantiating the latter definition with ''F'' as ''int'' would result in: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int::result_type negate(const int&amp;);
&lt;/source&gt;

where the return type is invalid. If this was an error, adding an unrelated function template (that was never called) could break otherwise valid code. Due to the SFINAE principle the above example is not, however, erroneous. The latter definition of negate is simply removed from the overload resolution set.

The '''enable_if''' templates are tools for controlled creation of the SFINAE conditions.

=== Solution and Sample code===
The enable_if templates are very simple syntactically. They always come in pairs: one of them is empty and the other one has a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; typedef that forwards its second type parameter. The empty structure triggers an invalid type because it contains no member. When a compile-time condition is false, the empty &lt;code&gt;enable_if&lt;/code&gt; template is chosen. Appending &lt;code&gt;::type&lt;/code&gt; would result in an invalid instantiation, which the compiler throws away due to the SFINAE principle.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;bool, class T = void&gt; 
struct enable_if 
{};

template &lt;class T&gt; 
struct enable_if&lt;true, T&gt; 
{ 
  typedef T type; 
};

&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an example that shows how an overloaded template function can be selected at compile-time based on arbitrary properties of the type parameter. Imagine that the function '''T foo(T t)''' is defined for all types such that T is arithmetic. The enable_if template can be used either as the return type, as in this example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class T&gt;
typename enable_if&lt;is_arithmetic&lt;T&gt;::value, T&gt;::type 
foo(T t)
{
  // ...
  return t;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

or as an extra argument, as in the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class T&gt;
T foo(T t, typename enable_if&lt;is_arithmetic&lt;T&gt;::value &gt;::type* dummy = 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

The extra argument added to foo() is given a default value. Since the caller of foo() will ignore this dummy argument, it can be given any type. In particular, we can allow it to be void *. With this in mind, we can simply omit the second template argument to '''enable_if''', which means that the '''enable_if&lt;...&gt;::type''' expression will evaluate to ''void'' when '''is_arithmetic&lt;T&gt;''' is true. 

Whether to write the enabler as an argument or within the return type is largely a matter of taste, but for certain functions, only one alternative is possible: 
* Operators have a fixed number of arguments, thus '''enable_if''' must be used in the return type. 
* Constructors and destructors do not have a return type; an extra argument is the only option. 
* There does not seem to be a way to specify an enabler for a conversion operator. Converting constructors, however, can have enablers as extra default arguments.

Unlike sickle-cell anemia, which is a disorder that results in the synthesis of an incorrectly functioning globin chain, Thalassemia is a condition in which too few globin strands are synthesized.  Thalassemia is generally caused by mutations in regulatory genes.  This defect reduces the synthesis rate of one of the necessary globin chains needed to make hemoglobin which leads to the formation of abnormal hemoglobin and causes anemia.

[[Image:Description23.jpg]]

== Strains of Thalassemia ==


There are three types of Thalassemia (bases on the globin strand affected), α-Thalassemia, β-Thalassemia and ɣ-Thalassemia. 


'''α-Thalassemia:''' The effects and severity of α-Thalassemia depends on the number of α-globin loci affected, because α-globin chains are encoded by two genes, each containing 2 loci affects of the disease can be minimal or even non-existent. If only one of the four loci is affected then the person usually doesn’t display any symptoms of the disorder, they are just a carrier. If two loci are affected then the person often has somewhat mild symptoms which mimic those of iron deficiency induced anemia (this condition is generally referred to as the α-Thalassemia trait). However, the effects of the disorder become more evident and severe when three loci are affected because now both genes that encode for the α-globin are defective (this condition is called Hemoglobin H disease), unstable hemoglobin is produced which acts as a much poorer oxygen transporter (because it has a higher than normal affinity for oxygen), which causes anemia and splenomegaly. If all four loci are affected than the fetus can’t survive and will either die in the womb resulting in a miscarriage or will be a stillbirth.


'''β-Thalassemia:''' Like α-Thalassemia the severity of β-Thalassemia depends on the nature of the mutation; the mutation can either completely prevent the production of β chains (referred to as βo) or allow limited β chain formation (known as β+). However, unlike α-globin, which is coded for by 4 loci, β-globin is only coded for by one gene with two loci, so the severity of the condition is very different based on whether one or two of the loci are affected. If only one of the loci is mutated then the symptoms are very mild and sometimes even unnoticeable, the only effect is a slight decrease in red blood cell size (this disorder is called β-Thalassemia minor). However, if both alleles are affected the person will experience severe anemia that could even cause death unless they receive periodic blood transfusion (called β-Thalassemia major). There also exists conditions which are intermediates between the two extremes, which often result in anemia but it can be managed with occasional blood transfusions (called Thalassemia intermedia). However, no matter the severity of the disorder (i.e.-the number of loci affected) there is still an excess of α chains produced in relation to the β strands which tend to bind to red blood cells and can cause membrane damage or even form toxic aggregates.


'''ɣ-Thalassemia:''' As with the other disorders, ɣ-Thalassemia exist as either a mutation that limits the production of ɣ-strands or completely eliminate the formation altogether.  However, unlike the other disorders, ɣ-strands only make up about 2-3% of hemoglobin, so the effects of the condition are not severe even if no ɣ-strands are produced.  The biggest risk associated with the disorder is that it counteracts the tested effects of β-Thalassemia (which is an increase in A2 hemoglobin) and can lead to a misdiagnosis. Such a misdiagnosis may lead to extreme sickness and, in some cases, death.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Concerted Model ==

The Concerted Model, also known as MWC model or symmetry model, of hemoglobin is used to explain the cooperativity in oxygen binding as well as the transitions of proteins which made up of identical subunits. It focuses on the two states of the Hemoglobin; the T and R states. The T state of the hemoglobin is more tense as it is in the deoxyhemoglobin form while the R state of the hemoglobin is more relaxed as it is in the oxyhemglobin form. T state is constrained due to the subunit-subunit interactions while the R state is more flexible due to the ability of oxygen binding. The difference in deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin is that the &quot;deoxy&quot; form doesn't have Oxygen and the &quot;oxy&quot; form is highly oxygen bounded. The binding of oxygen at one site increases the binding affinity in other active sites. Thus in the concerted model of the hemoglobin, it shows that the one oxygen binding to an active site will increase the probability of other oxygen binding to the other active sites in the hemoglobin. Overall, oxygen binding shifts the equilibrium toward the R state. This means that at high oxygen levels, the R form will be prevalent and at lower oxygen levels, the T form will be prevalent. Allosteric effectors of hemoglobin, such as 2,3-BPG, function by shifting the equilibrium towards or away from the T-state, depends on whether it's an inhibitor or a promoter. This model and the sequential model displays the extreme cases of R and T transitions. In a real system, properties from both models are needed to explain the behavior of hemoglobin.

[[File:Concertedmodel..JPG |thumb|500px]]

Molecules can exist either in the T (tense) state, or R (relaxed) state. The T-state is the deoxy form of hemoglobin and the R-State is the fully oxygenated form. Equilibrium is shifted between both states. When the model has high oxygen affinity, it means that it is highly R state favored; and hemoglobin is T state favored when it has no bounded oxygen. In the concerted model, all oxygen binding sites on Hemoglobin in the T state must be filled before the molecule converts to the R state. This is also true in the conversion of the R state to the T state- all bounded oxygen must be released before a full conversion can take place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sequential Model ==

The Sequential Model of the hemoglobin explains the cooperativity involved in the binding of oxygen. This model follows the concept that after binding occurs at one site in the active site, the binding affinity in the other sites around the protein will increase as well. Hence, the plot of substrate concentration versus reaction rate is of a sigmoidal shape. Because of this cooperativity, it does not follow Michaelis-Menten Kinetics. The difference between this model and concerted model is that the T states do not have to convert to R states. In this model, the ligand will change the conformation of the subunit that it is bound to and induce changes in the neighboring subunits. The Sequential model does not require the states to be in an &quot;either T or R&quot; ultimatum. Simply, each binding site influences nearby binding sites until all of the binding sites are in the same state. Neither the sequential model or the concerted model fully explains the nature of hemoglobin. Properties from both models appear in a real system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Prosthetic group==
Prosthetic group is a tightly bound, specific non-polypeptide unit required for the biological function of some proteins. The prosthetic group may be organic (such as a vitamin, sugar, or lipid) or inorganic (such as a metal ion), but is not composed of amino acids. Prosthetic groups are bound tightly to proteins and may even be attached through a covalent bond, as opposed to coenzymes, which are loosely bound. In enzymes, prosthetic groups are often involved in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]], playing an important role in the functions of enzymes.

Vitamins are another common prosthetic group. This is one of the reasons why vitamins are required in the human diet. Inorganic prosthetic groups, however, are usually transition metal ions such as iron. The Haem group in haemoglobin is a prosthetic group located in the porphyrin, which is a tetramer of cyclic carbon groups. It contains an organic component called a protoporphyrin made up of four pyrole rings and an iron atom in the ferrous state (Fe2+). The red color of blood and muscles is attributed to the Haem groups. The difference between a prosthetic group and a cofactor depends on how tightly or loosely bound to the enzyme they are. If tightly connected, the cofactor is referred to as a prosthetic group.

==Haem group==
[[Image:Heme b.svg|thumb|200px|Haem ''b'' (Fe-protoporphyrin IX)]] 
Haem group is a prosthetic group consisting of a protoporphyrin ring and a central iron (Fe) atom. A protoporphyrin ring is made up of four pyrrole rings linked by methine bridges. Four methyl, two vinyl, and two propionate side chains are attached. 

Haem of haemoglobin protein is a prosthetic group of heterocyclic ring of porphyrin of an iron atom; the biological function of the group is for delivering oxygen to body tissues, such that bonding of ligand of gas molecules to the iron atom of the protein group changes the structure of the protein by amino acid group of histidine residue around the heme molecule.

The iron lies in the center is an orgainc component called protoporphyrin, which is bound to four pyrrole nitrogen atom linked by a methine bridge that forms a tetrapyrrole ring. The iron can either be in the ferrous (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) or the ferric (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) oxidation state. However, it is only able to bind to oxygen when in the ferrous state.  The iron can form two additional bonds in fifth and in sixth coordination which on both side of heme plane.  The fifth coordination sites is linked to a distal histidine while the sixth coordination site can, not always, bind to oxygen.  Upon binding, the Haem group will actually shrink in size and descend further into the plane of the porphyrin ring.  Along with it, the distal histidine will follow, and this histidine is attached to the alpha-Beta interface thus resulting in local to complete conformational change. 

A conjugate protein combined with its specific prosthetic group is termed a holoprotein, while a protein in its absence is called an apoprotein. Prosthetic groups have varying functions, such as oxidizing-reducing reactions (redox), methylation reactions, oxygenation reactions, and so forth.

The haem group gives muscles and blood their distinctive red color.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Lock and Key ==

In the Lock and Key Model, first presented by Emil Fisher, the lock represents an enzyme and the key represents a substrate. It is assumed that both the enzyme and substrate have fixed confirmations that lead to an easy fit. Because the enzyme and the substrate are at a close distance with weak attraction, the substrate must need a matching shape and fit to join together. At the active sites, the enzyme has a specific geometric shape and orientation that a complementary substrate fits into perfectly. The theory behind the Lock and Key model involves the complementarity between the shapes of the enzyme and the substrate. Their complementary shapes make them fit perfectly into each other like a lock and a key. According to this theory, the enzyme and substrate shape do not influence each other because they are already in a predetermined perfectly complementary shape.  As a result, the substrate will be stabilized. This theory was replaced by the induced fit model which takes into account the flexibility of enzymes and the influence the substrate has on the shape of the enzyme in order to form a good fit.

[[Image:lock and key2.jpg|thumb|Lock and Key Analogy|left]]The active site is the binding site for catalytic and inhibition reaction of the enzyme and the substrate; structure of active site and its chemical characteristic are of specificity for binding of substrate and enzyme. Three models of enzyme-substrate binding are the lock-and-key model, the induced fit model, and the transition-state model. The lock-and-key model assumes that active site of enzyme is good fit for substrate that does not require change of structure of enzyme after enzyme binds substrate.

k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;,k&lt;sub&gt;d and &lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; == 
&lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;big&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;b&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are terms helpful in the description of an [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] that follows the Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
*&lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a constant that describes the turnover rate of an enzyme-substrate complex to product and [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]]. It is also the rate of catalyst with a particular substrate.&lt;br /&gt;
'''K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''' is dissociation constant. which describe how affinite two reactants are in a reaction. The following reaction is an example to show dissociation constant:&lt;br /&gt;
                                 k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                      A + B      ↔   AB &lt;br /&gt;
                                 k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where A and B are the two reactant, AB is the formed complex, k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt; is the reverse constant rate, and k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the forward constant rate. The dissociation constant is defined as: k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;=k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;/k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The smaller the dissociation constant is, the better two reactants can combine. Since the affinity of enzyme with substrate determines how favorable the reaction can form enzyme-substrate complex, k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is often studied in Michaelis-Menten equation.&lt;br /&gt;
*&lt;b&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Michaelis constant|Michaelis constant]] that describes the amount of substrate needed for the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] to obtain half of its maximum rate of reaction. &lt;br&gt;
Deriving from Michaelis-Menten equation:
&lt;big&gt;'''k&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;=(k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;+k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/)k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/big&gt;Since K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also referred as '''Michaelis constant''', is an important constant to study the ability of catalysis reaction of enzyme with specific substrate. k&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; can be seperated into two parts:&lt;br /&gt;
a.'''k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''
The first step of catalysis kinetic is the binding between substrate and enzyme, which is also the rate determine step in the reaction. the better enzyme bind to substrate, the smaller k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;is, thus the smaller k&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is.&lt;br /&gt;
b.'''k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''
The second step of catalysis kinetic is the forming of product. The larger k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; is, the more favorable the reaction towards product, and the larger k&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is.&lt;br /&gt;
There seems to be a contradiction between k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; in the Michelis constant equation: the better enzyme to the specific substrate, the smaller k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is, and the larger k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; is. However, what determine the performance of catalysis reaction is dissociation constant k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, because the first step of the reaction--binding is the rate determine step, fomring enzyme-substrate complex is the essential step to form product, thus k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the major factor to determine k&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Together they show an [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] preference for different substrates.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; results in the rate constant that measures catalytic efficiency. This measure of efficiency is helpful in determining whether the rate is limited by the creation of product or the amount of substrate in the environment. &lt;br&gt;
In situations where &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (the rate at which substrate unbinds from the enzyme) is much greater than &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (the rate at which substrate converts to product), if the rate of efficiency is:
* HIGH, &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is much larger than &lt;b&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] complex converts a greater proportion of the substrate it binds into product. This increased conversion can be seen in one of two ways -- either substrate binds more firmly to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]], a consequence of relatively low &lt;b&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or a greater proportion of the substrate that is bound is converted before it dissociates, due to a large turnover rate &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
* LOW, &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is much smaller than &lt;b&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and the complex converts a lesser proportion of the substrate it binds into product.&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; measures the catalytic efficiency, though, only when the substrate concentration is much lower than the &lt;b&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Looking at the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]]/substrate catalytic reaction equation, 

&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;h4&gt;E+S↔ES-&gt;E+P&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
with the rate going towards ES being &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, the rate going back towards E+S being &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and the rate going towards product formation (E+P) being &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, it is evident from 


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;=[k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/(k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;)]k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;


that even if &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is much greater than &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (much product is forming) and there is great efficiency, the equation will still be limited by &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, which is the rate of ES formation. This tells us that &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; has a limit placed on efficiency in that it cannot be faster than the diffusion controlled encounter of an [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] and its substrate (k1). Therefore, [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] that have high &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ratios have essentially attained kinetic perfection because they have come very close to reaching complete efficiency only being limited by  the rate at which they encounter the substrate in solution.

In cases near the limit, there may be attractive electrostatic forces on the enzyme that entice the substrate to the active site, known as Circe effects. Diffusion in solution can be partly overcome by confining substrates and products in the limited volume of a multienzyme complex. Some series of enzymes are associated into organized assemblies so that the product of one enzyme is rapidly found by the next enzyme.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Michaelis Constant ==

==Definition==
The Michaelis Constant, '''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''' is very important in determining enzyme-substrate interaction. This value of enzyme range widely and often dependent on environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength. 
The '''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''' is able to detect two factors: One is the concentration of substrate when the reaction velocity is half that of the maximal velocity; thus, the Michaelis constant measures the concentration of substrate required for a significant catalysis to take place. Secondly, it is, in some cases, able to detect the strength of the enzyme-substrate complex (ES). When, and only when k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;&lt; k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;, High '''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''' indicates weak binding and low '''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''' indicates strong binding. Under this special circumstance, K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the dissociation constant. Only then can the K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; be used as a measurement of the strength of the ES complex. 

There are cases where changes in the Michaelis constant are observed as is the case with inhibitors such as competitive, uncompetitive and noncompetitive inhibitors. In competitive inhibitors, the Michaelis constant increases because more active sites must be filled (either with competitive inhibitor or with substrate) to elicit the same Vmax. In uncompetitive inhibitors, the Michaelis constant decreases because the inhibitor only binds to the substrate-enzyme complex, creating an ESI complex. This drives the equilibrium reaction forward from E + S --&gt; ES, where more inhibitor can bind. The Michaelis constant decreases more with the addition of inhibitors. In noncompetitive inhibition, the Michaelis constant remains the same.

==Determining '''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'''==

The equation for the Michaelis Constant is ''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;= (k&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt; + k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/k'' 
sometimes it can be seen as ''[ES] = [E][S]/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''

From a graph one can determine the value of '''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'''. A graph with the reaction rate (V) on the Y axis plotted against the substrate concentration on the X axis allows one to find the value of  '''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  '''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''' is found at the substrate concentration when the reaction rate is half of its maximum value (V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/2). Note that if K2 &lt;&lt; k-1, then Km is equal to Kes, the rate constant for the disassociation of the enzyme-substrate complex.

The values of K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; also give the fraction of active site filled (f&lt;sub&gt;ES&lt;/sub&gt;). 

                                            f&lt;sub&gt;ES&lt;/sub&gt; = V / V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 + [S] / K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;

==Biological Examples==
For many enzyme experimental evidence suggest that K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;  provide approximately substrate concentration in vivo. Physiological consequences of K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is exemplified in individuals sensitive to ethanol. 
:
Normally in the liver, alcohol dehydrogenase converts ethanol into acetaldehyde. Acetaladehyde dehydrogenase, for example, has a low K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; mitochondrial form and a high K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; cytoplasmic form. In individuals sensitive to ethanol, the mitochondrial enzyme is less active due to substitution of a single amino acid and acetaldehyde is only processed by the cytoplasmic enzyme. Since cytoplasmic enzyme has high K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, it can only achieve high catalysis at very high acetaldehyde concentrations. Consequently, less acetaldehyde is converted, and the excess escapes into the blood and causes symptoms such as facial flushing and rapid heart rate in sensitive persons.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== AHSP Prevents Excess Free Alpha-globin Chains ==

Because alpha chains are coded for by four loci, compared to the two that code for beta chains, excess alpha chains are produced and must be stabilized in order to keep them in solution and prevent them from precipitating out. This is achieved by the production of an alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein (i.e.-AHSP).  This protein binds to the alpha chains in the same manner that the beta chains do and creates a soluble complex. It binds to the alpha hemoglobin as it’s produced and is then displaced by the beta hemoglobin produced which forms a more favorable and stable dimer.  This way there is no excess alpha hemoglobin which would accumulate and precipitate out of solution.


== AHSP Assists in Tetramer Assembly ==


AHSP is important not only for dealing with newly synthesized excess α-globin, but also in the assembly of normal Hb tetramers. Studies now show that mice infected with mild α-Thalassemia, a condition which causes a deficit of α-globin and an excess of β-globin, still utilize AHSP. No AHSP was expected to be needed by these mice because there was no risk of excess α-globin accumulating and precipitating out, however, when the mice with no AHSP and α-Thalassemia were compared to both normal mice, and mice with α-Thalassemia and intact AHSP, they were far more anemic, showing AHSP has other roles besides stabilizing excess α-globin. 


== Other Functions of AHSP ==


Besides being an important molecular chaperone in Hb assembly, AHSP may also provide an additional selective advantage to red cells under conditions of oxidative stress induced by drugs, because of its effects on preventing α-globin denaturation and promoting renaturation. AHSP may also be useful to red cells in iron deficiency in which heme availability is limited and apo-α-globin levels are increased and help stabilize red blood cells in the presence of environmental factors that alter Hb’s critical equilibrium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Enzymes are proteins (some may be catalytic RNA) that act as catalysts in chemical reactions.  They function via a variety of mechanisms, but all increase the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy of the reaction.  Some characteristics of enzymes are as follows:


#Enzymes are highly specific for a particular substrate.  The active site of an enzyme has a strong affinity for a specific substrate, and will slightly change its conformation, known as an &quot;induced fit&quot; to accommodate the target substrate.  This induced fit allows for a stabilized transition state, which lowers the activation energy of the reaction.
#Enzymes remain unchanged during the reaction itself.  While the enzyme's amino acid residues may break or form covalent bonds with the substrate, it will typically reform those bonds, enabling the enzyme to react with more substrates.
#Enzymes are very efficient, catalyzing about 1-10,000 molecules of substrate per second.  Therefore, only a small number of enzymes are typically created under normal cellular conditions.
#Enzymes do not affect the equilibrium constant, or K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;.  While the rate of conversion from substrate to product is increased, the vice versa is true.
#Enzymes can be allosterically controlled by a variety of means.  There are cofactors and coenzymes that are necessary for enzymatic catalysis.  Furthermore, there are also molecules that can allosterically inhibit protein function by modifying the conformational shape of the enzyme.

2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is a three-carbon molecule with two negatively charged (2-) phosphate groups attached to the central carbon, forming a tetrahedral structure. This highly anionic molecule is most commonly found in the red blood cells at about the same concentration as that of hemoglobin (around 2 mM); this is responsible for the great efficiency of oxygen transport that takes place in hemoglobin molecules. 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, abbreviated as 2,3-BPG and also referred to as 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), binds with greater affinity to deoxygenated hemoglobin typically found in tissues than to oxygenated hemoglobin found in the lungs. Pure hemoglobin releases only 8% of oxygen to the tissues, however hemoglobin with 2,3-BPG allows it to release 66% of the oxygen to the tissues. It is for this reason that hemoglobin, and not myoglobin, is more used in transferring oxygen between tissues and the lungs. There are high concentrations of 2,3-BPG found in erythrocytes

== Glucose Metabolism ==

2,3-biphosphoglycerate is the product of glucose metabolism. It is formed from 1,3-BPG by the enzyme bisphosphoglycerate mutase. It can form 3-phosphoglycerate from when it is broken down by phosphotase. This synthesis and disassembling takes several steps.

== Properties ==

2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is mostly found in human red blood cells, or erythrocytes. It has a less oxygen binding affinity to oxygenated hemoglobin than it does to deoxygenated hemoglobin. It also acts to stabilize the oxygen affinity of the hemoglobin in the tense state, since the oxygen affinity is low. This is due to the position of the 2,3-BPG molecule in the central cavity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer, where the 2,3-BPG interacts with the positively charged molecules on each beta chain within the deoxyhemoglobin. As a result, the conformation of the deoxyhemoglobin is altered in such a way that a greater number or concentration of oxygen molecules is needed to bind to the free sites in the deoxyhemoglobin, thereby giving hemoglobin a lower affinity T state until addition of more oxygen. This effect makes it difficult for oxygen to bind to the hemoglobin which allows it be released to areas with low oxygen concentration.  This is why hemoglobin is such an effective oxygen carrier. It is able to saturate itself with oxygen at high oxygen level in the lungs and retain the oxygen until it reaches the tissues which has a lower oxygen concentration. However, this does not occur in the relaxed (R) state since the hemoglobin is oxygenated. Thus, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate helps in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Regulation|regulation]] of the oxygen carrying capacity in hemoglobin. The R state conformation of deoxyhemoglobin does not allow for these interactions due to the oxygen bound to the heme group. During the T state to R state transition, the 2,3-bisphophoglycerate is released. It's vital to oxygen transfer, since the T state must be stabilized until the transition point.  However, the T state is very unstable resulting for hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and thus tries to bind to oxygen, disrupting the T state.  Without 2,3-BCG, this stabilization cannot occur thanks to its inhibition abilities.

2,3-BPG can also function as an intermediate of phoshoglycerate mutase. The enzyme is used in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of glycolysis in erythrocytes. The pathway is the anaerobic metabolic pathway that converts glycogen to lactic acid in human muscle.

The effect of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is shown between the fetal red cells and the maternal red cells. The maternal red cells are able to bind 2,3 biosphosglycerate better than the fetal red cells. Therefore the fetal red cells have a higher oxygen affinity which explains why oxygen flows from oxyhemoglobin to the fetal deoxyhemoglobin. Since the fetal red cells contain a higher oxygen affinity, it allows oxygen to be carried to the placenta.  Soon after birth, humans have regular hemoglobin. One of the reasons that fetal cells contain a higher affinity for oxygen is because fetal hemoglobin do not contain a beta subunit, but instead a gamma subunit.  Therefore the pocket that binds BPG differs which lowers the affinity for BPG while inducing higher oxygen binding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Double Reciprocal Plot==

The double-reciprocal equation is obtained by taking the reciprocal of both sides of the Michaelis-Menten equation. The double-reciprocal (also known as the Lineweaver-Burk) plot is created by plotting the inverse initial velocity (1/V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) as a function of the inverse of the substrate concentration (1/[S]). The V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; can be accurately determined and thus K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; can also be determined with accuracy because a straight line is formed. The slope of the resulting line is K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, the y-intercept is 1/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, and the x-intercept is -1/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;. Using the Michaelis-Menten equation, the V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is an asymptote and can thus only be approximated and as a result, the K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, which is V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/2, can't be determined accurately. This plot is a useful way to determined different inhibitors such as competitive, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive.
[[File:Reciprocal.png|thumb|Double Reciprocal Equation]]

[[File:Competitive diagram.png|thumb|left|Competitive Inhibitor Diagram]]

For competitive inhibitors, the inhibitor competes with the substrate molecule to bind to the binding site. Consequently, the K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; will increase without changing the V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; value. This means that the two graphs will have the same y-intercept as shown below. However the new x-intercept may be quite elusive. For this type of inhibitors, a higher concentration of the substrate is needed to get half of the active sites occupied. Therefore K&lt;sub&gt;M2&lt;/sub&gt; will be larger than K&lt;sub&gt;M1&lt;/sub&gt;. This translates to a higher a higher reciprocal value of K&lt;sub&gt;M1&lt;/sub&gt; than that of K&lt;sub&gt;M2&lt;/sub&gt;. However the x-intercept has the negative sign in front of it, thus on the graph it has to move to the right relative to the previous intercept. To show this on the double reciprocal plot, the slope will increase to show the strength of the binding competitive inhibitor. While the slope increases with the presence of the inhibitor, the y-intercept remains the same in presence and absence of the inhibitor. 
[[File:Competitive competition.png|thumb|Competitive Inhibition]]

[[File:Uncompetitive diagram.png|thumb|left|Uncompetitive Inhibitor Diagram]]
For uncompetitive inhibitors, the inhibitor will only bind to an enzyme-substrate complex; therefore, it does not compete with the substrate for the binding site. Consequently, both K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values decrease. Consequentially, the reciprocal value of the new V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; should be at a higher position on the axis, as a fraction becomes larger when the denominator gets smaller. The new reciprocal value of K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; will move to the left and the explanation should be similar to that of competitive inhibitor. To show this on a double reciprocal plot, the slope will remain the same as if the enzyme was not bound to the inhibitor, but the x-axis intercept will decrease. The double reciprocal plot for enzyme with and without uncompetitive inhibitor will be two parallel lines. 
[[File:Uncompetitive Inhibition.png|thumb|Uncompetitive Inhibition]]


[[File:Noncompetitive diagram.png|thumb|left|Noncompetitive Inhibitor Diagram]]
For noncompetitive inhibitors, the inhibitor can bind to the enzyme before the substrate can bind to the binding site. It does not have to wait for the enzyme to become an enzyme-substrate complex in order to bind to the enzyme. The inhibition will cause a decrease in V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; value while the K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is unaffected. This means the value of -1/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; remains the same for the two lines, while the new value of 1/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is higher relative to the previous one. To show this on a double reciprocal plot, the decrease in V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; will increase the y-intercept with a larger slope.

[[File:Noncompetitive.png|thumb|Noncompetitive Inhibition]]


The black lines represent the reciprocal of velocity when no inhibitor is present and the blue lines correspond to the presence of inhibitors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Penicillin is an antibiotic agent that was earliest discovered and used widely. This antibiotic agent was derived from the Penicillium mold. Since antibiotics released by fungi and bacteria act as a natural substances that inhibits other organisms, it is then a chemical warfare on a microscopic scale.  Penicillian is used to treat variety of infections and micro-organism. 

==History==
[[File:Alexander Fleming.jpg|thumb|Alexander Fleming]]
Penicillin was first noticed in 1896 by Ernest Duchesne, a French medical student. Then in 1928, it was re-discovered by Alexander Fleming, a bacteriologist, who worked the London's St. Mary's Hospital. During Fleming's work at the hospital, he noticed a Staphylococcus plate culture that was contaminated by a blue-green mold. At the same time, the colonies of bacteria that were next to the mold were dissolved. With much curiosity, Fleming began to grow the mold in a pure culture; as a result, he found that it formed a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. From the observations and experiments, Fleming named the substance penicillin, and Fleming published the results in 1929.

In 1938, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and Norman Heatley continued the research of penicillin at Oxford University. During that period of time, the three scientists and their staff developed methods for growing, extracting, and purifying penicillin to prove its value as a drug.

Then during the World War II (1939 - 1945) period, penicillin became very useful. In 1941, the research and production of penicillin moved to the United States. It was to protect the progress and production of penicillin from bombings in England. More and more work began on the growing of mold to make penicillin in large quantities for thousands of soldiers. When the amount of people dying began to grow, the interest in penicillin also grew in laboratories, universities, and drug companies. Scientist at that time knew that they were in a race against death, and since this infection was able to kill a wounded soldier through a small wound.

== Penicillin as an Inhibitor ==
'''Penicillin kills bacteria by interfering with the ability to synthesize cell wall. The bacteria lengthen, but cannot divide. Eventually the weak cell wall ruptures.'''

Penicillin irreversibly blocks bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibiting the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links. Penicillin covalently binds to the enzyme transpeptidase that links the peptidoglycan molecules in bacteria, it inhibits the molecule so that it cannot react any further and cell wall cannot be further synthesized.  The cell wall of the bacterium is weakened even further because the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers bacterial cell wall hydrolysis and autolysins, and destroys pre-existing peptidoglycan. Penicillin makes a great inhibitor because of its four membered beta lactam ring, which makes it especially reactive. Penicillin acts as a suicide inhibitor by binding with the transpeptidase enzyme it inactivates itself. 

Gram positive bacteria are the most sensitive and susceptible to penicillin because Gram positive bacteria only have murein (peptidoglycan) layer. Gram negative bacteria are usually more resistant to penicillin because they have multiple membrane layers, which allows them to still retain a cell wall even though they have lost their murein layer to penicillin. Penicillin can be used to treat Gram positive bacteria such as ''streptococcus pneumoniae'', ''staphylococcus aureus'', ''enterococcus'', ''clostridium tetani'', and ''listeria monocytogenes''. Penicillin cannot be used to treat gram negative bacteria such as ''neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, pseudomonas, legionella, escherichia coli'', ''helicobacter pylori'' (stomach ucler), ''borrelia burgdorfeli'' (lyme disease), ''treponema pallidium'' (syphilus), and ''chlamydia trachomatis''. 
''
[[Image:penicillin2.jpg]] [[Image:penicillin1.jpg]]

Some bacteria have developed resistance to beta-lactams. These bacteria contain beta-lactamases, a broad class of enzymes with a serine residue that cleaves the reactive beta lactam ring through an [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Catalytic Triad|acyl-enzyme intermediate]]. Augmentin, a drug that contains both a beta-lactam (typically amoxicillin) and clavulanic acid (a beta-lactamase inhibitor), is often prescribed to overcome drug resistant strains. Clavulanic acid works by competitive inhibition.

==Types of penicillin==

===Benzylpenicillin===
[[Image:Penicilling.png|thumb|Benzylpenicillin]]&lt;br&gt;
Benzylpenicillin, commonly known as penicillin G, is known as the gold standard penicillin. It is given by a method of non-oral administration (parentally) because it is unstable in the hydrochloric acid of the stomach. Because the drug is given parenterally, tissue concentrations of penicillin G can be achieved in larger levels than is possible with other types of penicillin, like phenoxymethylpenicillin. These higher concentrations become increased antibacterial levels or activities.

Uses for benzylpenicillin include:

*Cellulitis 
*Bacterial endocarditis 
*Gonorrhea 
*Meningitis 
*aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess 
*Community-acquired pneumonia 
*Syphilis 
*Septicemia in children

===Phenoxymethylpenicillin/penicillin V===

Phenoxymethylpenicillin is the orally active form of penicillin. It is less frequently used than benzylpenicillin, and is mostly used in conditions when high tissue is not required. However, it is the first choice when it comes to treating odontogenic (relating to the teeth) infections.

===Procaine===

Procaine benzylpenicillin (rINN), also known as procaine penicillin, is a combination of benzylpenicillin with the local anaesthetic agent procaine. It is absorbed into the circulation by means of deep intramuscular injection. It is used when prolonged low concentrations of benzylpenicilin are needed, and mostly used in veterinary environments as well as dental offices.
The common trade name for procaine is Novocain which is typically administered to patients at the dentist office before undergoing minor surgery.  It is metabolized in the blood plasma by an enzyme called pseudocholinesterase.  Procaine replaced cocaine as a local anesthetic due to the severe side effects caused by cocaine.

===Benzathine===
Benzathine benzylpenicillin (rINN), also known as benzathine penicillin, is absorbed into the circulation slowly by intramuscular injection like procaine penicillin, but then it is hydrolysed to benzylpenicillin in vivo. It is the number one drug choice when prolonged low concentrations are required and appropriate. It allows for antibiotic action to be prolonged over two to four weeks following just one dose.

Other examples of penicillin include amoxcillin, ampicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and temocillin. Amoxcillin and ampicillin are the most common penicillins that are prescribed by doctors because they are used to treat common infections such as throat infections. 

==Side effects==

Just like any other drug on the market, penicillin may cause unpleasant side effects for patients taking it.  Some of the side effects are commonly found on patients using penicillin are: diarrhea, hypersensitivity, nausea, rash, neurotoxicity urticaria, seizures. Pain and inflammation at the injection site is also common for the partenterally administered penicillin types. 
3% to 10% of the population is allergic to penicillin.  Usually when allergic to one type of penicillin, you are allergic to the entire family of penicillin antibiotics.  The problems mentioned about diarrhea and nausea tend to go away for most patients after a few doses of the drug.  If further symptoms occur, however, the drug should not be taken anymore.  Physicians say that any drug that interferes with cellular growth, in this case the cell wall can have severe side effects on a large population of patients.
The most common side effects caused by penicillin are:
# diarrhea that is watery or bloody
# fever, chills, body aches, flu symptoms
# easy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness
# urinating less than usual or not at all
# severe skin rash, itching, or peeling
# agitation, confusion, unusual thoughts or behavior
# seizure (black-out or convulsions)
# nausea, vomiting, stomach pain
# vaginal itching or discharge
# headache
# swollen, black, or &quot;hairy&quot; tongue
# thrush (white patches or inside your mouth or throat)

==Penicillin allergy==
Penicillin and related antibiotics can cause an allergic reaction in some people. Although, not all adverse reactions to penicillin are a sign of an allergic reaction. True allergic reactions involve the immune system and can cause signs and symptoms that range from an annoying rash to a life-threatening reaction or anaphylaxis with low blood pressure and trouble breathing. β-lactam antibiotic can end up causing allergic reactions to about 10% of the patients. However, even though penicillin are very commonly reported in allergy cases, but less than 20% of those reports are truly allergic. But it is definitely a drug that can cause major, severe reactions. 

It isn't clear why some people develop penicillin allergy while others don't. Treating an allergic reaction may require taking medications or emergency care in serious cases.

==Penicillin Resistance==
Penicillin has been a widely used antibiotic for years.  Although there has been evidence of new bacterium evolving to become resistant the penicillin.  Penicillin is used to stop the bacteria from building their cell walls called peptidoglycan.  The penicillin resistant bacterium have been shown to be creating dipeptide bridges in their peptidoglycan.  Researchers have found that bacteria that form dipeptide bonds in their peptidoglycan use a protein called MurM which helps in building dipeptide bridges within the peptidoglycan.  Researchers are trying to use the information to begin targeting MurM to help bring penicillin back to the forefront of antibiotics.  Also to note is that when patients that are taken penicillin to treat bacteria that it is necessary to take penicillin for the full duration of the required time because although the penicillin may kill most of the bacteria if not taken for the full duration can allow for a few bacterium to live, the most fit for survival to live and repopulate in the patient therefore creating a more penicillin resistant bacteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Catalytic Triad.jpg|thumb|frame|right|''Catalytic Triad in the Chymotrypsin'']]A '''''catalytic triad''''' is a group of three amino acids that are found in the active sites of some [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases|proteases]] involved in catalysis. &lt;br&gt; Three different proteases that have catalytic triads are: chymotrypsin, trypsin and elastase. In chymotrypsin, the catalytic triad is made from ''serine 195, histidine 57, and aspartate 102''.  The side chain of serine is bonded to the imidazole ring of the histidine residue which accepts a proton from serine to form a strong alkoxide nucleophile in the presence of a substrate for attack.  The aspartate residue orients histidine to make it a better proton acceptor via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic reactions.

The active site of chymotrypsin is marked by serine 195. Serine lies in a small pocket on the surface
of the enzyme. Serine is bonded to histidine 57 which is then bound to aspartate 102. All three of these
residues are hydrogen bonded at this pocket. These three residues participate in concerted
mechanisms that allows chymotrypsin and other proteases to be activated by incoming substrates. This is called
the catalytic triad. 

We know that serine is the final reactive site but serine actually depends on the
histidine and asparate residue to make it a good nucleophile. The histidine residue forces serine into a position
that facilitates nucleophilic attack later on through the process of catalysis by approximation. In the presence of a substrate, a chain
reaction occurs. First since asparate is acidic, it will be deprotonated first by bases. Aspartate that flanks
the histidine residue also provides it with favorable electrostatic effects and makes it a better proton acceptor. So after asparate is deprotonated,
proton transfer from histidine goes to aspartate. Now that histidine is deprotonated, it grabs the proton from
serine's hydroxyl group. This creates a much more reactive alkoxide group on serine. 

Now that the serine is activated we can proceed onto peptide hydrolysis. The alkoxide
can attack an incoming substrate to form a tetrahedral intermediate. In this stage we form a resonating oxyanion hole 
which is a common motif in these kind of reactions. The oxyanion hole stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate by distributing the negative charge around.
Next comes the acyl-enzyme and eventually we see the release of the
amine component and water binding. 

The catalytic triad actually reveals a deep hydrophobic pocket where serine is sticking out in the center. This pocket positions incoming side chains of 
a substrate. There is a lot of specificty involved as chymotrypsin has a specific pocket with serine while other enzymes
such as trypsin and elastase have different composition of pockets. Therefore we can now know that
chymotrypsin likes large aromatic or long, nonpolar side chain.

Catalytic triads also exist in trypsin and elastase. Instead of serine, in trypsin, the center amino acid at the pocket
is aspartate. Therefore, its pocket is specific to positively charged species of side chains. Elastase has a pocket that contains
two residues of valine, which makes it very hard for big bulky side chains to enter the pocket; therefore, it favors small
side chains. Trypsin and elastase are obviously homologs of chymotrypsin. They have 40% similarity in composition and have similar structures.

'''Site-Directed Mutagenesis helps us understand the Catalytic Triad'''

	Site-directed mutagenesis can be used to test the involvement of individual amino acid residues to the catalytic influence of a protease.  Each of the triad’s residues has been converted to alanine.  The cleaving ability of each mutant enzyme is examined.  The conversion of active-site serine 221, aspartate 32, and histidine 64 into alanine reduces catalytic power.  These results strongly support the fact that the catalytic triad, especially the serine-histodine pair, act together to generate a nucleophile that attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of a peptide bond.  
Site-directed mutagenesis can also tell us the importance of the oxyanion hole for catalysis.  The mutation of asparagine 155 to glycine removes the side chain NH group reduced by the oxyanion hole.  This shows that the NH group of asparagine residue helps to stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate and the following transition state.

[[Image:The S1 pocket.jpg|70px|thumb|frame|right|''The S1 pockets of the chymotrypsin, trypsin, and elastate.'']]The '''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; pocket''' helps to explain why ''chymotrypsin, trypsin, and elastase'' cleave certain peptide binds.  The S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; pocket is a deep hydrophobic pocket that allows long, uncharged amino acids like phenylalanine and tryptophan to fit in chymotrypsin.  Binding in the''' S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; pocket''' positions the adjacent peptide bond at the active site for cleavage.  Trypsin cleaves peptide bonds after arginine and lysine which are amino acids with long and positively charged side chains because its '''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; pocket''' contains an aspartate that is negatively charged which attracts and stabilizes the positively charged side chains of arginine and lysine in the substrate.  Elastase cleaves peptide bonds after amino acids like alanine and serine which have small side chains because its '''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; pocket''' has two bulky valine residues that decreases the size of the pocket opening so only small chains can enter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cofactor: A Definition ==

Many enzymes require an additional small molecule, known as a [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Cofactors|cofactor]] to aid with catalytic activity. A cofactor is a non-protein molecule that carries out chemical reactions that cannot be performed by the standard 20 amino acids. Cofactors can be either inorganic molecules (metals) or small organic molecules (coenzymes). 

Cofactors, mostly metal ions or coenzyme, are inorganic and organic chemicals that function in reactions of enzymes. Coenzymes are organic molecules that are nonproteins and mostly derivatives of vitamins soluble in water by phosphorylation; they binds apoenzyme protein molecule to produce active holoenzyme.

[[Image:Cofactor Flow Chart.JPG]] Figure 1-1: A flow chart of the two types of cofactors.

'''Apoenzyme'''- An enzyme that requires a cofactor but does not have one bound. An apoenzyme is an inactive enzyme, activation of the enzyme occurs upon binding of an organic or inorganic cofactor.

'''Holoenzyme'''- An apoenzyme together with its cofactor. A holoenzyme is complete and catalytically active. Most cofactors  are not covalently bound but instead are tightly bound. However, organic [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Prosthetic Group|prosthetic groups]] such as an iron ion or a vitamin can be covalently bound. Examples of holoenzymes include DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which contain multiple protein subunits. The complete complexes contain all the subunits necessary for activity. 

[[Image:Enzymes.JPG]] Figure 1-2: Illustrates that an ''Apoenzyme + Cofactor = Holoenzyme.''

== Examples of Holoenzymes ==
 
'''DNA polymerase''' is a holoenzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of deoxyribonucleotides into a DNA strand. DNA polymerase is an active participant in DNA replication. It reads the intact DNA strand as a template and uses it to synthesize the new strand. The newly polymerized DNA strand is complementary to the template strand and identical to template's original partner strand. DNA polymerase uses a magnesium ion for catalytic activity. 

[[Image:DNA Polymerase.JPG]] Figure 1-3: Illustrates the holoenzyme DNA polymerase a multi-subunit complex.

'''RNA polymerase''' is also a holoenzyme that catalyzes RNA. RNA polymerase is needed for constructing RNA chains from DNA genes as templates, a process known as transcription. It polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Enzyme Rates and Constants ==
'''Enzyme Thermodynamics'''

For enzyme thermodynamic, the most important constant is probably ∆G.  ∆G is the free-energy difference between products and reactants, also known as the amount of energy required to convert reactants to products.  More importantly, it can tell whether a reaction will occur spontaneously, which are what enzymes are concerned with.

If ∆G is negative then the reaction will occur spontaneously (''exergonic'').
If ∆G is zero, the system is at equilibrium and no net change can take place.
If ∆G is positive, energy is required for the reaction to occur (''endergonic'').

A thermodynamic explanation of this starts with the definition of Gibbs free energy, which says

&lt;big&gt;'''''∆G = ∆H - T∆S'''''&lt;/big&gt;,

where ''∆H'' is the change in enthalpy (joules) and ''∆S'' is the change in entropy (joules/Kelvin). As we can see, if the energy due to entropy (disorder of a system) exceeds the enthalpy (thermodynamic potential of a system), the Gibbs free energy will be negative and thus no energy is needed for the reaction to occur. 

'''Enzyme Kinetics'''

----

Enzyme Kinetics contain a few more constants and rates; starting with V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, this is the maximal rate when all the catalytic sites on the enzyme are saturated (bounded) with substrates. Another constant is K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the substrate concentration when it is half the V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  Their relationship to each other can be seen through the Michaelis-Menten equation.  

Enzyme Kinetics is measuring rate of enzyme reaction. One way to measure of rate of reation is by using spectroscopy change, absorb light at different wavelength. Another way to study enzyme kinetics is through the graph that has substrate concentration (x-axis) vs. reaction velocity (initial velocity). km(michaelis constant) is substrate concentration at which our enzyme reacts half of maximum velocity. 

V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;([S]/([S]+ K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;))

where [S] is the substrate concentration and V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Initial rate|initial rate]] of the reaction (t=0). Finally, there is the rate of k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; which measures the catalytic efficiency. k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; is the turnover number of an enzyme, which is the number of substrate bounded to an enzyme in a unit of time when the enzyme is fully bounded.  Given this, the higher the k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; rate is, the more efficient it is at binding substrates.

==1. Have and review the Basic Sewing Honor. ==
{{Ay prerequisite|Household Arts|Basic Sewing}}

==2. Have a practical sewing box for your sewing supplies. Include in it a pin cushion, tape measure, pins, needles, thread, scissors, seam gauge and seam ripper.==
These are all items you can buy in a department store or even in a thrift shop.  It is also possible that you have an older relative who no longer sews and would ''love'' to give your some sewing supplies, especially if you show a real interest in learning the craft.  Don't feel as though you need to buy everything on the list right away.  You can spread out your acquisitions over time as you hunt for bargains.

==3. Know how and when to: baste, overcast, zigzag, and blind hem. ==
===Basting===
[[Image:Basting (PSF).png|right|250px]]
In sewing, to baste or tack is to make quick, temporary stitching intended to be removed.  Tacking is used in a variety of ways:

* To temporarily hold a seam or trim in place until it can be permanently sewn, usually with a long running stitch made by hand or machine called a ''tacking stitch'' or ''basting stitch''.

* To temporarily attach a lace collar, ruffles, or other trim to clothing so that the attached article may be removed easily for cleaning or to be worn with a different garment.  For this purpose, tacking stitches are sewn by hand in such a way that they are almost invisible from the outside of the garment.

* To transfer pattern markings to fabric, or to otherwise mark the point where two pieces of fabric are to be joined.  A special loose looped stitch used for this purpose is called a ''tack'' or ''tailor's tack''.

* A basting stitch is essentially a straight stitch, sewn with long stitches and unfinished ends.  The basting stitch is used for temporarily holding sandwiched pieces of fabric in place.  The stitch is removed after the piece is finished.  Often used in quilting or embroidery.

===Overcast===
An overcast stitch is made at the edge of a piece of fabric to prevent it from unraveling.  It is made by passing the needle through the top of the fabric near the edge, and then pulling the thread over the edge and passing it through the top again.  The thread makes a spiral around the edge of the fabric, much as a spiral notebook is bound by a wire.

===Zigzag===
In sewing, a zigzag stitch is a machine stitch in a zigzag pattern. Tightly spaced zigzag stitches are used to emulate embroidery stitches such as satin stitch, and to reinforce buttonholes. A zigzag stitch is also used as a non-structural seam, to temporarily hold two panels together edge-to-edge (and eliminate the ridge that would &quot;x-ray&quot; through). This is done when another panel will overlay the seam and provide support.

===Blind Hem===
A blind hem is a stitch that is nearly invisible on the finished side of the fabric.  It can be used for hemming a garment, drapes, or curtains.  If done by machine, the sewing machine must have a blind stitch as well as a specialized presser foot made for this purpose.

In the machine stitch, three running stitches are alternated with one zigzag stitch.  The running stitch is made in the seam, and the zigzag goes out to the edge of the hem picking up only one or two threads of the weave.

When hand-stitching a blind hem, the principle of picking up only one or two threads still applies, but only on the front side of the fabric.  On the wrong side, the stitches will be somewhat long and could be quite visible.

==4. Identify (a) 5 natural fabrics such as cotton, linen, wool, silk and etc. and (b) synthetic fabrics such as rayon, nylon, dacron and polyester. ==
One way to meet this requirement is to visit a fabric store. Find examples of each of these types of fabric (fabric type will be labeled at the top of the roll).  Examine them closely, and ''touch'' them.  

If you are teaching this class bring in a few swatches of each type of fabric.  Label each, and pass them around to your Pathfinders, telling them about each one.  Tell them to closely examine and feel each sample.

==5. Show and demonstrate how to straighten fabric before use. ==
Sometimes new fabric sports unfortunate creases across the bias.  Any such creases should most definitely be removed with an iron before a pattern is cut from the fabric.  This is because the crease will alter the lay of the fabric and distort the pattern.  This distortion will be transferred to the garment.

Once all the creases have been removed, lay the cloth on a working surface large enough to accommodate the piece you wish to cut from it.  Spread it out flat, and make sure no sewing tools have found their way beneath the fabric.  Once this has been done, you are ready to lay the pattern on the material and pin it down.  

At this point, you have a choice of either transferring the pattern to the material with tracing paper, or simply cutting the fabric as per the pattern.

If using a graded pattern, you should not cut out the pattern following the cut lines for any but the largest pattern. 
If you would like to make one of the smaller sizes provided by the pattern, you can either fold the pattern along the proper cut lines, or trace them with tracing paper and a tracing wheel.

==6. Choose a pattern for an item such as a shirt, blouse, skirt or shop apron. Properly lay your pattern on the material, cut it out, and sew your item to completion. ==
Read the instructions that came with the pattern before beginning the project.  If you do not understand all the steps, keep reading.  Study them until you do understand.  Sometime enlightenment is difficult to achieve until you have actually followed the previous instructions and have cloth in hand and are ready to execute the step itself.  Don't give up before you start!

The outside of the pattern's package will tell you how much and what types of material you will need to make the item.  Read this carefully.

The next step is to lay out the cloth and cut out the pieces (see requirement 5).  The pattern will also tell you how to lay the pieces on the cloth to minimize the amount of cloth you need for the item.  

Once the pieces are cut out, follow the instructions in the pattern.  Once you have made a seam, take it to the ironing board and press it, but see if the pattern tells you whether you need to press the seam open, to the back, or to the front.  Hems are easier to sew if you press them first.

If you do not wish to make a shirt, blouse, skirt, or shop apron, perhaps you would enjoy making Bible costumes.  If your whole club (or unit) is working on this honor together, you will have the opportunity to outfit an entire troop for a VBS program or a [[../../Outreach/Christian Drama|Christian Drama]] program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An enzymatic cascade is a sequence of successive activation reactions involving enzymes, which is characterized by a series of amplifications stemming from an initial stimulus. The product of each preceding reaction catalyzes and is consumed in the next reaction. An example of an enzymatic cascade includes blood clotting, where a timely response is needed. The cascade first activates a clotting factor, followed by the activation of the next clotting factor and so forth until the final cross-linked fibrin clot is formed.

Another example of enzymatic cascade occurs following the binding of allergen to a receptor bound Ig on the mast cell.  Spleen tyrosine kinases (Syk) plays an important role in this immunoglobulin E (IgE) signaling pathway. Using knowledge of the cascade and the role Syk plays, Syk inhibitors have been developed to inhibit IgE- driven mast cell degranulation, as well as to inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines, thereby inhibiting an allergic response.
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19440557?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;ordinalpos=2]

Enzymatic cascades can also play roles in the immune system.  Complement cascade works with the body’s innate immunity by cleaning pathogens from an organism. It proceeds though three major pathways; classical (CP), alternative (AP) and mannose-binding-lectin (MP). The end product results in large scale amplification of cell killing membrane attack complex. 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system]

== Blood Clotting ==

Blood coagulation is an example of this; each enzyme activates the next until a fibrin clot is formed.  There are two pathways by which the clotting can proceed: intrinsically or extrinsically. Intrinsic clotting is activated by the exposure of anionic surfaces of blood vessels that is damaged by the trauma, while extrinsic clotting is initiated by the exposure of tissue factors (TF). Tissue factors are integral glycoprotein.

[[Image:Blood clotting.jpg]]
Inactive forms of clotting factors =pink
Activated forms = yellow 
Stimulatory proteins (not enzymes) = blue

The final portion of the pathway is the same for both intrinsic and extrinsic cascades, in which factor X is activated. Once the Prothrombin is activated and catalyzed into thrombin, it catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinopeptides at the central globular region, the globular domains at the carboxyl-terminal ends of the beta and delta chains interact with the exposed regions of the chains at the amino terminal.  This cross linking reaction forms fibrin clots.  It should be noted that thrombin is also involved in the activation of enzymes in previous steps, such as factors VII and VIII, providing a positive feedback loop on the cascade. This fibrin clotting process must be fast acting and precisely regulated, it can only act on damaged tissues. Fibrin can't be flowing in the blood vessels to cause blood clots. This precise regulation is owe to the fact that cloting factors are short-lived and diluted in blood vessels. They are quickly removed by the liver.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opening Remarks:==

Why is effective change management important in schools that wish to integrate distance learning into their curriculums?  Because given the many significant benefits offered by distance learning, distance learning programs are still not as widely adopted these days as they should be, nor have this technology been used to its full potential.  Distance Learning programs have been greeted with resistance from K-12 schools, universities, and the professional community because the distance learning model is being viewed by most as a change to the traditional teaching methods.  In order for distance learning to become successful initiatives in K-12 schools, the technology coordinator needs to understand the various aspects of change management as well as exercising strong leadership.

Based on Sociological observations, the acceptance of change depends on several factors:
1) The extent to which it is consistent with existing ideas and social patterns
2) The balance between the benefits and costs of change, including a generalized fear of the unknown
3) The strength of resistance by those with a vested interest in the status quo
4) The influence of the change agents

The paper will focus on the 2nd and the 4th factors by analyzing the benefits and disadvantages of distance learning as well as presenting ways where the technology coordinator can assume leadership as a change agent.

 
==Introduction to Distance Learning:==

Distance learning is defined per Wikipedia as:

“A field of education that focuses on the pedagogy and andragogy, technology, and instructional systems design that aim to deliver education to students who are not physically ‘on site’. Rather than attending courses in person, teachers and students may communicate at times of their own choosing by exchanging printed or electronic media, or through technology that allows them to communicate in real time and through other online ways.”

Distance learning has become an increasingly popular educational tool in the last few years.  Because distance learning can break down the barriers of time and distance, student learning can take anytime and anywhere in the world.

Online degree and certificate programs at universities have especially received much media attention.  Based on an article published on the Wall Street Journal in May 2006, “while overall higher-education enrollment in the U.S. is virtually stagnant, online enrollment is skyrocketing”.

Although distance education in K-12 schools has not received as much media attention, distance learning can and should become integrated into the K-12 curriculum given its advantages (some of which will be explored in later sections of the paper).  In addition, as one function of the K-12 schools is to prepare the students for the challenges later on in college and the professional world, by learning how to study in distance education classes, students can have the opportunity to obtain the hands-on experience with technology tools such as emails, discussion boards, video lectures (synchronous and asynchronous), WebTV, YouTube, Wiki, podcasting, etc.

 
==Introduction to Change Management:==

The distance learning model, like other technological innovations can be greeted with enthusiasm or resistance from teachers, students, schools, and the community.  While some will welcome a new and effective learning method, others will view distance learning with fear and anxiety.  

Managing change is not easy.  Managing change in the teaching and learning environment presents additional challenges when the technology coordinator must effectively manage the relationships with the principal, teachers, students, parents, and the community.  Throughout the implementation of the distance learning model in K-12 schools, the technology coordinator has the unique position to become the technological leader for the school.  In addition, the technology coordinator can transform his/her role if he/she can understand the human aspects of change.  Instead of being a support staff who follows the strategic directions set by the principal, the technology coordinator can exercise significant leadership.  

Change can be better accepted if the technology coordinator can show that the distance learning teaching mode meets the needs of students and teachers.  Change can also be better accepted if the technology coordinator can effectively articulate the benefits of distance learning to the principals, students, and teachers as well as demonstrating that they can all manage the shortcomings of distance learning.

==Presenting the benefits of Distance Learning:==

As an effective change agent, the technology coordinator should be able to clearly articulate the benefits of distance learning to the school board, the teachers, the students, the parents, and the community.

'''Advantage #1: Flexibility, Distance learning can take place anywhere and anytime'''

Distance Learning technologies have broken the down the barrier of time and space.  With new technologies, learning can take place any time and anywhere in the world.  Students in K-12 schools and adult learners can undertake learning at their own pace and convenience.  

'''Advantage #2 Additional teaching and learning formats'''

Distance Learning can create more varied teaching formats.  In Foreign Language and Culture classes, the technology coordinator can arrange and set up chat rooms with students in a foreign country.  The technology coordinator can also arrange and set up video conferencing features where the US students can chat with people at a foreign country using that foreign language in order to practice that language and learn more about the culture.  By using tools such as YouTube, Skype, and chat rooms, the teachers can increase student enthusiasm and interest for the courses.

'''Advantage #3 Cost Savings for the School'''

Although cost saving should not be regarded as the number one reason for the implementation of distance learning courses, there are significant long term cost saving opportunities.  With distance learning tools, the school can increase the number of students attending a class per a teacher.  

'''Advantage #4 Access to additional Courses from other Schools'''

Distance learning brings new access to new information; courses that could not be offered previously now can be accessed.  For example, a class taught in a middle school by a famous instructor in New York City can now be accessed by students from suburban schools in the US or even students from other countries.  Participation from students around the country or around the globe can also increase dialogue between the students.

'''Advantage #5 Familiarizing students with the Distance Learning technologies in preparation for college Distance Learning courses and lifelong learning when entering the workforce.'''

Online courses and e-Universities have met the many needs of adult learners and have therefore grown in number and capacity.  Many professionals understand the importance of lifelong learning and are actively pursuing continuing education through various means.  Because a large portion of the professional lifelong learning are taking place through distance learning courses, it is advantageous for K-12 students to become familiar with the many distance learning technology tools in preparation for college and the workforce.  As good habits should be formed at a young age, distance learning courses can be implemented in as early as elementary school.

'''Advantage #6 Giving students the opportunity to practice discipline.'''

In contrast to the traditional courses taught by an instructor in a classroom, distance learning classes, especially asynchronous courses, require the students to have more discipline in order to succeed in the class.  In the absence of a physical classroom and instructor, the distance learning courses require the students to exercise more self-discipline in order to keep up with the classroom readings and assignments.

'''Advantage #7 Teaching students to take initiatives for their learning.'''

Once a K-12 student reaches adulthood and becomes a professional, no one will force them to take classes, yet each professional must take responsibility for his/her own learning.  It is essential for professionals to engage in lifelong learning in order to stay competitive in the job market.  For example, a professional with a college degree in Information Technology might be asked by the company president to be in charge of the IT department budget.  Instead of stating that he does not have any Accounting knowledge, this professional can impress the company if he would take the initiative to enroll in continuing education courses in Accounting.  In contrast to traditional classroom courses where knowledge is passed from the instructor to the students, Distance learning courses require the students to take more initiatives for their learning as the students are often required to conduct individual research to complete assignments and contribute to class discussions.  When students enter the professional world, there will be many subjects that will be unfamiliar to them, by knowing how to take initiatives for their learning, distance learning courses can prepare the students to become proactive professionals.

==Limitations of Distance Learning and Ways to Manage Them:==

The technology coordinator should understand some of the limitations to distance learning as well as ways to minimize and manage these limitations.

'''Limitation #1: Learners might feel isolated'''

One of the limitations of distance learning is that the face to face interaction is lost in a distance learning class; this causes the learners to feel isolated during the learning process.  To manage this limitation, the technology coordinator should train the teachers to set up chat rooms, ask the students to post web pages with their pictures to be viewed by classmates, and set up opportunities for students to chat in synchronous format via software such as adobe connect.  Teachers can also set up face to face meetings with the students during the course.  Another way the technology coordinator can manage this shortcoming is to emphasize the fact that distance learning courses often offer the students more opportunities for interactions than in a traditional classroom.  In contrast to a traditional lecture-format classroom where student participation can be limited to those students with extrovert personalities, distance learning courses offer the opportunities for even the shyest students to participate via written formats.  When students are required to participate via the written format, they would often spend more time to organize their thoughts before making their comments, thus increasing the quality of the contributions.

'''Limitation #2: It is more difficult for learners to raise questions'''

Another limitation of distance learning is that it is harder for students to ask questions in a distance learning class.  In contrast to a traditional classroom where a student simply needs to raise his/her hand to ask a question, it is harder for students to ask questions to clarify their confusions in a distance learning class.  Therefore, the technology coordinator should inform the teachers of this limitation and encourage the teachers to spend extra efforts to make the instructions as detailed as possible to avoid confusion, the technology coordinator can also encourage the teachers to be responsive to questions from students.

==Resistance to change and the Technology Coordinator’s roles as a Change Agent and a Leader:==

Fear and anxiety are natural emotions to have when people encounter change.  As an effort to maintain the status quo, many people will adopt a resistance attitude as a defense mechanism.  During the Industrial Revolution, workers in factories have been known to destroy new plant machines because they understood that the introduction of automation would replace manual labor.  The technology coordinator should understand that some of the emotional resistance to distance learning are well-founded and work with the school leadership to manage and provide solutions to these negative emotions.

It is natural for teachers to fear that they might lose the respect of their students as many children today are technology savvy and spend considerable time with computers.  Equipping teachers with knowledge on distance learning technologies through IT training sessions is one of the most effective ways to decrease the anxiety.  

With the fast pace of technology innovations, teachers are not the only ones who are frustrated with the constant learning that has to take place in order to stay on top of these innovations.  Many users of technology might become frustrated when they have spent significant time to master a new technology innovation, only to find that their learning has quickly become obsolete in a few months.  To address this frustration, the technology coordinator should exercise technology leadership by providing frequent training sessions to teachers and school staff on the most current distance learning innovations.

A frustrating aspect for teachers who utilizes distance learning or other types of technologies is that technology is prone to bugs and breakdowns.  The technology coordinator should expect the technical difficulties and be understanding to users who become frustrated.  To ease these fears, the technology coordinator should hold frequent “open-door” office hours to support the teachers and make efforts to be responsive to user inquiries.

In order for a technology such as distance learning to be successfully implemented and accepted by the academic community, the technology coordinator should not only assume the role of a technology leaders, but more importantly, he should provide leadership as a change agent in order to change the school culture.  The technology coordinator can present a case to the principal on how the isolation of teacher can contribute to the fear of change, and how the establishment of a teacher support group can allow the teachers to share IT knowledge and communicate with each other.  The technology coordinator can also bring in outside Change Consultants to provide coaching and change awareness sessions to the teachers as a part of the teacher support program.  In addition, the technology coordinator can also petition the principal to support the teachers to enroll in distance learning courses in technology at universities such as the Teachers College at Columbia University.  By becoming students in distance learning courses, the teachers can experience the technology first hand and thus become more comfortable teaching with these technologies.

==Closing Remarks:==

Adopting distance learning in K-12 schools can be a rewarding yet challenging task.  A technology coordinator thus has the opportunity to exercise significant leadership in the technology and change management areas.  In order to assume effective leadership, the technology coordinator should not only be familiar with the advantages and limitations to distance learning, but he should also lead the change process with confidence and compassion to the teachers.  To influence the teachers, the technology coordinator must first understand the teachers as well as their fears and frustrations.

With the many advantages offered by distance learning technologies, this form of teaching and learning will soon become embedded in our education systems.  Students will choose to learn in technology rich classrooms instead of traditional classrooms where the lessons were taught in lectures using blackboards.  As Charles Darwin once said, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">Biological membranes have phospholipid bilayer structure which contains a set of proteins which help plasma membrane to carry its distinctive functions. Membrane proteins can be attached to the membrane or associated with the membrane of a cell or an organelle.
Membrane proteins can be classified into two groups based on the strength of their association with the membrane:

'''1.''' '''Integral membrane proteins'''(also called ''intrinsic proteins'')have one or more segments that are permanently embedded within the phospholipid bilayer and have their domains on both sides of the membrane.  Most integral proteins contain residues with hydrophobic side chains that interact with fatty acyl groups of the membrane phospholipids, thus anchoring the protein to the membrane. Most integral proteins span the entire phospholipid bilayer.It interacts extensively with the hydrocarbon chain of membrane lipid and they can be released by agents that compete for these nonpolar interaction.

'''2.''' '''Peripheral membrane proteins''' or ''extrinsic proteins'' are temporarily bound either to the lipid bilayer or to integral proteins by hydrophobic, electrostatic, and other non-covalent interactions. This type of proteins does not interact with the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer. They are usually bound to membrane by interactions with integral membrane proteins or directly by interactions with lipid polar head groups. This polar interaction can be disrupted by the change in pH.

  
[[Image:membrane_proteins_chem114A.jpg]]


Some membrane proteins are found bounded to lipid bilayer and generally involved in cell-cell signaling or interactions. Others are embedded within the lipid bilayer of a cell often form channels and pores. Membrane proteins can be attached to both the outside and inside of the cell membrane.

Proteins can be attached to the cell membrane in a variety of ways.  One method involves irreversible covalent modification.  Both Ras (a GTPase) and Src (protein tyrosine kinase) are known to be modified in this manner.  Both of these proteins participate in signal transduction pathways, but upon covalent attachment of a lipid group they become attached to the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane.  When Ras and Src are affixed to the cell membrane they are better able to receive and transmit information being transferred via their respective signal transduction pathways.Membrane proteins can be made of alpha helices or beta strands,or the combination of both alpha helices or beta strands. For example the channel protein called Porin is made up of entirely beta strands, while the enzyme protein called prostaglandin is made entirely of the alpha helices.

Membrane proteins can be alpha - helices or beta - strands.  Proteins can span the membrane with alpha helices.  Membrane - spanning alpha - helices are the most common structural motif in membrane proteins.  An examination of the primary structure reveals that most amino acids in the membrane protein are nonpolar and very few are charged.  One of the first alpha - proteins found was the bacteriorhodopsin.  It uses light energy to transport protons from inside the cell to outside generating a proton gradient used to form ATP.  The seven alpha - helices are closely packed and arranged perpendicular to the plane of the cell and they span 45A in width.  Membrane proteins can also be made out of beta strands.  Beta Strands form channel proteins.  They are less common than alpha - helices.  Channel proteins are formed by beta arrangement of beta strands.  Each strand is hydrogen bonded to its neighbor in an anti-parallel arrangement, forming a single beta sheet.  The beta sheet then curls up to form a hollow cylinder that forms a channel in the membrane.  An example is Porin.  The outside surface is non-polar and interacts with the hydrocarbon core of the membrane, while the inside channel is hydrophillic and filled with water.  The arrangement of polar and non-polar is accomplished by the alternation of hydrophobic and hydrophillic amino acids along with each beta strand.

Mutations in both Ras and Src have been observed in a number of cancer cells; it is thought that these mutations and the subsequent interruption of the signal transduction pathways predispose a cell to uncontrolled replication.  When the presence of a mutation is detected a small protein named ubiquitin is attached to the damaged protein; this modification signals that the marked protein is to be destroyed.  It is essential that the protein be destroyed before anaphase so that the damaged DNA is not passed on to other cells.  The attachment of ubiquitin to a damaged protein is the first step of apoptosis, which is programmed cell death.

===Fluidity of Membrane proteins===


Biological membrane are flexible. This flexibility is attained by the fluidity of the protein. The fluid mosaic model allows lateral movements called the lateral diffusion, and sometimes the transverse diffusion or flip flop can occur, which takes longer time to take place.

'''Lateral diffusion'''
Lateral diffusion is the movement of the lipid laterally which is very rapid, unless there is restriction by special interaction.

[[Image:lateraldiffusion.jpg]]


'''Flip-flop or Transverse diffusion

'''

The condition is when transition of a molecule from one membrane surface to the other occurred. It is a very slow space compared with the lateral diffusion.It happens once in several hours.

[[Image:1AB9.png|thumb| A graphical representation of zymogen]]

A zymogen(also denoted as a proenzyme) is a group of proteins that can also be described as an inactive enzyme. Since it is an inactive precursor, it does not hold any catalytic activity. These zymogens can be activated by chemical processes such as cleaving, hydrolysis, along with other biochemical changes that cleave the inactive enzyme to make it active. These biochemical processes often occurs in a lysosome, where cleavage reveals the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]]. Exposure of active site allow the enzyme to become active and function to catalyze reactions. The reason for cells to secrete inactive enzymes is to prevent unwanted destruction of cellular proteins. It is only when the conditions are right that zymogens become activated into enzymes.  There are specialized zymogenic cells that work only to synthesize and store zymogens in inactive form, ready to send to the parts of the body at need.

==Examples==

Examples of zymogens include:

&lt;big&gt;Pepsinogen&lt;/big&gt;

Pepsinogen, inactive precursor form of pepsin, is secreted by Chief cells in the stomach. Pepsinogen is activated by Hydrochloric acid (secretion from Parietal cells) because Hydrochloric acid provides the necessary acidic environment for which pepsin works best. Once pepsinogen becomes pepsin, it is responsible for the breakdown of food. The difference between pepsinogen and pepsin is that its primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids. The activation of pepsinogen to pepsin makes pepsin available to catalyze pepsinogen further to cleave it into more pepsin. 

&lt;big&gt;Trypsinogen&lt;/big&gt; 

Trypsinogen is the inactive form of trypsin. It is secreted by the pancreas and found in pancreatic juice. Once activated in the duodenum, trypsin cleaves peptide chains at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine and arginine unless they are preceding a proline. The importance of trypsin is its ability to cleave other zymogens such as chymotripsinogen and procarboxypeptidase.

&lt;big&gt;Chymotrypsinogen&lt;/big&gt; 

Once chymotrypsinogen is cleaved by trypsin, and reacted with Chymotrypsin produces a fully active enzyme, [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin]]. Chymotrypsin is found in the digestive system of mammals, as well as other organisms. It works by cleaving peptides at the carboxyl end of aromatic amino acids (Tryptophan, Tyrosin, and Phenylalanine)

&lt;big&gt;Procarboxypeptidase&lt;/big&gt; 

Procarboxypeptidase, which is the inactive form of carboxypeptidase, is converted to the active form by trypsin and enteropeptidase. It is secreted by the pancreas. Only some forms of carboxypeptidase are initially produced in the inactive form. However, the advantage of this mechanism is to ensure that the enzymes are not immediately exhausted before digestion.

&lt;big&gt;Nuclease&lt;/big&gt;

Nuclease is an enzyme which can break phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides in a DNA sequence. Nucleases contain a general range of enzymes such as endonucleases. Nucleases vary in the DNA sequences they cut as certain phosphodiester bonds are cleaved in such a way that may not always completely symmetrical.

&lt;big&gt;Pancreatic amylase&lt;/big&gt;

Pancreatic Amylase  is an enzyme that converts complex sugars such as starches and polysaccharides of carbohydrates into simpler sugars during digestion. Amylase hydrolyzes starch,
glycogen, and dextrin to form in all three instances glucose, maltose, and the limit-dextrins. Amylase is mainly secreted by the salivary glands, but some may also be found in the pancreas that also help aid in digestion.

&lt;big&gt;Lipase&lt;/big&gt;

Lipase is the active form of prolipase. Once activated, the water soluble enzyme is the catalyst for the hydrolysis ester bonds in water-insoluble, lipid substrates. This action is what classifies lipases as a subclass of the esterases. It cleaves fats into monoglycerides, fatty acids, and glycerols. The lipase also is essential in the process of digestion, as well as the transport and processing of dietary lipids in almost all organisms. 

&lt;big&gt;Proelastase&lt;/big&gt;

Proelastease is the inactive form of elastase. The activation of Proelastease is initially done through the simple cleavage of multiple sub-unit residues that bind to the central structure of the protein structure. The cleavage disrupts the hydrophobic interactions of the tertiary structure, allowing the polar regions of the enzyme to respond to digestion. Proleastease is distinct from Chymotrypsin through isolation by chromatography reveals that this structure is highly resistant and further stabilized by internal hydrogen bonding. Activation of proelastase and propeptidase with trypsin changed their electrophoretic mobilities. The activated proelastase migrated at the same rate as authentic, pure elastase.The proenzymes that were originally highly insoluble could be solubilized by treatment with alumina Cγ gel.

&lt;big&gt;Enteropeptidase&lt;/big&gt;

Enteropeptidase is produced within the walls of the small intestines secreted by the duodenum glands. This enzyme proteolytically activates trypsinogen to trypsin which simultaneously activates other digestive enzymes as well. Enteropeptidase cleaves at the C-terminal end of trypsinogen which activates the enzyme, turning trypsinogen into trypsin. Most of Enteropeptidase is consisted of disulfide bonds within the larger chain forming the catalytic subunits. 

&lt;big&gt;Caspase&lt;/big&gt;

Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play essential roles in apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammation. Caspases plays an important role in cells for apoptosis (programmed death) during the development and other stages of adult life. Caspases are also known as &quot;executioner&quot; proteins because of this role that they play in the cell. 

&lt;big&gt;Prothrombin&lt;/big&gt;

Prothrombin(Zymogen) is the precursor to the enzyme Thrombin which  in turn converts fibrinogen in to fibrin. Fibrin is the protein responsible for blood clotting and tissue restoration during a tissue rupture. As Fibrinogen is also a soluble zymogen   but when activated by thrombin it becomes Fibrin a non-soluble glycol protein.  Fibrimogen has a linearly symmetrical structure, containing a central cleavage site and a at both ends it has what is known as a globular unit which comes after a designated region alpha. The globular region has 2 “connection sites” Beta and Gamma. These 2 sites have the ability to connect to 2 other fibrin proteins, this allows the proteins to connect and make a lattice like structure making it a strong structure known as a cross linked fibrin clot.

&lt;big&gt;Angiotensin&lt;/big&gt;

Angiotensin is an oligopeptide that causes blood vessels to constrict and increased blood pressure. It also stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. It is a hormone and a powerful dipsogen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cooperativity can be seen in both enzymes and receptors, and describes the trends that occur when these structures contain multiple binding sites. Cooperativity describes the changes that occur when a binding site of one of these structures is activated or deactivated effecting the other binding sites in the same molecule. It can also be described as the increasing or decreasing affinity for binding of the other sites affected by the original binding site.

[[File:Sigmoid curve for an autocatalytical reaction.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a sigmoid curve.]]

Cooperativity can also be noted in large chain molecules that are made of many identical, or near identical, subunits (DNA, proteins, phospholipids), when these molecules go through phase transitions such as melting, unfolding, or unwinding, known as subunit cooperativity. When a substrate binds to the active site of one enzymatic subunit, the other subunits are stimulated and become active.

The activity of an enzyme can be graphed against the concentration of the substrate.  For an enzyme that shows a cooperative behavior, the relation between the two shows a sigmoidal curve instead of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Michaelis and Menten Equation|Michaelis and Menten]] behavior.  The graph shows a rapid increase in speed.  This reflects how the binding on one subunit increases the chance that the other subunits will bind to a substrate.

==Types of Cooperative Binding==

Cooperative binding can produce negative cooperativity, positive cooperativity, heterotropic cooperativity, and homotropic cooperativity.

===Negative Cooperativity===
An example of negative cooperativity is the decrease in binding affinity once one of the sites is bound. As ligands bind to the protein, the protein's affinity for the ligand decreases. For example, the relationship between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and the enzyme gliceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a clear example of this process.

===Positive Cooperativity===
[[File:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|thumb|left|Hemoglobin is made up of four subunits. If one subunit binds to oxygen it increases the chance the other three will do the same.]]
An example of positive cooperativity can be seen when a substrate binds to an enzyme with multiple binding sites the other binding sites are affected by this change.

This behavior is seen on the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin to form oxyhemoglobin. Hemoglobin is made out of four subunits, two alpha and two beta.  They come together to form a tetramer, each subunit having its own active site to bind oxygen to.  This active site contains a porphyrin ring structure with an iron atom in the center.  When the subunit is not bound to an oxygen the iron is about 0.4 A below the plane of the ring.  When the tetramer is in this state, it is considered to be in the T-state or tense state.

The R-state, or relaxed state occurs when hemoglobin has bound to oxygen.  Deoxyhemoglobin, or the T-state, has a low affinity for oxygen. When one molecule binds to a single heme, though, the oxygen affinity increases, which allows the following molecules to bind more easily in succession.  This occurs when the iron bound to the oxygen is lifted to lie in the same plane as the ring.  This forces the histidine residue it is attached to also move, which in turn forces the alpha helix where the histidine is attached, to move.  The carboxyl terminal at the end of the helix is located at the interface of the two alpha-beta dimers therefore favoring the R-state transition.  Overall the R-state is more stable than T-state but under certain conditions this can change. 

The oxygen affinity of the 3-oxyhemoglobin is about 300 times greater than that of its deoxyhemoglobin counterpart. This behavior leads to the affinity curve of hemoglobin to become sigmoidal, not hyperbolic as with the monomeric myoglobin's affinity curve. In the same way, the ability for hemoglobin to lose oxygen is greater as fewer oxygen molecules are bound. This cooperativity can be seen in Hemoglobin when one of the oxygen binds to one of the tetramer's subunits. This will increase the probability that the other three sites will bind to oxygen.

An example of homotropic cooperativity is the effect that the substrate molecule has on its affinity. 

An example of heterotropic cooperativity is when a third substance causes a change in the affinity.

===Concerted Model of Cooperativity===
The concerted model (symmetry model or MWC model): enzyme subunits are connected in such a way that a conformational change in one subunit is necessarily conferred to all other subunits. Thus all subunits must exist in the same conformation. Example: In hemoglobin, the tetramer changes conformation together (R state) after four oxygen molecules bind to all four monomers. The transition from the T state to the R state occurs in one step. 

[[File:Concertedmodel..JPG|thumb|500px]]

The Concerted Model, also known as MWC model or symmetry model, of hemoglobin is used to explain the cooperativity in oxygen binding as well as the transitions of proteins made up of identical subunits. It focuses on the two states of the Hemoglobin; the T and R states. The T state of the hemoglobin is more tense as it is in the deoxyhemoglobin form while the R state of the hemoglobin is more relaxed as it is in the oxyhemglobin form. The T state is constrained due to the subunit-subunit interactions while the R state is more flexible due to the ability of oxygen binding. The binding of oxygen at one site increases the binding affinity in other active sites. Thus in the concerted model of the hemoglobin, it shows that the one oxygen binding to an active site will increase the probability of other oxygen binding to the other active sites. In a concerted model, all oxygen binding sites on Hemoglobin in the T state must be bound before converting to the R state. This is also true in the conversion from the R state to the T state, in which all bounded oxygen must be released before full conversion can take place. At each level of oxygen loading, an equilibrium exists between the T-state and R-state. The equilibrium shifts from strongly favoring the T-state (no oxygen bound) to strongly favoring the R-state (fully loaded with oxygen). Overall, oxygen binding shifts the equilibrium toward the R state. This means that at high oxygen levels, the R form will be prevalent and at lower oxygen levels, the T form will be prevalent. Allosteric effectors of hemoglobin, such as 2,3-BPG, function by shifting the equilibrium towards or away from the T-state, depends on whether it's an inhibitor or a promoter. This model and the sequential model displays the extreme cases of R and T transitions. In a real system, properties from both models are needed to explain the behavior of hemoglobin.

{{BookCat}}

===Sequential model of cooperativity===
The sequential model: subunits are not connected in such a way that a conformational change in one induces a similar change in the others. All enzyme subunits do not necessitate the same conformation. The sequential model states that molecules of substrate bind through an induced fit. Example: In hemoglobin, the four monomers change conformation (R state) one at a time as oxygen binds to each monomer. This allows hemoglobin to have R state monomers and T state monomers. 

The Sequential Model of the hemoglobin explains the cooperativity involved in the binding of oxygen. This model follows the concept that after binding occurs at one site in the active site, the binding affinity in the other sites around the protein will increase as well. Hence, the plot of substrate concentration versus reaction rate is of a sigmoidal shape. Because of this cooperativity, it does not follow Michaelis-Menten Kinetics. The difference between this model and concerted model is that the T states do not have to convert to R states all at one time. In this model, the ligand will change the conformation of the subunit that it is bound to and induce changes in the neighboring subunits. The sequential model does not require the overall state of the molecule to be in only T state or in only R state. Simply, each binding site influences nearby binding sites until all of the binding sites are in the same state. Neither the sequential model or the concerted model fully explains the nature of hemoglobin. Properties from both models appear in a real system.

==Subunit Cooperativity==
Cooperativity not only occurs during ligand binding, but occurs any time energetic interactions simplify or complicate the occurrence of something happening that can involve multiple units as compared with single units. An example is the unwinding of DNA. Sections of DNA must first unwind in order for the DNA to carry out its other functions, such as replication, transcription, and recombination. Positive cooperativity among adjacent DNA nucleotides simplifies the process for unwinding a whole group of adjacent nucleotides compared to unwinding the same number of nucleotides spread along the DNA chain. The cooperative unit size is the number of adjacent bases that will unwind as a single unit because of the effects of positive cooperativity. This process applies to other types of chain molecules, too, such as the folding and unfolding of proteins, as well as the melting of phospholipid chains that comprise the cell membrane.

==Entropy and Cooperativity==
Entropy plays an important role in cooperativity. This can be seen in the example of oxygen binding to hemoglobin, where the first oxygen has four different sites that it can bind to. This shows a relatively higher entropy compared with the binding the last oxygen will have, which has only one site left that will bind. In going from an unbound to a bound state, the first oxygen must overcome a larger entropy change versus the final binding oxygen. This entropy difference is the main reason for the positive cooperativity in binding oxygen to hemoglobin.

==Kinetics of cooperativity==
When a plot of product formation as a function of substrate concentration produces a sigmoidal curve cooperativity is present. This sigmoidal curve is produced because of the effect of one substrate binding to one active site increasing the activity at the other active sites. The curve increases with a large slope and then levels out to its limit once the substrate saturation is reached.

== Hill Equation ==
The '''Hill equation''' is an equation describing the amount of ligand bound to the macromolecule, or its saturation.  The equation is as follows:

&lt;math&gt; \theta = {[L]^n \over (K_A)^n + [L]^n} = {[L]^n \over K_d + [L]^n} &lt;/math&gt;

Where:
&lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; represents the fraction of binding sites filled
&lt;math&gt;[L]&lt;/math&gt; represents the concentration of the ligand
&lt;math&gt;K_A&lt;/math&gt; represents the concentration of ligand required for half the binding sites to be occupied
&lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; represents the dissociation constant
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; represents the Hill coefficient, which describes the cooperativity of the reaction.

When:
* &lt;math&gt; n&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;, the reaction is '''POSITIVELY cooperative''', meaning a ligand binding to a site '''INCREASES the ligand affinity''' at other binding sites.
* &lt;math&gt; n&lt;1 &lt;/math&gt;, the reaction is '''NEGATIVELY cooperative''', meaning a ligand binding to a site '''DECREASES the ligand affinity''' at other binding sites.
* &lt;math&gt; n=1 &lt;/math&gt;, the reaction is '''NOT cooperative''', meaning a ligand binding to a site '''DOES NOT alter the ligand affinity''' at other binding sites.

The Hill Equation was formulated in 1910 by Archibald Hill (1886–1977), pioneer in biophysics.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Enzymes are proteins that catalyze a reaction by stabilizing the transition state and therefore, lowering the activation energy of the reaction. To achieve this, enzymes use different classes of reactions known as catalytic strategies. Four classes of enzymes are used in catalytic strategies are:
- Serine Proteases: example of catalytic mechanism of chymotrypsin
[[File:Catalytic Mechanism of Chymotrypsin.gif|thumb|steps of chymotrypsin catalytic mechanism with side chain catalytic triad]]
- Carbonic Anhydrase: make a fast reaction faster
Carbonic anhydrases dehydrate HCO3- in blood to form CO2 for exhalation as the blood passes through the lungs. 
[[File:Mechanism of Carbonic anhydrase.gif|thumb|]]
- Restriction Endonucleases (BamHI):
Bam HI: is used for DNA cleavage reaction. This enzyme recognizes particular base sequences, recognition sites, in target DNA and cleave DNA at a defined positions. 
I co-crystallized the complex BamHI-DNA with a divalent cations
BamHI binding to nonspecific DNA forms an electrostatic traps that allows sliding along DNA.
Catalytic Mechanism: Pre-reactive state (Glutamic acid 113 acts as general base removing a proton from water molecule) 
                                 Transition state (Pentavalent phosphate intermediate forms with 2 negative charges)
                                 Post-reactive state (proton donated by water molecule goes to oxygen in leaving group, phosphodiester bond is broken)
- Nucleoside Monophosphate Kinase
NMP kinase is enzyme that aids in transferring the phosphoryl group at the end of a nucleoside triphosphate to the phosphoryl group that is on a nucleoside monophosphate
NMP + ATP --&gt; NDP + ADP

The strategies used to catalyze a reaction are:
*'''[[Structural Biochemistry/Catalytic Strategies/Covalent Catalysis|Covalent Catalysis]]'''
Whereas most enzymes simply have an active site that changes the shape of a substrate, in covalent catalysis, the enzymes (or cofactors) covalently bond to the substrate as the first step. The active sites contain a reactive group, usually a nucleophile, that forms a covalent bond with the substrate. Then, the enzyme goes through a mechanism, eventually breaking down the substrate and reforming itself. Chymotrypsin, for example, can catalyze reactions by utilizing covalent modification. It can employ a serine residue as a nucleophile to attact the unreactive carbonyl group of a substrate. 

Other proteases like chymotrypsin, such as trypsin, can use a catalytic triad (containing aspartate, histidine and serine residues) to activate enzymatic activity and break peptide bonds. Proteases usually involves a nucleophile that attacts a peptide carbonyl group. Cystein proteases is activated by histidine to attack the carbonyl group. Aspartyl proteases is activated by aspartate pairs, which exists in deprotonated and protonated forms to attack a water molecule and carbonyl group, respectively. Metalloproteases is activated by a bound metal ion (usually zinc) to activate the water molecule, which acts as a nucleophile to attack the peptide carbonyl group. 

*'''[[Biochemistry/Catalytic Strategies/Acid Base reactions|Acid-Base Reactions]]'''
These enzymes generally use a molecule other than water to donate or accept protons as a nucleophile. An example is that of a Zinc ion - Histidine complex in carbonic anhydrase that breaks down the H2CO4 into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions. The zinc attracts a water molecule which then deprotonates. The oxygen acts as a nucleophile and attacks a carbon dioxide molecule to create a complicated coordination complex. Another then replaces the complex, releasing the bicarbonate ion. 

*'''[[Structural Biochemistry/Catalytic Mechanisms/Catalysis by Approximation|Catalysis by Approxmiation]]'''
The close proximity of two substrates can increase the rate of reaction between the two. Generally, when two molecules combine to become one, entropy decreases. An enzyme that brings the two molecules together decreases the entropy. This increase in rate is similar to increasing the concentration of the reactants. However, catalysis by approximation generally increases the reaction rate more than simply increasing the concentration of the reactants since the enzyme generally makes the reaction pseudo-intramolecular.

*'''[[Structural Biochemistry/Catalytic Strategies/Metal Ion Catalysis|Metal Ion Catalysis]]'''
Metal ions can directly facilitate the formation of bonds.  Because they are electrophillic, they can also act to stabilize the charges on the intermediates in the reaction. 

The type of strategy that is employed is based on the enzyme's structural properties and the reaction that the enzyme will 
catalyze. Many times a combination of strategies is used to in catalytic reactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Phosphorylation ==

[[File:Protein kinase.jpg|right|thumb|Protein kinase]]
Phosphorylation is an effective way of regulating proteins.  About 30% of proteins in eukaryotic cells are phosphorylated.  The enzymes that are responsible for these reactions are known as protein kinases.  There are about 100 homologous protein kinases in yeast and 500 in human beings. When ATP is hydrolyzed in a test tube, the release of free energy merely heats the surrounding water. In an organism, this  same generation of heat can sometimes be beneficial. For instance, the process of shivering uses ATP hydrolysis during muscle contraction to generate heat and warm the body. In most cases in the cell, however, the generation of heat alone would be an inefficient use of a valuable energy resource. Instead, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis directly to endergonic processes by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule, such as the reactant. the recipient of the phosphate group is then said to be phosphorylated. the key to coupling exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more reactive than the original unphosphorylated molecule. 

[[Image:400px-GSK3 phosphorylation.jpg‎|thumb|left|Schematics of Serine and Threonine Phosphorylation]]
ATP must be present for phosphorylation because it is needed as a donor.  One of the phosphoryl groups of ATP is transferred to a specific amino acid.  The acceptor is one of three amino acids with a hydroxyl group as a side chain:  serine, threonine, and tyrosine.  Tyrosine is handled by a different protein kinase than the other two.  The reaction below shows how ATP donates one of the phosphoryl groups to a phosphorylated protein.

Protein phosphatases reverse the effects of kinases by catalyzing the removal of the phosphoryl group attached to proteins.  The enzyme hydrolyzes and breaks the bond attaching the phosphoryl group.

[[Image:Down-Syndrome-DSCR1ST.jpg|thumb|Protein Phosphatase]]
[[File:Phosphorylation-driven.Par.0001.Image.274.gif‎|thumb|Illustration of Phosphorylation]]

It is important to note that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions are not the reverse of one another. The former takes place through the action of protein kinase and ATP cleavage, whereas the latter will only take place in the presence of a phosphatase.

== Reasons for Effectiveness ==

1) A phosphoryl group adds two negative charges to the protein.  These changes alter substrate binding and catalytic activity. 

2) A phosphoryl group can form 3 or more hydrogen bonds and can be tetrahedral.

3) The free energy of phosphorylation is very large.  Therefore it can change the equilibrium by a large factor.

4) Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation take place in less than a second or over a span of hours.

5) Phosphorylation produces highly amplified effects. One kinase changes hundreds of target proteins in a short interval.

6) Phosphorylation is irreversible.

7) ATP is the energy needed, and thus it links the process to bio energetics.

Phosphorylation is important to the regulation of cells by regulating insulin, water balance, and homeostasis of the cell.  The enzyme GSK-3 by AKT (Protein kinase B) regulates the insulin pathway. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase regulate water balance and homeostasis of the cell.

== Protein Kinase A ==

Protein kinase A (PKA) is an enzyme that is regulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP).  This is common in the &quot;flight or fight response&quot;. The hormone [[w:Epinephrine|Epinephrine]] signals the synthesis for [[w:Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|Cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] which subsequently activates protein kinase A. The kinase regulates target proteins through [[w:phosphorylation|phosphorylation]] of [[w:serine|serine]] and [[w:threonine|threonine]].  
PKA is not activated until cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit.  This stops inhibition of PKA.  The complex (R2C2) has a pseudosubstrate sequence of R that occupies the active site of PKA.  When cAMP binds, the R chains move so it is no longer inhibiting the active site.  The R chain has the sequence Arg- Arg- Gly- Ala- Ile.[[Image:Proteinkinase 1.svg]]

The figure above shows how once cAMP is bound to the binding sites, the pseudosequence is no longer blocking the active site of PKA.  This is how ''PKA'' is regulated.

The protein kinase A holoenzyme is a heterotetramer made up of two types of subunits: 1)A catalytic subunit which contains the enzyme's active site. It also contains a domain that binds ATP (the source of phosphate) and a domain that binds the regulatory subunit. 2)A regulatory subunit which consists of two molecules of this subunit bind one another in an anti-parallel orientation to form a homodimer; for type I subunits, this binding is covalent through disulfide bonds. This subunit also has two domains that bind cyclic AMP, a domain that interacts with a catalytic subunit, and a inhibitory domain that serves as a substrate or pseudosubstrate for the catalytic subunit. Regulatory subunits can also modulate catalytic subunit activity.

'''Regulating Activity''':
Intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP provides a very simple control mechanism over activity of protein kinase A.

At low cyclic AMP levels, catalytic subunits are bound to a regulatory subunit dimer and are inactive.
As the concentration of cAMP increases to ~10nM and above it binds to the regulatory subunits, which gives way to an allosteric change in conformation which causes unleashing of the catalytic subunits.
Free catalytic subunits are active and begin to phosphorylate their targets.

== Glycogen phosphorylase ==

[[w:Glycogen|Glycogen]] is the [[w:polysaccharide|polysarccharide]] of [[w:glucose|glucose]]. It serves as short term energy storage in animal cells. Glucose is a monosaccharide, an important carbohydrate in biology. It is used by the cell as a source of energy and as an metabolic intermediate.

Phosphorylase catalyzes the interconversion of glycogen and glucose-1-phosphate by the reaction,

Glycogen + Pi --&gt; Glycogen + glucose-1-phosphate

[[Image:Glcogen.glucose.pi.jpg‎]]

where [[w:glucose-1-phosphate|glucose-1-phosphate]] is then converted to [[w:glucose-6-phosphate|glucose-6-phosphate]] by [[w:phosphoglucomutase|phosphoglucomutase]], since the glucose-1-phosphate isomer cannot be metabolize easily, whereas the glucose-6-phosphate acts as fuel for [[w:glycolysis|glycolysis]] and [[w:pentose phosphate pathway|pentose phosphate pathway]].

Phosphorylase activity is regulated by reversible phosphorylation. Phosphorylase a is the active form, while phosphorylase b is inactive.

== Metabolic Disorders Caused by Defective Enzymes Controlling Phosphorylation ==
An example of a metabolic disease caused by defective enzymes is Lafora disease. Lafora disease, named after Dr. Gonzalo Lafora, is a metabolic disorder that is caused by defective enzymes that controls phosphorylation. It is a neurodegenerative disease caused by insoluble glucan accumulating in the cytoplasm. Glucan is a type of complex carbohydrate that is made up of glucose linked together by glycosidic bonds. Lafora disease not only causes epilepsy, but also progressive central nervous system degenerations. This ultimately results in the death of the patient. It is thought that the compilation of cytoplasmic lipid bodies (LB) trigger neuronal cell death and seizures.

It is recognized that in almost half of Lafora disease cases, the EPM2A (epilepsy, progressive myoclonus 2A) gene is mutated. The EPM2A gene encodes the bimodular protein called laforin. Laforin is associated with regulating glycogen metabolism. Glycogen stores long-term energy. Furthermore, about 20% if Lafora disease cases are a result of mutations in EPM2B (epilepsy, progressive myoclonus 2B), which encodes the protein called malin. Malin is associated with the binding, ubiquitylating, and promoting the degradation of laforin.

It is determined that insoluble glucan accumulating in the cytoplasm causes Lafora disease, although the molecular cause of this disease is still unknown. This is due to the fact that the function of laforin is obscure because its substrate is still unidentified. There are various hypotheses, but one prominent hypothesis is that laforin dephosphorylates glycogen molecules as they are synthesized. Without laforin, glycogen metabolism results in a slightly more phosphorylated glucan and would eventually lead to a Lafora body. Another hypothesis is that laforin recruits malin to the site of glycogen synthesis. Malin regulates the synthesis of glycogen by ubiquitylating protein targeting to glycogen (PTG), glycogen synthase (GS), glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE), and laforin to inhibit LB formation.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[:Image:]][[:Image:]]== '''Covalent Catalysis: A Definition''' ==

'''Covalent Catalysis''' is one of the four strategies that an enzyme will employ to catalyze a specific reaction. In this reaction the enzyme contains a reactive group, usually a nucleophilic residue which reacts with the substrate through a nucleophilic attack. This is usually carried out by pyridine, which is a better nucleophile than water that has a pKa of 5.5. The charge loss in the reaction during transitional state will then cause hydrolysis to accelerate. The residue becomes covalently attached to the substrate throughout the catalytic reaction adding an additional intermediate which helps stabilize later transition states by lowering the activation energy. The covalent bond is then broken to regenerate enzymes. 

== '''Examples of Enzymes that Participate in Covalent Catalysis''' ==

Examples of enzymes that participate in covalent catalysis include the proteolytic enzyme chymotrypsin and trypsin in which the nucleophlie is the hydroxyl group on the serine.
Chymotrypsin is a degradative protease of the digestive system. It catalyzes the cleavage of peptide bonds that are adjacent to large aromatic or nonpolar residues. It cleaves the peptide bond on the carboxyl terminus side of the protein. The chymotrypsin has three main catalytic residues termed as the catalytic triad. These are His 57, Asp 102 and Ser 195. Upon deprotonation the serine residue becomes a powerful nucleophile due to its alkoxide that will attack the relatively unreactive carbon of the carbonyl in the protein.
The figure shows the catalytic triads in neutral and deprotonated form.

Typical residues used in covalent catalysis are Lys, His, Cys, Asp, Glu, and Ser and some other coenzymes.

== Accuracy ==

A Page is worthless if the information it contains is wrong. Actually, that's not entirely correct. In some cases, a page can be ''dangerous'' to readers and learners if the information it contains is wrong. Think about errors in [[First Aid]] if you want an example of how a book could negatively affect a person's well-being.

Wikibooks requires that books be '''verifiable'''. This isn't technically the same as being &quot;accurate&quot;, but the two often go hand-in-hand. A book that is sufficiently verifiable can be considered the truth (or a close approximation thereof). To reach this level of verifiability, the book must either properly cite it's information sources so the reader can see the information reproduced at a website that is verifiable, or the material must be structured in such a way that the reader can reliably reproduce the information at home. This second point is called '''self-verifability''', and is very important at Wikibooks.

Beyond being a [[WB:NOR|a policy]] here at Wikibooks, verifiability is also one of the page review criteria used here by the [[Help:Revision review|FlaggedRevs extension]]. For a book to be considered &quot;featured quality&quot;, it should have very good ratings of verifiability.

Books needing accuracy help are typically in the '''Revised''' and '''Review''' stages of development.

{{warning|Notice that improving a page's accuracy often involves writing new [[../Content|content]]. Many book improvement tasks go hand-in-hand with each other.}}

== Self-Verifiability ==

Books on Wikibooks should be self-contained. They should start at a basic level where all readers have a certain set of required preliminary knowledge. Then, building on this foundation (which the book can treat as axiomatic), it introduces and develops more advanced topics. Preliminary knowledge can be treated as axiomatic because it should be covered to a high degree of verifiability in a separate book here on Wikibooks, ideally. If not, links should be provided to other places where such information is presented in a verifiable manner.

Because of self-verifiability, Wikibooks tend not to need the kinds of comprehensive footnotes and citations that Wikipedia does. Wikipedia articles are typically presented as if in a vacuum, each article stands alone. In Wikibooks, each page in a book can build logically on the pages before it, introducing new material as an increased understanding of previous material.

=== Preliminary Knowledge ===

Books should list all prerequisite knowledge that is required before reading the book. This includes, but is not limited to, links to other Wikibooks that the reader should have read first, or mentions of important subject areas that the reader should be familiar with. Frequently, this is represented as a particular grade level or reading level that the reader should possess.

== External Verifiability ==

Material which is not self verifiable, such as material which would put the reader in physical danger, or material which is experimentally impossible should be referenced and sourced as required.

== Improving Verifiability ==

Improving verifiability can be a complicated task. Here are some methods that can be used:

# Create a new list, or improve an existing list, of prerequisites that readers should have before attempting to read the book. Use templates like {{tlx|Reading level}} or {{tlx|Prerequisite}} on the book's TOC. Only use {{tlx|Prerequisite}} if the prior resource is located here on Wikibooks. Also, use {{tlx|Corequisite}} for material which the reader should attempt to read simultaneously.
# Create a page for &quot;Resources&quot;, or &quot;Further Reading&quot;, or &quot;External Sources&quot; where bibliographic data can be stored for the whole book
# Add notes to a page that discuss additional external reference resources, such as {{tlx|SideBox}}, {{tlx|info}} or {{tlx|warning}}.
# Use footnotes with the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax. Also, a template needs to be created to help automate formatting for this.
# Expand discussions and explanations of tough material
# Add more examples of tough topics.

== Further reading ==

* [[Help:Editing#References]] describes the inline &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax, and alternatives.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since many enzymes have common names that do not refer to their function or what kind of reaction they catalyze, a enzyme classification system was established. There were six classes of enzymes that were created so that enzymes could easily be named. These classes are Oxidoreductases,Transferases, Hydrolases, Lyases, Isomerases, and Ligases. This is the internation classification used for enzymes. Enzymes are normally used for catalyzing the transfer of functional groups, electrons, or atoms. Since this is the case, they are assigned names by the type of reaction they catalyze. The enzymes were numbered 1-6 and from here, they were divided into subdivisions. This allowed for the addition of  a four-digit number that would precede EC(Enzyme Commission) and each enzyme could be identified. The reaction that an enzyme catalyzes must be know before it can be classified.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., John L. Tymoczko, and Lubert Stryer. BIOCHEMISTRY. 6th ed. New York: W. H.

'''Oxidoreductases''' catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions where electrons are transferred. These electrons are usually in the form of hydride ions or hydrogen atoms. When a substrate is being oxidized it is the hydrogen donor. The most common name used is a dehydrogenase and sometimes reductase will be used. An oxidase is referred to when the oxygen atom is the acceptor.[[File:PDB 1jzr EBI.jpg|right|thumb|Glutathione S-transferase]]

'''Transferases''' catalyze group transfer reactions. The transfer occurs from one molecule that will be the donor to another molecule that will be the acceptor. Most of the time, the donor is a cofactor that is charged with the group about to be transferred. Example: Hexokinase used in glycolysis. 

'''Hydrolases''' catalyze reactions that involve hydrolysis. This cases usually involves the transfer of functional groups to water. When the hydrolase acts on amide, glycosyl, peptide, ester, or other bonds, they not only catalyze the hydrolytic removal of a group from the substrate but also a transfer of the group to an acceptor compound. These enzymes could also be classified under transferaes since hydrolysis can be viewed as a transfer of a functional group to water as an acceptor. However, as the acceptor's reaction with water was discovered very early, it's considered the main function of the enzyme which allows it to fall under this classification. For example: Chymotrypsin. 

'''Lyases''' catalyze reactions where functional groups are added to break double bonds in molecules or the reverse where double bonds are formed by the removal of functional groups. For example: Fructose bisphosphate aldolase used in converting fructose 1,6-bisphospate to G3P and DHAP by cutting C-C bond.

'''Isomerases''' catalyze reactions that transfer functional groups within a molecule so that isomeric forms are produced. These enzymes allow for structural or geometric changes within a compound. Sometime the interconverstion is carried out by an intramolecular oxidoreduction. In this case, one molecule is both the hydrogen acceptor and donor, so there's no oxidized product. The lack of a oxidized product is the reason this enzyme falls under this classification. The subclasses are created under this category by the type of isomerism. For example: phosphoglucose isomerase for converting glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate. Moving chemical group inside same substrate. 

'''Ligases''' are used in catalysis where two substrates are litigated and the formation of carbon-carbon, carbon-sulfide, carbon-nitrogen, and carbon-oxygen bonds due to condensation reactions. These reactions are couple to the cleavage of ATP.

== Big Books ==
[[Image:Sub-arrows.svg|thumb|right]]
It's easy to create a big ambitious plan for a book when you're just getting started. There are so many topics that need to be covered, and so much related material. It can be too hard to create lines in the sand between material that belongs in your book and material that does not. Plus, it's almost unthinkable that you would create ''two books'' at once. If you're doing the work, it's easier to just put all the information in one place and do all the basic structural work once.

However, the truth is that some books become so large and sprawling that they lose quality because of it. A book tries to cover too much material, and ends up not focusing enough on any of it to provide proper coverage. In these cases, sometimes the best thing you can do for your book is to '''split it''' into smaller books

=== Caveats ===

Notice that bigger books are not always well-served by division into smaller books. Here are some situations where having a single large book may be more desirable than having several small books covering the same topics:

# If the book is fundamental and comprehensive. Breaking it into smaller books, each one will be less comprehensive and therefore likely to be less valuable (without extensive cross-linking). Sometimes the sum is greater than the combined value of it's pieces.
# If the book has a large and dedicated team of contributors. A cohesive group of contributors, especially like those from academic institutions (groups of teachers, classes of students, etc) can work together to maintain and improve larger bodies of work.

Consideration should be made to break a large book into several small books if such a split will improve the quality and coverage of materal.

=== Mergers ===

The opposite of a book split is a book merger, and sometimes these are just as necessary. When individual books are too small and limited, or when there is significant overlap between two books without significant differences in definition (scope, target audience, etc) the two could probably be merged.

== Small Books ==

Small books have a number of benefits. Here are a few:

# It's easier to measure completion in a smaller book
# Smaller books have a more well-defined focus, which means they tend not to sprawl as new material is added
# Fewer pages means fewer pages that need to be written to and kept at a particular level of quality
# It's easier to identify holes in coverage when the subject matter is more focused on a particular topic
# Instead of creating a large book with many redlinks (which can make you feel hopeless), you can create a small book and make noticable progress on it. Create additional books later, as earlier books grow.

I recommend writing smaller books when possible, and if you have a large idea for a book you should separate it into ideas for multiple smaller books.

== Splitting Books ==

Here are some steps to take when splitting books, so you don't get overwhelmed with the job:

# Mark the page with {{tlx|Split}} to make sure other people are aware of your intentions. This way you can get interested parties involved in the planning and execution, and you can solicit feedback.
# Create outlines for all books that will result from your efforts, including books which already exist but are being radically altered. Make sure you know what the end goal looks like, so you know what direction you should be heading in at all times. These outlines can be on paper, or on a talk page, or somewhere in your user space, or wherever. The important part is that you have a '''plan'''.
# List all existing pages in your book on the outline, and show where they are moving to, what they are being renamed to, and how they are being altered for the final project
# Create any necessary templates for all the books, including navigational templates and categories.
# Consider creating a [[WB:AS|subject page]] that will keep all the new sub-books organized, and acknowledge that they are related in some way. Consider turning the old main page of the book being split into a redirect to the new subject page.
# Create the books, or create one of the books first and keep the rest of your outlines handy. You can come back to your notes later when it's time to create the next book in the series, or other authors can get started on the work before you have time to get to it.

== Opportunities ==

So long as you are massively rearranging the structure of one book, and creating at least one other book from scratch, this could be a great opportunity to do a few other high profile changes as well: Mergers between related books on the sub-topics, rearrangements of reading order, etc. So long as you are doing the work,</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

'''Metal ion catalysis''', or electrostatic catalysis, is a specific mechanism that utilizes metalloenzymes with tightly bound metal ions such as Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; (the first three being the most commonly used) to carry out a catalytic reaction. This area of catalysis also includes metal ions which are not tightly bound to a metalloenzyme, such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Enzymes can catalyze a reaction by the use of metals. Metals often facilitate the catalytic process in different ways. The metals can either assist in the catalyic reaction, activate the enzyme to begin the catalysis or they can inhibit reactions in solution. Metals activate the enzyme by changing its shape but are not actually involved in the catalytic reaction. 
 
First, the metal can make it easier to form a nucleophile which is the case of [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Carbonic Anhydrase|'''carbonic anhydrase''']] and other enzymes. In this case, the metal facilitates the release of a proton from a bound water to produce a nucleophilic hydroxide ion and start the catalytic reaction. With the polarization of the O-H bond, the acidity of the bound water can increase. Equally important, the metal can promote the production of an electophile which in turn stabilizes negative charge on the intermediate. Also, metals can promote binding of the enzyme and substrate by acting as a bridge to increase the binding energy and orient them correctly to make the reaction possible.

Common metals that take part in metal ion catalysts are copper ion and zinc ion. The catalysis of carboxypeptidase A is a prime example of this catalytic strategy. The iron metal ion is also very common--from the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin and myoglobin, to participating as an electron carrier in the cytochromes of the electron transport chain, to even as a detoxifying agent in catalase and peroxidase. 


Metal ions also have the ability to stabilize transition states, which makes them very useful in catalytic chemistry because it allows them to stabilize unstable intermediates that are still transitioning into a structure that's going to allow them to react with another substrate and form the final product. For example, in the presence of a tetrahedral oxyanion and another oxygen that is attached to a carbonyl functional group nearby  that is also about to become nucleophilic as an intermediate, the metal ion can coordinate to these two neighboring anions and participate in charge stabilization. 

[[Image:Metal_stabilizing.jpg‎]]

Forming this Copper 2+ metal ion bridge allows both nucleophilic/anionic oxygens to be stabilized at the same time. It also positions this molecule in the appropriate geometry for breaking or forming bonds. Metal ions like these enable species to acquire a reactive role by coercing them to adopt unusual angles and bond distances. 

Metal ions that are not tightly bound to a metalloenzyme, such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mentioned earlier participate as specific charge carriers in the membrane of our cells. For example, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; control the membrane's electrostatic voltage. They are ions that conduct the inside of our membrane's to have a net negative charge by the use of ion pumps and concentration gradients. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is also an important metal ion that controls and regulates the passing of neurotransmitters from one axon to the next in order to sound out signals throughout the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Catalysis by Approximation ==

Substrates that happen to come together through random collisions have an even smaller possibility of contact with the reactive portions of the substrate. Thus, enzymes can employ a strategy known as '''catalysis by approximation''' by which the enzyme brings together two substrates in order to increase the rate of reaction. This strategy takes advantage of binding energy and positions the substrates in the correct orientation for the reaction to proceed. Usually in a reaction, there will be a loss in translational entropy and rotational entropy. In the reaction, the transition state is much more ordered than it is at ground state, making delta S negative. This reaction takes place in the active site of an enzyme and the substrate and the catalytic group will than act as one molecule, preventing the loss of translational and rotational energy. The reaction first begins with two molecules that are able to find each other, which makes the rate of reaction dependent on the concentrations of the reactants. This is due to the higher probability of molecules to find each other. 

== Some Examples ==

An example of catalysis by approximation is when NMP kinases[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Enzyme_Catalytic_Mechanism/Nucleoside_Monophosphate_Kinase]] bring two nucleotides together to facilitate the transfer of a phosphoryl group from one nucleotide to the other. With the addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a phosphate group is placed adjacently to the phosphate group of the NMP kinase. This facilitates in the transfer of the phosphate between the two molecules.

      <comment>/* Optimum pH */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Optimum pH==
Changes in pH have influence on enzymes. The most favorable pH value is known as the optimum pH. This is the point that the enzyme is most active. This is graphically illustrated in figure. 
[[File: Optimum pH.png|thumb|right|alt=Optimum pH]]
Extremely high or low pH values generally result in complete loss of activity for most enzymes. pH is also a factor in the stability of enzymes. As with activity, for each enzyme there is also a region of pH optimal stability.
The optimum pH value will vary greatly from one enzyme to another, as Table shows:
[[File: Variation of optimum pH.png|thumb|right| Variation of optimum pH]]


Including temperature and pH there are other factors, such as ionic strength, which can influence the enzymatic reaction. Each of these physical and chemical parameters must be considered and optimized in order for an enzymatic reaction to be accurate and reproducible.

==Overview==

Enzymes typically are most active in a pH range of 5-9.  This is due to the fact that proteins function in an environment that reflects this pH.  There are a variety of reasons as to why proteins have a narrow pH range.  A variety of amino acid residues as well as the carboxyl and amide termini of proteins have a pKa range in the range of intracellular pH.  As a result, a change in pH can protonate or deprotonate a side group, thereby changing its chemical features.  For example, carboxyl termini, under deprotonated, could potentially lose an interaction with a adjacent subunit, changing the enzyme conformation.  In conclusion, this conformation could cause a decrease in substrate affinity.  A more drastic pH change can change the protein folding, thereby completely deactivating the enzyme or cause irreversible proteolysis.

However, pH change can potentially be utilized by enzymes for regulation or protein function.  For example, hemoglobin will create a salt bridge when blood plasma is acidic.  Therefore, the T-state of hemoglobin is stabilized and have a lower binding affinity to oxygen.  This facilitates increased oxygen transport to oxygen-deficient muscles.

1. The binding of the substrate to enzyme.&lt;br&gt;
2. The ionization states that the amino acid residues of the catalytic site of the enzyme have.&lt;br&gt;
3. The ionization state of the substrate.&lt;br&gt;
4. The variation in protein structure (More significant at extreme pH values).&lt;br&gt;


The rates of many enzymatic reactions adhere to a bell shaped curve when they are a function of pH:

[[Image:Enzyme-ph.png|thumb|Graph of enzyme activity as a function of pH. Green- high pH enzyme; Blue- low pH enzyme; Orange- neutral pH enzyme.]]


These curves reflect the ionization state of the amino acid residues that must have a specific ionization state for enzymatic activity to take place. The observed pK's (maxima point) often hints at the identity of the amino acid residues which are essential for enzymatic activity. For instance, an observed pK of ~4 suggests that either an Asp of a Glu is essential to the enzyme. pK of ~6 can hint towards a His residue whereas pK of ~10 hints toward a Lys residue.

However, it is crucial to remember that the micro-environment in which the enzyme is in also affects its activity. For example, an Asp residue in a non-polar environment or in close proximity to another Asp residue would attract protons more strongly than in any other environment and this have a higher pK value. 

Moreover, pH effects on an enzyme could cause denaturation of the enzyme rather than protonation or deprotonation of specific catalytic residues.

A particular residue may be replaced by doing site directed mutagenesis. Doing so provides researchers with a reliable approach to identifying residues that are required for substrate binding or catalysis.

== Specific Case: The Bohr Effect ==

The Bohr Effect was named after Christian Bohr, who studied and discovered the effects of Hydrogen ion and Carbon dioxide. The discovery of the cooperativity of Hemoglobin has helped Bohr in studying the effects of pH in enzymes. In this specific case, this is focused on the effect of Hydrogen ions on the hemoglobin protein and enzyme. Before understanding the Bohr effect, the cooperativity of hemoglobin has to be explained. In hemoglobin's cooperativity, the release of oxygen is favored when they are at a high concentration of oxygen. This occurs because the special hemoglobin character facilitate oxygen binding when one active site binds to a oxygen first. This ability of hemoglobin will allow them to respond to other physiological signals at where more oxygen is needed. 

In this case, high rates of metabolizing tissue at contracting muscles usually generate high rates of hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide, which allosteric effectors at that bind to hemoglobin on the areas that are not oxygen-binding sites. The Bohr effect is the when the hydrogen and carbon dioxide regulate the oxygen-bindings site on hemoglobin. 

As we know that hydrogen ion decreases the pH values in a solution, and this phenomenon usually decreases the hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, in other word, it increases the release of oxygen. Thus, at high pH, the side chains of the histidine (Beta-146) is not protonated and the salt bridge is not formed, while at low pH the side chains of histidine does form salt bridges when they are protonated. This will result in stabilization of the T state in hemoglobin which also increase the release of oxygen. 

When Carbon Dioxide is passed through the human body, the first mechanism that happens is when they react with water to become carbonic acid (H2CO3) accelerated by carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic acid is readily dissociated into HCO3- and H+ and decrease the value of pH as it is described in the previous mechanism.

Another way that Carbon dioxide can affect the affinity of oxygen in hemoglobin is a direct mechanism of Carbon dioxide and hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide stabilizes the deoxyhemoglobin (T state) by reacting with the terminal amino groups to form carbamate groups (negative charged). These carbamate groups then are free to form salt bridges that stabilizes the T state and release oxygen. The formation of the carbamate groups is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. After the formation of the carbamate groups, the carbamate dissociates into bicarbonate ions and protons. The salt bridges are formed by protonating histidine which then bridges with asparagine.

==Effect of Temperature on Enzymatic Activity==
As all enzymes have an optimal pH in which their catalytic activity is at its peak, enzymes also have an optimal temperature. There are two established thermal properties of enzymes that effect the catalytic rate. Those two are activation energy and their thermal stability. However experimental data of temperature against enzymatic activity does not clearly match the so sought out for indignation that activity simply increases with temperature. A new model called the Equilibrium model helps provide the quantitative explanation of enzyme thermal behavior under reaction conditions by introducing the enzymes inactive form, forming an equilibrium system that would follow similar rules to Le Chatlier's principle in basic chemistry. The equilibrium model gives rise to a number of insights in the sense that it eliminates time dependency that was thought to be important in the classical view of enzymatic activity against temperature. The idea behind the equilibrium model is that when under different temperature gradients, the inactive form of the enzyme that is added along with the active form, prevents a full inactivation of the active enzyme by equilibrium mechanics. It should be noted however that the difference between inactive and active forms of the enzyme must be understood. The equilibrium model describes the inactive form of the enzyme by purely centralizing its activity according to its active site. The active site of an enzyme is where substrates are capable of binding which then proceeds into a conformational change of the enzyme to then further proceed with the intended biochemical reaction. The inactive enzyme in this model is described as a mere folding change in comparison to the active form of the enzyme. This is not to be confused with an enzyme that has been denatured. An enzyme that is denatured is one that is completely changed, active site and all, to the point where the enzyme can not function at all, in other words, it is an irreversible enzyme conformational change. In the case of the equilibrium model, the mechanic of this model works simply because of the reversibility of the inactive enzyme form. The inactive form of the enzyme can reverse back to its active form which is in complete correspondence of the whole idea behind the equilibrium mechanics of the proposed model.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can loss or theft of a mobile device be dealt with?}}

From a survey of house hold spending Canada: Over two-thirds (68%) of Canadian households reported owning at least one cell phone, up from 64% in 2005. Moreover, 1 in 5 households reported owning two cell phones, while 1 in 10 households had three or more. With the increase use of cell phones also come the increase of cell phone theft and loss; it’s as frequent as losing a pair of sunglasses. As personal devices become more numerous in shape, size and functionality, they will become a part of us. And until that happens quite literally, we stand the chance at leaving a part of ourselves behind at the cafe, newsstand and while taking advantage of public transportation. Quite possibly you will only lose your list of contacts, easily restored to a new device from your PC back at the office. Sometimes more confidential information will be lost, but the gain for thieves is not actually in the phone but from the lapse of time from the theft until the time you notice it and take action to have the line shut down. Thieves are running up thousands of dollars in cell phone calls at your expense because the cell phone companies are holding the clients responsible up until the time it is reported stolen.

==Advantages==
&quot;Secure&quot; encryption methods provide even greater security, but have also been shown to have a limited usable lifetime. With that said, personal files on personal devices can and should be encrypted. Following the theory that an encrypted file becomes less valuable over time; you protect critical personal data from potential attack for long enough until it worthless. An example of this is protecting credit card and account information long enough for you to find a phone and cancel the account.

==Disadvantages==
Some disadvantages of a loss or stolen devices are that company employers and employees are walking around with corporate data on their PDAs and laptops and it’s not protected. The users as well as their devices are at risk. Although there is antivirus software and firewalls that may protect a network, they do not protect device-stored data.

==Future Implications==
As technology progresses we hope that one of the methods that will be automatic will be the encryption of personal handheld devices that are being used by the corporations’ employers as well as their employees. If corporations are going to continue to allow their employers/employees to synchronize their mobile devices with company data then they will have to ensure that they take the necessary steps to safe guard the data that may end up in the wrong hands. Encryption, firewalls, antispam ware and antivirus protection is a must. Maybe companies will follow in the footsteps of Milpitas, Calif.-based Phoenix Technologies Ltd., and incorporate the same product that they have introduced to their company called the TrustConnector 2, an application that prevents attackers from accessing protected systems even if they have valid IDs and passwords. According to Phoenix Technologies, every device that can access a network is given an identity that cannot be altered or stolen, making each identified device trusted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

Metal ions play an important role in biochemical processes.  Because metal ions are positively charged ions that are stable in multiple oxidation states and can form strong yet conformationally changeable bonds, they become attractive catalytic substances.  

Many biochemical reactions depend on the presence of metal ions, which are a part of coordination complexes. Those metal ions function to facilitate or inhibit biochemical reactions in the solution.

==In Trigger and Control Mechanisms==

Ions, such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, function as charge carriers. Because membrane ion pumps maintain a concentration gradients of those ions from the inside to the outside of the membrane, the movement of the ions would trigger mechanisms. The changes in concentration gradients are signals for nerve and muscle actions. These ions typically are used via intracellular and extracellular concentration differences to create a electric potential gradient.  In doing so, ion channels can be controlled via a variety of chemical mechanisms.  However, they are not responsible for conformational changes, but instead can cause a cascade of protein activation. 

'''Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
1. regulation of body fluids, including blood plasma, extracellular fluids in tissues&lt;br&gt;
2. signal transduction in nerves and muscles&lt;br&gt;
3. transmission of heat&lt;br&gt;
4. transportation of nutrients and wastes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
1. trigger taste sensations&lt;br&gt;
2. polarization of membrane: muscle contraction, transmission of nerve impulses&lt;br&gt;
3. regulation of body fluids, including cell fluid, plasma&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;br&gt;
1. trigger for muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release&lt;br&gt;
2. cancer prevention candidate&lt;br&gt;

==Catalytic Influences==

Metal ions are able to promote reactions by providing appropriate geometry for bond breaking and bond formation. Many coordination sites in the molecules are tetrahedral, octahedral, or square-planar, but metal ions also provide other geometric variation, which enables reactions to take place. Metal ions, transition metals especially, are frequently utilized as a catalyzing group due to their extended octet.  They are therefore able to create multiple interactions as well as ionization states that facilitate conformational changes to the protein.  Furthermore, they are able to create coordination complexes with ligands, which are considerably weaker bonds than covalent and ionic bonds, but allow for ligand stabilization.  

These metal ions participate in catalytic mechanisms in 3 main ways:

'''1.''' Binding to substrates to orient them properly for catalytic reaction.&lt;br&gt;

'''2.''' Mediation oxidationo-reduction reactions via reversible changes in oxidation state of the central metal ion.&lt;br&gt;

'''3.''' Electrostatically stabilizing or shielding negative charges.&lt;br&gt;

Essentially, metal ions serve as a electron sink, much as protonation does.  However, metal ions can be in high concentration without an effect on pH.  For example, carbonic anhydrase facilitates the creation of carboxylate ion from water and carbon dioxide.  It is initiated by the coordination bonding of OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; to Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.  This stabilizes the negative charge on the oxygen and facilitates a nucleophilic attack on the carbon atom in carbon dioxide.

Some examples of metal ions used in catalytic reactions include include Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Lewis Acid Behavior==

Binding to a metal ion makes water molecule more acidic than free water molecule. Coordination to proteins enhances the effect even more, resulting in M-OH species that is able to further react with other biological substances. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can activate phosphotransferases and phosphokinase, while Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are able to catalyze hydrolysis of phosphates, serving as Lewis acids.


[[Image:Active Site in Carboxypeptidzase A.jpg]]


Uncatalyzed hydrolysis rate constant is about ~10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, while with enzyme catalyzing the reaction, reaction rate constant increases to k = ~10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Carboxypeptidzase A has 307 amino acid residues. One Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is cleft on one side.

- Molecular weight = 34600 g/mol

- Egg-shaped 

- Dimension: 50*38A

- Carboxypeptidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of c-terminal amino acid residues of the protein. It is released in pancreatic juice of animals for the digestion of proteins.

==Interaction with Small Molecules==

Binding with small molecules enables metal ions to adopt unusual angles, bond distances, or specific geometry, and hence increases their reactivity. In hemoglobin and myoglobin, ferric ion is able to bind to oxygen, serving as a oxygen storage and transport. Oxygen molecules that bind to Iron metal ions is accompanied by the partial transfer of an electron from the metal ion to the oxygen. Their structure is best seen as a complex formed between ferric ion and a superoxide anion. Which is important than the heme-group stabilizes this binding or else superoxide is released into the body which could be biologically dangerous. Iron stabilizes this conformation in a strong ionic interaction which prevents this superoxide oxygen anion from leaving out of the blood cell.

==Oxidation-Reduction Reactions and Catalysis==

Coordination by different ligands changes the reduction-oxidation potentials of a reaction, making it easier or, sometimes, more difficult to take place. The change in redox potential also enables electron transfer.

'''1.''' The reaction of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is catalyzed by Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, where Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Similarly, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is oxidized to form NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O while Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced to Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.


'''2.''' The reverse reaction mentioned above, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is catalyzed by the valence charge of Mn.

'''3.''' Ribose is reduced to deoxyribose, a reaction catalyzed by Co&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, where Co&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is oxidized to Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Understanding Inclusive Education==

Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences and the idea that each student has a unique learning style continues to have many implications for today’s educators, especially as classrooms become populated with more diverse students. The diversity is especially felt within the area of inclusive education, where students who are classified as having a particular disability are educated within the same environment as their regular education peers. Sapon-Shevin (2007) defines inclusive education as practices that support the belief that all students in a school, regardless of their intellectual abilities or particular labels, have the right to be educated in the mainstream of education, and have their needs met within this context. She asserts ‘they are assumed to be full members-perhaps with modifications, adaptations, extensive support—but they are members nonetheless” (p. 6). Kluth (2003) adds that inclusive education is more than a set of strategies and practices but “an educational orientation that embraces differences and values the uniqueness that each learner brings to the classroom” (p. 24). 
The challenges teachers face are many which range from classroom management issues; to effectively delivering content to help students meet and exceed the standards, but within the inclusive environment they are even greater. Teachers and in class- support ( teacher’s assistant or paraprofessional) must consider the challenges that both the inclusive and general education students face which includes their social interaction with each other and understanding and their different abilities. 

==Making Inclusive Education Successful==

Making inclusive education successful requires that everyone get involved. Collaboration of parents, teachers and school administration is the beginning point, and ensuring that all modifications as outlined in the inclusion student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) are implemented-- which can be anything from extra time for the student who has a reading or writing disability to all together modified work. Additionally, research has shown the importance of the following to making inclusion work. 

            			   
1.	Learning must be cooperative

2.	Open communications

3.	Building of friendships and social relationships 

4.	Students must be able to access the curriculum. Instructional methods which are differentiated help to facilitate this process.

==How can Distance Learning Help?==

Now more than ever, distance learning has the potential to transform teaching and learning within the K-12 inclusive classroom, but it needs to be tailored with the needs of this group in mind. With technology as its main tool, distance learning can become an effective way to aid student achievement for this group, while making learning a fun, social and ongoing process. Computer-based technology has been shown to be a valuable way of improving student achievement, particularly for students with learning disability. Wikipedia defines distance learning as “a field of education that focuses on the pedagogy and andragogy, technology, and instructional systems design that aim to deliver education to students who are not physically on site.” Many higher education students have experienced distance learning courses where they never have to attend classes on campus or in person and where all communications with teacher and peers are conducted through electronic media. The convenience for learning that this field offers is certainly one main reason why it is appropriate for the inclusion classroom. Distance learning can be a supplement to the inclusion classroom by giving the general education student reinforcement of work taught and can level the field for inclusion students by ensuring that modifications according to each students unique IEP are put in effect. Inclusion students whose modification is “extra time,” for example, can use distance learning as a way to complete work, share work with peers and teachers and receive immediate feedback from the convenience of home. Other benefits of distance learning for this population include:	

						                                                                              
•	Continuation of the socialization process and building of friendships

•	Promotes digital literacy (an important skill for the 21st century students)

•	Meaningful learning and collaboration 

•	Presentation of content in an interesting way through the use of technology.


To facilitate this are technologies which are popular technologies. These include video conferencing, podcasts, social networking, YouTube, wikis and blogs. These technologies are equipped to begin to meet the needs of inclusion students in a distance learning environment.

==Video Conferencing==

Commonly understood as an extension of the telephone with the addition of image, video conferencing is an effective way to continue academic work away from the traditional classroom environment. Wikipedia defines it as “a set of interactive telecommunication technologies which allow two or more locations to interact via two-way video and audio transmissions simultaneously. It has also been called visual collaboration and is a type of groupware. It differs from videophone in that it is designed to serve a conference rather than individuals” Video Conferencing offers numerous opportunities for teacher and students in the inclusive setting to continue the education process after school.


•	It is ideal for the teacher to offer quick feedback to student work

•	Students whose particular modification required more time to complete class work could get the opportunity to share their work during the video conferencing and get the feedback from classmates.

•	Student can continue work on project with group members which help foster relationships.

==Podcasts==

Wikipedia explains a podcast as a “series of audio or video digital-media files which is distributed over the Internet by syndicated download, through Web feeds, to portable media players and personal computers. Though the same content may also be made available by direct download or streaming, a podcast is distinguished from other digital-media formats by its ability to be syndicated, subscribed to, and downloaded automatically when new content is added.” All students in the inclusive classroom stand to benefit from podcasts because of the reinforcement and relearning opportunities it present, but some benefit more than others:


•	Students with visual impairment can listen to lectures on their iPods or mp3 players. This benefit of podcasts is beginning to satisfy the need to provide another point of access to the curriculum for non-traditional students.

•	Audio learners who are characterized by the ability to remember what is heard compared to what is read, or by a difficulty reading or writing would have lecture presented in the format that works best for them.

==YouTube==

There is no end to the possibilities of YouTube for inclusive education. It affords teachers the chance to upload clips of lessons for students’ viewing, and in turn students can comment on videos and receive immediate feedback in that form from both teacher and other peers. YouTube also has extensive content for k-12 population. 
All learning styles would find YouTube as an effective educational tool. Audio and visual learners can work comfortably listening to, viewing  and commenting on video clips while Kinesthetic and tactile learners would enjoy projects centered on making and uploading YouTube videos clips.

==Social Networking==

There are many social networking sites, a list is available at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites.  As the name suggests, social networking can promote the building of friendships and further help to socialize inclusion students with their general education peers and teacher. Kluth (2001)holds that providing opportunities for social connection beyond the classroom is important. Using social networks as a learning tool is becoming more popular with sites like ELGG, for example, an open-source social networking software where users are provided with their own weblogs, an online profile, RSS reader  and file repository (with podcasting capabilities). It is ideal for students because of the privacy controls which it allows. Students can keep their profiles private or available to selected users. Teachers can use social networks for group projects which require a great deal of collaboration and to engage students in discussions.

==Wikis and Blogs==
Wikis and Blogs are being used now more than ever as an educational tool. For the k-12 inclusion classroom, wikis like the other technologies can give students another place to continue the work started in the classroom. Students can brainstorm ideas, work on group projects together, and receive feedback from teachers and peers. Teachers can have a place to post assessment tasks and check for understanding. Similar to wikis, blogs give students their own space to share their thoughts, and receive feedback. Teachers can use a blog as the class page where information pertinent to students and parents are accessible.

==Overview==


Today there is an explosion of technology that allows groups of individuals to communicate worldwide without leaving their offices, at their home, even on the road. According to recent data from Statistics Canada, about 10 percent of the Canadian workforce qualifies as distributed. Forty percent of IBM’s workforce has no office at the company; at AT&amp;T, more than 30 percent of its managers are distributed; and at Sun Microsystems, nearly 50 percent of employees are distributed. Working from different places causes a new question that is how a meeting is held. Mobile technology produces not only telework but also teleconference. 

Teleconferencing is the use of electronic communication that allows two or more people at different locations to hold a simultaneous conference. In recent years, holding teleconference calls has become a wonderful way for many companies to avoid the expenses involved in employee travel. As gas prix have continued to rise, companies are even pulling back on meetings that have their people driving across town, not to mention the trips that involve flying from on side of the country to the other. Teleconferencing services are enjoying a surge in the business world, as more and more organizations have turned to such services to help communicate, while reducing their reliance on travel. In most cases, when people need to have a meeting it is for a fairly short period of time, maybe for a few hours, or a day or two at most. Making use of a teleconference is particularly great for those short meetings when it would take more time for the key executive or meeting presenter to get to the other location.

Three kinds of teleconference services: Teleconference call is the oldest and simplest, where multiple people are able to call into one central phone number so that everyone can communicate on the line at the same time, but they can’t communicate by face-to-face. Video teleconferencing is no wonder why has started to realy catch on and become popular with the way that technology is advancing. When people participate in this type of teleconference, usually the organizers or presenters are on camera and the other participants who are “attending: opt receive information are able to see who is speaking. This is also wonderful because the presenters can use visual aids to make a greater impact and to improve their presentations. Web conferencing is a newer innovation that expands the features and benefits of teleconferencing services. This kind of teleconferencing gives people the ability to interact with others through a secure website. Many websites now offer online conferencing at no cost, but the more extensive web conference systems that provide more features will charge a fee for use. Once you know what you need from a teleconference service provider, it’s time to find the best provider. You can start your online search with companies like The ConferenceSpace, www. Theconferncespace.com, and ask all the questions you need to make sure you discover the best solution for your company.

The advantages of teleconferencing are obvious, and numerous. However, there are some disadvantages that should be brought to light. Technical failures may occur when trying to establish a conference or during a conference, which would terminate the meeting prematurely. In addition, socializing is less than a face-to-face meeting, and it would be difficult to build close relationship between group members.

==Future==

What is the next step toward more realistic virtual meetings? The answer is known as tele-immersion, a conceptual hybrid of virtual reality and Star Trek’s Holodeck. One of the principal applications areas for Internet 2, tele-immersion visually replicates, in real time and in three dimensions, slabs of space surrounding remote participants in cybermeeting. The result is a shared, simulated environment that makes it appear as if everyone is in the same room.

: I've listed it on the [[Japanese/Contents]] page. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:42, 4 July 2008 (UTC)

== Hiragana Lessons ==

I've been revamping the hiragana lessons here [[User:Retropunk/Japanese_Junk_Page]] to replace the current header page for the [[Japanese/Lessons/Lesson_6 | lessons]] This merges some of the data in [[Japanese/Reading Hiragana]].  The rest of the information in the Reading Japanese page has been better illustrated or doesn't need to be in &quot;Reading Japanese&quot; (i.e., devoicing and pitch).  The other sections were either stated in the updated page, or in the lessons.  I'm open for updating the page.  When it's good to go, we should probably delete [[Japanese/Reading Hiragana]] and the hiragana lessons under [[Japanese/Grammar_Lessons/Chapter_0 | here]].  I want to emphasize that the other data under the later section may be useful.  I'm only talking about removing the a through n group pages. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 02:36, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

: I went ahead and updated the page.  [[Japanese/Reading Hiragana]] is outdated, and should probably be merged completely with [[Japanese/Lessons/Lesson_6]].  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 07:27, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

== Conjugation tables ==

I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Conjugation_table_without_Romaji&amp;oldid=1133476 completely] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Conjugation_table_without_Romaji&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=1133476 revamped] the [[Conjugation table without Romaji]] book. I think we should move this to a module like [[Japanese/Verb conjugation table]] or something similar and delete the [[Conjugation table with Romaji]].

I added some colours to make it easier to connect the legend with individual verb forms. I'm by no means a graphics person, so if anyone is good with colour schemes, please give us a hand.

I also transposed the tables so they now only take three lines each. This has cut the length of the page by half. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:32, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

: I've moved the page. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:29, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

== Introductions ==

Cleaning up the introductions,
* [[Japanese/Introduction]]
* [[Japanese/Introduction/About]]
I found the [[Japanese/Introduction/About#Why study Japanese]] useless. I'd like to delete this whole section (see [[Talk:Japanese/Introduction/About#Japanese.2FIntroduction.2FAbout.23Why_study_Japanese|the discussion]]).

I'd also be interested in peoples' oppinions on what to put on those pages ( and if renaming them will help new contributors. It might clarify to call them something like [[Japanese/The Japanese language]] and [[Japanese/About this project]]. It's a bit of a colour-of-the-bike-shed decision, but figured I'd check to see if anyone had good any good suggestions for a clearer useful scope. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:21, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

: I've decided that &quot;Preface&quot; would probably fit well as a title for the contents of [[Japanese/Introduction/About]]. I'm not really sure about the &quot;Introduction&quot;, though. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:03, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

== Adding material to the main page ==

I've put up a rough structure for the main page and stolen some material from Retropunk. I've bolded the links that are also on the front page. Not sure if that's the best notation, though. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:39, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

== Japanese in other languages ==

I found a link to [[fr:Japonais]] and added a bunch of language links which I just wanted to draw attention to. The French book looks brilliant and is certainly a good source of inspiration for presentaion. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:24, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

== Phrasebook ==

I've been playing a bit around with the phrasebook. I put it up at [[Japanese/Phrasebook]] and started to move in content that's linked to from [[Japanese/Contents#Phrases, but no grammatical discussion]]. I also set up a template at [[Template:Japanese Phrasebook entry]] to set up phrase lists.

I've been wondering whether this should be a seperate book. It might help to have a clearer seperation between the two since the phrasebook should probably not have any Japanese scripts. Higher level students should be studying grammar anyway. Splitting them up might, however, reduce the amount of collaboration. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:53, 4 July 2008 (UTC)

: Yes, I think it absolutely should be. I've moved it to [[Japanese Phrasebook]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:24, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

== Kanji reading template ==

I created [[Template:Japanese kanji readings]] for use in kanji lists such as the ones linked to from [[Japanese/Kanji]]. Just wanted to bring this to people's attention in case anyone would be interested or able to comment on it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:37, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
: Ahh, yes.  I was making one... but been too busy with work to really work on it.  I don't see myself having much time for the next month or so, but I'll try and come on every once in awhile. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 03:41, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
: It appears that there's an alignment problem with the examples.  They vary heavily.  I'm not sure this could be solved. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 06:59, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
:: Better now? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:56, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
::: Not sure if you noticed, but the image libraryis severely lacking for the red images.  It wouldn't be difficult to make these images, but it's time consuming.  Most of the time, the Japanese/Chinese-Traditional use the same strokes, but there are a few differences.  I'll try to add the images as I can. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 05:11, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
:::: I did notice. I've contacted the Commons stroke order project members shortly before my old computer died to ask them about the status of the project and how to sort out the issue of Chinese vs. Japanese stroke orders. Currently, the Chinese stroke order is the default with Japanese versions where these differ.
:::: Have you visited the Commons project yet? Are you planning on contributing the missing characters? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:52, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
::::: Yes, I'm aware of the CJK site.  The main problem is that most of the strokes are for Chinese traditional characters.  There are some Japanese Kanji that do not follow stroke pattern nor the exact same character.  Some are the same as the simplified characters.  Some are completely different from both.  To get an accurate list, we would really need to start a Japanese-list in conjunction to the Chinese list.--[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 06:44, 8 October 2008 (UTC)
:::::: Well, the way things were going on Commons, there was a great team doing a lot of work on the Chinese characters. They later added Japanese versions on to them as they found discreptancies. That system worked well as long as the Chinese characters were the main part of the project. Modifying the project to allow seperate Chinese and Japanese sub-projects will take a bit of work but may well be worth while to make use of the work already done.
:::::: The Commons project was working on that when the core team retired from the project. I've been wanting to work on this as I'd love to modify it to make it easier for people to join and add the occational image. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:44, 8 October 2008 (UTC)

: I've completed adding the templates to the kanji pages. As Retropunk has noted, there are many images missing. I've spent a some time looking into the resources at Commons. There are some Japanese-specific images but I couldn't find any systematic overview of which characters share stroke orders with the simplified Chinese characters.
: At some point we'll have to systematically check everything. We may want to consider a fairly extensive overhaul of the Stroke Order Project on Commons before starting this. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:13, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

== Kana template ==

Stumbled across a second set of hiragana stroke order lists. Decied that a couple of templates might be useful to standardise these. I copied some of the markup from [[Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Hiragana/Lesson 1]] and made [[Template:Japanese kana navigation]] and [[Template:Japanese kana]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:42, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

: I've just finished updating the [[Special:PrefixIndex/Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Hiragana|hiragana pages]] with these templates. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:36, 12 August 2008 (UTC)
: I won't get around to doing the katakana until I set up Linux on my new computer (for which I'm missing an optical drive). It's just not worth doing without a proper editor. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:57, 8 September 2008 (UTC)

: I added some extra features to [[Template:Japanese kana]] so that the voiced and plosive characters would be displayed beside the clear ones.
: I'm completing the the katakana pages. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:12, 30 September 2008 (UTC)

: Phew. The katakana are now done. The hiragana haven't been updated to use the new template format (putting the voiced and plosive with the clear sounds).
: There is still work to be done on polishing the kana pages, though, but I think the structure is now pretty much in place.
: I'm also thinking of adding the audio links to the template in the same way that the image links are currently added. It would create a whole bunch of red links, but I don't think it's a big problem since these are needed anyway for the pronunciation guide. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:08, 1 October 2008 (UTC)

=== Mnemonics ===
I've never used mnemonics for anything other than &quot;る&quot; and &quot;ろ&quot;. Can anyone share their thoughts about whether we need seperate mnemoncis for the clear, voiced and plosive characters, or whether it's sufficient to have them for the clear sounds alone. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:08, 1 October 2008 (UTC)
: I don't see a reason to have separate mnemonics.  However, I don't see why we should restrict them for the clear syllables.  If there are no alternatives, we can use either of the three.--[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 05:07, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
:: I'm not sure if I got what you're saying. Is it that you see no reason to have seperate mnemonics, but you don't either see a reason why not to have them? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:16, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
::: I don't see a reason to have a mnemonic for each syllable (clear, voiced, and plosive), but I don't see a reason to restrict the mnemonic to just clear.  If voiced seems more appropriate than forcing a mnemonic for clear, then we should use the voiced mnemonic.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 05:51, 8 October 2008 (UTC)

== Kana page ==
I've created a [[Japanese/Kana]] page which now links to all of the kana pages (I have only updated a single hiragana page with the new template, though &amp;mdash; comments appreciated). I've merged in stuff about the yōon and added links to drilling software.

I know that not everyone will agree with this approach, but would like to explain my rationale. I'm interested in comments and critisims, I'm not married to this approach and am willing to change my mind if I hear a good argument against it. I would, however, like the opportunity to convice others of the benefit of my proposal so that we can remove the redundancy. At this stage in the book, however, I'm not that bothered by duplicate material if different contributors see value in each version. In the case that people don't agree, I have no problem with retaining both approaches.

My approach is to join the two kana pages since a lot of the material on [[Japanese/Reading_Hiragana]] is also directly applicaple to katakana. At the same time, I want to seperate the pronunciation from the discussion of these scripts where possible. That would include the &quot;mora&quot;, &quot;chōon&quot;, &quot;pitch accent&quot; and &quot;devoicing&quot; which I belive belong rather on [[Japanese/Pronunciation]]. The pronunciation of the &quot;voiced and plosive&quot;, &quot;sokuon&quot; and &quot;yōon&quot; are represented in the kana scripts, and therefore I believe we should include those with the kana discussion as well as on the pronunciation page.

I understand that, as it stands, the pronunciation page doesn't teach pronunciation very well and is more of a guide riddled with the inadequacies of describing sounds with comparison to words in English &amp;mdash; a language infamous for its wide variety of pronunciations. Ideally, we'll find a native Japanese speaker with a nice voice (there was an active person on Commons a while back) to make proper sound examples to turn that page into a decent resource for pronunciation.

We would then end up with two pages where one focuses on the pronunciation of Japanese, while the other discusses the syllabary scripts with which the sounds are written. These can (and should) be well connected by cross-referencing to integrate them where needed. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:42, 6 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

I've archived some of the old discussions (mostly pre-July 2008) and the discussion on page deletions.  Hopefully I didn't mess anything up on my selective move.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 14:42, 7 October 2008 (UTC)

: I've long thought of doing this, but wasn't sure where to cut. I was hoping that at the end of this stage we could do away with most of this page and start fresh on the next stage; actually adding content. But we're hardly there yet.
: Thanks for takning the initiative. Are you able to devote a bit more time to the project again, or are you still &quot;busy as a bee&quot;? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:24, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
:: I'm not able to devote a lot of time, but I'll be looking around and helping as I can.  I plan on making the red-images for the kanji vocabulary sometime in the near future.  I've requested help on lang-8.com, so maybe we'll get a few people from there.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 05:45, 8 October 2008 (UTC)

== Hi, a little question... ==

'''When the book will be complete, include the table of contents?''' I entered to /Content and this was a mess, I don't know where to start from there.

And I'm correctly in a holiday, so I want to use the time to learn some japanese. =]
I like animes, so I want to learn japanese.
I'll provably use a special method I heard to learn languges quickly. The man who invented it know 25 languges, including japanese. Worth a try.

: Not quite sure what exactly you are asking. If you read the discussion above you will learn how the contributors of this book propose to present the contents of this book. Take care. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:31, 15 October 2008 (UTC)
: I understand your eagerness, but you'll need to be patient.  Currently, there's only two people developing this book.  We're working on this book in our spare time to develop a better path for readers and developers.  If you want a starting point, I would look at learning the Kana first and then the vocabulary on the very first page.   However, if you're learning Japanese to understand anime, you may want to find another source.  There's a few podcasts that teach Japanese, and you'll probably find this useful for listening comprehension.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 05:52, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

:'''Greetings one and all, konnichiha''' or whatever! I was around years months ago, and then was unable to have enough free time to commit to being around here. But I'm back and want to help you guys sort this book out. Also, I've been working on a sort of &quot;phrase book&quot; that is less somber. Is that beyond the scope of Wikibooks? I'm curious what people think about having more than one book regarding studying Japanese. I do want to help make this one nice and shiny though. I was also thinking about polishing off my &quot;phrase book&quot; and presenting that too. To repeat myself, it's a bit humorous, is that taboo here on Wikibooks? I don't know too much about the whole culture here on Wikibooks, so I'd like some feed back about that... and I'd also like a quick update summarizing what needs to be done with this serious book here. Cheers, [[User:Nesnad|Nesnad]] ([[User talk:Nesnad|talk]]) 16:16, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

:: There's already a [[Japanese_Phrasebook|phrasebook]] that you can modify if you wish.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 05:26, 21 October 2008 (UTC)

:: I don't think light spirits are beyond the scope of Wikibooks. The Japanese Phrasebook (which was split from this book) isn't much at all yet, and quite dry at that. It might be difficult to merge your content into it, but go ahead if you want.
:: I would have no problem with multiple books as long as they are clear enough in their distinction for users and contributors to choose between them. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:48, 21 October 2008 (UTC)
::No, no. '''Please don't''' merge my book with that dry list of a phrase book. ''Shudder'' ;-) I mean it's a good list and all, but mine is in a whole other style. My created book is a hybrid between learning and using a phrasebook, quite different than options currently available here so a learner can follow their own personal learning style. I think it will be quite useful, it even has sound files for each bit of dialogue. So now I will go about adding it to our virtual &quot;bookshelf&quot; after I tweak a few things. How should I go about doing that? Cheers, [[User:Nesnad|Nesnad]] ([[User talk:Nesnad|talk]]) 16:33, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

== Have we decided on a contents yet? ==

Hi I've been invited here and I thought I'd try and look around to see if I could help. I'm having trouble figuring out the outline of the book. The outline on the [[Japanese|start page]] and the page you've called [[Japanese/Contents|Contents]] don't agree. I do have some suggestions on what material could be included and how it should arranged, but I'd like some feedback first on what other people's thoughts are before I put work into something that conflicts with others' vision of the work.

I would appreciate it if people can identify for me the precise purpose of this wikibook? Who is it for, what does it cover, how is it meant to be used? [[User:Raichu2|Raichu2]] ([[User talk:Raichu2|talk]]) 09:05, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

: Welcome, Raichu2! This book doesn't have much of an outline. It used to be much worse, though. Discussions relevant to ongoing work is all here on this talk page.
: In ''[[Talk:Japanese#Wow. This is a mess|Wow. This is a mess]]'' we moved away from a strict vision to fill into, to organising the material available (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Japanese&amp;diff=1206960&amp;oldid=1206935 my personal treatise]). This book is never gets attention for as long as it takes and unless we face up to that reality it will never mature, but continue to be rewritten from scratch.
: In ''[[Talk:Japanese#Categorisation|Categorisation]]'' we came up with the categorisation you see on the main page. The reason for why this doesn't match with the [[Japanese/Contents]] page is that before proposing a scheme, I dumped all of the Japanese book pages in [[:Category:Japanese]] onto the contents. Only after sifting through all of them and seeing what was there, did we set up the categorisation. Since the pages on [[Japanese/Contents]] don't yet fit the scheme, it doesn't make much sense to squeeze them into that mold.
: So, the [[Japanese]] page is primarily for students looking for decent study material, while [[Japanese/Contents]] is mainly for contributors looking for existing material to work with (be it merging, re-factoring, deleting, or rewriting). If you would like to propose a change to either, please feel free.
: Since June, we've deleted over fifty pages of unnecessary or duplicate material, navbars, printable versions, and templates. Deletion proposals and discussions go in ''[[Talk:Japanese#Removal Suggestions|Removal Suggestions]]''.
: There hasn't been much discussion on the actual content since Retropunk and I have been working on somewhat separate aspects of this book. ''[[Talk:Japanese#How much to teach (was: what a mess...)|How much to teach]]'' and ''[[Talk:Japanese#Levels|Levels]]'' might be of interest. For development of a consistent curriculum see Retropunk's [[User:Retropunk/Japanese Curriculum]]. He does loads more work on actual contents and might even add information on his approach below. There is a list of proposals on [[Japanese/Contents#Structure/Lesson Plans/Syllabus]].
: As for your specific questions about the purpose of this book; every contributor seems to have a different take on that, much to the book's misfortune. I'm interested in accessibility issues to make it easy for users to find material useful to them and their level. I believe learners would benefit from various [[v:Learning path]]s. With as general a scope as &quot;[[Japanese]]&quot;, I think we should aim to accommodate all.
: That said; pick your path and be bold. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:27, 9 November 2008 (UTC)
: Raichu, I'm glad you've decided to come and take a look.  [[User:Retropunk/Japanese Curriculum]] shows some work I was doing.  The lessons I have in the first portion are not really written in stone, and they're an attempt to better mold the material into a lesson plan.  You'll also see [[User:Junesun|Junesun's]] take on the first couple lessons, which she believes should be very short, concise and involving only a couple grammar points at a time.  You'll also see a big list of items that are traditionally seen on JLPT4 as per the Test Specifications.  I currently have an example from Junesun's lessons at [[User:Retropunk/Japanese_Curriculum/Lesson_1|Lesson 1]], amd you'll see that only the copula and the question particle was really used with a handful of expressions.  Whether this is the best process, we could discuss it.  
: I'm really opened to discuss what should be used, and how it should be formed.  We could probably get Junesun in here, too.  If you know other people who would like to contribute, by all means, invite them.  It's better to have more input.  I would like to know what ideas you have on organizing the material into modules / lesson plans.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 23:27, 9 November 2008 (UTC).

I've been thinking about it, and I think the most challenging aspect is that our audience is the entire world. To be useful, this book (1) needs to cater for readers at all levels, from complete beginners, through those who have done some study but wish to continue learning, to more advanced students who want to improve; and (2) to be really useful should be usable as a reference guide for easily looking up specific points.

We can achieve (1) by a series of graded lessons, where the list of links to the lessons clearly identify what each lesson will teach. That way readers can easily skip material they are know already and can quickly identfy what pages they want to need to visit. Of course beginners should be able to learn by following the pages in order from the beginning.

I don't think we should neglect (2). One cannot remember everything one learns. You might forget how ばかり works, for example. Then when you encounter it in your reading, you would like to quickly find the lesson that deals with it and reread the material. Or you come across something you haven't learned yet, so you might wish to peek ahead so you can understand what you are reading. A simple way to achieve it is an alphabetic list of links to the relevant lessons.

Any comments?

Anyway, I'll have a poke around the existing material and get back to you with any further thoughts I have. I really don't want to start working on individual lessons unless the overall plan is established.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Raichu2|Raichu2]] ([[User talk:Raichu2|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Raichu2|contribs]]) 04:56, 14 November 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: I think graded lessons are useful, and here the various syllabi will come in handy. I also agree that like your idea of a topic index. It will be very tricky to update, though. It'll take some thought to do properly. I think another useful approach is referencing lessons with related material (this will also help students pick the lessons of their choice without having to rely on a specific path).
: Regarding waiting for the overall plan: This book will still be useful if it doesn't cater to all or doesn't provide an all-encompassing syllabus. Yes, we shouldn't set our scope too narrow, but we shouldn't aim too high, either. Why? Because we don't want to end up like [[User:Balloonguy/Japanese#Japanese_Lessons|the others]]. Then what can we do? Structure needn't precede all lesson writing and there's plenty of material here to work with.  For all the good intentions, the majority of systematic work on this book seems to have been on contributors' guides and course structure.
: Now I don't want to detract from the valuable work on these areas by dedicated contributors (such as Retropunk). If you want to work on structre you should collaborate with him or come up with your own. See [[Japanese/Contents#Structure/Lesson Plans/Syllabus]] for more ideas to work with. If you're interested in writing actual lessons, don't wait for structure, just go to work where your interests lie.

: Contributors to actual lessons are somewhat of a rare commodity. For all the good intentions, many seem to have run out of steam before completing the vision they worked so long to develop. None of the pages linked to from the main page are original, but rewrites and refactorings of existing material. There's plenty of grammar points in [[Japanese/Contents#Pure grammar and barely vocab/structure]] that would be useful if patched up and posted on the main page. They'd serve both as lessons in their own right and to benefit whatever learning paths comes along.
: So if lesson writing is your ultimate goal just start editing. Go to the [[Japanese/Contents]] page, pick a topic from [[Japanese/Contents#Pure grammar and barely vocab/structure]] or [[Japanese/Contents#Lessons]] (e.g. adjectives, a specific verb form or expressing time and/or date), fix what's bad, split up the unrelated, merge the duplicates and add what you feel is missing.--[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:36, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

: A couple comments.  I do think we should cater to the masses to make this a great book, and if we lay down the framework, we just need to invite people to participate and hopefully have them adhere to the framework.  These people can be regular contributors, one-timer contributors, guest contributors, or whatever.  The only reason I'm looking at JLPT4 as a basis is because it's generally perceived as the &quot;Beginner's Japanese.&quot;  I was using it as a starting point on generating a framework for topics.  

:The topic index is a good idea. See [[Talk:Japanese#Grammar List Points]] for my concerns about grouping topics and the strict syllabus (i.e., everything goes chronologically.)  If it doesn't make sense, it's okay.  I was probably pretty darn tired when I wrote it.  Just ask for clarifications.    If you would like to discuss lessons and combining grammar/vocab into lessons, you can do so [[User_talk:Retropunk/Japanese_Curriculum | here]].  I have a bunch of the JLPT4 points [[User:Retropunk/Japanese_Curriculum#JLPT_4 | here]], but be aware that some may be wrong and feel free to modify the page.  You can also go ahead and review the first lesson I started, and need to finish over [[User:Retropunk/Japanese_Curriculum/Lesson_1 | here]].   Feel free to comment on it or give feedback. 

: As for future lessons, I'm basically stuck on a few concepts - how to organize the grammar points into lessons and how to go about with the lesson (i.e., use a story, or just give a bunch of examples). [[User:Junesun | Junesun]] gave a bunch of ideas on how to organize lessons [[Talk:Japanese#How_much_to_teach_.28was:_what_a_mess....29 | here]] and [[User:Retropunk/Japanese_Curriculum#Lessons_.28Junesun.29|here]], so it may be fruitful to try and model it after that. If we find it to be too conservative or liberal, we can go ahead and modify it slightly.  This solves the presentation and amount of material to cover, but this still leaves a few problems: finding the grammar points to use, and showing the points in use (e.g., conversation, posters, and etc.,).  

: Lastly, as my contribution history will show, I can become quite busy at times.  I generally can reply around here within a day or so, but sitting and actually writing content or proposing content can sometimes be sporadic.  Don't feel hesitant to add material. If there's some disagreements on presentation, there's always talk/discussion pages.

:Let me know what you think, and happy editing.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 06:30, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

: Sorry I don't understand what Swift means by referencing lessons with related material. Could you elaborate?
: As Retropunk says, I think that if we get a good structure and plan at the outset, then the rest becomes a matter of people filling in the details over time. [[User:Raichu2|Raichu2]] ([[User talk:Raichu2|talk]]) 06:23, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Coordinate Plane==
[[Image:2D_Cartesian_Coordinates.svg|frame|An example of a coordinate plane]]
:A '''Coordinate Plane''' (Also referred to as a Cartesian Plane, after ''René Descartes'') is a 2-dimensional plane with a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. Both axes extend to infinity, but in graphs only segments of them are drawn (and sometimes arrows are used to indicate the infinite length, such as in the picture to the right). The horizonatal axis is known as the ''x-axis'' and the vertical axis is known as the ''y-axis''. The point where they intersect is known as the ''origin''.

===Coordinates of a Point===
:When a point is plotted on a coordinate plane, its ''coordinates'' an be found. The ''x-coordinate'' is the point's distance from the y axis, and the ''y-coordinate'' is the distance from the x-axis. When the coordinates are integer numbers, they can be easily found on a graph by looking at the numbers on the axes. Together, the coordinates can be expressed as an ''ordered pair'' . The ordered pair (4,3) represents a point for squares to the right of the origin and three squares upward from it. On the x-axis, numbers increase toward the right and decrease toward the left. On the y-axis, numbers decrease going downward and increase going upward.

===Plotting an Equation on a Coordinate Plane=== 
:It is also possible to represent an equation on a coordinate plane by plotting multiple ordered pairs. In the case of a linear equation in the form &lt;math&gt;y=mx+b&lt;/math&gt;, the x-coordinate for a given point will be equal to the x variable at that point and likewise the y-coordinate will be equal to the y variable at that point.

:The simplest way to produce a graph of a linear equation is to solve for y at arbitrary values of x and plot the results. In the case of the equation &lt;math&gt;y=2x+4&lt;/math&gt;, if you were graphing for x-coordinates from 0 to 5, you would find the value of y in that equation for all integer values of x from 0 to 5.

::&lt;math&gt;(2*0)+4=4&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(2*1)+4=6&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(2*2)+4=8&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(2*3)+4=10&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(2*4)+4=12&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(2*5)+4=14&lt;/math&gt;

:The resulting ordered pairs are (0,4),(1,6),(2,8),(3,10),(4,12) and (5,14). All linear equations have an infinite number of possible ordered pairs, but for graphing, a finite number will suffice. Plot these coordinate pairs on a sheet of graph paper (Count off the length of the x-coordinate to to right then count the length of the y-coordinate upward if need be). Once all of the points are plotted, draw a line connecting them. This line represents all the values of the equation &lt;math&gt;y=2x+4&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x=5&lt;/math&gt;.

In the northeast united states, smaller streams spend much of the year around 50°F.  They lack the powerful currents needed to gauge deep pools in the bedrock.  Most of the year these smaller waters are optimal for trout during the fall-spring seasons.  Trout populations are often heavily stocked.
However, once the summer begins, temperatures rise.  Abundant insect life, from its many shallow reaches, offer good minnow populations and warm-water fish cautiously push upstream.  By early summer a considerable diversity of game fish can lie in a smaller stream that had nothing but trout in early spring.  This water can be considered a 'seasonal' river since it hosts similar fisheries than a much larger river.

==Differences with Rivers==
There are some similarities in fishing seasonal rivers.  Fisheries have similar needs and preferences on all waters and often react similar ways to current and food.  However, Fishing these smaller waters does call for a similar yet different approach.  Listed in some dominant differences.

**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.

* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:18, 5 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Ugly Pages ==

There's nothing more deterring to readers then ugly &quot;wall of text&quot; pages. Maybe dense pages of text are good for [[Wikibooks:Reading Levels|some readers]], but for most a better and richer formatting is required. Books needing formatting help are typically in the '''Revise''' or '''Review''' stages.

{{Info|Note that pages needing formatting may also benefit from improvements to [[../Visuals|Visuals]].}}

== The Wikitext Solution ==

[[Editing Wikitext|Wikitext]] provides a number of tools that you can use to break up large blocks of text:

#Numbered and bullet lists
#Definitions &lt;nowiki&gt;; and :&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#Preformatted text
#Tables
#Headings and Subheadings.
#Images

We've also provided a number of templates that can be used to set text apart from the main paragraph structure: {{tlx|TextBox}}, {{tlx|LeftHalf}}, and {{tlx|RightHalf}}. Also, other templates can be used like {{tlx|SideBox}}, {{tlx|LeftBox}}, {{tlx|Info}} and {{tlx|warning}}. These all help to break large blocks of text up into managable bits.

== The HTML Solution? ==

You can write stuff in HTML, but consider the cost. You gain some additional control over presentation, but your book becomes harder to edit. Also, if you do something clever on one page, consistency demands that you continue that clever presentation on other pages as well. You could end up spending more time and energy adding clever formatting to pages and fixing it when unwitting editors break it, than you spend actually writing your book. If you do want to use fancy formatting, consider putting it all into templates.

== The CSS Solution ==

There is a '''Per-Book Javascript''' gadget that enables books to provide their own custom Javascripts and CSS Stylesheets. This can be nice for increasing the aesthetics of a page, but keep in mind that most users (and almost all casual readers) won't activate this gadget.

== The Upper Limit ==

Books don't need to be works of art. Accessibility and Editability demand that books keep formatting to a minimum, so people can more easily edit them. This is the purpose of wikitext in the first place, to be more simple then HTML or LaTeX so people can contribute more easily. Using Wikitext is really the best option when formatting a book, because it's simple to implement and it's easy to edit.

When formatting or reformatting a book, keep in mind that it doesn't need to be a work of art. Being too fancy is actually a bad thing. Use some basic wikitext and some templates on the page in a consistent way, and it will make an amazing difference.

== Improving Formatting ==

Some things to do to improve the formatting of a book:

# Improve the look of any page header templates or other book-specific templates
# Make sure all templates are used consistently throughout the book
# Break long blocks of text up with headings, lists, tables, diagrams, and other features.</text>

== Verifying Edits ==

The FlaggedRevs extension enables us to verify certain page edits and flag them as being held to a particular level of quality. When additional edits are made, the quality could potentially go down, so we can configure the page to only show the most recently verified version of the page to readers by default, until later edits can be similarly reviewed. Books needing review are typically in the '''Review''' or '''Featured''' states.

{{info|While reviewing, problems with the book or individual pages may become apparent that require [[../Formatting|Formatting]], [[../Style|Style]], or other [[../Cleanup|Cleanup]] work.}}

== Verifying a book ==

To review and verify a book, you need to have the [[WB:RFA|appropriate flags]]. Getting them is easy enough, and I won't waste time describing it all here. In order to verify the quality of an entire book, you must go through and grade each page individually.

You don't need to pick through the page with a magnifying glass and tweezers. Give it a quick read-over, and check if the page is a decent quality. Is the writing consistent and of a high quality? Is the page verifiable? Does the page have sufficient coverage? These rankings are a judgment call, and some reviewers will naturally grade some pages higher or lower than others. This is fine. It is never worth while to quarrel over a page ranking, the quality of the page could change dramatically after the next edit anyway.

Pick a couple pages per day and review them. It won't be long before you've reviewed the whole book. Then, you just need to keep up with changes over time which is much easier.

== Featured Quality? ==

If a book is featured, that doesn't mean you have to rush in and mark every single page as being &quot;Featured Quality&quot;. This is probably not the truth anyway. Mark pages naturally, and grade each page individually from other pages or from the book at large. Keep in mind that the book itself may have an emergent quality to it, where it is better in whole then the individual parts are. If you have a featured book where all of the pages are reviewed with relatively low scores, it might be a sign that the book is not featured quality.

== Improving Review Coverage ==

# Read and evaluate individual pages. Leave notes on the talk page about any large issues that you find
# [[Help:Revision review|Sight the page]] for quality, being honest and leaving a summary comment
# Mark the TOC of the book and possibly the offending pages of the book with cleanup templates like {{tlx|stub}}, {{tlx|cleanup}}, or {{tlx|npov}}
# Nominate good books for [[WB:FBN|featured status]].
# Nominate very bad books for [[WB:VFD|deletion]].</text>

== Visuals ==

Books need visuals. They can illustrate certain points in ways that words never can. They can help break up large monotonous text. Images are more important for some books then for others, but they can find a home in all books in some way. Books needing visuals are typically in the '''Expand''', '''Revise''' and '''Review''' stages of development. Pages needing improved visuals may also need additional textual content to explain and reference those visuals.

== Adding Images ==

Find related images and insert them into the text. Don't try to get too fancy with positioning the image, or adding a caption, or a border or anything.

=== Raiding Commons ===

Commons has tons of images, go there and do a search for some key terms from your book and see what pops up.

=== Integrating Images ===

Once you have images for your book, you need to integrate them. Make sure they are positioned nicely in the text. Make sure you explain them and reference them from the text itself.</text>

== Style ==

Having lots of content in a book is one thing, having lots of ''good'' content is another entirely. Some books need to add more content, and some need to improve the content they already have. Working on style is all about improving content. Style of composition is one of the metrics that are used when reviewing a page, so getting it right is important and will have an effect on the way the page is viewed by readers and treated by editors. Books that need style help are typically in the '''Revise''' or '''Review''' states.

Note that improving the style of a page or a book may involve the creation of significant amounts of new content.

== Content Dumps ==

Content can come from anywhere. It can be imported from Wikipedia, donated and converted to Wikitext from authors elsewhere in the internet, or dumped into the editor as a stream of consciousness without rhyme or reason. In all these cases, the content will have a very long journey before it's considered &quot;good&quot; stylistically. 

== Style Checklist ==

When working to improve the style of a book, there are a few things worth noticing:

# Consistency. Books need to be consistent in style from one page to the next, and in the page from one paragraph to the next.
# Voice. Make sure the same narrative is being directed at the same audience throughout
# Spelling. Many browsers include spell checking functionality now. Just do it right.
# Grammar. Harder than spelling since it isn't as easy to automate, grammar is still very important and can negatively impact readability if it's really neglected.
# Structure. Make sure the page flows from easy to hard, that later things build on earlier things in a logical way. Don't jump around too much or go off on tangents&amp;mdash;use a separate page to talk about a separate topic.

== How To Improve Style ==

# Fix spelling and grammar mistakes
# Use proper terminology (keeping in mind the target audience)
# Break long blocks of text up with headings, lists, tables, diagrams, or other effects.
# Read, review, and revise paragraphs for consistency in voice and presentation.</text>

== Book Names ==

Wikibooks doesn't have a hard policy about what names can and cannot be used for a book. However, there are times when the title of a book doesn't appropriately match the content that the book contains. In these cases, the best way to procede is to have the book renamed to something better. 

== Renaming A Book ==

Here are some things that you can do to pursue a book rename (which is a bit of a big deal):

# Solicit feedback on the book's main talk page, or in the [[WB:CHAT|reading room]]. 
# Come up with a good new name for the book, and make sure it isn't taken.
# Post a notice on the front of the book with {{tlx|Move}}
# Move all pages to the new name
# Clean up double-redirects
# Make sure the book is properly categorized so people can find it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/New Book Page}}

== Monolithic Pages ==

Sometimes as a book is being developed the content is just dumped onto the page in a disorderly manner. If this happens quickly enough, the page will become large and monolithic with dozens of headings and mountains of text. This makes things hard to navigate, and makes pages hard to edit. It also puts a large drain on the server and increases load times. At Wikibooks, we encourage (and basically require) that you break books into a collection of pages, each with a reasonable size. A page should be able to cover a single topic to an acceptable degree. Other topics and advanced details about the same topic can be moved into other pages.

== Outlining ==

Like creating a new book from scratch, spliting an existing monolithic book into subpages will benefit from creating a good plan and an outline. Know what pages you want, what content goes on each, and what order they should be in. Create the links, then start copy+pasting code from one to the other. A browser that uses tabs makes things a lot easier. You can open all the pages in different tabs or different windows, and do all the work in one shot. Otherwise you need to copy sections, move to the next page, and paste it in before flipping back. It can get quite tedious!

== Breaking into Subpages ==

Here are some things you can do to break a page into subpages:

# Create an outline for what you want the book to look like, either in your user space or on the main talk page of the book.
# Mark the main page of the book with {{tlx|Subpages}}
# Solicit feedback from community members on [[WB:CHAT]] or on the main talk page of the book
# Create a TOC with redlinks on the page
# Copy+Paste content from the main page to each of the subpages
# Make sure to tag all pages with a page header template and with a category of the name of the book</text>

      <comment>/* Mars */ ce</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Mercury=

Mercury has no moons.

=Venus=

Venus has no moons.

=Earth=

Earth has one moon, usually called &quot;the Moon&quot; and sometimes called Luna.  It is the fifth largest moon in the solar system.  Of all the moons of the eight planets, Earth's moon is by far the largest relative to its planet, with a diameter of 3476 km and hence a ratio to Earth's diameter of 0.2764.  By comparison, the next largest moon relative to a major planet (Triton of Neptune) has a diameter ratio of just .0546. The Moon's diameter is over 50% greater than that of the dwarf planet Pluto.

=Mars=

Mars has two very small moons, both discovered by Asaph Hall. Deimos was  discovered Deimos on August 12, 1877. Deimos, the outermost moon, was named for the Greek god of panic. Deimos has a diameter of just 16 km. The inner moon Phobos has a diameter of 26 km and is heavily cratered. Phobos was discovered on August 18, 1877. Phobos was named for the Greek god of fear.  Deimos and has far fewer craters then Phobos and the craters are also much smaller.

=Jupiter=
Jupiter currently has 64 discovered satellites and 1 not identified object- like- satellite, but the four Galilean moons (Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa) are by far the largest (in that order).

==Ganymede==

Ganymede is the largest planetary satellite in the solar system. With a diameter of 5268 km, it is about 8% larger than the planet Mercury. It is also the only moon in the Solar System with its own magnetosphere. Ganymede was discovered on January 7, 1610 by Galileo Galilei, along with Io, Europa, and Callisto.

==Callisto==

Callisto is the second largest Jovian moon (that is, moon of Jupiter), and third in the Solar System (with a diameter of 4820 km).  It is 98% of the size of Mercury.  Callisto has the oldest surface in the Solar System (this means is the most heavily cratered body in the Solar System) even older than Mercury's.  Callisto was discovered in 1610, along with Io, Europa, and Ganymede.

==Io==

Io (pronounced EYE-oh) is the third largest Jovian moon and the fourth largest moon in the solar system.  It is slightly bigger than Earth's moon, with a diameter of 3642 km.

===Discovery/History===

[[Image:Io highest resolution true color.jpg|right|170px|thumb|Wikimedia Commons True Color Image]]Io has had a long history since its discovery in 1610 by Galileo Galilei.  Telescope technology limited observations of Io until the late 1800s when large scale features were able to be resolved on its surface.  Observations show that Io has areas of red, brown, orange, and yellow which were later attributed to the abundance of sulfur and sodium on the surface and the unusually high amount of volcanic activity.  Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system.  Its activity is due to a great deal of tidal heating from Jupiter and a resonant orbit with Jupiter’s other moons.

===Origin of Internal Energy===
Io has a similar density to our moon, but is made mostly of sulfur compounds&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothery&quot;&gt;Rothery, D. 1992, Satellites of Outer Planets, pp.138-142&lt;/ref&gt;.  Io experiences a large amount of tidal heating because it orbits Jupiter at a relatively close distance of 422,000 km and gravitational interactions with other [[w:Galilean moons|Galilean moons]].  Jupiter’s large gravitational field and Io’s interactions with other satellites have resulted in an orbital resonance between Io, [[w:Europa (moon)| Europa]], and [[w:Ganymede (moon)| Ganymede]] which means their orbital periods are integer multiples of each other&lt;ref name=&quot;Christiansen&quot;&gt;Christiansen, E. 1995, Exploring the Planets, pp.331-333&lt;/ref&gt;.  [[Image:PIA00703.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Wikimedia Commons Io Eruption Plume Image]]For each orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times, this forces Io to have a more eccentric orbit.  The eccentric orbit means that Io's orbital distance continuously varies, which causes expansion and contraction of its tidal bulge.  This frictional energy is dissipated in the form of heat.  Io’s internal heat melts the sulfur-rich core into liquid magma, which is contained in large subsurface chambers&lt;ref name=&quot;Weissman&quot;&gt;Weissman, Paul R. 1999, Encyclopedia of the Solar System, pp.359-363&lt;/ref&gt;.  This process raises the internal pressure of Io and causes volcanic activity.  It is believed that Io has a thin rigid lithosphere and a constant flowing liquid mantle due to its constant internal heating.  It is estimated that the power dissipation from tidal interaction is two orders of magnitude greater than radioactive decay.  For this reason, Io has a maximum observed temperature of ~1800K- the second highest in the solar system&lt;ref name=&quot;Weissman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Another manifestation of the large power dissipation is a large heat flow, 30 times larger than found in Earth’s volcanoes.

===Volcanic Features===
It is not surprising that Io’s surface is dominated by volcanic features.  The surface is littered with pit craters, calderas (volcanic craters), lava flows, shield volcanoes, ash plains, sulfur (S) deposits and other features.  [[Image:Tvastarpic2.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Image of Active lava flows in the Tvashtar Paterae region.  Images taken by Galileo in 1999 and 2000]]There are over 500 volcanoes on the surface of Io.  There are also over 200 calderas, some of which stretch up to 200km across; these calderas are surrounded by different patterns such as bright rings from condensing sulfur ejecta&lt;ref name=&quot;Christiansen&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Volcanic eruptions cause these plumes of ejecta, which can be sprayed up to a height of 300km and 1000km in diameter&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothery&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  The formation of the ejecta plumes is determined by the type of eruption and the characteristics of the material ejected (i.e. molecular composition or phase of matter).  Large lava flows are common on the surface due to large volcanic plume velocities of ~1km/s.  Lava flows create intervent planes which are areas between volcanoes where lava flows are frequently resurfacing, keeping them flat&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartmann&quot;&gt;Hartmann, W. 1993, Moons &amp; Planets, p.387&lt;/ref&gt;.  Unlike the Earth, there has been no evidence shown that Io has plate tectonics; there are also anomalous isolated mountains in the polar regions&lt;ref name=&quot;Christiansen&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Plasma Torus===
Recently, it has been discovered that Io has a plasma torus.  The plasma torus is created by the volcanoes that eject sodium and sulfur gas and plasma into Io’s atmosphere.  Since Io is not very massive it is not able to hold a substantial atmosphere, leaving behind a “tail” which follows Io’s orbit around Jupiter.  Jupiter’s magnetic field strips off more than 1000kg of Io's material per second&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;&gt;Galilean Moons: Io, NASA/JPL 2008, http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/moons/io.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  The plasma torus is held in place by Jupiter’s large magnetic field, which causes the charged particles (protons and electrons) in the field to orbit a center of rotation, which causes these particles to stay in a relatively small area.  Some of these ions are drawn towards Jupiter’s atmosphere by its magnetic field lines, when these ions interact with Jupiter’s atmosphere, auroras are created.  The excess stripped ions in the torus double the size of Jupiter’s magnetosphere compared with theoretical calculations&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.   Spectral observations show that Io’s torus and ionosphere are depleted by processes that produce a large nebula expanding out to ~500 Jupiter radii&lt;ref&gt;Mendillo, M. 2007, The Source of Sodium Escaping from Io revealed by spectral high definition imaging, Nature Journal, Vol.448, pp.330-332&lt;/ref&gt;.  One of the latest methods of studying the plasma torus is with high resolution (R~120000) spectra of neutral oxygen emissions (630nm) as well as other emissions with the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) instrument in Madison, Wisconsin.  These observations have shown that emissions show significant long and short-term variations of oxygen emissions.  Since intensity variations exist along with a long-term intensity average, it has been concluded that the emissions cause an interaction between Io’s torus and its atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;Oliversen, R. 2001, Sunlit Io Atmospheric 6300A Emission and the Plasma Torus, Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 106, pp.183-193&lt;/ref&gt;.  The reason for studying emissions is to measure the composition as well as velocity structures.  This spectra is being taken with a dual Fabry-Perot etalon system to filter out the multiple orders that are produced by etalons&lt;ref&gt;Oliversen, R. 2008, Observation of Io and the Plasma Torus During 2007 and 2008, Unpublished&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Io's Surface and Subsurface===
[[Image:PIA01129 Interior of Io.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Wikimedia Commons Io Interior Image]]Research is also being directed towards Io’s surface and subsurface processes.  Scientists are currently trying to map the anti-Jovian hemisphere as well as analyze volcanic, tectonic, and other processes affecting the region&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;Williams, D. 2008, Volcanism on Io: Insights from Global Geologic Mapping, American Geophysical Union&lt;/ref&gt;.  Observations show that Io’s entire surface is constantly changing because of subsurface processes, but most eruptions are found to be confined to isolated areas.  Volcanic events only take place on about 17% of the surface which points back to the large lava flows that can extend up to 1000km&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Similar to Earth’s geysers, Io’s fissures release gases and liquids like sulfur vapor up to 225km and can last for days.  Io’s surface has been found to be very active and volatile; it has been observed that changes in volcanic spray were detected in a 5.5 hour period.  A New Frontiers class mission named Argus is a planned mission to send a spacecraft to Io that would orbit the moon 40 times at about 100km altitude.  The goal of the mission is to attempt to answer basic questions about the possible habitation of planetary bodies like Europa and Enceladus, which are both under the influence of significant tidal heating&lt;ref&gt;Chen, E. 2008, Argus: A New Frontiers Mission to Observe Io, Unpublished&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Europa==
Europa is the solar system's sixth largest moon.  With a diameter of 3120 km, Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's moon, and is substantially larger than the dwarf planet Pluto. Europa has the smoothest and one of the youngest surface in the Solar System, Scientist think that Europa might have  a liquid ocean under its icy crust and thus, scientist think it may harbor life. Europa was discovered in January 7 1610 by Galileo Galilee in 1610 at the same time that Io, Ganymede, and Callisto were found.

==The remaining 60 moons==
Jupiter has other remaining 60 moons (some may be captured Asteroids some may not) are all far smaller than Ganymede, Callisto, Io and Europa even the fifth largest moon of Jupiter has a diameter under 200 km. The other moons names in order are in the Inner Group: (since Jupiter has a lot of moons they are divided into groups) Metis, Adrastea, Amathea and Thebe followed by the Themisto group with only one member which is Temistho. The Himalia Group: Leda Himalia,Lysithea, and Elara. The Carpo Group which only member is the moon Carpo. An unamed group which only member is an unnamed moon (S\2003 J 12). Anake Group: Anake, Praxidike, Harpalyke, Iocaste, Euanthe, Thyone, Euporie , S/2003 J 3 , S/2003 J 18 , Thelxinoe , Helike , Orthosie , S/2003 J 16 , Hermippe , Mneme , S/2003 J 15 and S/2010 J 2. The Carme Group: Herse , S/2003 J 10 , Pasithee , Chaldene , Arche , Isonoe , Erinome , Kale , Aitne , Taygete , S/2003 J 9 , Carme , S/2003 J 5 , S/2003 J S/2003 J 19, Kalyke , Eukelade and  Kallichore. The Pasiphae Group: Eurydome , S/2003 J 23 , Hegemone , Pasiphaë , Sponde , Cyllene , Megaclite , S/2003 J 4 , Callirrhoe , Sinope , Autonoe , Aoede , Kore and S/2010 J 1 and the final group is another unnamed group with an only moon with a group all of its own (S\2003 J 2)

=Saturn=

Saturn has 62  moons.

===Titan===
Titan is the second largest moon in the solar system; with a diameter of 5150 km, it is slightly smaller than Jupiter's Ganymede; it is larger than the planet Mercury.  Titan is the only planetary moon having a dense atmosphere. Titan's atmosphere is mostly composed of nitrogen with a trace of methane.  Titan's Atmosphere is by far the densest of any satellite in the Solar System, being 50-60% denser than Earth's atmosphere.  Other moons, if they have atmospheres (which the majority don't), have less than 1/1000 the pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea level.  The Atmosphere on Titan is dense enough for there to be rain; however, the rain is liquid methane.  The temperature on Titan is so low (-333 degrees Fahrenheit) that methane is a liquid.

==Rhea==
Rhea is the second largest moon of Saturn and the ninth largest moon in the Solar System, with a diameter of 1528 km. The moon has a possible ring system. Rhea's low density of 1.23 suggests that it is composed of 75% water ice and 25% rock.

==Iapetus==
Iapetus is the third largest moon of Saturn and the 11th largest moon in the Solar System. Iapetus holds the record for the Farthest Round Major moon of any Planet\Dwarf Planet being 93 times farther from Saturn than the Moon from the Earth. Iapetus diameter is 1472 miles (735 km). Half its surface is extremely bright while the other is extremely dark.

==Dione==
Dione is the second densest moon of Saturn (after Titan) at a density of 1.47 this means that it has more rocky material within than the other moons. Dione has a face which it's heavily cratered and another that it's almost completely clean of craters. At a diameter of 1122 km, Dione is the fourth largest moon of Saturn and the 15th largest in the Solar System

==Tethys==
Tethys is similar to Dione in many ways like size number of craters ext... .Tethys is the 16th largest moon of the Solar System and the 5th largest of Saturn. Investigation and Research indicates that in the past, Tethys was a giant ball of liquid water that with the temperatures of the outer Solar System froze eventually

==Enceladus==
Enceladus is the 17 largest moon of the Solar System at 500 km across. Enceladus is the only Moon of the Solar System that shoots tons of water from its inside to outer space. Enceladus is much smaller than Titan, Rhea, Iapetu, Dione and Tethys but much bigger than Mimas, the Smallest round moon of Saturn.

==Mimas==
Mimas is the smallest round moon of Saturn and the 20th largest moon of the Solar System at a diameter of 396 km. Mimas has a huge crater being almost as half a big as Mimas itself which it would have been a little bigger and it would have destroyed Mimas.

==Hyperion and Phoebe==  
Hyperion is the 8th largest moon of Saturn and 23rd in the Solar System. Hyperion is the only moon in the Solar System that rotates chaotically. The density of Hyperion is one of the lowest in the Solar System at 0.5 grams per cubic centimetres which is lower than Saturn's which is 0.7 grams per cubic centimetre. Phoebe is the ninth largest moon of Saturn and one of the largest irregular moons in the Solar Sytem at a diameter of 220 km. Like Hyperion, Phoebe's rotation is not the same as its year, however Phoebe's rotation can be determined while Hyperions's cannot.  Phoebe rotates once every eleven hours while its year is 550 days.

==Triton==
Triton is the seventh largest moon in the solar system; its diameter of 2705 km is about 10% larger than the Dwarf Planet Pluto. Scientists believe that this moon is really an object that has been captured by Neptune's gravity. Triton is one of the coldest bodies in the Solar System being even colder than Pluto at -393 degrees Fahrenheit. In 360,000,000 years it is expected to pass the Neptune roche limit and disintegrate to form a planetary ring system

==Nereid== 
Nereid is the third largest moon of Neptune at 170 km in Diameter. Nereid is also one of the few moons in the Solar System that its year is not the same as its rotation

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

Serine proteases are [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases|proteases]] that have serine, an amino acid, bonded at the active site. Their main function in humans is digestion, however they also function in processes such as inflammation, blood clotting, and the immune system in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Serine proteases are grouped depending on their structure. Major groups of serine proteases include alpha hydrolase, beta hydrolase, and signal peptidase.
The serine proteases is the enzyme that catalyze the hydrolysis of ester or amide. This reaction involves the reaction of acylation of the hydroxyl group of Ser-195. The substrate forms a tetrahedral intermediate by attacking of Ser-195 on the carboxyl group of the substrate since the active site of the enzyme is complementary to the transition state of the reaction.


Proteases, proteinases, peptidases describe the same group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of covalent peptide bonds. Serine proteases are grouped into clans that share structural homology and then further subgrouped into families that share close sequence homology. In the case of serine protease, the mechanism of the protease is based on the nucleophilic attack of the targeted peptidic bond by a serine. 

Cysteine, threonine or water molecules associated with aspartate or metals may also play this role. In many cases the nucleophilic property of the group is improved by the presence of a histidine, held in a &quot;proton acceptor state&quot; by an aspartate. Aligned side chains of serine, histidine and aspartate build the catalytic triad common to most serine proteases.

The active site of serine proteases is shaped as a cleft where the polypeptide substrate binds. Schechter and Berger [1] labeled amino acid residues from N to C term of the polypeptide substrate (Pi, ..., P3, P2, P1, P1', P2', P3', ..., Pj) and their respective binding sub-sites Si,..., S3, S2, S1, S1', S2', S3',..., Sj) . The cleavage is catalyzed between P1 and P1'. 

Many proteases are synthesized and secreted as inactive forms called zymogens and subsequently activated by proteolysis. This changes the architecture of the active site of the enzyme. 

Few examples are: Chymotrypsin, trypsin, and elastase.

&lt;u&gt;'''Chymotrypsin'''&lt;/u&gt;

Synthesized as inactive proenzymes (chymotrypsinogen)

Formation of key acyl-enzyme intermediate

Catalytic residues are Ser195 and His57

&lt;u&gt;'''X-ray Structure'''&lt;/u&gt;

~240-residue monomeric proteins, 4 disulfide bridges

Two folded domains with antiparallel b-sheets (barrel-like) and little helix

Catalytic triad - His57 and Ser195 located at substrate binding site along with Asp102, which is buried in solventinaccessible pocket.

&lt;u&gt;Chymotrypsin&lt;/u&gt; - prefers bulky Phe, Trp, or Tyr in hydrophobic pocket.

&lt;u&gt;Trypsin&lt;/u&gt; - prefers Arg and Lys in binding pocket (Ser189 replaced by Asp).

&lt;u&gt;Elastase&lt;/u&gt; - prefers Ala, Gly, Val in its depression site

&lt;u&gt;'''Catalytic Mechchanism'''&lt;/u&gt;

Bound substrate is attacked by nucleophilic Ser195 forming transition state complex (tetrahedral intermediate), His57 takes up H+, which is facilitated by Asp102.

Tetrahedral intermediate decomposes to acyl-enzyme intermediate by His57 (general acid).

Acyl-enzyme intermediate is deacylated by reverse of above steps, release of carboxylate product, H2O is nucleophile and Ser195 is leaving group.

Enzyme prefers binding transition state to either Michaelis complex or acyl-enzyme intermediate forms.

Catalytic triad serves to form low-barrier hydrogen bonds in the transition state (assisted by hydrophobic environment).

&lt;u&gt;Zymogens&lt;/u&gt;:

Inactive (proenzyme) forms

Enzyme inhibitors (pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) or zymogen granules prevent activation

Active sites are distorted

Serine proteases are sequence specific. While cascades of protease activations control blood clotting and complement, other proteasesare involved in signalling pathways, enzyme activation and degradative functions in different cellular or extracellular compartments.

Threonine proteases are [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases|proteases]] that have threonine, an amino acid, bonded at the active site. It is responsible for functioning proteasome, the large protein-degrading apparatus. Threonine proteases haveaA conserved N-terminal threonine at each active site. Pre-proteins, which are catalytic beta subunits, are activated when the N-terminus is cleaved off. This makes threonine the N-terminal residue.

Threonine proteases are activated by primary amines. The mechanism for the threonine protease was described first in 1995. The mechanism showed the cleaving of a peptide bond which made an amino acid residue (usually serine, threonine, or cysteine) or a water molecule become a good nucleophile which could perform a nucleophilic attack on the carboxyl group of the peptide. The amino acid residue (in this case threonine) is usually activated by a histidine residue.

===Distance Learning to enhance current practices in the K-12 classroom curriculum===

Sadaf A Durrani

==Introduction==

Distance learning is an effective means of delivering education material to students who are not physically located in the same school, state or country. This means have opened up a new area for educators to interact within. No longer will the age old adage of “walking 5 miles to get to school” be true as students will be able to access educational material within their home settings rather than being confined to a school classroom. There are two main branches involved in distance learning which are synchronous and asynchronous learning. Synchronous learning involves all participants being present at the same time while asynchronous learning environments do not require the participants to be present at the same time and allows for individual student growth. Some examples of synchronous learning environments would be web conferencing and asynchronous environments would be email, message boards or forums and video learning. In addition to distance learning E-learning (electronic learning)(http://www.k12.com) a component of distance learning involves almost no person-to-person interaction rather coursework is delivered to the student and do not require any interaction between the course instructor and the student as the material is readily available.  

It cannot be disputed that distance learning has opened up a completely new area of opportunities for people who may not have been able to attend college due to a variety of personal or financial reasons and now is able to work towards accomplishing their goals. One of the benefits of this particular learning style is that one is able to be in control of their own schedule and timetable rather then is restricted to a classroom timetable. At times student may require a bit more time to truly understand and apply a particular concept of a course and following the classroom timetable may just have them complete the task at hand but not comprehend the material being presented. However at the same time distance learning does not provide the same nurturing environment one may experience in a classroom setting. For some students the positive reinforcement provided in a classroom may be the motivation that is required for them to do better and to exceed expectations which were set forth by the instructors. The one sided learning that is the norm for distance learning does not provide the social interaction which is available in classrooms and does not help in developing social skills. There are many opportunities in education for distance learning to apply to all disciplines.

==Brief History of Teaching Practices== 

A brief history of current teaching practices indicates that students are often times learning from textbooks that are over 20 years old. The material in the books may not be relevant with respect to the time that book is being utilized in. For example, a science textbook from the 1980’s would not reflect the advances in the field of science, which occurred during the 1990’s unless the published textbook was updated by the author. Often time’s students in classroom settings suffer from repetition of old out dated material rather then learn from new techniques. With the ease of accessibility to the Internet students, have discovered a new manner in which to obtain information, do research, and acquire new skills all from the privacy of their own homes. Most students do not need to access the local library for information as the Internet has provided them a platform to search and obtain the information. Moving forward integrating technology especially the Internet within the classroom would enhance the classroom learning experience as educators would be able to link up to other classrooms in the country and create a wider audience for the students to learn from and interact with.


==Current Teaching Practices Enhanced by Distance Learning==

For students in the kindergarten class integrating technology into the classroom would help them develop computer literacy skills at an earlier stage. For example, currently kids in that particular grade set are able to use technology such as V-Tech® to recognize different shapes, sounds, and letters. Through distance learning students in kindergarten classes may be able to link up to, other students who are in the same class but in a different school district, and interact with them via a web conference or a classroom activity. Thereby changing a static classroom activity into a fun and exciting experience for the students enhancing their learning and encouraging social interaction with other kids who they may not know. 

Students in grade school could benefit from a distance-learning program as students who may not be social butterflies may benefit from being able to express themselves in a nonjudgmental manner via technology. Similarly, students in grade school students could benefit from joining another virtual classroom for a particular subject area that may be discussed that day. Distance learning in this particular case could enhance and address topics that students may not be able to discuss openly either due to peer pressure or due to other factors. Creating a chat room for the particular topics being discussed in the classroom may enable to the students to address and ask question therefore taking an active approach to learning rather than the static approach. Often times is limited by the classroom time or the curriculum being taught not allowing enough time to address any questions students may have later on about a topic. A forum or chat room setting would enable the students to address questions for a particular topic discussed in the classroom and give those students who may miss the class an opportunity to learn what they missed.  

One of the classes that students may benefit the most from with respect to distance learning would be any foreign language course. By linking up with another group of students who know the language, students may be able to teach others at a level which would encourage them to learn and participate in their learning. For example, students in the city who are learning the Spanish language connect with students in Latin America who may be trying to learn English, interact with each other, and teach each other rather then being taught by instructors who in this particular case could supervise the learning. One of the website that which encourage this particular manner of learning is K12 Academics (http://www.k12academics.com). This website gathers and creates an environment which is contains content from schools curriculum accounting to the standards of the particular state and helps build on the foundations that the student would have received within the classroom setting. The distance-learning program encourages students to develop their own individual strengths and helps to minimize the weaknesses by providing information that students would be able to grasp at their own pace rather then just with the pace of the entire class. This particular website has helped textbooks come to life and provides educators with lesson plans to help them plan their classroom activities and allows the students to continue the learning at home. This type of distance learning program has created an environment which enhances the learning environment from no longer being limited to the classroom rather it has shown students that any place can become a learning environment. By providing online lessons for the students to participate in and summer school as well so that students who may need a little extra time to cover particular topics enough of a head start so that they are able to stay with their classmates rather then fall behind. 

The same particular website has created and encouraged a different learning experience for students in high school as well. This program has offered an online course option that is and can be integrated into the current high school curricula for the students to follow to encourage an active learning environment. An example of integrating this type of environment could again be similar to the use in grammar school especially for the foreign language classes, by connecting with another class in any part of the world such as for those students learning French can be tutored by students in France would create an open dialogue and create new friendships. It also targets and caters to the needs to Advance Placement students as well as the Gift and Talented student programs. Enhancing a high school curriculum may be a difficult task but integrating technology and distance learning into the curricula have provided students with new learning opportunities to take advantage of and to gain experience form. Technology which was not in existence about 10 -15 years ago such as graphic designing software has enabled students to develop a new area of interest and skills which will help them in the long run as they work towards their long term career goals. Learning new skills can always leave a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment in students thereby enhancing the learning experience as well as promoting new methods such as distance learning to be integrated into the static classroom settings. 

==Closing Remarks==
Distance learning has provided a new platform for students to be excited about school and the learning process rather then dread being in school. Students can be excited about the opportunities being provided to them by their school districts encouraging them not to be limited just the by resources but to expand their horizons and develop new skills. Although distance learning has opened up a whole new area for students to enhance and improve their skills this form of learning will not be able to replace the value of an instructor being present in the classroom for questions as well as interaction time. As students learn at various levels and speeds distance learning can enhance the value of the content being discussed in the classroom however it may not be able to replace the discussion which only can occurs within the classroom. Studies&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt; have shown that regardless of how one may feel about distance learning this form of learning can only be effective if there is an instructor involved who is able to supervise and maintain the integrity of the information being presented to the students reassuring that the curricula of the school is being adhered.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics Computer graphics] are graphics created by computers and, more generally, the representation and manipulation of pictorial data by a computer.

== Purpose ==

The purpose of this book is to convey the principles of computer graphics in an easy to read manner. The reader need not have an advanced understanding of mathematics in order to comprehend what is being presented. The reason this book is being written (by one of the authors) is to get a more complete and in-depth understanding of the computer graphics field.

== History ==
 
History goes here...

== Vectors ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector See here for an overview on Vectors]

== Matrices ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) See here for an overview on Matrices]

== 2D Computer Graphics ==

The simplest computer graphics is in two dimensions. Later on we will go on to three dimensions where things get progressively more complex. 

=== Line Segment ===

It's pretty easy to draw a line on the screen. All you need to do is create points between two endpoints on the screen. To accomplish this first though you need the [equation of a line] 

=== Circle ===

=== Square ===

=== Curves ===

==== Curve Continuity ====

==== Bezier Curve ====

==== B-Spline Curve ====

== 3D Computer Graphics ==

Great, we have a solid understanding of the 2D world. Now let us graduate to 3D! Of course all that we have learned in 2D can be automatically used in the 3D world.

=== Line Segment ===

=== Sphere === 

=== Cube ===

=== Surfaces ===



== Glossary ==

=== Phong Shading ===
Phong shading refers to a set of techniques in 3D computer graphics. Phong shading combines a model for the reflection of light from surfaces with a compatible method of estimating pixel colors using interpolation of surface normals across rasterized polygons.

=== Gouraud Shading === 
Gouraud shading, named after Henri Gouraud, is a method used in computer graphics to simulate the differing effects of light and colour across the surface of an object. In practice, Gouraud shading is used to achieve smooth lighting on low-polygon surfaces without the heavy computational requirements of calculating lighting for each pixel. Gouraud first published the technique in 1971.

=== NURBS ===
Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) is a mathematical model commonly used in computer graphics for generating and representing curves and surfaces.

=== Linear Interpolation === 
Linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials. It is heavily employed in mathematics (particularly numerical analysis), and numerous applications including computer graphics. It is a simple form of interpolation.</text>

== Live links for unavailable sounds ==

Here is a list of all the sounds that are named on the page but, as of this writing, don't have audio files available.  On the page, they are shaded red, but inert.  Here they are live links.  If any of them turn blue, they should be reenabled on the page and removed from this list here.  After each one I've also included an interwiki link to the corresponding wikipedia article to make it easy to check there, in case one of these sounds were to become available under a different name (for which there is some precedent).  (They're likely to use the names I've given here, though.)  BTW, the epiglottal plosive does have a sound file on wikipedia, but it's a .wav instead of an .ogg, and isn't on Commons; I decided not to try to bring it over for use here, even though the conditions of copyright would seem to allow that.

== Why use CXS ==
Why use conlang X-Sampa when IPA can be used?[[Special:Contributions/97.85.162.133|97.85.162.133]] ([[User talk:97.85.162.133|discuss]]) 09:22, 12 April 2013 (UTC)

: CXS can be written using ascii characters.  So anyone can easily write the symbols, and any software is sure to be able handle them.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:00, 12 April 2013 (UTC)

== Lateral trills ==
Is there a symbol for lateral trills, and shouldn't there be examples?

: Oh, cool idea.

: In the table, dark-shaded entries are sounds that are supposedly physically impossible for humans to pronounce.  A few years ago, there was some excitement in the linguistic community because someone had discovered a natlang in Africa(?) that actually used a sound that had been blocked out in the IPA table as physically impossible.

: In the case of a lateral trill, apparently in setting up the table nobody even thought to set up a row for that.  In trying to twist one's tongue that way, one can sort of see why they didn't.

: When a symbol is needed, one finds a way.  This is done in IPA as well as in CXS.

: In the case of a lateral trill &amp;mdash;I'll assume this is a ''voiced coronal'' lateral trill&amp;mdash; I would suggest using a technique parallel to the way the table forms the voiced retroflex trill (whose symbol is a voiced retroflex flap blended to a voiced coronal trill via &quot;{{CXS|)}}&quot;).  This would give you
:: {{CXS|l\r)}}
: Anyway, that would be my thought without having actually ''heard'' the sound.  Which, you know, I'm not entirely sure is physically possible for a human being to pronounce.&amp;nbsp;;-)&amp;nbsp; --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:58, 12 April 2013 (UTC)

== Tasks in progress ==

* Redistribute the [[{{PAGENAME}}#Data tables|data tables]].  The two big questions are
:* should upper and lower case letter symbols be in a single section, or separate sections, and
:* should non-letter symbols and non-symbols (all of which are non-letters) be in a single section, or separate sections.
* Section [[{{PAGENAME}}#Diacritics and suprasegmentals 2|#Diacritics and suprasegmentals 2]], check the IPA, and consider whether there's a better way to illustrate (the super/subscripting doesn't show well).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This wikibook is tailored specifically for the WJEC GCSE Biology course. I decided to create this book because of the lack of good WJEC resources on the web. This annoyed me when I was doing my GCSE course and I wanted to create something which solved this for all future students.

==About the WJEC course==
Well what you have to understand if you're doing WJEC (Welsh Joint Education Committee) Biology is that there are 3 possible things you can be doing. You may be doing a '''Single Award Science''', sometimes known as '''Core Science'''. You may be doing a '''Double Award Science''', sometimes known as '''Additional Science'''. Or you may be doing '''Separate Sciences''' in which case you will be getting a GCSE in '''Biology'''. It is important to know which of these you are doing to use this book.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! GCSE Type
! Sections to study
|-
| Core Science
| Just Biology 1
|-
| Additional Science
| Biology 1 and 2
|-
| Separate Science
| Biology 1, 2 and 3
|}

==About this book==
This book covers the entire syllabus of the WJEC GCSE Biology course. It is to be used specifically for the WJEC course. It may be useful in some aspects for other examining boards but you should not trust that it will be, because it is not intended to be. It is meant to be a very in depth study of the WJEC course, at a suitable depth that an A* could be obtained from reading it.

==How this book works==
The textbook part of the book is split into 3 sections. Biology 1, 2, and 3. Use the table above to find out which ones apply to you. In every lesson, the section will be clearly displayed in the page name so you will know whether you should be reading that lesson or not just by reading that.

==Tone==
This book is intended to be written in a fairly informal manner as from experience, the average 14-16 year olds do not enjoy reading the formal tone of textbooks. It's meant to come across as friendly, interesting, and fun.

==You can contribute!==
I have made this book on wikibooks under the GFDL for a reason. So that other people may help and contribute. Whether it's a simple typo, or help with an entire category of the wikibook, your contribution is greatly appreciated. If you contribute in anyway to this wikibook, you are entitled to add yourself to the list of authors of this book [[WJEC GCSE Biology/Authors|here]]. In fact, please do, so we have an easy to keep record of everyone who has made the effort to help.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Biology 1 is the first section of the WJEC GCSE Biology course. If you are doing a WJEC GCSE in Biology then no matter what type you are doing (single award, double award, etc.) you will have to do an exam on this part of the course. So everyone needs to learn this section!

Listed below are the subjects that you will have to learn for this exam. They are further split up into lessons.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Quick Comparisons ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	D configuration is much more common than L isomer in sugars
&lt;br&gt;2.	Unsaturated and shorter fatty acid chains tend to be more fluid and melt at a lower temperature
&lt;br&gt;3.	Bilayer is preferred for lipids in water over a micelle
&lt;br&gt;4.	Integral proteins span membranes and are hard to remove compared to peripheral proteins which only interact via electrostatics/hydrogen bonding
&lt;br&gt;5.	Alpha helix proteins tend to span membrane while beta strands tend to form channels
&lt;br&gt;6.	Adenine and guanine are two ringed purines (Guanine has an extra carbonyl group)
&lt;br&gt;7.	Cytosine and thymine are one ringed pyrimidines (Thymine has an extra carbonyl group)
&lt;br&gt;8.	Adenine and thymine form two bonds while cytosine and guanine forms three
&lt;br&gt;9.	Difference between thymine and uracil is that thymine has a CH3 substitutient
&lt;br&gt;10.	A nucleotide is a nucleoside joined to one or more phosphates with ester bonds, such as ATP

== What types of bonds join these molecules together? ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Sugars in a disaccharide- glycosidic linkage
&lt;br&gt;2.	Backbone of DNA- phosphodiester linkage
&lt;br&gt;3.	Glycerol and fatty acids in a lipid- ester linkage

== Name the main types of sugars and give an example ==
&lt;br&gt;1.	Aldose: D-Glucose
&lt;br&gt;2.	Ketose: D-Fructose
&lt;br&gt;3.	Pentose: A-D-Fructofuranose
&lt;br&gt;4.	Hexose: A-D-Fructopyranose
&lt;br&gt;5.	Reducing Sugars: Glucose, galactose and fructose}}
&lt;br&gt;

== Name the three common disaccharides ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Sucrose: Glucose and fructose
&lt;br&gt;2.	Lactose: Glucose and galactose
&lt;br&gt;3.	Maltose: Glucose and glucose

== Name the most common polysaccharides ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Glycogen: Branched A linked glucose, animal energy storage
&lt;br&gt;2.	Amylose (starch): Unbranched A linked glucose, plant energy storage
&lt;br&gt;3.	Amylopectin (starch): Branched A link glucose, plant energy storage
&lt;br&gt;4.	Cellulose: A linked for energy storage and B linked straight chain for structure

== Name common features shared by biological membranes ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Sheet like structures only two molecules thick
&lt;br&gt;2.	Consists mainly of lipids and proteins
&lt;br&gt;3.	Lipids have hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends and form bilayers
&lt;br&gt;4.	Specific proteins mediate distinctive functions
&lt;br&gt;5.	Membranes are noncovalent assemblies held by noncovalent interactions
&lt;br&gt;6.	Membranes are asymmetric- inside and outside surface distinct
&lt;br&gt;7.	Membranes are fluid- molecules can move around easily but hard to rotate
&lt;br&gt;8.	Most membranes are electrically polarized such that the inside is negative

== Describe the three common types of membrane lipids ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Phospholipids with hydrophobic fatty acid tail and hydrophilic phosphate/alcohol head
&lt;br&gt;2.	Glycolipids with hydrophobic fatty acid tails and hydrophilic sugar heads usually of glucose or galactose
&lt;br&gt;3.	Cholesterol- steroid derived liquid with hydrocarbon tail and hydroxyl group; rarely found in prokaryotes but common in animal membranes

== Describe the main differences between archea membranes and eukaryote/bacterial ones ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Nonpolar chains are joined to glycerol by ether rather than ester link since it is more resistant to hydrolysis
&lt;br&gt;2.	Alkyl chains are branched rather than linear which resist oxidation
&lt;br&gt;3.	Stereochemistry of central glycerol is inverted in archea membranes

== Identify some key features of the fluid mosaic model ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Molecules can move laterally with ease but it is difficult to rotate
&lt;br&gt;2.	Lack of rotation allows membrane to remain asymmetrical
&lt;br&gt;3.	Bacteria regulate fluidity by varying degree of unsaturation and length of fatty acid chains
&lt;br&gt;4.	Animals regulate fluidity by cholesterol concentration, which is bulky and disrupts movement

== Identify some membrane bound organelle within the cell ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Nucleus
&lt;br&gt;2.	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
&lt;br&gt;3.	Mitochondria

== Describe the Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment with bacteria and mice ==

Live virulent bacteria are shown to kill mice while a similar but nonvirulent strain does not. Killing the virulent strain and then injecting the mice does not harm the mice. Killing the virulent strain and then either adding its DNA or the dead strain itself to the nonvirulent strain caused a transformation. The newly transformed nonvirulent strain is now virulent and will kill the mice. This showed that DNA contains genetic information.

== Describe the Hershey-Chase experiment with radio marked viruses ==

Hershey and Chase added a radioactive marker to two viruses: one set had markers on its protein coat and the other had markers on its DNA. The viruses were allowed to infect bacteria and in the end, only the bacteria infected by the virus with radioactive DNA were radioactive. Thus, virus only transferred DNA to bacteria meaning that DNA must be the genetic code. 


== Name three main units of nucleic acids ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Sugar- either deoxyribose or ribose
&lt;br&gt;2.	Base- nitrogenous base attached to the sugar
&lt;br&gt;3.	Phosphate- attached in between sugar molecules in the backbone


== What are the main features of Watson and Crick’s double helix model of DNA ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Two polynucleotide chains around a common helical axis running in opposite directions
&lt;br&gt;2.	Sugar-phosphate backbone on the outside and nitrogenous bases on the inside
&lt;br&gt;3.	Bases are perpendicular to axis, separated by 3.4 angstrom, in a pattern that repeats every 10 bases; there is a rotation of 36 degrees per base
&lt;br&gt;4.	The diameter of the helix is 20 angstroms
 

== What are the forces that stabilize DNA? ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Stacking interactions between stack bases are weak and thus more stable
&lt;br&gt;2.	Hydrogen bonds between bases is strong and holds helix together
&lt;br&gt;3.	Hydrophobic effect of burying bases in the interior makes it more stable
&lt;br&gt;4.	Charge-charge interactions such as the repulsion of phosphate in the backbone is reduced by the presence of cationic proteins such as lysine and arginine
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;NOTE: DNA can coil further into secondary and tertiary structures via super coiling (Ex: circular)


== Describe the significance of DNA melting ==

DNA can be reversibly melted because at the melting temperature, the chains do not break down but the double helix does separate into two strands. This results in an increase in UV absorption since the double helix absorbs less due to the hypochromic effect. Once the temperature dips below the melting point, the double helix can be reassociated in a process called annealing.


== What are four requirements regarding the ability of DNA polymerase to catalyze phosphodiester bond formation? ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	The reaction requires all four activated precursors- dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP as well as Mg ion
&lt;br&gt;2.	The new DNA chain is assemble directly on a pre-existing template
&lt;br&gt;3.	A primer must be present to begin synthesis; this primer is a free 3’-OH and elongation of DNA proceeds in the 5’ to 3’ direction
&lt;br&gt;4.	DNA polymerase can remove mismatched nucleotides and correct mistakes

NOTE: Meselson-Stahl experiment demonstrated that DNA replicated in a semi-conservative fashion, meaning that half of the newly synthesized strand comes from parental DNA. The experiment uses radioactive nitrogen markers and measured the radioactivity of parent and daughter strands.

== Explain how retroviruses attack cells ==

The retrovirus carries two single-stranded RNA molecules. Once it enters the cell, an enzyme known as reverse transcriptase is used to form a DNA complementary to RNA. The RNA is then dissolved and what remains is a DNA transcript of the original viral RNA, which the cell then makes into a double helical viral DNA strand. This strand is incorporated and the cell is infected. 


== Identify some important forms of RNA ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Messenger RNA- template for protein synthesis or translation
&lt;br&gt;2.	Transfer RNA- Carries amino acid to ribosomes for peptide formation
&lt;br&gt;3.	Ribosomal RNA- Main component of ribosomes, both as structure and as enzyme
&lt;br&gt;4.	Small nuclear RNA- Splices RNA exons
&lt;br&gt;5.	Signal recognition particle- RNA-protein complex that targets new proteins to right places
&lt;br&gt;6.	Micro RNA- Inhibits translation
&lt;br&gt;7.	Small interfering RNA- Promotes messenger RNA degradation
&lt;br&gt;8.	RNA telomerase- An enzyme that maintains chromosomal telomeres during replication


== What are the key features of RNA polymerase? ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Requires a template, usually double stranded DNA but sometimes single stranded DNA
&lt;br&gt;2.	Four activated precursors- ATP, GTP, UTP and CTP
&lt;br&gt;3.	A divalent metal ion such as Mg or Mn
&lt;br&gt;4.	Elongates in 5’ to 3’ direction
&lt;br&gt;5.	Cannot correct error


== What are the key differences between DNA and RNA polymerase? ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	DNA can correct errors but RNA cannot
&lt;br&gt;2.	DNA needs primer but RNA does not
&lt;br&gt;3.	DNA needs dTTP precursor while RNA needs UTP


== What are the key parts of the genetic code, the relation of DNA bases to protein peptides? ==

&lt;br&gt;1.	Three nucleotides form a codon which encodes an amino acid
&lt;br&gt;2.	The code does not overlap, meaning each nucleotide participates in only one set of three nucleotides that form a codon
&lt;br&gt;3.	The code has no punctuation, meaning the codons code for amino acids continuously, and all bases are part of a codon
&lt;br&gt;4.	The genetic sequence is degenerate meaning there are many codons for each amino acid
&lt;br&gt;5.	The genetic code is universal among living organisms

NOTE: Methanonine is the start codon and always start a peptide sequence, while stop codons are read by release factors rather than transfer RNA anti-codons. 

What are introns and exons? How does the split gene sequence benefit an organism?
&lt;br&gt;1.	Introns are noncoding DNA that do not call for proteins and exist only in eukaryotic cells
&lt;br&gt;2.	Exons are DNA that does code for proteins and is copied during transcription
&lt;br&gt;3.	Introns are spliced out prior to DNA transcription at GU/AG which signal splice sites
&lt;br&gt;4.	Split genes allows for exons shuffling which allows exons to be rearranged quickly and efficiently. Since exons code for discrete functional and structural units, this allows the structure to be changed easily. 
&lt;br&gt;5.	Split genes also allows the generation of a series of related proteins by splicing the same RNA chain in difference ways

What are the key tools in the analysis of genes?
&lt;br&gt;1.	Restriction enzymes- Enzymes that cut genes at precise locations
&lt;br&gt;2.	Blotting techniques- Southern blot separates and characterizes DNA while Northern does the same for RNA
&lt;br&gt;3.	DNA sequencing- Determines the precise nucleotide sequence in DNA
&lt;br&gt;4.	Solid-phase synthesis- Synthesizes precise sequences of DNA and uses it to identify others
&lt;br&gt;5.	Polymerase chain reaction- Amplifies a segment of DNA that makes it easier to characterize and manipulate genes

== Techniques in DNA synthesis and manipulation ==

'''Restriction enzymes'''
&lt;br&gt;1.	Restriction enzymes cleave DNA into specific fragments by recognizing certain sequences and using them as cleave sites
&lt;br&gt;2.	The results can then be separated using gel electrophoresis
&lt;br&gt;3.	The resulting fragments can be identified by hybridizing it with labeled complementary DNA strand using the Southern blot

'''Southern blot'''
&lt;br&gt;1.	A mixture of restriction fragments are separated via electrophoresis on agarose, denatured to form single strands and transferred onto a nitrocellulose sheet
&lt;br&gt;2.	The positions of the fragments are preserved and exposed to a radioactive phosphorus labeled, single stranded DNA probe. 
&lt;br&gt;3.	The DNA probe will hybridize with a fragment having the complementary sequence and the radioactive marker will identify which fragment was the match
&lt;br&gt;4.	A similar technique for analyzing RNA is known as the northern blot. 
&lt;br&gt;5.	From earlier chapters, the method for detecting protein with stained antibodies was known as the western blot

'''DNA Sequencing by controlled termination of replication'''
&lt;br&gt;1.	Chain termination DNA sequencing generates fragments whose length depends upon the last base in the sequence
&lt;br&gt;2.	The same procedure is preformed on four reactions at once. 
&lt;br&gt;3.	A DNA polymerase is used to make the complement of a sequence and is primed by a synthesized fragment complementary to part of the sequence. 
&lt;br&gt;4.	An analog of one of the nucleotide is used in synthesis and when it is used, it terminates the chain. 
&lt;br&gt;5.	By using an analog for a different nucleotide each time, we can determine the sequences by analyzing the resulting fragments. 

'''DNA Solid Phase Synthesis'''
&lt;br&gt;1.	Activated monomers are protonated molecules that are added to a growing chain and form a phosphate triester bond 
&lt;br&gt;2.	The triester is oxidized by iodine
&lt;br&gt;3.	The DMT protecting group is removed by reacting it with the acid and this elongates the chain by 1 unit
&lt;br&gt;4.	Takes about 10 minutes to elongate a chain

'''Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)'''
&lt;br&gt;1.	Can be used on targets whose flanking sequences are known
&lt;br&gt;2.	The parent DNA is headed to excess primer to separate the strands
&lt;br&gt;3.	The solution is then abruptly cooled to allow the primers to hybridized to a DNA strand
&lt;br&gt;4.	DNA synthesis begins as DNA polymerase is added
&lt;br&gt;5.	The chain is copied from both primers producing two new double strands
&lt;br&gt;6.	The two new double strands are separated by heat and the cycle starts again
&lt;br&gt;7.	The quantity grows exponentially and can easily amplify DNA a billion times
&lt;br&gt;8.	Materials required includes the appropriate DNTP and the usual metal Mg, along with buffer and constant temperature change

'''Recombinant DNA technology'''
&lt;br&gt;1.	A plasmid is a circular DNA that has our gene of interest and an origin of replication
&lt;br&gt;2.	Restriction enzymes can be used to cut a particular piece of DNA; cut fragments can then be annealed together with DNA ligase
&lt;br&gt;3.	A similar method can be used to add a sequence to a gene though it is much faster to do this using PCR
&lt;br&gt;4.	DNA cloning in bacteria is usually done with plasmids or lambda phage
&lt;br&gt;5.	A cloning vector is cleaved with an restriction enzyme, a DNA fragment of interest is obtained by cleaving and the two fragments are ligated together. The recombinant DNA is then introduced into the host cell which begins to make many copies of the recombinant DNA.


== What are the two kinds of homologs and give an example of each? ==

A '''paralog''' is a homolog (similar protein or gene) from the same species but with different function such as two different enzymes in a human. 

'''Orthologs''' are from different species but perform a similar function such as digestive enzymes in humans and cows. 


== What is sequence alignment and how does it work? ==


Sequence alignment is a method to detect homologous genes or proteins. It is typically done on amino acid sequences because it is more sensitive as there are more amino acids than nitrogenous bases. To do the alignment, one sequence is slid over another and gaps are introduced to account for deleted amino acids. To know if an alignment is meaningful or not, shuffle the original sequence into a random sequence and then run an alignment with the random sequences and compare the scores. The random sequence should have a much lower score relative to the authentic sequence. 


== What are substitution and identity matrices? How are they used? ==


A substitution matrix allows us to account for the type of substitution, whether or not amino acids are swapped for similar ones or dissimilar ones. The deduced matrices can help us identify amino acids that are conserved more than the others. This has a higher level of sensitivity because it accounts for minor (conservative) substitutions that are relatively irrelevant to the central structure such as alanine for glycine. The identity matrix method is similar to sequence alignment because it only considers the identity of each amino acid. The lack of statistical similarity does not rule out homology as divergent evolution may have changed the proteins too much for a simple comparison. 


== What is structural alignment and how is it used? ==

Structural alignment refers to the conservation of tertiary structures in proteins. Tertiary structures in proteins tend to be more conserved than the primary structure of amino acid sequences. For example, the heme group is conserved in both hemoglobin and myoglobin. Also, proteins with different amino acid sequences may have similar three dimensional structures. It can be used to evaluate the effects of sequence alignments by generating a template which shows conserved residues and their functionality. Repeated motifs can be detected by aligning sequences with themselves. 


== What is divergent and convergent evolution and give a biochemical? ==


'''Divergent evolution''' is the process by which living things differentiate from a common ancestor, an example is one protein changing into multiple forms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''Convergent evolution''' is the natural evolution of two independently evolving things towards each other, an example is how two proteases evolve nearly identical active sites despite differing tertiary structures.


== Centrifugation==


- Mixture of particles that need to be separated are placed onto the surface of a vertical column of liquid.

- The density of which progressively increases from top to bottom → centrifuged.

- Although the particles in suspension are individually denser than the liquid at the top of the gradient, the average density for the sample is lower; only under such conditions could the sample zone be supported by the top of the density gradient.


== Mass Spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF) ==


- Characterization and identification of protein better than SDS-PAGE

- MADLI-TOF has higher sensitivity and can separate small protein samples

STEPS:

1. Sample protein is separated by 2-D gel

2. Specific cleavage (like trypsin) cuts the proteins

3. Separated peptides are identified by MALDI-TOF

- Heavy peptides will move slowly, and lighter peptides will move faster

4. As peptides move along the tube, the different peptides take different amounts of time to reach to the end of the tube

- These separated peptides can be analyzed by matching with the computer simulated database

ADVANTAGES:

•	Robustness

•	High Speed

•	Immunity to contaminants, biochemical buffers, and common additives

== Peptide Sequencing ==

- Find out amino acid composition 

- By using indicator dye to quantify-ninhydrin or fluorescamine

- Sequence one AA at a time

- By using Edman Sequencing : process of purifying protein by removing one residue at a time from the amino end of a peptide

== Peptide Synthesis==

•	Make antibodies

– Peptides can act as antigens, which will stimulate the immune system of the body to produce antibodies to target the peptide. These antibodies can be used to isolate a protein

•	Isolate receptors for hormones of other signaling molecules

•	Work as drugs

– Synthetic peptides can be used as drugs. 

– Example: Vasopressin, which is used to treat patients with diabetes

•	Understand protein folding

– Extremely helpful because synthetic peptides can include many AA’s that are not found in normal proteins; meaning these peptides are not limited to the standard 20 AA’s → resulting in a greater variety of structures

Procedure:

•	1. Attach protected AA

•	2. Deprotect amino terminal

•	3. Coupling to the second protect AA

•	4. Deptrotect amino terminal

•	5. Disconnect dipeptide

== X-Ray Crystallography== 

•	Can reveal 3-D structures of thousands of proteins

•	3 Components – Protein Crystal, Source of X-Rays, Detector 

o	Answers to the level of individual residues and atoms

== Electron Microscopy ==

•	Can reconstruct 2D images of a molecule to 3D

Requirements:

1. Reasonable size of proteins without need to use crystals (samples don’t have to be pure and only takes very little sample)
	
2. Molecules must exist in many identical copies

Steps:

1. Sample Preparation

- Sample is collected and placed on a metal plate to generate the best contrast

- Negative Staining

•	Molecules are absorbed to a continuous carbon film in which molecules are put into a metal plate by drying

2. Particle Picking

o	Particles have to be separated and classified according to their similarities

3. Generate Initial Model

– Random Conical Tilt Reconstruction

•	reconstruction of the 3D images; one at high tilt angle, and the other at untilt angle. Tilt angles allow the testing samples to align in unique orientations

4. Refinement

- From refined data, a new 3D structure of a molecule is reconstructed

== Nucleic Acids ==

Three main chemical units of nucleic acids:

1. Nitrogenous base

2. Sugar

3. Phosphate group

== Nucleotides == 
- Units of DNA
&lt;/br&gt; - consists of sugar (ribose, deoxyribose), phosphate group, and a base (A,G,T,C)
&lt;/br&gt; - Joined by 3’-5’ Phosphodiester bonds 

== Nucleosides ==
- Units of RNA
&lt;/br&gt; - Consists of sugar (ribose, deoxyribose) and a base (A,G,T,C)

== DNA ==
Stores genetic information 
&lt;/br&gt; Codon –  sequence of three bases, responsible for encoding of a single AA

– '''PROPERTIES''':

1. 2 strands (anti-parallel and complementary)
&lt;/br&gt; 2. Made up of deoxyribose sugar, phosphate backbone, and nucleic acid base
&lt;/br&gt; 3. Bases are perpendicular to the helix axis (3.4A)
&lt;/br&gt; 4. Strands held together by H-bonds to form double helix (A=T, G=C)
&lt;/br&gt; 5. Direction: 5’  3’ 
&lt;/br&gt; 6. Repeats every 10 bases
&lt;/br&gt; 7. Weak forces stabilize DNA because of hydrophobic effects and Van Der Waals 
&lt;/br&gt; 8. DNA chain = 20A wide

'''STRUCTURE''':

- A and B = Right handed
&lt;/br&gt; - Z = Left handed

'''cDNA LIBRARY''':

- Library of mRNAs: made up of introns and exons and is able to isolate genes

== Flow Of Genetic Information ==

- Replication: DNA to DNA
&lt;/br&gt; - Transcription: DNA to RNA
&lt;/br&gt; - Translation: RNA to Proteins

== Hypochromic Effect == 

- Describes the decreasing absorbance of UV when forming a double strand
&lt;/br&gt; - As you increase the temperature on a DNA double strand it becomes denatured and is therefore a single strand, leaving the bases more exposed and more able to absorb UV.
 

== Additional Notes ==

'''Notes on RNA:'''

RNA sequences can be compared in a similar manner which will reveal important information about the secondary structures of RNA. 

'''Notes on evolutionary trees:'''

The alignment data can be used to generate an evolutionary tree, such as one for the globins which shows that hemoglobin B was the most recent development. 

'''Notes on modern technology:'''

Ancient DNA can sometimes be amplified and sequenced which allows us to compare what species are more closely related on the evolutionary tree. This has for example revealed that Neanderthals are a branch of modern humans that became extinct, as opposed to a step along the evolutionary line. Molecular evolution can also be examined experimentally by using combinatorial chemistry. This is done by creating a large random pool of molecules and selecting for a specific function.

==Introduction==


Cultural sensitivity is a national issue that we deal with consistently.  Without fail we are presented with headlines about race relation tension, many times resulting from a misunderstanding and lack of sensitivity to ones culture and beliefs.  Much of this tension is due to a lack of education and tolerance. We not only experience this sense of negativity between adults, but misunderstandings extend to our young future.  Who are the ones to blame?  The parents and guardians at home, or the school systems not providing the substantial curriculum to combat this ever growing ignorance.
As educators it is our duty to help develop our future leaders of the world.  To provide them with the proper tools to help them maintain peace and prosperity throughout the globe, as well as help positive nations grow.  Through productive growth, we strive to establish abiding citizens that will develop through education, and transform into responsible caring citizens that will affect society in a positive manner.
In 1998, researchers from Texas A&amp;M University had an idea for a cross-cultural project using distance learning and multimedia to facilitate understanding among a diverse group of secondary students.  The final project came to be known as Cultural Connections.  Cultural Connections brought students across the state of Texas together in an effort to meet via distance technologies.  The researchers wanted the students to get to know each other while conducting curricular activities together.   Though there was very successful K-12 distance learning projects across school populations (SAXophone, Kidlink’s Multicultural Calendar), Cultural Connections mission was to foster relationships among teachers as well as their student subjects across distances.
In order to test the significance of the Cultural Connections concept, a case study was performed in the fall of 1998 to explore the effectiveness of distance learning and multimedia technologies between two teachers and their subjects.  Researchers wanted to assess the expanded learning capabilities between students that were geographically separated. Participants in the study included two teachers and their students, three teacher-observers, and two faculty researchers from Texas A&amp;M University.  Student participants were 14 randomly placed eight-grade students and ten gifted and talented fifth-grade students.   Initially, the participating instructors collaborated to team-teach; developing a program of study focused on curricular activities as well as identity-forming multicultural activities.  The program of study was conducted over 6 months with nine distance-learning units.  The curriculum provided the students with an opportunity to apply technology in their classrooms while developing an extended network beyond their four walls.  Teachers were also given an opportunity to build professional relationships with other teachers across diverse school sites.



==Collaborative Learning==



Initially students were skeptical of their distant classmates, honestly expressing many misconceptions regarding their distant partners.  This project opened up doors for students to share their experiences with people of other cultures and to learn from the perspectives and experiences of others.  As stated by Meier (1995), “there is no tolerance without respect—and no respect without knowledge.”  Students working within established virtual communities are given a chance to transform into more tolerant and respectful citizens.  This is due to the fact that they are given the opportunity to develop relationships with people from diverse cultures and backgrounds.  Positive identity formation is transformed through the cross-cultural connection.  Schools can play a major role in this major transition, building a broad worldview in students as well as educators.  Lasting bonds are also being established, strengthening a more healthy global community. The theoretical framework of this project focused on three assumptions: (a) social constructivist pedagogy can foster personal growth, (b) collaborative learning experiences can foster construction of meaning, and (c) technology can foster collaborative learning (pg. 70, 2000).  
The multimedia software that was utilized gave the students the advantage over typical use of pen and paper.  It allowed them to easily include visual and aural representations of themselves.  Telecommunication technologies have the potential to equalize education by providing all students with access to communication tools that are key to genuine democratic participation (Cummins &amp; Sayers, 1995).  The cross-cultural project also looked at 5 key goals for global education: (perspective consciousness, (b) state of planet awareness, (c) cross-cultural awareness, (d) systematic awareness, and (e) options for participation (Hanvey, 1977).    The use of the multimedia software not only reduced provided students the opportunity to learn from diverse perspectives, but helped to reduce isolation that may have existed through cross-classroom collaboration.  Cultural Connections demonstrated the importance of diversity, but illustrated the use of cultural unity.
Perception for the need to widen the learning community that could not be established within the confines of their four walls was understood by both instructors involved in the project.  Both parties were fortunate to be provided with the essential tools such as videoconferencing systems, media software as well as internet connections during the program of study.  Students were motivated to interact in a variety of ways with their distant classmates by such activities as reading discussions, performing skits, and debating issues.  One substantial debate that stood out was when the students had to participate in an open forum to discuss the pros and cons of school uniforms.  This debate demonstrated the ability for the students to implement what they had learned in order to address serious issues in a meaningful way. The students demonstrated that they had grown as a group and were beginning to develop personal identity.
Personal identity was continually established through the multimedia portfolios created by each student.  It gave all participants an opportunity to better understand and relate to both their present classmates as well as their distant ones.  Many students created visual representations of their home lives, their goals, their thoughts and values, their likes and abilities, and their stories.  The ability to use such software enabled the students to critically reflect on their experiences in a social context beyond their immediate communities.  Students were given the opportunity to view their portfolios individually or in small groups.  Educators began to see significant changes within the participants in the program of study.  As the software files were edited and revised, so were  the personal identities of the children.  The shyness and self-conscious feeling initially established in the beginning of the project, transitioned into a since of confidence and excitement towards the new friendships that had been developed.  The access to technology allowed the students to extend their friendships on their own via email.  Not limiting them only to the time reserved each month for class participation.


==Results==



Two key terms radiate throughout the Cultural Connections project: Multicultural understanding and Self-concept.  Through the concept of multicultural understanding, you began to feel a sense of appreciation from the students towards their differences and similarities with their distant classmates.  Though there were various differentiations in beliefs, experiences, values and behaviors across cultures, there were also many similarities.  This was demonstrated through the forum conducted in relation to their beliefs pro or con towards implementation of uniforms.  Students blossomed into their own self-concept by reflecting through the program of study on their behaviors and attributes.  Their capabilities were endless in what they could achieve past there interaction within this program of study.  As each student moved through the project they began to demonstrate characteristics of growth as well as empowerment.  They also promoted a sense of guidance towards each other through their critical evaluations of worked displayed throughout the program of study. The content of the student portfolios, reflections, and interviews, and the contents of the teacher’s reflections all provided evidence that Cultural Connections enhanced teaching and learning experiences.
The Cultural Connections case study’s purpose was to explore the effectiveness of distance learning and multimedia technologies in facilitating and expanded learning community among teachers and their students.  The project was effective in that through analysis from pre-project to post-project interview, the language indicated a transformation from belittlement to pride.  In the beginning, many of the students compared themselves unfavorably to their distant partners.  Students were learning to be more aware of what they were about and who they were as individuals.  There was also significant academic achievement as compared to benchmark tests provided prior to the program of study.  Of significant importance in all was the expanded multicultural understanding over time.  Comments that were generalized in the beginning became more personalized and focused on similarities.
Cultural Connections helped the educators in the program of study motivate other teachers to get involved in such a project.  They were able to observe how the program helped the students grow in self-esteem, achievement, and multicultural understanding.  Through their understanding of multimedia development and telecommunications they were able to communicate with other colleagues and become mentors at their schools.  Seeing the success of the program motivated many other teacher observers to get over their fear of the new media and apply it to their current curriculum's.  Cross-classroom collaboration made it possible for young adolescents to expand their world-views in order to be positive contributors to an ever growing multicultural environment.  There became a better understanding in how distance technologies can foster team teaching across cultures and geographical distances.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to the Topic ==

Rural schools typically face issues such as a lack of qualified teachers and a lack of budget to implement costly classes in which only few students attend. With the rapid growth of technology used in educational settings, distance learning now can provide significant benefits for rural schools to overcome these issues. This page illustrates how distance learning helps rural schools handle their problems and enhance their educational quality. The target audience of this page is distance learning coordinators and instructors, working for rural K-12 schools. However, due to the high applicability of the information, people who are generally interested in distance learning are likely to find this page interesting. The information on this page is mainly based on research of U.S schools, but this might be applicable to many other countries, as we can find similar issues in rural schools all over the world. 

Rural schools generally exist in countryside areas which typically have less economical development and a lower population than urban or suburban areas. In the case of the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Education, the definition of a small rural school is a school in a district where average daily attendance is fewer than 600 students, or in a district in which all schools are located in counties with a population density of fewer than 10 persons per square mile (U.S Department of Education, 2008). 

Traditionally rural schools have had unique benefits for students. In fact, rural schools pioneered many educational reform tools, including peer assistance, multi-grade classrooms, mentoring and cooperative learning. The small size of the community made strong unity among students, teachers and the community (National Education Association). 
However, although rural schools have certain benefits and importance in their community, rural schools face unique challenges too. The following section is a description of these challenges.

== Challenges of Rural Schools ==

Here are the typical challenges that rural schools face. 

1) Difficulty in providing comprehensive curriculum&lt;br&gt;
The small size and remote geographic location make it difficult for rural schools to provide comprehensive curriculum. Additionally, rural schools often have difficulty in providing low-enrollment and high-cost classes, due to a lack of budget and qualified teachers. For instance, the U.S. shortages of teachers in subject areas such as math and foreign languages make it harder for rural schools to maintain the qualified teachers of these subjects (Hobbs, 2004).

2) Lower payment for teachers &lt;br&gt;
Teachers in a rural school often receive a lower salary than teachers in an urban school. For example, in the case of the U.S., on average, rural teachers only make 88 % of the salary of their non rural peers (Jimerson, 2003). This is because teachers’ salaries are partly generated by the local property tax, and rural areas have a poorer capacity to generate this tax. Due to this pay gap, rural schools have trouble hiring and retaining new teachers. Consequently, some rural schools have to hire under prepared teachers and have inappropriately large class sizes.

3) Funding Shortages and Threats of consolidation&lt;br&gt;
The reduction of national and state educational funding has had a particularly strong impact on rural schools, as they typically have a low local tax base, lower economic development, an aging population and declining student enrollments. As a result, it is difficult for rural schools to provide high cost and low enrollment classes such as anatomy and chemistry. In the U.S. there are many cases of lawsuits arguing that the state government has a constitutional duty to provide schools with equitable and adequate educational funding. Nevertheless, in many cases, legislatures often turn the issue to school consolidation as a way out of fiscal distress and a way to improve student educational opportunity. In these cases, it is often true that the savings gained through consolidation will be more than offset by higher costs in other areas (Rural School and Community Trust, 2003). 


== What Is Distance Learning? ==

Distance learning is any kind of instructional setting where instructors and students are separated in physical space and time. Distance learning is not synonym of “online learning”, as distance learning includes more comprehensive learning activities such as listening to the radio, and distance learning does not have to be combined with internet access. Nevertheless, it is also true that in many contexts, distance learning includes online communication. Hobbs explains distance learning based on its four major characteristics: learners, time, instruction and degree of interactivity (2004). 

1) Learners &lt;br&gt;
Distance learning can occur with individual learning or within a group. In the case of individual-based learning, when two students are enrolled in the same class, one student may sit in the computer room of his/her school to participate in the class, and another student may be in his/her home. In a group learning setting, a group of students may participate in the class from their school, while another group of students may participate in the same class from different schools or organizations.

2) Time &lt;br&gt;
Distance learning can occur in both real time and delayed time. In real time (synchronous communication), students and teachers can interact with each other simultaneously. In delayed time (asynchronous communication), students can response to previously developed instruction at their convenience (at any time and any place).  

3) Instruction &lt;br&gt;
Distance learning class can be provided by several methods. Students may learn from teachers as they do in the traditional classroom settings, or students may also learn from a set of organized materials such as computer texts. In the latter case, students may never interact with human instructors. 

4) Degree of Interactivity &lt;br&gt;
Often distance learning is divided into one-way and two-way technologies. In one-way technologies, students may be able to see, hear and watch instructors, but students cannot directly communicate with instructors. On the contrary, in the two-way technologies, students and teachers can directly interact with each other. 

Any distance learning contains these four aspects in varying degrees.

== Advantages of Distance Learning for Rural Schools ==

This section is an illustration of the advantages of distance learning in rural schools. To be clear, distance learning has significant potential to overcome the issues of rural schools and would enhance the quality of the education.  

1) Academic Advantages&lt;br&gt;
Distance Learning classes can be offered regardless of the availability of local certified teachers, and significantly improve the breath of curriculum in rural schools. For some advanced classes sometimes it is almost impossible for rural school to find adequate local teachers, but these problems can be solved by offering distance learning programs. For example, teachers in an urban school can teach a class such as anatomy as an online class, to a student in rural school where there is no qualified anatomy teacher. For the distance learning coordinators, it is important to think about collaboration with different schools (including urban schools) and various teachers to offer these advanced classes. Another important academic advantage of distance learning which traditional classes cannot offer is the possibility of a “virtual” field trip. Using technologies such as YouTube, Video Phone and Skype, instructors can offer students the opportunity to interact with remote cultures regardless of their geographic location. For example, in American schools, students can talk with people in Asia, or they can go on a virtual field trip to NASA using Video Phone. 

2) Economic Advantages&lt;br&gt;
For an educator’s point of view, calculating the cost for each class is something that he/she has to do to implement and evaluate the class. In this sense, it is hard for rural schools to provide classes which are expensive, but have low enrollments. However, using distance learning technology, this problem can be solved. Rural schools now can expand the breadth of curriculum by introducing distance learning classes, depending on the year to year student needs. In this way, rural schools do not have to hire new teachers in order to satisfy student needs. Also, it is important to note as a technology coordinator that some forms of distance learning which do not require a high degree of instructor involvement have no significant incremental cost. Learning through radio and DVD are examples of this. Thus, the cost of offering a class to one student could be same as if it were offered to fifteen students. 

3) Professional development for teachers &lt;br&gt;
Not only students, but teachers also receive benefits from distance learning. Rural teachers can update their knowledge and gain additional certification through distance learning. They do not have to leave their community to further their expertise. Additionally, distance learning provides opportunities for extending the clinical experience of pre-service teachers. Also, pre-service teachers can maintain remote mentoring relationships between new teachers and experienced teachers. 

4) Collaborative Learning beyond space and time&lt;br&gt;
Distance and time are not barriers to collaboration with students and teachers in remote places. Rural students can share their learning with people in remote areas through an online discussion board. Distance learning instructors can create educational programs aimed at sharing views between urban students and rural students. Instructors can even create global learning environments which students learn together with people in foreign countries. This kind of learning opportunity is desirable in the present era of globalization.

5) Specialized student services&lt;br&gt;
Distance learning technology also makes it possible for students to receive an extended variety of specialized school services such as speech therapy, psychological testing and counseling. Video phone technology is especially useful on these occasions. Sometimes rural students have trouble receiving these services, even though they need them. Distance learning tools can help solve this issue (Barron, 1999; Hobbs, 2004). 



== How to Ensure Student Success ==


There are some factors which we can typically see in successful distance learning. Broadly speaking, there are three elements. 

1) Instructional effectiveness&lt;br&gt;
This measure may not very different from a traditional classroom. It is often said, distance learning technology does not improve bad teachers, but it improves the capacity of good teachers. That is, it expands instructors’ ability to communicate with students, coach students and encourage the application of their learning. The importance of instructional effectiveness is not really different from in the traditional classroom setting. Without this capacity, sophisticated technologies do not enhance the educational quality of rural schools. 

2) Instructor training&lt;br&gt;
There are mainly two major aspects regarding distance learning in which instructors should be trained. First, instructors need to understand the technical operation of software and hardware. Second, and more importantly, they should learn how to teach through distance learning technology. Sometimes, teachers fail to teach distance learning classes by simply transferring their experience in traditional classes. There are different conditions such as level of interaction in distance learning. It is important to prepare for teaching based the distance learning environment. Instructors should be especially aware of types of technologies and internet connectivity that rural schools have. 

3) Student supports for technology issues&lt;br&gt;
A technological support structure is essential. Rural schools should have a school-based technology troubleshooter who can handle problems such as internet communication problems. Also, depending on the course, occasional face-to-face contact with an instructor facilitates student learning (Barron, 1999; Hobbs, 2004). 


== A Success Story ==


There are numerous successful cases of distance learning in rural K -12 education all over the world. The Fire and Ice project is a quite well-known example. “Fire and Ice” is a series of interactive dialogues among students (ages 7 to 13) of several countries including Brazil, Canada and Mozambique. They used webcam for their communication. There, they discussed global environmental problems with the help of translators. A rural school in Massarmbara, a village several hours from Rio participated in this project. Instead of just discussing the environmental issues, the students exchanged ideas for practical actions to change the environment of their communities. Later in the year, they talked again to share their progress. The Brazilian students in Massarmbara found out about the devastation of the soil in their community due to fires, chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Then, the students learned how to make compost to create organic fertilizers from local farms and actually grew garden vegetables. Their action caught the attention of media outlets such as CNN, and become a well-known successful case of distance learning. The distance learning project “Fire and Ice” not only provided the rural students chances to interact with foreign students beyond physical spaces, but also inspired them to take practical actions to make a difference in their community with a global vision. Without distance learning technology, this kind of learning program in the rural school would have been impossible. Stace Wills, the co-founder of Fire and Ice says, &quot;This project is about inspiring students to create their own solutions for helping combat climate change in their local areas. What really makes this different is that the students are translating dialogue into action&quot; (Schwartz, 2007).

== The Obstacles for Rural Distance Learning == 


When effectively implemented, distance learning has considerable benefits in rural education. However, there are possible barriers to implementing distance learning in rural schools. 

1) The Digital Divide is the essential issue. The Digital Divide is the gap between areas where access to telecommunication technologies, especially internet access, are available and areas where it is not. In the case of the U.S., many rural schools still lag behind urban schools. The gap is now defined in terms of the access to broadband (high speed line). Because in many cases, distance learning programs require a certain degree of internet connectivity, the Digital Divide will be a big issue. 

2) Lack of skilled technology coordinators and instructors
Rural schools sometimes lack school based technology professionals who adequately familiar with distance learning technology. Often small schools do not have the resources to attract skilled technology coordinators who can fix the technology problems and can keep up to date on the newest information about distance learning. 

3) Budgetary issues 
Technology selection is often determined by affordability. In this way, technology may not meet the expectations of students and instructors. In the case of the U.S., school district budgets rarely include expenses for distance learning technology, so collaboration with the state government is necessary (Hobbs, 2004; National Education Association). 


== Closing Remarks ==


While these issues exist in rural schools, clearly, distance learning has huge potential to revolutionize the quality of education in rural schools. Distance learning definitely provides broader choices and chances to make more creative education programs in rural schools. While allowing rural schools to maintain their distinct benefits, distance learning will ensure that the location and size of a rural school will not limit its quality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most inhibitors work extremely fast when establishing their binding equilibrium with the enzyme. However, tight-binding inhibitors establish their equilibrium on a much slower time-scale. Therefore, these types of inhibitors are called time-independent inhibitors because they show a change in initial velocity with time. There are four types of interactions that can slow down the kinetics of an inhibitor. The first is when the enzyme doesn’t have an inhibitor at all. The second interaction is when the equilibrium constants are very small compared to the enzyme turnover when the inhibitor is reversible. The third interaction is when the inhibitor binds, it forms an EI complex that is then isomerized to form a new complex. This new complex significantly inhibits the reaction, therefore slowing it down. The fourth interaction deals with irreversible inhibitors that can act as affinity labels for the enzyme, therefore slowing the reaction down based on its mechanism. Two examples of time-dependent inhibitors are serine proteases and the prostaglandin G/H synthase.

==Determining Reversibility==

Determining reversibility involves performing a large dilution, dialysis, filter binding, or size exclusion chromatography. In order to tell the difference between covalent inactivation from noncovalent inhibition, it is important to be able to tell when the inhibitor is being released upon denaturation of the enzyme. For example, if there is an inhibitor that is covalent and it is denatured, then the inhibitor would still be attached to the denatured protein due to the covalent bonds between the inhibitor and the enzyme. However, if the inhibitor was noncovalent, then the active site of the enzyme would release the inhibitor in to the denaturing solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Riboswitches are recently discovered RNA domains that function as gene expression regulators. It is a portion of the mRNA strand that is able to bind small molecules and alter the gene activity. An mRNA which possesses the riboswitch is able to regulate its own activity depending on whether or not a molecule is attached to it. They are located at the 5' end of untranslated regions of messenger RNA. These functional domains exist in bacteria and have also been engineered in the laboratory{{ref|Wang2008}}. Riboswitches are significant because most believe that proteins are primarily responsible for the complexity, specificity, and efficiency of gene control. Most riboswitches exist in bacterias although some have also been found in plants and fungi{{ref|Breaker2008}}.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It was first described by Ronald Breaker's lab in 2002 when they utilized in-line probing of ''Escherichia coli btuB'' mRNA to show that it could bind a metabolite/substrate and inhibit translation of the strand's product (AdoCbl) -- without proteins{{ref|Nahvi2002}}.

The original meaning of riboswitch was that messenger RNA can sense small molecules of metabolite. While this is still the use today, others have changed the meaning to include other types of RNA, further expanding the meaning. mRNA that contains a riboswitch can regulate its own activity. This opens many doors in the world of biology because it shows that molecules can evolve to be their own masters, or regulating themselves. These RNA were seen to distinguish between very similar molecules or analogs which shows the intricacy of the method. This fact has opened up a world of RNA because it is now known that the capabilities of RNA were much greater than once known. It is interesting because it illustrates how little we humans know about our very own bodies. Riboswitches allow RNA to respond to different concentrations of molecules almost as though the RNA had a mind of its own determining its actions. Due to the expansion of the definition of a riboswitch, there are many different kinds known to mankind today.

As the mantra of structural biochemistry is that structure determines function, it is not a surprise that the structure of the riboswitch allows for such great function. Most RNA do not need to conform to the strict watson and crick model of DNA allowing for many variations in RNA. The great variation in RNA is responsible for riboswitchs abilities. Riboswitches are made of two parts. the aptamer domain and the expression platform. The aptamer domain essentially acts as a receptor that binds to specific ligands. The expression platform is interesting because it can toggle between two different secondary structures when binding to a ligand, creating a plethora of possible structures. In both parts of a riboswitch there is a switching sequence. This switching sequence directs the expression of the genes.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Riboswitches&quot;&gt;[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/riboswitches-a-common-rna-regulatory-element-14262702 Riboswitches], November 14th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Riboswitches==

There are several types of riboswitches known, some of which are:

*TPP riboswitch : this riboswitch binds TPP (thiamin pyrophosphate in order to regulate the transport and synthesis of thiamin as well as other metabolites with similar properties.

*Lysine riboswitch : binds to lysine and regulates its biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport.

*Glycine riboswitch : this riboswitch regulates glycine metabolism. This is the only riboswitch known currently to be able to perform cooperative binding.

*FMN riboswitch : this riboswitch binds FMN (flavin mononucleotide) in order to regulate the transport and synthesis of riboflavin.

*Purine riboswitch : binds purines to regulate its transport and metabolism. Different forms of this riboswitch are able to bind either guanine or adenine depending on the pyrimidine in the riboswitch.

*Cobalamin riboswitch : this riboswitch binds adenosylcobalamin, the coenzyme form of B12 vitamin, in order to moderate the synthesis and transport of cobalamin and other similar metabolites.  

as well as many others such as SAM riboswitch, PreQ1 riboswitch, SAH riboswitch, glmS riboswitch, and cyclic di-GMP riboswitch.

== Structure ==

[[Image:Riboswitch_Model.jpg]]

Riboswitches consist of two functional components, the conserved aptamer region and the highly variable expression platform. Unlike proteins, only four nucleotides are available to generate the specificity required by the riboswitch to bind{{ref|Coppins2007}}. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The aptamer domain is usually a single binding site that has a highly conserved primary and secondary RNA structure and forms selective binding pockets for ligands. It essentially acts as a sensor for metabolites within the cell. Since it is located at the 5' end of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Messenger RNA (mRNA)|mRNA]], it is usually the first to be transcribed by [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/RNA Polymerase|RNA polymerase]]. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To improve aptamer-substrate affinity, structural data shows that hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, and other interactions form with the substrate and also adjacent RNA regions. Other aptamers may utilize an induced fit mechanism with deep binding pockets{{ref|Breaker2008}}.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The expression platform is commonly located downstream from the aptamer.

== Function ==

Most riboswitches function within feedback pathways by sensing metabolites and turning &quot;off&quot; the ability to express genes that would produce proteins that would continue the production of that metabolite{{ref|Coppins2007}}. 
The aptamer region tends to recognize ligands that are closely related to the gene products downstream from the riboswitch expression platform.

The {{tl|shelf}} template has been deprecated and the &quot;Bookshelves&quot; link points to [[Wikibooks:Departments]]. What's the status of this? Can someone update the page with more up-to-date information? Thanks! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:48, 6 December 2008 (UTC)

:Well awhile ago in the reading room there was discussion about deprecating the bookshelves and there appeared to be consensus to do so. The idea was to move towards Subject pages which consist of lists automatically generated through the use of categories, so people can focus more on contributing to books and less on how to make them available for readers to find. See [[Subject:Major Subjects]] and the subject pages linked to from there for instance. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:16, 6 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first section of the GCSE Biology course, Adaptation and Competition, is also one of the easiest sections. Learn a few definitions, a couple of facts, and then simply use your common sense. However, make sure that you learn this section well, because the examiners love to put questions forward on it. The questions on adaptation do though, as I said, involve a fair amount of common sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How has mobile work affected business meetings?}}

Today there is an explosion of technology that allows groups of individuals to communicate worldwide without leaving their offices, at their home, even on the road. According to recent data from Statistics Canada, about 10 percent of the Canadian workforce qualifies as distributed. Forty percent of IBM’s workforce has no office at the company; at AT&amp;T, more than 30 percent of its managers are distributed; and at Sun Microsystems, nearly 50 percent of employees are distributed. Working from different places causes a new question: how is a meeting held? Mobile technology creates teleworkers and also teleconferences. 

==Teleconferencing==
Teleconferencing is the use of electronic communication that allows two or more people at different locations to hold a simultaneous conference. In recent years, holding teleconference calls has become a wonderful way for many companies to avoid the expenses involved in employee travel. As gas prix have continued to rise, companies are even pulling back on meetings that have their people driving across town, not to mention the trips that involve flying from on side of the country to the other. Teleconferencing services are enjoying a surge in the business world, as more and more organizations have turned to such services to help communicate, while reducing their reliance on travel. In most cases, when people need to have a meeting it is for a fairly short period of time, maybe for a few hours, or a day or two at most. Making use of a teleconference is particularly great for those short meetings when it would take more time for the key executive or meeting presenter to get to the other location.

===Types===
A teleconference call is the oldest and simplest, where multiple people are able to call into one central phone number so that everyone can communicate on the line at the same time, but they can’t communicate by face-to-face. Video teleconferencing is no wonder why has started to really catch on and become popular with the way that technology is advancing. When people participate in this type of teleconference, usually the organizers or presenters are on camera and the other participants who are “attending: opt receive information are able to see who is speaking. This is also wonderful because the presenters can use visual aids to make a greater impact and to improve their presentations. Web conferencing is a newer innovation that expands the features and benefits of teleconferencing services. This kind of teleconferencing gives people the ability to interact with others through a secure website. Many websites now offer online conferencing at no cost, but the more extensive web conference systems that provide more features will charge a fee for use.

===Disadvantages===
The advantages of teleconferencing are obvious, and numerous. However, there are some disadvantages that should be brought to light. Technical failures may occur when trying to establish a conference or during a conference, which would terminate the meeting prematurely. In addition, socializing is less than a face-to-face meeting, and it would be difficult to build close relationship between group members.

==Future==
What is the next step toward more realistic virtual meetings? The answer is known as tele-immersion, a conceptual hybrid of virtual reality and Star Trek’s Holodeck. One of the principal applications areas for Internet 2, tele-immersion visually replicates, in real time and in three dimensions, slabs of space surrounding remote participants in cybermeeting. The result is a shared, simulated environment that makes it appear as if everyone is in the same room.

      <text xml:space="preserve">       
Although the discovery of the structure of DNA was attributed to Watson and Crick, a keynote 
player in helping them discover this structure was a scientist by the name of Rosalind Franklin.  
Rosalind Franklin, along with Francis Wilkins,  worked on DNA applying X-ray crystallography to find out 
its structural properties.  X-ray crystallography required the process of exposing a crystal specimen 
(DNA) to X-rays to determine the locations of the atoms in the “molecules that comprises basic unit of 
crystal called unit cell”.  The task however was not an easy one to attain.

Obtaining a clear diffraction pattern of an object required that the crystal be pure and the x-ray strong enough.  However, as Franklin realized, DNA existed in two forms in equilibrium which resulted in a very unclear diffraction pattern.  These forms were the A form, which is the dehydrated form of DNA, and the B form, which generated a long and fibrous structure due to humid conditions. Franklin, applying her chemistry background, then proceeded to isolate these two forms using clever laboratory techniques such as “manipulation  of the critical hydration of her specimens” [2].  The A and B forms were then separated and subjected to X-ray crystallography obtaining the pictures which would be the basis of Watson and Crick’s helical DNA structure; one of them the famous photo no. 51 of the B DNA form.



== Fiber Diffraction ==

Fiber diffraction is a method used to determine the structural information of a molecule by using scattering data from X-rays. Rosalind Franklin used this technique in discovering structural information of DNA. The experiment places a fiber in the trajectory of an X-ray beam at right angle. The diffraction pattern is obtained in the films of a detector placed few centimeters away from the fiber. The fiber diffraction pattern is a two dimension patterns showing the helical symmetry of a molecule rather than a three dimension symmetry if taken by X-ray crystallography. A good fiber diffraction patterns exhibits four quadrant symmetry, the axis aligned to the fiber is called the meridian and the axis perpendicular to the fiber is called equator. Franklin obtained a diffraction pattern using a non-crystalline DNA fiber, and from it she deduced the B-form of DNA.

==EXPERIMENT==


* The diffraction pattern obtained by Franklin and Wilkins showed a X pattern which hinted of a 2 stranded helical form
[[Image:biochemcamille.jpg]]

* They also observed that the patterns was consistent and inferred that the helix’s diameter must also be consistent, 
[[Image:biochemcamille2.jpg]]

* The helical turn of DNA correlates to the horizontal lines in the picture which measures to 34 Angstroms.  They also calculated that the gap between based pairs was 3.4 A as measured on the distance from the center of the X to the ends.  Simple math deduced that there are 10 nucleotides per turn


Franklin and Wilkins also showed that the sugar phosphate backbones were found to be in the outside of the helix and not inside as it was previously thought to be.  They came to this conclusion because of the A and B forms of DNA.  The hydrated and dry forms of DNA showed that water could easily come in and bind to DNA, a fact that could only happen if the feature showed sugar phosphate backbones being on the outside.

==SUMMARY OF FINDINGS==


- DNA’s helical structure was composed of two strands


- establish that DNA’s diameter was similar throughout


- calculated that 1 turn was 34 A, distance between base pairs as 3.4A, and 10 nucleotides per helical turn


- showed that sugar phosphate backbones were located outside of the structure

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''What is Distance Learning in a K-12 Environment?'''&lt;/big&gt;


Distance Learning is typically defined as a learning experience where the student and the instructor are separated by distance and/or time. Historically, the notion of distance learning has been around for some time. Over 100 years ago, distance learning was represented by correspondence courses where lessons were received, completed and sent through the mail. Later, radio and television were adapted for instructional purposes. Currently, online or virtual learning is the primary means of distance education. Recent reports show online learning is on the rise for all ages, including K-12 students. A 2001 study conducted by the Distance Learning Resource Network (DLRN), looked specifically at K-12 virtual schools and found the trend from ‘virtual high schools’ to ‘virtual K-12 schools’ one that continues to grow (Clark, 2001).

A more recent report (2007) by the Sloan Consortium shows the number of K-12 students enrolled in online courses to have risen significantly. The researchers surveyed more than 350 school districts representing 44 states. According to the report, approximately two-thirds of responding school districts offered some form of online courses, either fully online or blended. Fully online courses were more common, with 57.9% of the districts surveyed having one or more students enrolled, while a smaller percentage of districts - 32.4% of them - had at least one student enrolled in a blended course (Sloan Consortium, 2007, p. 9). 

The Sloan study distinguished and defined three types of online courses: 

Online — Course where most or all of the content is delivered online. Defined as at least 80% of seat time being replaced by online activity.

Blended/Hybrid — Course that blends online and face-to-face delivery. Substantial proportion (30 to 79%) of the content is delivered online.

Web-Facilitated — Course that uses web-based technology (1 to 29% of the content is delivered online) to facilitate what is essentially a face-to-face course. 
(Sloan Consortium, 2007, p. 4)




== Benefits and Challenges for K-12 Distance Learning ==


Existing and emerging technologies offer many opportunities for distance education. Some of these opportunities include: 



1.	Students in rural K-12 schools are offered broader educational opportunities through online classes.

2.	Students are given access to instructors and resources that may not be available locally.

3.	High schools are able to offer Advanced Placement courses. 

4.	Online classes alleviate scheduling constraints.

5.	Advanced students can supplement their learning beyond the classroom.

6.	Students who have failed a course or require remedial review do not have to re-enroll in a classroom course.

7.	Blended or hybrid courses give students (especially those who are more reserved in a classroom) a platform for  engagement, expression and collaboration. 

8.	Students concurrently learn technological skills when they take an online or blended course. 

9.	Online learning communities can promote multicultural understanding and collaboration.

10.	Students can communicate with experts ‘in the field.’



In addition, studies seem to show little difference between students’ learning outcomes in a classroom vs. an online environment, although this is an area requiring further study. A major study by Cavanaugh, Gillan, Kromey, Hess, &amp; Blomeyer in 2004 presented a meta-analysis of fourteen studies focusing specifically on student outcomes. Their conclusion was: 


Students can experience similar levels of academic success while learning using telecommunications and learning in classroom settings. While distance learning as it is practiced in today’s virtual schools uses technology that is less than ten years old and advances rapidly, the literature has shown that a student’s education online can be as effective as it is in a classroom (Cavanaugh, et. al, 2004, p. 21-22). 


The authors also state:


For literature on K–12 distance education to be meaningfully synthesized, the inclusion criteria had to be narrowly specified. This synthesis included studies with data on the performance of grades 3–12 students in web-based distance learning programs compared to students in classrooms. Measures of performance present in the literature do not draw a complete picture of the full range of effects that students experience as a result of participation in distance education. Qualitative studies, strict experimental studies, narrative reports, and other designs offer information not acquired in this analysis. Although the inclusion criteria were designed to allow a wide range of studies to be analyzed so that a comprehensive knowledge of K–12 distance education would result, a small number of studies was analyzed. The results should be interpreted with caution (Cavanaugh, et. al, 2004, p. 13).


Technology, despite its potential, can certainly be used improperly used or not used adequately.
Learning is not promoted by the addition of technology; learning results from sound pedagogical practices which effectively incorporate technology. 


Current literature seems to be in agreement as to the challenges and issues pertaining to distance learning. Course quality, technology requirements/costs, and teacher training are universal concerns. Also, an online learning environment may not be successful for all types of learners. Certain students may feel isolated or lack the necessary discipline. Concerns have been raised about the online environment impeding children’s social development and skills. Children who have language difficulties may struggle with a text-heavy online environment. Highly technical or complex subjects may be especially challenging for an online curriculum.

== Creating Successful K-12 Distance Learning Environments ==
 

Constructivist learning theory tells us that meaningful learning is achieved when learners are actively engaged in authentic tasks, constructing and articulating their own knowledge, and reflecting on their activities and accomplishments. When students participate in realistic, meaningful tasks, critical thinking and problem-solving skills are promoted. Instructional design models apply this pedagogy to online learning tools, modules, and lessons. 


Janicki &amp; Liegle (2001) have synthesized the work of a range of instructional design experts to develop a list of 10 concepts they believe support effective design of web-based instruction. These are: 


· instructors acting as facilitators; 

· use of a variety of presentation styles;

· multiple exercises; 

· hands-on problems;

· learner control of pacing; 

· frequent testing;

· clear feedback; 

· consistent layout;

· clear navigation; 

· available help screens.



Adult online learners typically possess the discipline and self-direction required from an online learning environment, whereas, children are still learning these skills. Therefore, virtual K-12 teachers need to skillfully help students not only learn the subject at hand, but they must teach students to “learn how to learn” in the online environment. This requires a careful, scaffolded  course design with consistent supervision and reinforcement. 


Research has found that older children have more internal locus of control than younger children, reinforcing the need for careful design and teaching of distance education at K–12 levels. Younger students will need more supervision, fewer and simpler instructions, and a more extensive reinforcement system than older students. Effective online programs for young learners include frequent teacher contact with students and parents, lessons divided into short  segments, mastery sequences so student progress can grow in stages, and rewards for learning  such as multimedia praise and printable stickers or certificates. (Cavanaugh, et. al, 2004, p. 7).


Neo-Piagetian theorists such as Vygotsky proposed that historical and cultural context play significant roles in helping people think, communicate, and solve problems, proposing that cognitive development is strongly linked to input from others. Vygotsky’s theory implies that cognitive development and the ability to use thought to control our own actions require first mastering cultural communication systems and then learning to use these systems to regulate our own thought process. Online learning communities can provide a supportive context that makes new kinds of learning experiences possible (Cavanaugh, et. al, 2004, p. 7-8). Through distance learning, students may have exposure to and share with people of other cultures and perspectives. 


Online learning environments, when designed to fully use the many tools of communication that are available, is often a more active, constructive, and cooperative experience than classroom learning. In addition, technologies that are easily employed in online environments, such as mind  mapping tools and simulations, are effective means for helping students make meaning of  abstract phenomena and strengthen their meta-cognitive abilities (Duffy &amp; Jonassen, 1992).

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, your first lesson, and you'll be pleased to know, it's a fairly basic and straightforward one to start us off. This lesson is all about the classification of species. By the end of this lesson, you will understand why species are categorised, and how they are categorised.

==Introduction==
The classification of species basically means how scientists sort the species into groups. For example, consider films. They are classified into different types (genres) e.g. Action, Horror, Comedy etc. This helps viewers find and choose a film that they think they would like. Classification helps scientists in the same ways, they can find a species which has the particular features that they are looking for.

==Why have classification?==
Classification is useful for several reasons. As I mentioned above, it makes it easier to find a species of animal that has the features you are looking for if animals are sorted into groups. Another role of the classification system is to create scientific names for creatures. I will demonstrate how this works further down the page. The reason why scientific names for creatures are useful is because they are universal to all languages. No matter what country you may be in, the scientific name for a human is always 'Homo Sapien'. This makes it easier for scientists to communicate.

:'''Comment''' This may be advertising, but probably of a less volatile sense than the kind you're thinking of. #1 The software in question is entirely free (there is no &quot;pro&quot; version), and is freely distributable, alterable, etc, as is the source code. (Under the lGPL, looks like). Furthermore, the product in question was already paid for by the U.S. gov't, it looks like, as part of a Lockheed Martin contract, because it seems like this Sandia corporation is a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. And I hardly think that giant corrupt defense contractor is out to get people to register for its software. :D I think what it is is that this guy BtRichardson, who looks like one of the guy's publishing it on the antfarm rubyforge website, made it as part of his job, and now he's trying to make it visible to and usable by the code community with all good intentions. He probably started this book here as a means of making publicly available documentation of it.

:That said, the material there right now is currently just a copy of his website antfarm.rubyforge.org. He may be participating in one of several disparate examples of highly motivated government employees trying impressively to make their publicly funded professional work publicly available and useful. That said, however, wikibooks is not designed to be a webpage substitute for code projects, and I think, after a while, if the page doesn't really develop into any documentation (and goodness knows that if anyone's fit to write documentation about it, this guy, the developer is), it could be scuttled, sure, cause the information's already out there. -[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 10:29, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==


'''Transgenic animal''' are animals that have had foreign genes from another animal introduced into their genome. A foreign gene (such as a hormone or blood protein) is cloned and injected into the nuclei of another animal’s in vitro fertilized egg. Cells are then able to integrate with the transgene, and the foreign gene is expressed, upon which the developing embryo is surgically implanted in a surrogate mother. The result of this process, if the embryo develops, is a transgenic animal housing a particular gene from another species.

Applications of transgenic technology are for example, improving upon livestock, such as higher quality wool in sheep, or increasing the amount of muscle mass of an animal so that it can produce more meat for consumption. Conversely, transgenic animals can also be utilized for medical purposes such as producing human proteins by inserting a desired transgene into the genome of an animal in a manner that causes the target protein to be expressed in the milk of the trangenic animal.

The expression of a transgene can also be engineered to take place in plants, such as obtaining the bio-luminescent gene that gives fireflies their glow in the dark ability, and introducing it to a plant.

== Transgenic Mice in Alzheimer's Research==
[[File:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg‎|thumb|A mouse undergoing a Morris Water Test]]
Recently, transgenic mice have been used to conduct research concerning Alzheimer’s Disease.  Researchers have created a new transgenic mouse that carries the gene for human Alzheimer’s disease, which represents a breakthrough in the development of effective treatments for a currently incurable disease.  Researchers developed these transgenic mice by harvesting DNA that activate genes in the brain affected by the disease, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.  This DNA was then inserted into mice embryos via microinjection techniques.  This new DNA then became part of the mouse’s genotype through hybridization of  this foreign DNA with the mouse’s own DNA. 

Observable results in the brains of the mice were not seen within the first six months of life, but between six and nine months, the transgenic mice developed similar characteristics as ones seen in human Alzheimer’s patients.  Such changes include damage to the neurons in the brain, reduction in synapse density, and accumulation of pathogenic beta-amyloid deposits.  These beta-amyloid deposits increased in size as the mice aged  and reached levels proportional to the amount of deposits that develop in human Alzheimer’s patients.   The development of the amyloid plaques have been shown in transgenic mice to have adverse affects on memory, which resemble memory deficits seen in human patients.  

The Morris water maze  is a test conducted on transgenic mice demonstrating the memory loss  resulting from damage to the hippocampus.  This test involves placing a mouse inside a shallow pool of water that contains a submerged platform, which remains out of site of the mouse for the duration of the test.  The mouse is placed in the pool on the opposite of the platform and is allowed to find the submerged platform by swimming around the pool and using visual cues on the surrounding walls.   The test is performed multiple times and each time the mouse is placed  in the same pool, the time spent swimming around in search of the platform decreases, which is a result of the formation of memories the mouse has stored of the various cues.  The Alzheimer’s transgenic mice perform poorly when subjected to this same test, which indicates significant damage to their hippocampus: the location of memory storage in the brain.

One of the main reasons for developing these transgenic mice is to determine whether or not these harmful amyloid plaques are the cause for Alzheimer’s Disease, and what types of treatment can be developed to  prevent them from forming and/or limit their growth.  These transgenic mice not only provide more insight into the cause of Alzheimer’s but they also function as models for testing drugs to treat the disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

In South Korea, there has been a nation-wide effort to incorporate e-learning system into the area of primary and secondary public education. As ‘Activation of e-learning’ was one of the eight major tasks set by Korean Ministry of Education in 2005 (So, 2005), based on its advanced IT infrastructure, the country has succeeded in implementing the Cyber Home Learning System (CHLS) – Internet based learning system – on a national level in its 16 distinct districts of the country as of April, 2005. The major goals of operating CHLS in Korea include improving qualities of the current public education system, resolving the issue of educational equity across different regions and socio-economic status, and reducing the expenses spent on private education (tutoring) which imposes big financial burdens on household economies. In this wiki book section, ‘Kkulmat.com’ (www.kkulmat.com), a CHLS run by Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, will be introduced as one successful example of internet-based K-12 education program.


== Kkulmat.com – Creation of web-based e-learning system ==

Since its opening in March, 2005, the popularity of Kkulmat.com (‘Kkul-mat’ means ‘taste of honey’ in Korean) is now known by more than one million online members and has a daily traffic of about 150, 000 people who visit the website. The website basically provides an abundance of free contents of academic curriculum across major subjects learned at primary and secondary schools. It also gives an opportunity for students to learn what they want to learn at their own pace. The creation of the website was the result of collaborative efforts among the government, the industry, and the academia. The service contents and the management of cyber classes and teachers were done by the government while the developing systems, such as Learning Management System (LMS) were executed by the private party (So, 2005). Korea Education and Research Information Service (KERIS), an academic research institute, played key roles in establishing standard policies and criteria for contents and LMS development, as well as developing training materials for teachers who work in the cyberspace (2005).

Targeted users of Kkulmat.com consist of three major population groups – primary and secondary school (K-12) students, teachers, and parents. For students, the website provides academic contents (based on standardized curriculum), evaluation service, and counseling service. Teachers can have access to various training materials, tutoring manuals, and education policies/guidelines. The website also provides information that help teachers provide effective online counseling service to students. Parents, once they are registered to the website, can track the record of their children’s work. They can also view the study logs, evaluation results, online community activity information, and counseling history. They can access information on children’s education, including the best practices of internet-based learning, which are shared by other parents. Furthermore, they can receive online counseling service regarding their kids’ academic or life issues.

== Key contents and services of ‘Kkulmat.com’ ==

When you look at the online space of the website, the main contents are divided by four major sections, which are called, ‘Study, ‘Challenge’, ‘Ask’, and ‘Meet’. 

The ‘Study’ section provides different contents according to different grades and subjects. One important feature in this section is that the students can either learn in a purely self-directed way utilizing the various online contents, or join a cyber class where cyber teachers are available to help them to schedule their study plan and even assign the homework. In any cyber class setting, students can ask questions to teachers and are also allowed to communicate with their online classmates through an open discussion board. Every teacher member can freely create a cyber class on the website. When students choose to study in a self-directed manner, they can first take a diagnostic test, which enables them to start their own study with the appropriate contents for their knowledge level. Academic learning contents are available for all major subjects (Languages – Korean and English, Math, Social Studies, and Science) and additional subjects (e.g. computer, art, etc.) for primary and secondary school students. 

The ‘Challenge’ section mainly consists of general tests (per each subject and grade level) and chapter tests. The chapter tests are provided for each learning chapter of relevant subject (The public school curriculum in South Korea is pretty much standardized throughout the country) and students can always choose between two types of tests – the basic test and the advanced test. While general tests are available to the students of all grades, chapter tests are only available to 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade students at this point of time. In the area of Math, there are extra sections of evaluation, in addition to the general test and the chapter test. That is, regardless of the grade level within the school category (elementary, middle, and high), there are six distinct categories of math subjects (e.g. probability and statistics). Within each category, there are about ten different levels of tests. All the students should first take a diagnostic test under each category in order to move to the right level of tests. Students can also save the questions they want to keep for future reference in their own online room.

The ‘Ask’ section is the space where academic and life counseling is available to students. In the academic counseling board, students can ask any questions that are related to their study subjects. There are designated groups of cyber teachers who are devoted to answer those questions. It can be observed through the website that teachers mostly give responses to the students within the same day or by the next day from the date the question was posted. This immediacy is possible because the system sends SMS text messages to the teacher’s cell phone whenever it gets questions on the website enabling teachers to stay in tune, even without looking at the website (Kim et al, 2006). Life counseling service helps students get counseling on their life issues, such as family, friends and school related matters. In this section, students have an option to keep their questions and answers private through the lockdown function. For the questions that are frequently asked, there is a separate FAQ column provided under the ‘Ask’ section.

Under the ‘Meet’ section, users can create or join the online communities and are also allowed to create their personal blogs. Students (sometimes with teachers and parents) can share ideas through online community activity. Popular categories of online community include arts, health, hobbies, reading/writing, and foreign languages.

In addition to the above-mentioned service areas of the website, there are many useful auxiliary functions for students, teachers, and parents. For example, all the online members can create their own cyber room where they can keep their notes, as well as counseling history, use online calendar and personal diary, and communicate with other members through sending messages and SMS messages. They can even expand their social networking through the member search function. Through Kkulmat messenger service, students can chat with their cyber teachers and classmates. The website provides a unique function that allows children to collect ‘Honey Drops (Kkul-bang-ul)’. The more they actively participate in the online learning activities, the more ‘Honey Drops’ they get to have in their account. With the earned honey drops, students can buy items for their avatar or read online comic books. The website also provides a separate section for the children who have auditory difficulties to teach them how to read speech even though the current contents have more to be developed.

== Success factors of Cyber Home Learning System (CHLS) ==

In the research article, ''The Qualitative Study of Best Practices of Cyber Home Learning'' (Kim et al, 2006), contributing factors that make a best practice of Cyber Home Learning System were identified. Effective factors that were identified in the case of ‘Kkulmat.com’ can be grouped into four categories: Quality of contents and effective contents utilization, Evaluation measures, Teacher-student interaction through counseling, and Motivation strategy (2006).

''Quality of contents and effective contents utilization''. The learning contents of Kkulmat.com are closely connected with the public school curriculum. In this way, online learning can play an important role of reinforcing school education experience, which meets the primary goal of CHLS as a tool to improve the quality of public education. In this regard, the government sponsored e-learning system can be viewed as an effective blended learning approach. Secondly, students learn more effectively through multiple representations of the contents at Kkulmat.com. Through the various multimedia technologies, students can better understand the learning contents. Also, multimedia-utilized contents attract learners’ attention. Kkulmat.com provides a vast amount of animated learning contents to help students’ learning.

''Evaluation measures''. Online practice tests that provide accumulated database of questions can be a good tool to enhance students’ academic capability. Furthermore, online tests may serve better than offline tests in terms of convenience and effectiveness due to the unique functions such as time-controlling function and automatic evaluation/feedback system.

''Teacher-student interaction''. The importance of interaction between teachers and students in the cyberspace cannot be overemphasized. In ‘Kkulmat.com’, students and teachers can form an effective communication loop. With the benefit of the technology, teachers can give prompt feedback to the students adding values to the mutual interaction. Positive and encouraging words of cyber teachers can evoke motivation in learners. Continuous support on training qualified cyber teachers with expert knowledge and online counseling skills will be essential. 

''Motivation strategy''. While the level of motivation that students can earn from the interaction with teachers is important, ‘Kkulmat.com’ adopts a strategy of having students collect and use ‘Honey Drops’ to encourage their participation in online learning activities. As mentioned earlier, this unique function seems to make students’ learning experiences more enjoyable. However, according to a research on the effectiveness of CHLS, this kind of motivating strategy worked the most in elementary students (Jang, 2006). For middle school and high school students, new motivating measures need to be developed to increase their participation.

== Closing Remark ==

The implementation of nation-wide Cyber Home Learning System (CHLS) has opened a new horizon in the area of public education in South Korea. The blended learning approach that connects e-learning experience with public school education is expected to resolve significant social issues such as educational inequality and excessive household expenses spent on private education (tutoring). Besides, online learning environment may contribute to the paradigm shift of education from traditional teacher-centered approach to learner-centered approach. While ‘Kkulmat.com’ serves its primary purpose of reinforcing public school education through e-learning program, its quality contents and services are also believed to benefit students who have difficulties regularly attending schools for varied personal reasons. Securing more than one million online members within three years can be labeled as a remarkable success, however, experts point out that qualitative growth of the CHLS should be more emphasized in the stabilizing stage of CHLS (Kim et al, 2006). In order that CHLS program will grow as a sustainable and effective learning tool that earns high level of trust from students and parents, continuous effort to provide quality learning contents and well-structured training program for the CHLS teachers will be essential.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Elearning Pentad - Learning without the Ebox'''

----

'''Introduction'''

----

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We’ve all heard the cliché “thinking outside the box”, but when it comes to elearning, the saying may have some substance. The eBox comes to mind when I think of traditional methods of online learning such as learning management systems, discussion threads, and posted lectures. The eBox is where we place courses with relevant documents, quizzes, discussion forums, exams, and other information. Students primarily interact by reading, commenting on discussion boards, and uploading completed assignments. Students mainly communicate with instructors via email and sometimes by using discussion boards. Typically, discussion boards are places where students communicate with classmates by responding to discussion threads posted by the instructor. This type of learning reflects the typical eBox – the course structure is fairly well laid out without much room for variation. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; However, if we think outside the box, the eBox that is, we find that there is an emerging new way of learning online because of Web 2.0 tools. Tim O’Reilly (2003) coined the term Web 2.0 to describe using the Web as a platform in which participation is encouraged. Linda Wallace (2008) describes some of the more common Web 2.0 tools such as blogs, file sharing places, mashups, podcasts, RSS feeds, social networking communities, web conferencing tools, and wikis. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How do these new tools fit into the eBox, or perhaps the better question is, is it even necessary that Web 2.0 tools fit into the eBox? If you are responsible for choosing systems and tools to provide elearning for your school, you will need to consider all of these options. I think it is helpful to strip away any extra layers that might get in the way of seeing our objectives. I think we will then be able to see that sometimes we have restricted our learning methodologies based on the constraints of the eBox. In other words, we will find that we have let the “terrain determine tactics”, when we should be determining our own tactics and building a terrain that suits our learners and our tactics. That is much easier to do, with the openness of today’s Web.

'''Elearning Pentad'''

----

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; To start the process, I will build on the work of Alison Ruth (2008) using Burke’s Pentad to explore how elearning works. Burke (1969) looks at how five elements (i.e., act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose) shape drama. These elements answer the five questions of “what was done (act), when or where it was done (scene), who did it (agent), how he did it (agency) and why (purpose).” At its core, learning involves similar concepts, so this seems like a great place to start. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Let’s look at each of the elements and how they manifest themselves in elearning both within the eBox and outside the eBox in the Web 2.0 world.

'''Participatory Learning Model'''

----

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Vossen &amp; Westerkamp (2008) promote a turning from the closed communities of traditional elearning and a moving to open communities that utilize web services. They argue that the open communities will allow learners to include resources that are personally preferred or otherwise desirable for the learning objectives. This will be increasingly important for teens and adult learners. 

“In a world where learning-in-advance is more and more replaced by learning-on-demand, where tertiary learning is hence gaining importance, and where even university-level training is more and more blurred, for example, by the necessity for a student to provide for his or her tuition themselves, the current situation with e-learning systems is no longer appropriate.” Vossen &amp; Westerkamp (2008)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Simões &amp; Gouveia (2008) argue that the use of Web 2.0 tools in elearning builds on Roberts’ view of the active learner which is deeply rooted in the pedagogical ideas of Vygotsky and Papert. Additionally, according to The Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, a majority of students are using such technologies. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So what does this mean for e-learning? McLoughlin and Lee (2008) think that online learning environments must take advantage of Web 2.0 tools. They call for a new ''Pedagogy 2.0, ''which is a model of learning based on'' ''connectivist pedagogy that will empower learners “to participate, learn, and create knowledge in ways that are personally meaningful and engaging”. The authors define connectivism as a process of creating a network of personal knowledge. Some of the pieces that makeup the Pedagogy 2.0 model include calls for instructors to create Microunits (small pieces of digital content that can be used to augment thinking), to use dynamic syllabi and to scaffold student learning from a wide network of peers, experts, and communities. This model is consistent with Sfard’s (1998) participation model. According to Sfard, knowledge exists as an aspect of participation in cultural practices. Students move into the role of prosumers – both producers and consumers of knowledge (Paavola &amp; Hakkarainen 2005).

'''Conclusion'''

----

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We started with a worn cliché and the suggestion that the cliché might have substance as we ponder elearning and Web 2.0 tools. What we have discovered is that the tools don’t have to fit in the old toolbox. New wine needs new wineskins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Briefly describe each of the four levels of organization of a protein structure===
Primary - The primary structure of a protein is the simple sequence of its amino acids in a linear fashion.&lt;br&gt;
Secondary - The secondary structure of a protein is the alpha helix and beta sheets that amino acid sequencies can form. Turns and loops,not as regular or periodic as alpha/beta strands, are also secondary structures.&lt;br&gt;
Tertiary - The tertiary structure is the overall three-dimensional structure of the protein.. &lt;br&gt;
Quaternary - The quaternary structure of a protein is formed by multiple polypeptides(called subunits) such as dimers, trimers, etc. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

Two hydrogen bonds to the same peptide group are highlighted in magenta; the H to O distance is about 2 Å (0.20 nm). The protein chain runs upwards here, i.e., its N-terminus is at the bottom and its C-terminus at the top. Note that the sidechains (gray stubs) angle slightly downward, toward the N-terminus, while the peptide oxygens (red) point up and the peptide NHs point down.

===What is ELISA, and how is it run?===
&lt;b&gt;[[w:ELISA|ELISA]]&lt;/b&gt; is also known as &lt;b&gt;Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay&lt;/b&gt;. It is a technique used to detect an antibody or an antigen in a sample. ELISA is an undetermined amount of antigen which is fixed for a surface and covered over with an antibody, so the antigen and antibody bind. An enzyme is linked to the antibody so that a visible signal can be seen. There are different methods of ELISA, such as indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA, and competitive ELISA.


=== What is Biochemistry? ===
&lt;b&gt; Biochemistry &lt;/b&gt;is the study of the chemical basis of life.

=== What are the foundations of biochemistry? ===
- Biological, Chemical, and Physical

== Biological == 


&lt;u&gt;Main Cell Structures: Nucleus, Cytoplasm, Plasma Membrane 
&lt;/u&gt;

Nucleus: contains genetic material - DNA and associated proteins

Cytoplasm: aqueous cell contents and suspended particles and organelles

Plasma Membrane: lipid bilayer and selectively permeable to polar substances. Includes proteins that function in transport, signal reception, and enzymes. 

--&gt; Cell size is limited by oxygen diffusion

--&gt; Surface Area increases while the total volume stays the same


&lt;u&gt;Three Life Kingdoms: Eubacteria, Eukaryotes, Archaebacteria
&lt;/u&gt;

Prokaryote: Prokaryotes are organisms that are made up of cells that lack a cell nucleus; DNA is not bound within a nucleus, generally small, undergoes fission/budding, and there is no membrane bounded organelles, mitochondria, or intracellular movement.

Eukaryote: Eukaryotes are organisms that are made up of cells that possess a membrane-bound nucleus and holds genetic material; generally large, undergoes mitosis, and has a mitochondria, cytoskeleton, and intracellular movement. 


&lt;u&gt; Macromolecules: Proteins, Nucleic Acids, Lipids and sugars &lt;/u&gt;

Glucose is a parent sugar. 


&lt;u&gt; Genetic &lt;/u&gt;

1. DNA strands are complementary

2. DNA &lt;--&gt; RNA --&gt; PROTEIN

&lt;u&gt; Evolutionary &lt;/u&gt; 

- RNA WORLD HYPOTHESIS: RNA PREDATED DNA AND PROTEINS

1. Creations of prebiotic soup, including nucleotides, from components of the Earth's primitive atmosphere.

2. Production of short DNA molecules with random sequences.

3. Selective replication of self-duplicating catalytic RNA segments 

4. Synthesis of specific peptides, catalyzed by RNA

5. Increasing role of peptides in RNA replication; coevolution of RNA and protein

6. Primitive translation system develops, with RNA genome and RNA-protein catalysts

7. Genomic RNA begins to be copied into DNA

8. DNA genome, translated on RNA-protein complex (ribosome) with protein catalysts

- DNA mutations produce evolutionary change

- Prokaryotes originated eukaryotes

== Chemical ==

&lt;u&gt; The Composition of the Universe &lt;/u&gt;

- Helium and Hydrogen

&lt;u&gt; The Earth's crust &lt;/u&gt;

- Oxygen and Silicon

&lt;u&gt; The Human Body &lt;/u&gt;

- Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen

&lt;u&gt; Configuration vs. Conformation &lt;/u&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Configuration &lt;/b&gt;is a fixed spatial arrangement of atoms that have the same chemical bonds but have a different stereochemistry. 

&lt;b&gt; Conformation &lt;/b&gt; is a spatial arrangement of groups that, without breaking any bonds, are free to assume different positions in space because the freedom of rotation about single bonds. 

- Carbon molecules form chiral molecules

- Biomolecules are stereospecific 


=Physical=

==== Bioenergetics ====
- Cells need energy to perform work and stay alive and reproduce 
- ATP is the central energy currency
- Enzyme decreases the activation energy of the reactions


==== How is energy extracted, channeled, and consumed in living cells? ====
=====Laws of Thermodynamics =====

- &lt;b&gt; First Law &lt;/b&gt;: the total amount of energy in the universe remains constant

- &lt;b&gt; Second Law &lt;/b&gt;: the total disorder (entropy) of the universe is continuously increasing


====Metabolism====

&lt;b&gt; Catabolism &lt;/b&gt;: ADP to ATP; includes stored nutrients, ingested foods, and dolar photons (exergonic)

1) Charge-charge interactions (ionic interactions)

2) Dipole interactions (hydrophobic interactions)

3) Molecular repulsion at extremely close approach ( Van der Waals interactions)

4) Hydrogen bonds 


= Water=

====What is pH?====

&lt;b&gt; Basic &lt;/b&gt;: pH &gt; 7

&lt;b&gt; Neutral &lt;/b&gt;: pH = 7

&lt;b&gt; Acidic &lt;/b&gt;: pH &lt; 7


==== What is an electrolyte? ====

- A substance that is capable of generating ions in solution

- Strong electrolytes dissociate completely in water (HCl)

- Weak electrolytes dissociate only slightly in water (CH3-COOH)


====Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation====

- Dissociation of a weak acid in the presence of its conjugate base

- When [HA] = [A-] then pH = pKa


====What are buffers and what do they do?====

&lt;b&gt;Buffers&lt;/b&gt;: solutions that tend to resist change in their pH as acid or base is added

- Composed of a weak acid and a conjugate base 

- When adding H+: H+ + A- --&gt; HA

- When adding OH-: OH- + HA --&gt; A- + H2O

- Organic acids and bases are weak proton donors and acceptors


= Amino Acids =

====Protein Composition and Structure====

- Amino Acids --&gt; Peptides --&gt; Proteins


====Primary Structure (Composition-Amino Acids)====

&lt;b&gt; Amino Acids&lt;/b&gt;: are used in every cell in your body in order to build the proteins that you need in order to survive 


&lt;b&gt;Structure&lt;/b&gt;

- Zwitterion: Both polar and non polar (COO- and NH3+)

- Zwitterions are dipolar ions


&lt;b&gt; Stereochemistry&lt;/b&gt;

Configuration of an amino acid

- L = counter-clockwise

- D = clockwise


&lt;b&gt; Torsion Angle (aka dihedral angle) &lt;/b&gt;

- The torsion angle is the measure of rotation around a bond, and is defined by the four atoms surrounding the measured bond


&lt;b&gt; Classes &lt;/b&gt;

- Aliphatic: Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Leucine, and Isoleucine

- Hydroxyl or Sulfer-Containing: Cysteine, Methionine, Serine, Threonine

- Cyclic: Proline

- Aromatic: Phenylalanine, Tryptophan, Tyrosine

- Basic: Histidine, Lysine, Arginine

- Acidic and their Amide: Aspartatic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Asparagine, Glutamine


&lt;b&gt; Peptides &lt;/b&gt;

- A &lt;b&gt;peptide&lt;/b&gt; is a compound consisting of two or more amino acids linked in a chain

- A &lt;b&gt;peptide bond&lt;/b&gt; is the primary linkage of all protein structures


&lt;b&gt; Ramachandran Plot &lt;/b&gt;

- A way to visualize backbone dihedral angles (torsion angles) PSI and PHI of amino acids residues in protein structure

- Represents areas of steric exclusion in the polypeptide chain


&lt;b&gt; Polypeptides &lt;/b&gt;

- A &lt;b&gt; polypeptide&lt;/b&gt; is a string of amino acids that are linked together

- A &lt;b&gt; tetrapeptide &lt;/b&gt; is a peptide consisting of four amino acids joined by peptide bonds


==== Secondary Structure====

A &lt;b&gt; beta strand &lt;/b&gt; is a structural unit of protein beta sheets

- The distance between the amino acids is 3.5 A

- Anti-parallel, parallel, and mixed beta sheets


An &lt;b&gt;alpha-helix&lt;/b&gt; is a right handed coil or spiral conformation (most regular and prevalent in sequences) which is clockwise


&lt;b&gt;Theoretical Helices&lt;/b&gt;

- Residues/turn = 3.6 A

- Translation = 1.5 A

- Pitch = 5.4 A


&lt;b&gt; Alpha Helical coiled-coil&lt;/b&gt;: horizontal and coiled together

&lt;b&gt; Heptad Repeat coiled coil&lt;/b&gt;: vertical and coiled next to each other 

- Collagen Helix (fibrous protein): is present in skin, bond, tendon, and is the most abundant protein in mammals

- Collagen triple-helix


&lt;b&gt; PYMOL &lt;/b&gt; is a molecular visualization program that is very popular with protein crystallographers because of speed and versatility


&lt;b&gt; Turns and Loops &lt;/b&gt;

- A &lt;b&gt;beta-turn&lt;/b&gt; is where a beta strand turns by 180 degrees to fold back on itself, forming two anti-parallel beta strands

- A &lt;b&gt;loop&lt;/b&gt; is a flexible region in a protein's secondary structure


====Tertiary Structure====

- The 3-D structure of a single protein molecule (folding or coiling of the secondary structure to form a globular molecule)

- Includes Hemoglobin and Fatty-Acid binding protein (Alpha proteins, Beta proteins, and Alpha/Beta proteins)


====Quaternary Structure====

- The 3-D structure of a multi-subunit protein and how the subunits fit together (clustering of several individual peptide or protein chains into a final specific shape)

A &lt;b&gt;monomer&lt;/b&gt; is a molecule that can be bonded to other identical molecules to form a polymer 


====Protein Folding and Protein Modifications====

&lt;b&gt; Why do you want to fold proteins?&lt;/b&gt;

- So that their bonds among the atoms can make up the amino acid, and as they fold they hold a particular shape. You want to fold the proteins because the shape of the protein is necessary for its correct function 


&lt;b&gt; How are proteins folded?&lt;/b&gt;

-	Proteins assume their functional shape or conformation

-	Proteins can be folded and unfolded (denatured) 

-	Non-covalent forces help proteins 

-	Charge-charge interactions

-	Dipole-dipole interactions (hydrophobic effect, hydrophobic core)

-	Folding should be thermodynamically favorable


&lt;b&gt; Can you predict how proteins will fold?&lt;/b&gt;

-	Chaperonins, like GroEL, help proteins to fold by using ATP to make the folding reaction favorable 

-	Amino Acids have different hydrophobic tendencies 

-	Amino Acids have different tendencides to be in an alpha helix

-	You can use such properties to predict secondary structure with a 70-80% accuracy 


&lt;b&gt; What are the chemical modifications presented in proteins?&lt;/b&gt;

- 	Glycosidation (sugars)

-	Acetylation

-	Phosphorylation

-	Fatty Acid Addition


=Protein Techniques=

====How do you isolate a protein from others?====

- Protein Purification


====How do you know the shape of a protein?====

- Protein Structure


====Protein Purification====

&lt;b&gt; How do you know the protein is there? How do you recognize it?&lt;/b&gt;

--&gt; Specific Activity (Enzymatic Activity)

-	Activity vs. Specific Activity (Jar of marbles with red marbles)

-	Measuring enzyme activity spectroscopically 

-	Making monoclonal antibodies (separated), polyclonal antibodies (joined together)

-	Normal antibodies that we produce: '''POLYCLONAL ANTIBODIES''' (recognize different areas of the same protein)

-	'''MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES''': Always recognize proteins in the same area

      <text xml:space="preserve">Imagine a ten year old, a fourth grader, sitting at home in Kalamazoo, Michigan learning algebra, ancient history and geography with his classmates located in places such as Marseille, France; Manchester, England; Conakry, Guinea and Penang, Malaysia. Some questions that come to mind include: how would they come together in a common classroom? In what language would they communicate? Who will design the curriculum? What times of the day will they meet? What will be the effect of such interactions on a child’s intellectual development? These are all valid questions, and the purpose of this paper is to address how creating a global classroom via computer-mediated distance learning mechanism will transform the educational development of a K-12 student in the 21st century.

We live in a complex world where educational systems appear to bridge divides by universally including subjects such as the physical sciences, but they still keep us separate because those subjects are taught in different classrooms and under different circumstances. To promote the understanding of other socio-cultural perspectives while gaining the knowledge to compete in the 21st century, a K-12 student should be given an option to share the classroom with people from other countries.

==Creating a global classroom online==

The most practical means of bringing students from different countries to learn together in the same classroom is through the World Wide Web. By harnessing the enormous power of the web, educators can create a learning environment once considered a fairy tale. With the use of personal computers connected through complex telecommunications networks running across the globe, students can engage one another in a virtual classroom. Although they are somewhat handicapped by the inability of class members to see one another. This online format almost assures that the K-12 student will learn at his/her convenience if classes are virtual and will also avoid commuting to school when he/she attends classes through this medium.

==Management and control of course design==

Perhaps the most contentious issue will be the entity that will manage the design, review and distribution of academic content in the global classroom. This will determine the language of instruction and the curriculum in general. The solution to any potential conflict arising from the issue of control will be for all participating countries to adopt English; a language widely spoken around the world, to be the main language of instruction; except where classes in other languages are being taught.

The design of course curricula should not be left to only one country. Rather, it should be jointly managed by a committee representing all the participating countries. The intent of creating a global classroom is to give a child a truly global education. Therefore, anything less than full cooperation from all participating countries may defeat the purpose of the idea. The subjects to be offered and the contents should be evaluated by all concerned parties. Courses requiring practical collaboration among students should incorporate collaboration tools such as wikis etc.

==Establishing educational balance==

Essentially, creating a global classroom does not mean that the K-12 student will take all classes online. In order to balance the child’s academic experience, a portion of his/her education can be delivered in a traditional classroom. What this does is ensure that the child maintain a degree of social interaction in a physical environment while still being a member of a global classroom in an online environment. The committee charged with developing the curricula must recognize that the online education should be only a part of the child’s academic experience. Therefore, at least one third of the education of a student who is participating in a global classroom may need to be taken on-site, while the remaining two thirds will be online for the sole purpose of achieving the balance described earlier.

We need to make certain the distinction between global schooling and home schooling. In the former as proposed in this paper, the student is taught by a teacher located in a different country other than his/her home country, while in the former, the teacher is the student’s parent primarily.

==Feasibility of course offerings==

It’s unrealistic to think every course is capable of being offered through the global classroom, due to factors ranging from language barriers to the requirements of the courses. Courses in the liberal arts can be easily taught along with math. The biggest challenge will come from the physical sciences, i.e. physics, chemistry and biology.

The designers of the curriculum must ensure that the courses being offered provide the best opportunity for quality learning. There should be little incentive to push all the course work of the student to the web when some of these courses may be better taught in a traditional classroom.

==Enforcing discipline in a cross-boundary classroom==

So, who will enforce discipline in the global classroom? Given differences in cultures and academic practices, it is easy to see potential conflicts when a child in England is subject to the disciplinary style of the German academic system. The best solution to this potential conflict is to empower the same management team described earler to create a set of acceptable disciplinary measures that are country-neutral and can be accepted by all participating countries.

It’s important for there to be discipline in the classroom because students can easily go off course if they operate unchecked. There must be set deadlines for submitting assignments and a code of conduct on how to relate to people in the global classroom.

==Synchronous Vs Asynchronous learning==

Synchronous online learning refers to the real time conduct of class sessions, while asynchronous learning refers to a non-real time class arrangement. In a synchronous setting, the students and teacher log on to the internet and hold classes as though they were all in the same location – the only exception being that they can’t see one another.

==Potential impact on a child’s education==

The first impact of a global classroom on a child’s education is to broaden the student’s world view. For a student that would have been exposed to an insular educational system to be absorbed into a wider academic space is phenomenal. The K-12 student will certainly not see the world the same way a counterpart without the same experience and opportunity will view the world.

In a multicultural world, a student who seeks to thrive in the 21st century must be able to draw upon knowledge that originates from outside his/her national boundaries. A K-12 student may pride themselves as being a global citizen after such an extraordinary journey.

==Potential impact on cross-cultural understanding==

The robust exchange of academic ideas in a global classroom will promote understanding and tolerance among the student body. Never will students view their counterparts from other parts of the world through the lens of stereotypes. The American kid who belongs to the same class as a child in Malaysia will not need anyone to define who Malaysians are to him. More often than not, ignorance of other people fuels suspicion and negative response. In the process, unreliable information about such people or parts of the world are disseminated to an unsuspecting public that may accept it as the truth.

A student in the global classroom is transformed by experience into a knowledge and truth seeker, who will not simply accept what he’s told about people and cultures around the world. The enormous benefits of these interactions to global fellowship and peace cannot be overemphasized.

==Conclusion==

Throughout this paper, attempt has been made to address each of the questions posed at the beginning. While those questions were answered in various sections and in no particular order, it is crucial to continue to raise awareness about the issues surrounding a proposed global classroom. For instance, the issues of adopting a common language for instruction and establishing a framework for multilateral management of courses are worth revisiting to minimize conflict.

It's key to note that adopting the idea of a global classroom will raise the quality of education and bridge cultural divides. It will give a universal meaning to some of the best known subjects that have been taught for generations across the globe. For instance, the K-12 student will discover that the methods of solving problems in algebra and geometry are the same in Lagos, Nigeria as they are in Perkasie, Pennsylvania. The purpose of the global classroom is not to wish away socio-cultural differences among nations, but it will promote a greater degree of accommodation of diverse views than currently exists. As a result, this medium of education offers the best chance for us to create the next generation of global leaders and thinkers who, though residing in different countries and territories, share a common bond and destiny to make the world a better place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How does carbon dioxide affect hemoglobin? ==

Carbon dioxide decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. This is because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with water, with the help of carbonic anhydrase, to form carbonic acid. this lowers the pH, which in turn lowers the affinity of oxygen to hemogobin.

== What are the differences between myoglobin and hemoglobin? ==

Hemoglobin 
                                              
-tetramer with beta and alpha subunits with a Fe metal center at the active site

-more efficient O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carrier from lungs to rest of the body due to easy release of ligand (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

-weaker hold on and lower affinity for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

-cooperative molecule with two distinct states: T (tense) and R (relaxed)

-as pH decreases the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity decreases and vice versa 

-better release of ligand when low pH inside red blood cells


Myoglobin

-single polypeptide with Fe metal center at active site

-controls reactivity of Heme group to prevent release of reactive O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

-stronger hold on and higher affinity for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

-better carrier choice in muscle cells

-Fe gets oxidized from II to III through binding of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

-works better if remains in dioxygen form and not superoxide       



== Describe the catalytic mechanism of chymotrypsin? ==

1. Binding of substrate

2. A nucleophilc attack of serine on the peptide carbonyl group 

3. Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate

4. The release of the amine component

5. Water binds (hydrolysis)

6. Nucleophilic attack of water on the acyl-enzyme intermediate

7. Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate

8. Release of the carboxylic acid component

== What is a zymogen, why are they created by the body? ==

A zymogen is an inactive precursor of an enzyme. The reason for cells to secrete inactive enzymes is to prevent unwanted destruction of cellular proteins.

== What are the two models for the formation of Golgi complex? ==

1. CISTERNAE MATURATION describes that golgi was made from scratch and that proteins from the ER fused and matured to create the specific compartments.

2. VESICULAR SHUTTLE MODEL describes that golgi was a pre-existing structure within the cell and that its function is to continue the processing of proteins after the ER.


== Carbohydrates ==

Sugars or saccharides
&lt;/br&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/br&gt; Monosaccharides are chiral molecules
&lt;/br&gt; An aldehyde or a ketone can react with an alcohol to yield a hemiacetal or a hemiketal.

== Anomeric Carbon ==

- In a ring structure it is the hemiacetal or hemiketal that is bound to an alcohol group and an ester bond

== Formation of Glycosidic Bond ==

- In ring form of glucose molecule, the anomeric carbon and a hemiacetal group react with alcohol group
&lt;/br&gt; - It releases water then forms glycosidic bond
&lt;/br&gt; - Can be either an alpha or beta bond

== Reducing Sugars ==

- Reducing sugars are hemiacetals and have a reactive carbonyl group
&lt;/br&gt; - Reducing sugars can be made longer and longer
&lt;/br&gt; - Examples: glucose, maltose, lactose

== Non-reducing Sugars ==

- Cannot form glycosidic bond
&lt;/br&gt; - There is no anomeric carbon available since they are fixed in a bond already

== Polysaccharides ==

- Homo-polysaccharides take one sugar and the rest of chain is made of the same sugar
&lt;/br&gt; - Hetero-polysaccharides are chains made up of different sugars
&lt;/br&gt; - Both can be branched or unbranched

== Glycosylation ==

- Glycoproteins are formed when a carbohydrate is attached to a protein
&lt;/br&gt; - Main goal is to make protein more soluble
&lt;/br&gt; - Makes it easier for protein to be in solution because of the added hydroxyl group
&lt;/br&gt; - Often results in a branched oligosaccharide
&lt;/br&gt; - Occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum then is transported to the Golgi
&lt;/br&gt; - '''TWO TYPES'''
&lt;/br&gt; 
* N-linked: Only happens with amino acid, Asparagine
:* Begins in the endoplasmic reticulum then continues to Golgi
* O-linked: Only happend with amino acids, Serine and Threonine
:* Takes place exclusively in Golgi

== Lipids ==

- Fatty acid component
:* Hydrocarbon chains
:* Saturated or unsaturated
:* Carboxylic group at end

== Phospholipids ==

- Consists of:
:* Glycerol molecule
:*Fatty acid attached to glycerol
:*Phosphate group and alcohol also attached to glycerol
&lt;/br&gt; - They are also amphipathic molecules

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dehydrogenases ==
Dehydrogenases catalyze the oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds by using either NAD+ or NADP+.  
Some dehydrogenases are specific for one coenzyme. This reaction can be reduced by NADH or NADPH. 
In the oxidation of the alcohol, one in dehydrogenases transferred to the 4 position of the nicotinamide ring of the NAD+ by removing two hydrogens. Therefore, the carbonyl group was made from the reaction.  This reaction is stereospecific.  The enzyme can either attack either side of the ring, resulting in different conformations and characteristics.  The enzyme with the syn conformation will catalyze the reaction to reduce carbonyls groups more rapidly. The enzyme with the anti conformation is less reactive than the previous enzyme. Different types of dehydrogenases exist, some of which are briefly mentioned below.

===1. The alcohol dehydrogenases===
The alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes the reaction of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones by using NAD+ as a coenzyme.  It also has the zinc ion sites at the bottom of the enzyme. The zinc ion binds on NAD+ by during the catalysis.  
Mechanistically, the coenzyme binds to the enzyme by oxidizing the alcohol in the enzyme. The enzyme-NADH complex is dissociated to be rate determining.

===2. L-Lactate dehydrogenase===
L-lactate dehydrogenase oxidizes the reversible reaction of L-lactate to pyruvate by using NAD+ as a coenzyme. The alcohol group becomes the carbonyl group of the enzyme. L-lactate or pyruvate is binded  to the enzyme through the coenzyme. Therefore, the coenzyme always binds on the enzyme first. Other substrates may bind to the enzyme as well.
Lactate dehydrogenase is especially important for the role that it plays in glycolysis. In order for glycolysis to occur, NAD+ must be available. Under anaerobic conditions, there is not sufficient NAD+ available for glycolysis to occur because it is all stuck in the NADH form (the insufficient amount of oxygen means that no oxygen is present to receive electrons from the end of the electron transport chain). Lactate dehydrogenase allows for the occurrence of glycolysis by helping in the conversion of NADH to NAD+. Lactate dehydrogenase does this by converting pyruvate to lactate. The figure below explains this reaction.

As is shown, two electrons are removed from NADH and a proton is added in order for lactate to be formed and for NADH to be oxidized to NAD+.

===3. Malate dehydrogenase===
Malactate dehydrogenase oxidizes malate to oxaloactate in areversible reaction. NADH and NAD+ bind with equal affinity. In other words, it catalyzes, by means of NAD+ or NADP, the dehydrogenation of malate to oxaloacetate or the decarboxylation of maleate to pyruvate.

===4. Glutamate Dehydrogenase===
Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of the nitrogen atom in glutamate into ammonium ions by oxidative deamination (See Reaction Scheme Below). In oxidative deamination, the reaction starts by dehyrogenation of the Carbon-Nitrogen bond, which then leads to an imine intermediate known as the Schiff-base intermediate. The first step utilizes glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)and utilizes the coenzyme NAD+, which is reduced to NADH [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Enzyme/Coenzymes#NADH]. Next, hydrolysis of the Schiff base leads to α-ketoglutarate and the free ammonium ion. The reaction is driven in the forward direction due to quick removal of the ammonium ion. Glutamate dehydrogenase is located in the mitochondria of cells.  Glutamate dehydrogenase is unique because, in some organisms, it is capable of using either NAD+ or NADP+ in its catalytic reactions. This ability is unique because NADPH is used as the reductant in biosynthetic reactions, while NAD+ is usually used as the oxidant in most catabolic reaction, and glutamine dehydrogenase is not specific to either.

== Hemoglobin ==
[[Image:Heme b.svg‎|thumb|Iron metal center|200px]]
&lt;b&gt;Hemoglobin&lt;/b&gt; is contained in red blood cells, which efficiently carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues of the body. Hemoglobin also helps in the transportation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions back to the lungs. 

&lt;b&gt;Hemoglobin&lt;/b&gt; is able to bind to gaseous nitric oxide (NO) as well as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As red blood cells passes through the capillary beds of the lungs, gills (in fish), or other respiratory organs, oxygen is diffused into the erythrocytes and hemoglobin binds O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO. Hemoglobin then unloads its cargo in the capillaries. There O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is able to diffuse into the body cells. The NO relaxes the walls of the capillaries, allowing them to expand which in effects helps the delivery of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the cells.

[[Image:Hemoglobin_structure.JPG|thumb|Alpha, Beta, Heme|200px|left]]&lt;b&gt;Hemoglobin&lt;/b&gt; consists of four subunits, each with a cofactor called a heme group that has an iron atom center. The iron is the main component that actually binds to oxygen, thus each hemoglobin molecule is able to carry four molecules of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Cooperation among the four subunits of the hemoglobin molecule is necessary for the efficient transportation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The four subunits of hemoglobin actually bind to oxygen &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;cooperatively&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, the binding of oxygen to one site of the four subunits will increase the likelihood of the remaining sites to bind with oxygen as well.

Hemoglobin is a protein that is used to carry oxygen through the blood stream from the lungs to the tissues. This is important for survival. Hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen the lower the concentration of oxygen gets. This has great implications for the human body and has helped us adapt very effectively. The lower affinity and lower concentrations means that when we are working out, our bodies are low on oxygen which means hemoglobin has less affinity for oxygen and can more easily drop the oxygen off at human tissues. This gives us greater oxygen in our oxygen dependent state. On the other hand, when oxygen concentration is high, the hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and therefore does not drop the oxygen where it is not needed. This is a very complex and smart system that has evolved to keep hemoglobin as an important biological molecule for a very long time. On the otherhand, the cousin of hemoglobin, myoglobin is used to store oxygen in muscles. This myoglobin has a slighty higher affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin especially at lower levels. This is because myoglobin has an easier job in that it only needs to store oxygen and release it for the muscles, while hemoglobin also has to transport the oxygen and release it in the correct areas. 

Hemoglobin is created in the body by DNA just like all the other proteins. Alterations or mutations to hemoglobin causes many blood related diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, where the cell structure is distorted and can no longer carry as much oxygen in the correct way as a normal blood cell. This highlights the underlying ideal in structural biochemistry in that structure DETERMINES FUNCTION. This is proof! The sickle cell anemia case is extremely interesting because it shows us how and why diseases develop. The gene for sickle cell anemia also provides protection against malaria. Therefore, in countries where malaria presented problems, there was an higher than average amount of individuals carrying the sickle cell anemia gene. The heterozygous state is best because it does not allow sickle cell anemia to develop while still preventing malaria. Whereas, the homozygous states would produce individuals either struck with sickle cell anemia or malaria. This is why in malaria ridden areas, there is a higher than average number of people who are heterozygous for sickle cell anemia which is also why this disease does not die out! The carrier state is actually selected by nature. &lt;ref name=&quot;hemoglobin and myoglobin&quot;&gt;[ hemoglobin and myoglobin], November 14th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conformational Change ==
Upon O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding to an active site of hemoglobin there is a conformational change that results, which helps hemoglobin cooperate. &lt;b&gt;Cooperation&lt;/b&gt; refers to the interactions among active sites, in the case of hemoglobin, cooperation allows the binding of oxygen to be increased as one site is filled, the remaining active sites will be more likely to bind to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well.
[[Image:Hemoglobin_t-r_state_ani.gif‎ |left|thumb|Hemoglobin Interactions]]
Once O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is bound to an active site on the hemoglobin molecule, the iron atom Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is oxidized to (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). The interaction that results between iron and oxygen in hemoglobin is a combination of resonance structures, one with (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and another between (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) and super ion O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The binding of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the iron center results in a conformational change in the histidine residue toward the porphyrin in the structure of the hemoglobin molecule which ultimately results in an increase O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity of hemoglobin. The associated movement of the histdine-containing group will result in a conformational change to the rest of the hemoglobin structure. The COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; group is now interacting with the alpha-beta interface which causes conformational changes of neighboring active sites. These conformational changes will result in an increase of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity to hemoglobin.

==== Allostery ====
Hemoglobin is an allosteric protein. It's ability to bind to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to one of the subunits is affected by its interactions with the other subunits. As mentioned above, the binding of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to one hemoglobin subunit induces conformational changes that are relayed to the other subunits, making them more able to bind to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by raising their affinity for this molecule. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate are all allosteric effectors as they favor the conformation of deoxyhemoglobin and therefore promote the release of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Because these three molecules act at different sites, their effects are additive.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Enzyme_Model.jpg|Allosteric regulation of an enzyme
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Mechanism of the allosteric change ====
X-ray crystallography revealed that oxyhemoglobin, the form that has four O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules bound, differs markedly in its quaternary structure from deoxyhemoglobin, the form with no O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bound. In the absence of bound O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; lies slightly to one side of the porphyrin ring, which itself is slightly curved. As a molecule of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binds to the heme prosthetic group it pulls the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into the plane of the porphyrin ring, flattening out the ring in the process. Movement of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; causes the proximal histidine to move also. This, in turn, shifts the position of helix F and regions of the polypeptide chain at either end of the helix. Thus, movement in the center of the subunit is transmitted to the surfaces, where it causes the ionic interactions holding the four subunits together to be broken and to reform in a different position, thereby altering the quaternary structure,leading to the cooperative binding of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Hb.

== Regulation by pH (Bohr effect)==
[[Image:Bohreffectcurve.gif‎|right|thumb|Bohr Effect Curve ]]The regulation of oxygen binding of hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide is called the &lt;b&gt;Bohr Effect&lt;/b&gt;, which was proposed by Christian Bohn, in 1904. The Bohr Effect describes the effect of pH on the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin decreases as pH decreases from a value of 7.4. As hemoglobin moves into a region of lower pH, its tendency to release oxygen will increase, therefore more oxygen will be release as the environment becomes more acidic.
[[Image:Bohr-Effekt_2.svg‎|left|thumb|300px|Protonation occurs in low pH]]

There is a chemical basis that is responsible for the pH effect. The histidine residue of hemoglobin molecule structure is one factor of the pH effect. At high pH, the side chain of histidine is not protonated and the salt bridge between histindine's terminal carboxylate group and a lysine residue, does not form. However as the pH drops, meaning at low pH levels, the side chain of histidine will become protonated and thus form a salt bridge with Aspartate instead. This electrostatic interaction results in a structural change. The formation of salt bridges stabilizes the hemoglobin structure resulting in a lower O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity of hemoglobin and thus increase the tendency for oxygen to be released.

== Regulation by 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)==
[[Image:2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate.svg‎|thumb|Structure of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate]]The effect of &lt;b&gt;2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)&lt;/b&gt; in hemoglobin is described as an allosteric effect. &lt;b&gt;2,3-BPG&lt;/b&gt; is an allosteric effector, it binds to a site that is completely remote from the active site for oxygen. The amount of &lt;b&gt;2,3-BPG&lt;/b&gt; in red cells is crucial in determine the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. 

A single &lt;b&gt;2,3-BPG&lt;/b&gt; molecule is bound in the center of the tetramer of a deoxyhemoglobin structure in a central cavity in the T form. Upon the transition of T state to R state, &lt;b&gt;2,3-BPG&lt;/b&gt; is released. Therefore in order for the transition from T to R states to occur, the bonds between hemoglobin and &lt;b&gt;2,3-BPG&lt;/b&gt; needs to be broken. In the presence of &lt;b&gt;2,3-BPG&lt;/b&gt;, oxygen is less tightly bound to hemoglobin. The conformational changes allow a structural stabilization to occur and thus hemoglobin gains oxygen affinity.

== Regulation by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ==
Carbon dioxide is able to stimulate oxygen release by two mechanisms:
# The presence of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in high concentration will DECREASE the affinity of hemoglobin due to a drop in pH with the red blood cell

There are effects of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in hemoglobin through catalysis. A reaction between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water forms carbonic acid. However, this reaction requires for carbon dioxide to be catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme in red blood cells, which ultimately results in H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. Once carbonic acid dissociates into these two ions, pH will drop. The drop in pH stabilizes the T state and thus increases the tendency for oxygen release.

                                                                CO2 ↔ CO2 + H2O ↔ H2CO3 ↔ HCO3- + H+

#A direct chemical interaction between (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and hemoglobin will stimulate the release of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is able to stable deoxyhemoglobin by reacting with terminal amino groups to form negatively charged carbamate groups. This interaction results in a salt-bridge that stables the T state, which favors the release of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:carbamate.png|300px]]

 
It also explains the transport of carbon dioxides from tissue to lung. CO2 that produced by tissue cells pass through the red blood cell and form H+ and HCO3- as previously mentioned. It allows the exchange of HCO3- for Cl-. Therefore, the concentration of HCO3- increases in the blood capillary and carbon dioxides are carried to lung in this form. When HCO3- reaches lung, the reverse reaction take place and release carbon dioxides in lung.

== Competitive Inhibitory Ligands ==
Several molecules are responsible for substantially lowering hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen to tissues.  The most common is carbon monoxide (CO), which has a binding affinity to hemoglobin 200 times greater than oxygen.  Once carbon monoxide binds to the heme group, oxygen affinity is increased, since hemoglobin is a tetrameter that facilitates cooperative ligand binding.  However, this prevents oxygen from being released into oxygen-requiring tissue.  The CO and hemoglobin complex is known as carboxyhemoglobin.  This is known as carbon monoxide poisoning, where CO competitively binds to oxygen and prevents oxygen transport.  As such, as small concentration of CO can cause serious harm to an individual.  As little as 0.02% of CO concentration can cause headaches, and 0.1% will lead to unconsciousness.  Other competitive ligands include cyanide, sulfur monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfide.

== Differences in Embryonic, Fetal and Adult Hemoglobin ==

Embryonic and fetal hemoglobin differ at the subunit level to that of adult hemoglobin by the subunit interface strengths. Subunit interface in embryonic hemoglobin are much weaker than subunits in fetal hemoglobin which are much weaker than in adult subunit interface.  In human red blood cells, hemoglobin can have eight different combinations of dimer formations. Each formation can be present in greater amounts than others or can be present only at distinct times during development. In embryonic development there are three different kinds: ζ_2 γ_2 (Hb Portland-1), ζ_2 ε_2  (Hb Gower-1) and α_2 ε_2 (Hb Gowler-2). Fetal hemoglobin consists of α_2 γ_2(HbF) and adult hemoglobin consists of α_2 β_2 (HbA) as well as trace amounts of α_2 δ_2(HbA2). Although the tertiary structure of all these various hemoglobin is almost identical, their primary structure varies in specific substitutions that accounts for their differing O_2affinity as well as their interactions with allosteric effectors. These amino acid substitutions have an effect on how the subunits fit together and how their interactions take place. Embryonic ζ_2 γ_2 (Hb Portland-1), ζ_2 ε_2  (Hb Gower-1) and α_2 ε_2 (Hb Gowler-2) is found during the first few months of life as well as a fourth, ζ_2 β_2 (Hb Portland-2). ζ_2 β_2 (Hb Portland-2) is a rarely occurring form of hemoglobin.  The strengths between the interfaces of the monomer units in each kind of hemoglobin differ significantly and to a greater extent in the deoxy state and become even stronger in the liganded state. The tertramer-dimer dissociation constants differed depending on what subunits they contained. For example, between the two similar embryonic subunits ζ_2 ε_2  (Hb Gower-1) and α_2 ε_2 (Hb Gowler-2) there was a difference in dissociation constants of 13-fold from α to ζ subunits. Therefore by comparing the different types of hemoglobin with one that has one similar subunit, their dissociation constants can give a wide range on information. Little is known about the Hb Portland-2 because it s rare and only occurs in a type of α-thalassemia (genetic defect). Hb Portland-2 differs from other hemoglobins because it dissociates from tetramer to dimers and even more readily from dimers to monomers whereas other types of human hemoglobin will dissociate from from tetramers to dimers rapidly but will not dissociate from dimers to monomers. The dissociation talked about happens at pH 7.5 but will differ significantly once the pH is lowered. In HbA (adult hemoglobin), the dissociation of tetramer to dimer increases with the decrease in pH, for every 1pH unit decrease, there is a 10 fold increase in dissociation. When the pH is changed to 6.3, the dissociation in HbA will be primarily dimers whereas in Hb Portland-2 the dissociation is mainly monomers. With this being true, the formation of tetramers in HbA is favored greater than the formation of tetramers in Hb Portland-2 because ζ_2 β_2 dimer is much weaker than α_2 β_2 dimer. In HbA, the α and β subunits are unstable but in Hb Portland-2 ζ and β subunits are weak interfaces as dimers but are stable as monomers. Embryonic hemoglobins at pH 6.3 are able to dissociate readily but Hb Portland-1 and Gowler-1 dissociate faster than Hb Gowler-2.  When monomers of embryonic hemoglobin Hb Gowler-2 and Portland-2 were mixed and allowed to recombine, the stronger tetramer formation was the result. Instead of having α_2 ε_2 (Hb Gowler-2) and ζ_2 β_2 (Hb Portland-2) reform, the formation of α_2 β_2 (HbA) was obtained as well as ζ_2 ε_2 because the αβ interface is the strongest and therefore most favored. And when the ζ_2 γ_2 (Hb Portland-1), α_2 ε_2  (Hb Gower-2) were put through the same process, the interface of Fetal Hemoglobin α_2 γ_2(HbF) was the result because it is by far stronger than embryonic hemoglobins. When the ζ_2 γ_2 (Hb Portland-1), α_2 ε_2  (Hb Gower-2) and ζ_2 β_2 (Hb Portland-2) were mixed, the favored outcome was HbA and HbF was not detectable. All three experiments prove that subunit competition contributes to the rearranging and the notably higher α_2 β_2 formation than any other tetramer due to the stronger interface. The rarity of Hb Portland-2 may be due to the fact that the tetramer-dimer and dimer-monomer interfaces are relatively weaker than any other human hemoglobins. Subunit competition has a lot to do with why some hemoglobins are more likely to form because the formation of hemoglobins with stronger interfaces is favored over the formation of weaker ones. As well as there being formation of stronger ones from the weaker ones.  

==Roles in disease==

Hemoglobin is formed by genes that are in charge of the expression of the hemoglobin protein. Failings in these genes can form irregular hemoglobin and anemia, which are conditions termed &quot;hemoglobin disorder&quot;. Irregular hemoglobin appears in these three conditions.

1. Structural failure in the hemoglobin molecule. Changes in the gene for one of the two hemoglobin subunit chains, alpha (α) or beta (β), are called mutations. Often, mutations change a single amino acid building block in the subunit. Most commonly the change is innocuous, perturbing neither the structure nor function of the hemoglobin molecule. Occasionally, alteration of a single amino acid dramatically disturbs the behavior of the hemoglobin molecule and produces a disease state. Sickle hemoglobin represents this phenomenon.

2. Reduced production of one of the two subunits of the hemoglobin molecule. Mutations that form this condition are termed &quot;thalassemias.&quot; Equal numbers of hemoglobin alpha and beta chains are essential for normal function. Hemoglobin chain inequity damages and destroys red cells thereby producing anemia. Although there is a dearth of the affected hemoglobin subunit, with most thalassemias the few subunits created are structurally normal.

3. Irregular relations of otherwise normal subunits. A single subunit of the alpha chain and a single subunit from the β-globin locus combine to create a normal hemoglobin dimer. With severe α-thalassemia, the β-globin subunits start to associate into groups of tetramers due to the scarcity of potential α-chain partners. These tetramers of β-globin subunits are functionally inactive and do not carry oxygen. No similar tetramers of alpha globin subunits form with severe beta-thalassemia. Alpha subunits are quickly destroyed in the absence of a partner from the beta-globin gene cluster.

'''Simple syrup''', also known as '''sugar syrup''' or '''bar syrup''', is a [[cookbook:sweeteners|sweetener]] made of [[cookbook:granulated sugar|granulated sugar]] and [[cookbook:water|water]]. Simple syrup is often used to sweeten cold beverages, in which solid sugar will not readily dissolve.

As its name suggests, simple syrup is very easy to prepare. Prepared syrup can be stored, refrigerated, for up to a week.

==Ingredients==

*1 part [[cookbook:water|water]]
*2 parts [[cookbook:granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]

==Procedure==

# Combine the sugar and cold water in a [[cookbook:sauce pan|sauce pan]].
# Bring the water to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly.
# When all of the sugar has dissolved, remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature.
# Transfer to a storage container, and refrigerate until needed.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

*Food coloring can be added to make differently colored syrups.
*Flavors and extracts can be added after the sugar dissolves, to create flavored syrups.
*The ratio of sugar and water can be changed to make thinner or thicker syrup.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Substrate Specificity==
===Complex formation and Bond Cleavage===
In an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the substrate must first attaché to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]]. The substrate is relatively smaller than the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]]. Therefore, the substrate is binding with a portion of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]]. The substrate is attached to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] with weak bonding forces such as hydrogen bond, electrostatic interactions, and dipole-dipole interactions. The substrates are usually complementary to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]]. However, it is possible that they do not fit perfectly each other. These bonding forces help the complex to be more stable. In the case of two substrate reactions involving ternary complex, two substrates must be bound close to each other to precede the reaction. It is impossible to proceed the reaction if two substrates are not adjacent or close each other spatially. From the case, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] should have some steric specificity.

===Asymmetric reactions of Symmetric substrates===
Symmetric substrates are bound the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] asymmetrically in [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] reactions. For example, when an symmetric substrate binds to an [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]], the enzyme-substrate complex becomes asymmetric. Further, when two identical substrates binds to the complex, they start to react differently with other molecules. 

===Achieving Specificity and it's Affect on Catalysis===
Specificity is achieved when a substrate binds to an enzyme that has a defined arrangement of atoms in the active site.  In order for the substrate to bind correctly the active site must be in a correct shape that matches the enzyme.  The substrate binds to the enzyme through multiple weak bonding interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions.  The lock-and-key model that Emil Fischer devised in 1890 demonstrates the binding between a substrate and the enzyme.  This model demonstrates that the enzyme must have a cleft or crevice that corresponds to the shape of the substrate perfectly.

With many years of research it has now been determined that enzymes are more flexibly than what scientists once believed and that the lock-and-key model is not an accurate representation.  Donald E. Koshland Jr. discovered the induced fit model in 1958 in which the active sites on proteins can be modified so that the substrate can fit better.  In some cases however, the active site does not modify its shape until the substrate has already been bonded to the enzyme.

This affects the catalysis in many ways.  One thing is that when the two bind together they produce something called binding energy which the free energy that two exhibit when they form.  Maximum binding energy can only be achieved when the correct substrate binds to the enzyme.  This makes substrate specificity very important.  It is also at its highest when the substrate is in the transition state.  The release of the binding energy when the substrate is in its transition state lowers the activation energy of the reaction and thus making the reaction have a faster rate making the time for product to form much shorter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Civil Engineering. PhD, Licensed Professional Engineeer in USA, 46 yrs experience. Latest 15 years as a volunteer for infrastructure in the Developing World. Focus is primarily water supply and wastewater treatment in rural areas. My specialty is design that aims to use natural physical forces (e.g. gravity), biological processes rather than chemicals, use of native skill sets and materials found in the area of a proposed project, and such robustness of design that the function of the project may operate for weeks or months with neglect.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Though this may seem like a simple or natural creation.  There are some rhetorical and pedagogical questions to think about while creating the assignment sequence for the class.

'''Topical assignment sequence:'''

With the topical assignment sequence you let a topic dictate the order of assignments.  For example, if the main topic for the course were technology, the following assignment sequence would be effective.

1.	Narration: Narrate your relationship to technology as a child.  Did you play computer games? Did you watch a lot of movies and TV?  Did you have any electronic toys and games?

2.	Visual Analysis: Find an advertisement online.  Using the rhetorical principles learned in class, analyze the ad.

3.	Cause and Effect:  Write about the cultural environment that caused a need for computers.  Then discuss the effect computers have had on our society.

4.	Argument: Argue for or against the idea that writing online is not as important as writing essays.

5.	Research Paper: Pick a type of technology that has failed or become obsolete.  Give the history of that technology, and talk about the possible reasons for its annihilation.


'''Traditional assignment sequence:'''

In a traditional assignment sequence, each assignment builds on the skills learned in the previous assignment.  These skills are all combined in the final assignment.


1.	Narrative or observational essay

2.	Cause and effect essay

3.	Rhetorical analysis

4.	Argument paper

5.	Research paper


Things to think about: how can you make these different sequences your own? Are there assignments, which may serve the same purpose (such as analysis) but fit better into your class?  With the emphasis of finals at the end of the year, would it be better for your students to put the research paper second to last?


'''Steps for helping students with an assignment:'''


1.	Introduce the genre of writing; define any key terms and/or authors; discuss the context of the assignment and the content o the assignment.

2.	Help students pick a topic by brainstorming, free writing, outlining, and/or doing research.

3.	Teach students effective organization techniques (and research, if the assignment has a research component). 

4.	Revise, revise, revise! Here you may want to do peer review, conferences, or some other revision technique.  The more you require rough drafts, the less of a chance your students will plagiarize.  Also, you can get a feeling for how well your students comprehend the assignment.

2.	Visual Analysis: Find an advertisement online.  Using the rhetorical principles learned in class, analyze the ad.

3.	Cause and Effect:  Write about the cultural environment that caused a need for computers.  Then discuss the effect computers have had on our society.

4.	Argument: Argue for or against the idea that writing online is not as important as writing essays.

5.	Research Paper: Pick a type of technology that has failed or become obsolete.  Give the history of that technology, and talk about the possible reasons for its annihilation.


&lt;h2&gt;Traditional assignment sequence&lt;/h2&gt;

In a traditional assignment sequence, each assignment builds on the skills learned in the previous assignment.  These skills are all combined in the final assignment.


1.	Narrative or observational essay

2.	Cause and effect essay

3.	Rhetorical analysis

4.	Argument paper

5.	Research paper


Things to think about: how can you make these different sequences your own? Are there assignments, which may serve the same purpose (such as analysis) but fit better into your class?  With the emphasis of finals at the end of the year, would it be better for your students to put the research paper second to last?


&lt;h2&gt;Steps for helping students with an assignment&lt;/h2&gt;


1.	Introduce the genre of writing; define any key terms and/or authors; discuss the context of the assignment and the content o the assignment.

2.	Help students pick a topic by brainstorming, free writing, outlining, and/or doing research.

3.	Teach students effective organization techniques (and research, if the assignment has a research component). 

4.	Revise, revise, revise! Here you may want to do peer review, conferences, or some other revision technique.  The more you require rough drafts, the less of a chance your students will plagiarize.  Also, you can get a feeling for how well your students comprehend the assignment.

     My name is Cristina Murphy. I come from a large family of eight children and was born in the Dominican Republic. To me education is very important as it was to my mother and making sure that all eight of her children received an education. My mother did not want to send us to public school, and she did not have the finances to send us to private school so she chose to home school us. 

     When I was growing up we had a library at home with books about science, math, and religion. We also had several sets of encyclopedias. Reading in the library everyday was routine as a part of our home schooling. It was also a part of how we learned English, which at the time was not offered in public schools in the Dominican Republic. 

     When I was twelve years years old I was registered in a private school because our family moved to Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico it was required for children to attend school and home schooling was not recognized as a way of educating children. I was scared at first, but with the really strong educational foundation my mother provided I was able to excel and found that I did better then those students whose parents were not so involved in there children's education. I did very well through the rest of primary school and went on to go to college. I consider my mother to be an amazing person and a great educator. She achieved her goal of sending each one of her eight children to college.

     In conclusion, I believe in a more personalized education so that children may reach higher potential involving both parents and communities. My mothers strong belief in education is the basis for my educational philosophy and a great part of why I want to become a teacher now.[[User:Cbmurphy|Cbmurphy]] ([[User talk:Cbmurphy|talk]]) 21:23, 7 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Section 1.1 What is Constructivism? ===

Overview:

Constructivism is based on the work of Jean Piaget. As the name suggests, in constructivist theory, meaning is constructed based on experiences. Even though we hear and receive information, it does not necessarily mean that we have learned that information. New learning is assimilated into the learner’s mental schemas by connecting with knowledge that is already present. New information that does not fit into the schema is hard for the learner to understand. Meaning must be made by connecting the new learning to the old. New learning must be reflected upon and connected with old experience. Learners must reflect upon learning to make it connect to the old learning and to construct it’s meaning. Learning is done mainly by asking questions, exploring, and evaluating what is known. 

What is it all about?:

Constructivism is when students acquire their knowledge through inquiry, research, and their own investigation. As they construct their knowledge, they are enhancing their ability to think critically and analyze information. The goal of constructivism is not to simply memorize and regurgitate information. If a student is truly in a constructivist classroom, they will be more likely able to retain and apply that information. Student learning must be active both mentally and physically, and not passive. Students learn by discovering their own answers as opposed to listening to a lecture.


Principles of Constructivism:

There are several guiding principles of constructivism. First, learning is a quest for understanding and meaning. Learning starts with the problem or question that students are trying to understand or make meaning of. Second, learning is centered around main concepts and ideas instead of isolated facts. It is important for students to know and understand both the wholes of a concept, as well as the parts of a concept. Third, as teachers, we must understand the mental models of our students, which includes the way they perceive the world, and the assumptions that they make in their understanding of the world. By doing so, we will be able to better guide our students as they construct meaning. The last principle in constructivism is that students are constructing meaning as opposed to repeating facts and memorizing answers. The assessment must be tied to the learning process.

Constructivism in the Classroom:

In a constructivist classroom, teachers use active techniques to learning. Students learn primarily through experiments, real-world problem solving, reflection and discussion. Unlike traditional classroom instruction where the teacher gives the students the knowledge they need, in a constructivist classroom, the teacher guides the students in their learning. The teacher encourages the students to ask questions and to access their learning. By asking questions, the students work through their learning and not only learn new information, but they learn how to learn. Students are encouraged to evaluate their learning and reflect on their learning progress. Hands on learning is the basis of a constructivist classroom. Students learn by doing. “They become engaged by applying their existing knowledge and real-world experience, learning to hypothesize, testing their theories, and ultimately drawing conclusions from their findings” (Thirteen Ed.).By asking questions and evaluating their learning, students are able to work with their natural curiosity. Students work to understand their world and how it works. Assessment of learning is based on student evaluation of learning. 

Constructivist Teaching Practices:

There are twelve teaching practices of constructivist teachers. First constructivist teachers encourage and accept student initiative. They guide students as they ask questions, and students are responsible for their own learning. Another practice is that
teachers use data and primary sources, as well as manipulatives that will help students better comprehend abstract concepts. Third, constructivist teachers use cognitive vocabulary such as &quot;classify,&quot; &quot;analyze,&quot; &quot;predict,&quot; and &quot;create.&quot; By doing these activities, it requires higher level thinking that will benefit students. Fourth, 
students drive the instruction. Based on their needs, the teacher adapts and seizes the teachable moments that arise on a daily basis. In addition, constructivist teachers discover the prior knowledge of their students before sharing their own knowledge. A sixth practice is to encourage students to engage in conversation with both the teacher and with each another. Teachers also further knowledge by asking open-ended questions, and getting the students to ask questions of each other. Another practice is to encourage students to elaborate after responding. This allows the student more think time, as well as the ability to correct their errors, or better explain their thinking. Constructivist teachers engage students in experiences that might cause contradictions to their first or original thoughts or discussion. Another practice is for teachers to allow wait time after posing a question. This gives everyone time to think and process his or her thoughts before responding. In addition, constructivist teachers allow time for students to make connections and create metaphors, which will help guide their learning. The final practice is to nurture a child’s natural curiosity through discovery.
 
A Glimpse into a Constructivist Classroom:

In Mrs. Smith’s third grade classroom, students are learning about animals. Today they are learning how birds use their beaks to eat their food. To learn about this, Mrs. Smith has prepared a variety of stations for the students to learn. The students will be using everyday kitchen tools to simulate the bird beaks. The students will use the kitchen tools to try to pick up and “eat” food that the birds would actually eat. As they progress from station to station, the students will note which tools are useful for eating which type of food and compare these to the beaks of the birds they are studying. By using a simulation, the students are able to use their own though processes to study the bird beaks. They are able to experiment and use tools on real food. When the students are finished with the experiment, they will record their findings and thoughts in their science learning logs. By recording thoughts in learning logs, they are able to reflect upon their own learning and to think about what they have learned.

===Section 1.2 Origins / Historical Background ===

Origins and Backgrounds of Constructivism

'''Essentialism'''

The philosophy of '''essentialism''' believes in using primary concepts, thoughts, and skills.  These are believed to be crucial to a society and should be taught in a systematic way.  The belief is that this type of education should be taught to any and all students regardless of their educational differences and needs.
Essentialism prepares individuals to be productive and contributing citizens. The teacher is responsible for providing all knowledge and maintaining a task oriented environment while the student listens.  According to essentialism the purpose of education is to teach children the lessons they need to live in the world. Some of the theorists who used and share similar ideals in education are Johann Friedrich Herbart, Herbert Spencer, and Maria Montessori.

'''Johann Friedrich Herbart''' (1776-1841) was born in Oldenburg, Germany. He attended the University of Jena where he studied philosophy. He is known as a philosopher, psychologist, and an educator.  Some have even called him the “father of scientific pedagogy.”  Herbart believed the frame work of education should be based on two systems psychology and ethics. “To Herbart, ideas were central to the process. He felt they grouped themselves into what he called &quot;apperceptive masses.&quot; By assimilation (or apperception) new ideas could enter the mind through association with similar ideas already present” (BookRags Staff,2005).  “Herbartianism, in predicting that learning follows from building up sequences of ideas important to the individual, gave teachers a semblance of a theory of motivation.” (Clark, 1999). Herbart was among the first scientists to develop an educational process for learning like this.  His process was developed into a five step system. His students called the method the “Five Formal Steps of the Recitation” (BookRags Staff, 2005).  The steps were organized as preparation, presentation, association, generalization and application.  

'''Herbert Spencer''' (1820-1903) was born in Denby, England. He is known as a philosopher, scientist, engineer and political economist (Smith, 1997).  Spencer was known for his beliefs about life and the processes of evolution. Some even compare his theories with Darwin’s “Survival of the Fittest” view.  His prospective on humans were concentrated on a very scientific level.  “Spencer systematically tried to establish the basis of a scientific study of education, psychology, sociology, and ethics from an evolutionary point of view” (BookRags Staff, 2005).   Spencer stated &quot;If they are sufficiently complete to live, they do live, and it is well they should live. If they are not sufficiently complete to live, they die, and it is best they should die.&quot;  He believed people had natural will to flourish from their environment and learn from it.  If they could not well then they could not.  

'''Maria Montessori''' (1870-1952) was born in Ancona, Italy.  She was the first Italian woman to become a physician when she graduated from medical school in 1896. Her medical practice included studying the behaviors of children. She would analyze their learning by watching them use their surrounding environment to refine their own skills.  She became so interested in studying the behaviors of children that in 1906 she gave up her practice and chair position at the university to fully concentrate on studying learning patterns of children.  “She left to begin studying a group of sixty young children of working parents in the San Lorenzo district of Rome” (North American Montessori Teachers Association [NAMTA], 2009). This is where she developed her signature method of how children learn called the “Montessori Method.”  This method revolved around the premise that children teach themselves learning from the surrounds in their environment. The teacher was the facilitator for the learning environment. While children got on with their activities the task was to observe and to interfere from the side-line (NAMTA, 2009).  Montessori provided the children a stimulating environment to learn in emphasizing self-determination and self-realization.  She is known today by the many schools she represents all over the world.
By studying these three theorists we see a common pattern among them.  They all believe children/ people instinctively have the will to learn in their own natural surroundings.  They all have a unique philosophy but follow the general concept essentialism.

'''Humanism'''

'''Humanism''' is a philosophy that emphasizes the freedom, dignity, and potential of humans.  Humanists commit to helping every person realize and perfect their potentials and view reason and education as a means to that end.  Although humanism was influenced by the study of ancient Greek and Latin literature and philosophy, it was during the Renaissance when people first called themselves humanists. These Renaissance humanists viewed the ultimate ideal of education to include “those studies by which we attain and practice virtue and wisdom; that education which calls forth, trains and develops those highest gifts of body and mind which ennoble man” (Aloni, 1999).  
The romantic, naturalistic, or therapeutic form of humanistic education first appeared in Jean Jacques Rousseau’s 18th century writings.  This is based on the argument that every person has a primarily good and unique “inner nature” or a “fixed self” that develops – according to its built-in code - toward a healthy existence and full humanity. Humanists believe that true education consists of careful “drawing out” and attentive actualization of a person’s inner nature (Aloni, 1999).  The curriculum is student-centered, focusing on the concerns and interests of the students.  Class content is relevant and pertinent to their lives.  Students are encouraged to evaluate their own learning.    The teacher is a facilitator rather than an authority figure and provides support and understanding instead of being critical and judgmental.
The following individuals made significant contributions to humanistic education in the 18th and 19th centuries.

'''Jean Jacques Rousseau''' (1712 -1778) was a Swiss-French writer and philosopher. In his first major work, the Discourse on the Arts and Sciences (1750), Rousseau wrote on the negative theme that man is good by nature but has been corrupted by society and civilization.   In 1762 he published Emile which was more of his treatise on education than a true novel. “Émile was the most influential work on education after Plato's Republic” (Doyle &amp; Smith, 2007).  His educational ideas were based on his view that children are naturally good and emphasized learning from nature and learning by experience. He stressed the importance of children developing ideas for themselves, to make sense of the world in their own way and to draw their own conclusions from their own experiences (Doyle &amp; Smith, 2007).  He believed that emotions should be educated before reason.  The aim of education is individualistic and should appeal to each child’s interests.  He did advocate physical education and manual work in the curriculum.  The role of the educator was to control the environment and facilitate learning because Rousseau felt that when a child is ready to learn and is interested he will then have that self-motivation to learn. 
  
	'''Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi''' (1746-1827) was a Swiss educator and social reformer whose method resulted in the introduction of an elementary school system in Europe. As a young man, Pestalozzi was influenced by Rousseau and particularly impressed with Emile but later abandoned some of those theories.  In 1799 Pestalozzi was invited to teach at Burgdorf, where other progressive teachers joined him in developing a teacher-training institute.  In 1804 the institute moved to Münchenbuchsee, and in 1805 to Yverdon, where he spent the next 20 years testing and developing his philosophy of education.   Pestalozzi believed that the “whole child” not just the mind should be educated, religion shouldn’t be an educational guiding principle, and learning occurs by doing. (“Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi,” 1967). Pestalozzi became convinced that children must receive both instruction and discipline first from their parents and then by teachers.  He encouraged children to absorb knowledge through their own sensory experiences.  His technique of bringing physical specimens into the classroom for observation was innovative in the teaching of natural science.  He replaced the harsh discipline and mechanical rules of the times with discipline based on love and understanding. 
    
	'''Friedrich Froebel''' (1782-18520) was a German educator and psychologist best known for his creation of the kindergarten system.  His educational philosophy is based on his belief of the unity of all things in God. His kindergarten program encouraged free activity, creativeness, social participation and motor expression (Bourgoin, 1998). He encouraged educational environments where children were involved in practical work and directly using materials since he felt understanding unfolds by engaging with the world. Froebel stressed play as the chief form of self-expression and developed play materials—spheres and other geometric forms—as well as group play activities. 

The educational processes of constructivism and progressivism are not considered to be included with the humanistic school of thought. “'''Progressivism''' concentrates on self-esteem, creativity, happiness, and other intangibles rather than more empirical outcomes” (Bechtel, 2006).  Constructivism and progressivism seek individual development for democratic life.  They are actually considered to be seen as “'''Hegelian dialectics'''.”  The Hegelian dialects focus on the philosophy learning creates its different stages as a person goes each stage.

'''''The Beginning of  Constructivist Thought'''''

''An Overview''

Constructivism is not a new concept in education.  Early thoughts about a student-centered methodology in teaching can be traced back to the writings of Greek philosophers such as Plato and Socrates.  Later, theorists like Piaget contributed to the idea of child-driven investigation to enhance what learning they have already experienced.  Other theorists, such as Lev Vygotsky, added new dimensions to constructivism. Vygotsky's &quot;social constructivism&quot; credited different aspects of culture and socialization to a child's construction of knowledge. These theorists and a few others influenced modern day constructivists who have taken this work and turned it into practice in modern-day classrooms.

''Plato's education theory and Socrates''
Elements of constructivism have been found in the earliest of works of Greek philosophy, including Plato's ''The Sophist'' (Leigh, 2007). Plato's andragist view on education was obvious in that he theorized that learners contain a belief system that has the ability to be challenged by their own investigation and research as to what is true about their previous knowledge and what is false (Leigh, 2007). In a similar way, Socrates believed in the role of teacher as questioner (LovetoKnowCorp, 2002). The idea of the instructor as a questioner can be found today as instructors pose essential questions to students in preparation for further investigation rather than to recite definitive answers (Adams &amp; Burns, 1999). 


'''Constructivism in the Late 18th and Early 19th Century'''

''Giambattista Vico (1668-1744) and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)''
Vico contended that a human being constructs his own understanding and was the first theorist to put this idea into words with his well-known postulation ''verum esse ipsum factum'' (&quot;true itself is fact&quot; or &quot;the true itself is made&quot; (SEDL, 1994).  His perception of &quot;truth&quot; stems from the process of a person growing and maturing, thereby learning of what is honest and accurate in his own reality (Parkinson, 2004). As a contemporary of Vico, Kant's thinking was similar in that he believed knowledge to be based on a person's own point of view (Heylighen, 1993).  Brooks &amp; Brooks (as cited by Regina Public Schools &amp; Saskatchewan Learning, 2004) stated that Kant supported the notion that humans have the ability to gather information through perception, organize it within their cognitive structures, reflect on, and analyze what happens to them, and then apply meaning to those situations.

''Alexander Kapp (1833)''
A German instructor, Kapp developed the term &quot;andragogy&quot; to define the idea of adult learning (Smith, 1999).  This definition was created in contrast to the term pedagogy, which describes the specific way children learn (Smith, 1999). Decades later, his work was further developed by Malcolm Knowles who believed that a significant difference in cognitive development causes adults and children to learn differently. For example, adults are more process-driven than content-driven, and they learn on their own better than children, who usually need assistance (Smith, 1999). Today, constructivist theories and androgist beliefs greatly influence teacher education programs. These programs will eventually transform practices in the classroom (Harris, Lowery-Moore, &amp; Farrow, 2008). 


'''Constructivism in the Late 19th and Early 20th Century'''
  
''John Dewey (1859-1952) and Jean Piaget (1896-1980)''
John Dewey is often mentioned with Jean Piaget and is credited for giving constructivism momentum as an active movement in education (SEDL, 1994). Dewey advocated the idea that learning should pertain to actual life (Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 2004).  He also saw the need for the learner to reflect on any personal experience that brought about learning. Vanderstraeten and Biesta (as cited by Regina Public Schools &amp; Saskatchewan Learning, 2004) explain that Dewey wanted learning to occur naturally and over time, becoming the student's own habit.  Examples of Dewey's beliefs in action in a twenty-first century classroom include taking a field trip to a local organization or taking part in social service work that benefits the greater community (Fogarty, 1999).
Piaget contended that students came to every learning situation with prior knowledge (Kretchmar, 2008).  Phillips &amp; Soltis (as cited by Regina Public Schools &amp; Saskatchewan Learning, 2004) note that Piaget believed that humans should be at one with the world around them.  When children feels unbalanced in their world, they seek to once again feel adjusted. Uneasy children will have found that balance through investigation and by engaging with the world around them (Regina Public Schools and Saskatchewan, 2004). He thought such an experience, also known as &quot;learning by doing,&quot; contributed to knowing (Lunenburg, 1998).  A classroom today that allows students to perform experiments to learn science concepts is using Piaget's idea of constructivism (Fogarty, 1999).  Piaget's beliefs, combined with the use of the Internet, have the potential to influence teaching practices. The Internet has had great success in enlarging a student's social boundaries and giving educators a larger bank of resources from which to pull information and experiences (Lunenburg, 1998).

''Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934)''
Although a contemporary of Piaget and Dewey, Vygotsky's constructivist contributions fall under a slightly different category, labeled specifically, &quot;social constructivism.&quot;  Fogarty (1999) interprets this type of constructivism by explaining that knowledge becomes deeper when you first learn from others, then yourself (Fogarty, 1999).  Vygotsky also had developed the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (Kretchmar, 2008). Vygotsky had believed that a child needed adult assistance to build knowledge. As knowledge is constructed, the additional support can be decreased and the child could think on their own (Kretchmar, 2008).  Therefore, any instructor in the twenty-first century who had conducted a whole group discussion, then allowed students to work independently on the concept(s) presented has applied Vygotsky's practice (Fogarty, 77).   

	
'''20th Century Constructivist Thought'''

''Jerome Bruner (1915-present) and Ernst von Glasersfeld (1917-Present)''
Following the thought of Piaget, Bruner postulated that students come into the educational system with their own beliefs and ideas (Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 2004).  At the same time, he acknowledged that children need assistance with their learning to build on what they already know (Boulware &amp; Crow, 2008; Caldwell, 2008). Bruner reasoned that children should understand the skills and knowledge that go into understanding a concept rather than focusing on categorizing a concept by name. In other words, the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; are more important than the &quot;who&quot; or &quot;what&quot; (Boulware &amp; Crow, 2008).  American and British education systems owe a debt to Bruner and his ideas (Caldwell, 2008).
Both von Glasersfeld and Bruner took the stance that children need to be involved with their learning (Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 2004). However, von Glasersfeld believed that the new knowledge acquired by a person does not have a definite correct or incorrect answer that is absolute. Instead, he contended that since experience is combined with perception, then someone can only use his or her ideas to ask questions that will formulate new thinking.    
	
''Seymour Papert (1928-present) and Donald Schon (1930-1997)''
Seymour Papert, a professor at MIT, centered his constructivist theory around the idea of &quot;learning by doing&quot; (or &quot;playing&quot;) and incorporating technology to improve student learning and enhance creativity (Papert, 2005b). Best known for his Logo software, which is used in math programs in schools throughout the United States, Papert contended that technology should be used far more extensively in education to prey on students' inherent motivation to play (&quot;Seymour Papert&quot;, n.d.; Papert, 2005a). By adding more technology to classroom practices, Papert believed interest in science, for example, would increase substantially among learners.  Schon studied internal processing and wrote about the capability of people to think about themselves and believed that if people thought about (reflected on) the things they have done, then they could modify their behavior and, therefore, their lives (Kinsella, 2007). 

 
'''Conclusion'''
Constructivism has been studied by a variety of individuals, and has evolved as a theory from Classical times to present day.  Although the theorists vary slightly in their approach to constructivism, they all seem to agree that children must be actively engaged in making meaning out of the world around them. They support the idea that the instructor's main role should be as a facilitator, instead of the traditional notion of the &quot;sage on the stage&quot; who has all of the information to disseminate to the students. Instead, the students are the investigators who manipulate, play, and manage the variables to make sense of problems or situations.

===Section 1.4 Today's Controversies in Constructivism ===

What is Constructivism?

Constructivism is a theory of learning that emphasizes students constructing their own knowledge. Constructivism is a process where the students are actively seeking their own knowledge and not sitting back and passively absorbing knowledge. Students, through the learning process of constructivism, develop their own theories of knowledge through building mental models and building off of past knowledge. The main components of constructivism involves being active in the learning process and continuously building off of previous knowledge.

While the constructivist approach is accepted and practiced by many, others feel that the approach has a number of problems and downfalls for both the students and teachers. The next sections will discuss these controversies.

Noisy and Uncontrollable Classroom Controversy

Many people feel that a constructivism based classroom is subject to much noise and confusion, lending itself to an uncontrollable environment. They feel that for students to actively research or create models or representations of knowledge that the teacher would lose control of the classroom. While alternative classrooms might be different than the traditional classroom, it does not mean that control will be lost. For example, students can construct, using appropriate software tools, simulations of models of the phenomena they are learning about, conduct experiments with the models they have constructed, and analyze the results so obtained. According to their own analysis, driven by the feedback they received from running their models on the computer, the students can gradually improve their models, eventually arriving at a precise representation of the phenomenon under study (Technion, 2000).

Constructivism Dismisses the Role of the Teacher

One of the most debated and critical controversies surrounding constructivism is that constructivism eliminates the need for a teacher in the classroom. Constructivism deals with students branching out and building off of both previous knowledge and creating their own learning environment. Constructivism simply changes the role of the teacher making the teacher more of a guidance and expert resource in a particular field rather than a teller of knowledge. The teacher has to create both problem solving activities as well as inquiry based activities to guide the students through the knowledge process. The student is responsible for forming ideas and making inferences on the material that the teacher has supplied. The constructivist approach to education is to have the students create their own knowledge off of experience rather than to have the teacher tell the students that knowledge (Educational Broadcasting Corporation, 2004).

Constructivism as a Theory

Constructivism has its fair share of doubters when it comes to theory. Some say that it is not a true theory and does not account for all learning. While constructivism teaches active learning, not all learning takes place in this manner. For example, when one reads and links that with reasoning then the process involved is simply word recognition and not constructivism (Stanovich, 1994). While other theories of learning state that memorization can not be associated with the constructivist theory of learning, constructivist advocates state that the memorization is actually a constructively based activity. Memorization consists of deciding to commit that information to memory, why that information has been committed to memory, how that learner will use that information, and how that information committed to memory can be used for future construction of knowledge (Dimock &amp; Boethel, 1999).

Constructivism Does Not Support Novice Learners

While much evidence does support constructivism and its effect on students, there is still controversy surrounding the benefit of constructivism on novice learners. Novice learners do not have the background or base knowledge in order to create new ideas and build knowledge. They are not capable of learning new ideas by building off of previous knowledge (Sweller, 1988). Kirschener described constructivist based learning as &quot;unguided methods of instruction.&quot; Some have even suggested that novice learners need more structured learning environments in order to build a base of knowledge (Kirschener, Sweller, and Clark, 2006). Others state that constructivism pushes behavioral activity too early and that novice learners should focus more on cognitive learning (Mayer, 2004). Constructivism is an approach that deals with guided instruction and structure in the classroom. Certain critics of constructivism lump it together with other theories and fail to take into account the structure of constructivism.

Constructivism Does Not Support Students with Learning Disorders

Students with learning disorders pose many problems with learning through the constructivist approach in that they typically have issues with grasping higher level thinking and problem solving (Steele, 2005). Constructivism based thinkers believe that all students are benefited by a constructivist approach to education and that with the appropriate guidance and leadership that even learning disabled students are capable of becoming successful (Grobecker, 1999). Learning disabled students benefit from constructivism in that they are able to start with new ideas and concepts which improve self esteem by allowing those students success (Steele, 2005). Teachers allow students to show what they already know while building on new knowledge formation.

Conclusion

Research has shown constructivism to be very successful in many environments, yet a failure in others. While much controversy surrounds the constructivist approach to education, there are still many institutions and individuals that stand by the approach. While many of the controversies brought up in this chapter have been supported by researchers, most of them are able to be refuted by others in their specific environments. The ultimate answer lies within the teaching environment. Any theory or approach to education will have doubters, but it lies in the teachers hands as to if the approach will have success or not. The failure of any theory or approach stems from lack of readiness on the teacher and the institution. Another consideration is the learning style of individual students. While some students might not be as successful being taught from a constructivist approach, many others might have success. Teachers need to be able to teach with a variety of methods and tailor education to meet individual needs in order to become successful. If we cannot teach to our student needs then we are not succeeding in our job.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chapter 2. How People Learn: The Constructivists’ View'''
===Overview ===

Constructivist Learning Theory has provided us with evidence that students learn the best through hands on &quot;real life&quot; experience grounded in a social context (McMahon, 1997).  Piaget (1973) studied the idea that in opposite relation to passive learning, constructivst must constantly create these learning experiences creatively using the most innovative techniques in a give time period.  Several different learning styles such as Visual-Auditory-Kinesthic and Multiple Intelligences have given us vehicles to outline creative ways in which students learn and provide us with opportunities to guide classroom instruction to meet all learners (Hyslop-Margison, 2004). One of the ways we can do this is through technology, although we still have not used this valuable resource to its full poetential (Ginsberg &amp; McCormick, 1998).

===Learning Theory ===
In education, learning is commonly defined as a process that combines “cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences and experiences for acquiring, enhancing, or making changes in one's knowledge, skills, values, and world views&quot; (&quot;Learning Theory&quot;, 2009).  While learning focuses on the event of learning itself, a learning theory is the attempt to establish how learning occurs.   Learning theories typically consist of two main components, learner vocabulary and theoretical frameworks for decoding learning (&quot;Learning Theory&quot;, 2009).  In regards to learning theories, and the frameworks included, our focus is on the Constructivist Learning Theory.  The Constructivist Learning Theory is a learning theory that is identified as a process of learning in which knowledge is acquired by experiences.


===The Role of Thinking &amp; Sharing ===
In the Constructivist Learning Theory, or framework, thinking and sharing hold a significant role.  According to Professor George E. Hein, thinking is listed first in importance in his hierarchy of Constructivism and labeled, &quot;focus on the learner in thinking about learning&quot; (Hein, G.E. 1996).  He was referencing thinking as the basis of the process of learning - as something that must be tapped before learning can actually occur - the learner must be engaged in the very though of learning.  Sharing, as defined by Mark McMahon (1997) says that it is, &quot;meaningful learning occurs when individuals are engaged in social activities&quot;.  McMahon (1997)  concurs that learning is a &quot;social process.&quot; He moves on to say that, &quot;learning is not a process that only takes place inside our minds, nor is it a passive development of our behaviours that is shaped by external forces and that meaningful learning occurs when individuals are engaged in social activities,&quot; (McMahon, 1997). Although thinking and sharing are a large part of Constructivism, there are other factors that also contribute to Constructivism. 
 
Most theorists agree that Constructivism is made up of phases.  There are a variety of models that are applicable.  According to Gagnon and Collay, the elements they have comprised into their model entitled the Constructive Learning Design are &quot;Situation, Groupings, Bridge, Questions, Exhibit, and Reflections&quot; (Gagnon &amp; Collay, n.d.).  The first part of the Constructive Learning Design is &quot;Situations.&quot;  &quot;Situation&quot; refers to what the teacher initially prepares for the student, and the meaning that the student will be expected to construct from the initial setup.  The element of &quot;Groupings&quot; has two categories: how students will be grouped and how materials will be distributed and best utilized.  Third part is &quot;Bridge.&quot;  This step determines the prior knowledge of the learner and what additional information they need to make connections from the known to the unknown.  The &quot;Questions&quot; step is designed to use throughout all of the elements of the Constructive Learning Design.  The questions are intended to guide instruction, prompt learning, to enhance reflection, and to continue learning.  The fifth stage is &quot;Exhibit,&quot; which indicates the need for the students to produce a physical representation of their learning.  The last part of the Constructive Learning Design is &quot;Reflections.&quot;  Learners are expected to reflect on their learning with their teacher and peers.  While all of these elements vary in their contribution to the Constructive Learning Model, all of them funnel back to the two fundamental points previously mentioned - thinking and sharing, which is why thinking and sharing are so significant to Constructivism (Gagnon &amp; Collay, n.d.).


===Creativity, Inventiveness, Innovation ===

Creativity, inventiveness, and innovation all play a role in Constructivism.  In a constructivist world, ideally, according to Jean Piaget, “To understand is to discover, or reconstruct by rediscovery, and such conditions must be complied with if in the future individuals are to be formed who are capable of production and creativity and not simply repetition,&quot; (Piaget, 1973).  Creativity is a facet in Constructivism, in that constructivists frequently view conventional pedagogy as passive teaching, because learners are furnished with previously created materials, such as textbooks, which limits the amount of creativity learners are able to contribute themselves (Levine, 2005).
 
Constructivists desire learners to be creative, original in their composition, with the encouragement of self-derived rules and norms for their creativity, thus leading to inventiveness.  Constructivists also desire learners to demonstrate their creativity through outlets such as clubs and service projects.  Constructivists favor using inventive ways of self-exploration in learning.  Students are involved in drawing their own conclusions by means of creative experimentation.  The constructionist teacher becomes a facilitator of learning in the classroom and instead of teaching &quot;at&quot; students, they assist learners with understanding with a hands-on approach (&quot;Constructionism&quot;, 2008).  
 
Technology is an innovative tool that allows instructors to operate with greater productively as well as extending additional interesting and effective lessons and classroom activities. Technology enables students to interact with and explore the world, bringing a wealth of information and experiences to learners that would normally be impossible without leaving the classroom.  Technology is also an innovative way to strengthen learner creativity and to encourage self-direction.  It also aids students in developing know-how that will prepare them as responsible citizens on a nation and global respect (Hyslop-Margison, 2004).


===Learning Styles ===

Two of the many learning styles identified are Visual-Auditory-Kinesthtic and Multiple Intelligences.  There are two different versions of the Visual-Auditory-Kinesthic Model.  The Visual-Auditory-Kinesthic (Modality Preference) Model, according to Willis 1999 (as cited in Miller, 2001), is based on the way students learn using either sight, sound, or body movement.  Learners have a preference of the three senses that better assists them in processing information (Miller, p. 2).  Two different studies in Miller's (2001) article found that a higher percentage of learners favor kinesthic learning.  The Modality Strengths Model determines which of the three senses are stronger within a learner (Miller, p. 3).  Studies conducted in the late 1970's that have tested the Modality Strengths Model show that students have greater strengths in either visual, auditory, or a mixture of both (Miller, p. 4).  Wilson (1998) noted that knowing the strengths of a learner are more beneficial that know their preference (Miller, p. 3).  All debates aside, testing is available to find which sensory facet is either stronger or a preference.  Although the models may differ on what strength is most beneficial for students, studying Visual-Auditory-Kinesthic Models helped researchers understand that students need to be active participants in learning within a stimulating environment that fits their individual needs (Miller, 2001).   
 
Howard Gardner developed Multiple Intelligence Theory in 1983 to meet the needs of all learners (Abdallah, 2008).  Early on, I.Q. tests were the big determinites to figure out intelligence (Abdallah, p. 25).  Both Gardner (1999) and Hoerr (2000), noticed that these tests only assessed students academic ability (Abdallah, p. 25).  Gardner wanted to extend the idea of &quot;being smart&quot; past book learning and recognized that different people had &quot;intelligence&quot; in different areas (Abdallah, 2008).  Gardener recognized that learners, as individuals, were just as influenced as much by the outside world and their own particular situations as they were textbook learning (Abdallah, 2008).  While traditionally, academia has tested for logical and verbal linguistic, Gardener expanded the range of intelligence to include:  verbal-lingusistic, logical/matmatical, intrapersonal/introspective, interpersonal intelligence, bodily/kinesthetic, visual/spatial, music/rhymic intelligence (Abdallah, 2008).  The benefit of Gardener's work in education today has been for educators to help a greater number of students succeed while providing a more engaging atmosphere (Abdallah, 2008).
 
While it is a teacher's choice to employ a variety of teaching styles to meet the learning styles of the students, not all teachers follow the same path.  The results of Ginsberg and McCormick's (1998) study suggested that most schools do not use computers in particularly innovative ways that would apply to different learning styles. The effective schools in the study tended to have slightly better and more frequent use, but  it was not a significant difference.  Ginsberg and McCormick found that the potential of the computer for differentiated learning was, for the most part, not being realized. They were surprised by the lack of concern over instructional issues because it signified to them that teachers are not trained enough to be aware of the issues (Hunter, 2003). In another study by Nigel Ford and Sherry Chin found that teachers that individually matched learning styles to students saw a significant increase in performance (Ford &amp; Chen, 2003).  In a third study, differentiation was the focus.  This particular study by Danzi ''et al.'' published in April 2008 explained the challenges that face teachers today.  He explained how many teachers have a wide range of abilities in their classroom and are expected to meet all needs in the face of standardized testing and, in some cases, with very little support from school districts (Danzi ''et al.'' p. 30-31).  Students who are not having their needs meet in the classroom become unmotivated and disinterested in learning which cause problems in the classroom environment and for the instructor (Danzi ''et al.'', 2008).  Differentiation seems to assist in combating some of these problems and create an atmosphere where learners of all types have their needs meet (Danzi, p. iii).


===Conclusion ===

Constructivist Learning Theory has brought the issue of active, individual learning to the forefront of educational research.  According to Constructivist, treating all students the same has inhibited true learning.  Treating students as individuals and allowing them to create situations that are meaningful to their particular style of learning will increase student motivation and allow each learner to gain information and experience that is meaningful to them (Danzi ''et al.'' (2008); McMahon 1997).  Innovative resources like technology can be used by educators to not only challenge students, but themselves (Hyslop-Margison, 2004).  Using Constructivist Learning theory will help educators to become more creative in their teaching and allow students to take a more social and active approach toward learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For many years, people have waged an uphill struggle against the forces of gravity and friction. Fortunately, we now have machines of all kinds to help us along the way. In this wikibook, you will explore different types of machines, find out how they work and discover that the use of simple machines to perform great feats is nothing new.


='''Get Moving'''=
=='''Force'''==

Like any other object, a bicycle starts to move only when something pushes or pulls on it. A push or a pull on something is called a ''force''. When you ride a bike, you apply force with your legs to keep the bike moving forward. On level ground, most of your effort goes into pushing the bike forward, but when you come to a hill, you also have to work against gravity. So, when you ride up the hill you have to push your bike up against the force of gravity.

Work is done when a force moves an object through a distance. The distance must be in the direction of the force.

=='''Friction'''==

Friction is a force that resits the motion of one surfacer past another surface. This force creates a resistance on moving objects and causes them to stop. Wheels or rollers help cut friction between moving, touching surfaces. But you can also use a thick liquid like oil or grease to reduce friction. They are lubricants – substances that reduce friction. Grease forms a smooth layer and makes it easy for an object to slip. Ball bearings are small balls that help cut down on friction inside machines by keeping metal surfaces from rubbing against each other. A bicycle has ball bearings where the wheels are joined to the frame.

However, thanks to friction, the tires do not slip and the bike moves.

='''Simple Machines'''=

=='''Inclined Planes'''==
Inclined Planes are a type of simple machine. An example of a inclined plane is a ramp. A inclined plane multiplies your input force by allowing you to exert it over a longer distance. It looks like a flat, slanted surface.

='''The Pyramids'''=
='''Everyday Machines'''=
=='''Scissors'''==

=='''The Bicycle'''==

=='''Gears'''==
'''Gears''' may be defined as any toothed member designed to transmit motion or power from one shaft to another preferably if the distance between the two shafts is small. It is a positive and smooth drive. 

Gears are generally used for one of four different reasons:

1. To reverse the direction of rotation.&lt;br&gt;
2. To increase or decrease the speed of rotation.&lt;br&gt;
3. To move rotational motion to a different axis.&lt;br&gt;
4. To keep the rotation of two axes synchronized.&lt;br&gt;

=='''Modern Machines'''==

=='''Bike Design'''==

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are typing a whole document in a language other than English, it's cumbersome to type each individual accent as, e.g.,  \~{} -- i.e., you'd rather type the accents directly in the source code in the native language. I can accomplish that including the following three lines in the tex file header:

&lt;code&gt;
\usepackage{ae} % or {zefonts}

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
&lt;/code&gt;

:This article explains a lot about character encoding. I strongly discourage the use of latin1; utf8 should be the preferred encoding for technical and compatibility reasons. See the article for more explaination. Font encoding is explained in [[LaTeX/Fonts|Fonts]]. --20:30, 4 January 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are the options for using mobile technology on trains, planes, and automobiles?}}

With the development of information technology, more and more relative technologies and devices applied on almost every field, especially on the trains, planes, and automobiles although it is more difficult since transportation have not the fixed position to be addressed at specific period of time.

During the last few years of the last century, technologies were deployed which made it increasingly feasible for large numbers of devices to be connected without being connected physically.The set of technologies focused on are ‘wireless’, which are now an essential part of our everyday lives. The basic application to transportation is digital mapping and GPS technology to locate a destination and get an available parking spots. This device also could provide incorporates location-based mapping and messaging technology to create a hi-tech game of hide and seek. 

For the train travel, more people to take the train would be attracted by being provided payable wireless networking service. A journey’s duration becomes productive work time for people for who the taking train is part of a daily commute or a longer trip. They also can write or receive Email, messages and surf the internet to play their time as usual. For example, T-Mobile’s service, installed on Southern Trains’ brighto Express by wire less specialist Nomad Digital uses WiMaX and T-Mobile have already had the postive feedback for users.

For the plane, we knew that there was a ban to use mobile devices on a plane. But for better or for worse, It has issued plans that will allow airlines to offer mobile services on UK-registered aircraft. The decision means that mobiles could be used once a plane has reached an altitude of 3,000m or more. The Australian Communications and Media Authority would permit cell phone use on domestic and international flights. An 18-month long trial of the pico cell technology used for in-flight cellular communications was deemed successful with no reported complaints of interference to either the plane’s avionics system or ground cellular networks. Should mobiles be banned from aircraft or are you looking forward to joining the mile-high call club? Which begs the question: who actually wants this? A survey taken in 2005 by Skytrax asked nearly 700,000 people for their thoughts on the potential use of mobile phones on planes. An overwhelming 89% said they did not want such a service become possible. Not ever. Now those seem pretty damning statistics. In my opinon, i don’t agree with using mobile phone on the plane since it is terrible to plane’s flying and to other passengers. Although the information technology will develop highly, we still should reduce the harm from the mobile devices to others or ourselves.

Increased reliance on cellphones has led to a rise in the number of people who use the devices while driving. There are two dangers associated with driving and cellphone use, including text messaging. First, drivers must take their eyes off the road while dialing. Second, people can become so absorbed in their conversations that their ability to concentrate on the act of driving is severely impaired, jeopardizing the safety of vehicle occupants and pedestrians. Therefore, properly using a cellphone is a big issue for modern society. 

Advances in communications systems to make travel faster, smarter and safer in the future. Intelligent transport systems--allows cars to avoid collisions; e-Call automatic emergency call; Congestion alerts and e-transport could alert drivers to traffic jams to help reduce road congestion; e-Transport systems could simplify travel and decrease journey times when travelling by bus, train or plane through one e-ticket which could be used on all modes of transport.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Numeric provides common behavior of numbers. Numeric is an abstract class, so it should not be instantiated.
&lt;br&gt;
Included Modules:
&lt;pre&gt;
Comparable
&lt;/pre&gt;
Instance Methods:
&lt;br&gt;
+ n
&lt;pre&gt;
    Returns n.
&lt;/pre&gt;
- n
&lt;pre&gt;
    Returns n negated.
&lt;/pre&gt;
n + num&lt;br&gt;
n - num&lt;br&gt;
n * num&lt;br&gt;
n / num&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    Performs arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
&lt;/pre&gt;
n % num
&lt;pre&gt;
    Returns the modulus of n.
&lt;/pre&gt;
n ** num
&lt;pre&gt;
    Exponentiation.
&lt;/pre&gt;
n.abs
&lt;pre&gt;
    Returns the absolute value of n.
&lt;/pre&gt;
n.ceil
&lt;pre&gt;
    Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to n.
&lt;/pre&gt;
n.coerce( num)
&lt;table&gt;
    Returns an array containing num and n both possibly converted to a type that allows them to be operated on mutually. Used in automatic type conversion in numeric operators.
&lt;/table&gt;

n.divmod( num)
&lt;pre&gt;
    Returns an array containing the quotient and modulus from dividing n by num.
&lt;/pre&gt;
n.floor
&lt;table&gt;
Returns the largest integer less than or equal to n.
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    1.2.floor            #=&gt; 1
    2.1.floor            #=&gt; 2

    (-2.1).floor         #=&gt; -3
&lt;/pre&gt;

n.integer?
&lt;pre&gt;
    Returns true if n is an integer.
&lt;/pre&gt;
n.modulo( num)
&lt;pre&gt;
    Returns the modulus obtained by dividing n by num and rounding the quotient with floor. Equivalent to n.divmod(num)[1].
&lt;/pre&gt;
n.nonzero?
&lt;pre&gt;
    Returns n if it isn't zero, otherwise nil.
&lt;/pre&gt;
n.remainder( num)
&lt;table&gt;
Returns the remainder obtained by dividing n by num and removing decimals from the quotient. The result and n always have same sign.
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    (13.modulo(4))         #=&gt;  1
    (13.modulo(-4))        #=&gt; -3
    ((-13).modulo(4))      #=&gt;  3
    ((-13).modulo(-4))     #=&gt; -1
    (13.remainder(4))      #=&gt;  1
    (13.remainder(-4))     #=&gt;  1
    ((-13).remainder(4))   #=&gt; -1

n.truncate

    Returns n as an integer with decimals removed.
&lt;pre&gt;
    1.2.truncate           #=&gt; 1

{{closed | Closed as '''Keep'''.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:43, 8 December 2008 (UTC)}}
Per discussion on [[Talk:The GIMP: Noob to Pro]], this book does not have a significantly different scope or target audience. Work should be done to improve [[The GIMP]] rather than starting a new book. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:28, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I still think that this book should be kept. It does have a different scope. It's just really hard to see the scope of a book before it is written.[[User:Nick.anderegg|Nick.anderegg]] ([[User talk:Nick.anderegg|talk]]) 16:20, 29 November 2008 (UTC) &lt;small&gt;moved from [[Talk:The GIMP: Noob to Pro]]. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:28, 29 November 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' but rename - I still think that the use of colons on the bookname is problematic. As for the need of yet another book on the subject, I still haven't been convinced by the argumentation that we should force people to restrict themselves to improve already existing content, this is a bit different than a fork (we still don't have a fork policy), but is common understanding that we (wikibooks) should strive to keep forks/duplications of subjects low (using the scope subterfuge), this point has clear consensus, but if the new contributor wishes to start from a clean slate (because for whatever reason he feels incapable of building on the previous existing work) would it be beneficial for us to prevent the creating the new work ? I don't think so, we should press the point that it should be the last resort but ultimately we should encourage people contributing content whenever we can. This is no big problem since the community will reserve the right to take steps later on, to reduce forks/subject duplications, in the form of proposals for merge or even deletion. Merges at a later date are almost guaranteed even in the strictest of consensus, there will always be a later date were a unworthy projects will cease to have any support on the community. This approach enables peaceful resolution to conflicts, generates more free content (not only for the project) and fosters competition to generate quality work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:28, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

::[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] On the topic of renaming it, I don't feel that this will be problematic. I actually got the idea for the title from [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]], because I like the way it was set up. Blender 3D, is even a featured book, and it utilizes the colon, so I don't that that is will cause any problems.  --[[User:Nick.anderegg|Nick.anderegg]] ([[User talk:Nick.anderegg|talk]]) 19:44, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
:::You maybe right, but historically the use of colon (named as the colon convention) regarding page names indicates a specific namespace (and as I said earlier on it is still recognised as such by the Wikimedia software), like all existing programming books were under Programming: this is made even more clear if you look in the Cookbook: namespace, this convention was deprecated (personally I didn't participate on the discussion) but for what I read on the naming policy and the discussions that took place this convention should be avoided (and if you think a bit about it it seems reasonable that we should use a single standard, or it becomes very confusing), as for the Blender 3D: I don't know why it still uses the old convention (probably it is an old book) but for consistency sake it should also be renamed...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:53, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
::::As per your request, I have changed the title to [[The GIMP -- Noob to Pro]] for now until I can come up with a better way to separate the subtitle. --[[User:Nick.anderegg|Nick.anderegg]] ([[User talk:Nick.anderegg|talk]]) 20:07, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

:::::Huh... I don't know. Old habit I guess. I will leave it with two until I can come up with a final name. Check out [[Talk:The GIMP -- Noob to Pro]], and help me pick the new title. --[[User:Nick.anderegg|Nick.anderegg]] ([[User talk:Nick.anderegg|talk]]) 20:35, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
:::::Txs, that was the last request I had standing, thanks for addressing all and again I'm sorry if I pressured you into action in any way, it's my normal procedure: page created by anonymous user, no content, tag as speedy deletion
:::::Due to the new way pages are being validated (we don't have any hint that a page was already patrolled), I tend to pick newer and easy to resolve pages. I will attempt to deal with the other colon book :) as soon as this discussion closes.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:08, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
::::::It was created by an anonymous user because I forgot to log in. :-)  I really don't think there is a problem with the colon. I opened it up to discussion in the book talk page because the name follows the naming policy. It wasn't allowed under an old policy maybe, but it is allowed now and it is the standard way to subtitle a book in print. --[[User:Nick.anderegg|Nick.anderegg]] ([[User talk:Nick.anderegg|talk]]) 21:15, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
:::::::Humm no you have misunderstood me, the colon was the original way of naming books on Wikibooks, sometime ago due to the need of sub-pages in books and a way to access those the &quot;/&quot; slash convention substituted it. I remember at a the time being asked to rename the books I was working on to remove colon, being the rational more or less the one I gave you above, this is the standing policy even if it doesn't clearly state the exclusion of the colon as it is today I will examine to see if something has been lost over the edits the approved text has gone in the meanwhile.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:24, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I'm surprised why there should be a need for a second book, and I suspect this will just duplicate work.

:[[WB:FORK]] may not be policy, but it's generally accepted that forking is bad unless there is good reason - usually a significantly different scope or audience. This book has nothing close to a significantly different scope or audience. Merging the books is wasted effort, and I rather unhappy that Nick is putting the community in the position of having to expend that effort. Nonetheless, the book should be deleted. Instead, chapters should be merged into [[The GIMP]] (or vice versa) ASAP. Incidentally, the colon was much better than the current title and Panic would do well to stop misrepresenting [[WB:NP|the naming policy]]. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:42, 5 December 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Xia Dynasty of China is the first dynasty to be described in ancient historical records such as ''Records of the Grand Historian'' and ''Bamboo Annals''. The Xia Dynasty was established by Yu the Great. According to the traditional chronology based upon calculations by Liu Xin, the Xia ruled between 2205 BCE and 1766 BCE, however according to the chronology based upon the ''Bamboo Annals'', it is between 1989 BCE and 1558 BCE. The Xia Shang Zhou Chronology Project concluded with 2070 BCE and 1600 BCE. Although there are some scholars who have doubts over whether the dynasty really existed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. |  coauthors = Linda Black, Larry S. Krieger, Phillip C. Naylor, Dahia Ibo Shabaka, | title = World History: Patterns of Interaction | publisher = McDougal Littell | date = 1999 | location = Evanston, IL | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-395-87274-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; archaeological evidence points toward its existence. 
According to historical records, it was preceded by the period of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors and followed by the Shang Dynasty.

According to the official history, the Xia Dynasty was founded when Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun abdicated the throne in favor of his minister Yu, whom Shun viewed as the perfect civil servant. Yu was greatly praised by his people for eliminating flooding by organizing the building of canals in all the major rivers. Soon before his death, instead of passing power to the person deemed most capable of rulership, Yu passed power to his son, Qi, setting the precedence for dynastic rule or the Hereditary System. The Xia Dynasty thus began a period of family or clan control. 

The Skeptical School of early Chinese history, started by Gu Jiegang in the 1920s, was the first group of scholars within China to seriously question the traditional story of its early history: “the later the time, the longer the legendary period of earlier history... early Chinese history is a tale told and retold for generations, during which new elements were added to the front end”&lt;ref&gt;Building the Chronology of Early Chinese History. Journal article by Yun Kuen Lee; Asian Perspectives: the Journal of Archaeology for Asia and the Pacific, Vol. 41, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Yun Kuen Lee's criticism of nationalist sentiment in developing an explanation of Three Dynasties chronology focuses on the dichotomy of evidence provided by archaeological versus historical research, in particular the claim that the archaeological Erlitou culture is also the historical Xia Dynasty. “How to fuse the archaeological dates with historical dates is a challenge to all chronological studies of early civilization.”&lt;ref&gt;Building the Chronology of Early Chinese History. Journal article by Yun Kuen Lee; Asian Perspectives: the Journal of Archaeology for Asia and the Pacific, Vol. 41, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Jie, the last ruler, was said to be a corrupt king. He was overthrown by Tang, the first king of the Shang dynasty.

After the defeat of Xia by Shang, some members of the royal family of Xia Dynasty survived as the Qi (Henan) state until 445 BCE. The Qi state was well recorded in the Oracle script as the one major supporter of the Xia Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=JUeFAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%E6%9D%9E%E5%9B%BD&amp;dq=%E6%9D%9E%E5%9B%BD&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 Guo li Taiwan shi fan da xue guo wen yan jiu suo ji kan
 By Guo li Taiwan shi fan da xue Guo wen yan jiu&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kings of the state of Yue, and therefore its successor state Minyue also claimed to be descended from Yu the Great.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/History1766bye3553.html The State of Yue]&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs that point to the possible existence of the Xia dynasty at locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts. There exists a debate as to whether or not Erlitou culture was the site of the Xia dynasty. Radiocarbon dating places the site at ca. 2100 to 1800 BC, providing physical evidence of the existence of a state contemporaneous with and possibly equivalent to the Xia Dynasty as described in Chinese historical works.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, John K. ''China: A New History''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, a site located in the city of Yanshi was excavated containing large palaces that some archaeologists have attributed as capital of the Xia Dynasty.  Though later historical works mention the Xia dynasty, no written records dated to the Xia period have been found to confirm the name of the dynasty and its sovereigns. At a minimum, the archaeological discoveries marked an evolutionary stage between the late neolithic cultures and the typical Chinese urban civilization of the Shang Dynasty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I disagree with the section 'Using recursive rules'

The rules of thumb:
* Start with your stop predicate.
* Avoid recursion on the lefta

..are maybe useful to the author of the post but I don't always write the &quot;stop&quot; predicate first and certainly do not avoid recursion on the left. I feel like it would be rude to just remove it though because the advice there is applicable to some situations.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page acts as the home for both EDUC 2201 Instructional Technology  and EDUC 6305 Advanced Instructional Technology, a (3) hour graduate course. The focus is on integrating technology into learning, and learning with technology. The content of the course will involve a combination of a variety of instructional methods including, self paced, group work,  reflection on how people learn and the role that technology plays in the learning process.  A central theme will be how technology is being incorporated into traditional direct instructional strategies or conversely how technology is transforming the teaching and learning processes. There is a heavy emphasis on the International Society for Technology in Educations National Educational Technology Standards for Teachers ISTE NETS-T   and the Interstate New Teachers Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC) principles. In addition the coursework should be considered within the Partnership for the 21st Century Skills framework.
This course provides a practical forum for teachers, corporate trainers, and other educators to investigate how the Internet and multimedia applications can be used to support education. Progression through the course will advance from usability and design issues, to development and publication of personally developed educational products.

----

This course is about technology integration into learning--our learning and our students' learning. Throughout the course there will be opportunities to explore how you learn new skills, new information and how you create new knowledge. We will explore on line learning, project-based learning, modeling, thinking in a context, community-based learning and teaching strategies that transfer more responsibility to the learner. You will be able to chose from a broad range of technology tools to enhance your learning individually and in small groups.
Ideally, your work and effort in this class should be mindful of how your improved skills may improve the lives and learning of children. However, the focus of the course work should be on your own personal learning. Those who understand their own learning make better teachers. Since knowledge is context-specific and learning is a socially embedded process of negotiation and acculturation.
These classes will be treated like a research and development facility or art studio in which we collaborate, engage in discussion and learn to use specific software packages when a &quot;teachable moment&quot; occurs. Face to face sessions will concentrate on basic skills required for success in this class namely the Web, FTP, email, and Blackboard. Asynchronous sessions will be spent, discussing the assigned readings and current events. There will also be opportunities to solve student problems. 

----

The backbone technology in the course is the Internet. We will be using the Web, FTP, email, reference materials, and other software to support our learning, on-line class discussions, for constructing web pages and other instructional materials. Students in this course will work individually and collaboratively, so each can pursue his or her own interests and utilize individual talents while at the same time contributing to our collective learning community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;How can a K-12 educator create an effective distance learning program ?&lt;/b&gt;

==Introduction== 

Over the past decade there has been a sudden increase in delivering distance learning programs  in K-12 education, defined as “learning experiences in which students and instructors are separated by space and/ or time” (Cavanaugh, Gillian, Kromrey, Hess, &amp; Blomeyer, 2004, 5).  In preparation for 21st century learning, traditional classrooms have been transformed by technology to allow students access to learning that is “anytime and anyplace” (SREB, 2003, p. 2). Distance learning programs provide a “significant and influential medium through which standards-based teaching and learning, online collaboration and acculturation to evolving norms for participation in virtual communities are quickly becoming realities” (NCREL, 2002, p. 1-2). Since this form of instruction is relatively new and rapidly changing, this article provides particular insight into those aspects of distance learning that currently lend themselves within the context of a K-12 distance learning program and offers a brief overview of supporting research.  

==Distance Learning Educators== 

An instructor is a key component in a successful K-12 distance learning program. Just as teachers engage students in discussion and learning in traditional classrooms, the same must be achieved online. However, distance learning presents certain new challenges as students often never actually meet one another or their teacher, and the nature of communication is often limiting and void of visual cues. As well, there are challenges in keeping tabs on individual students' learning when they are studying remotely. As a result, the role of the online teacher is pivotal for effective learning outcomes and experiences.

Increasingly, there has been an emphasis on creating distance learning environments where the teacher focuses less on on web content and more on interactive and collaborative structures that recognize the social and interactive elements of knowledge construction, and towards pedagogical approaches that enable student-centered (e.g. problem-based, inquiry-based, discovery, and authentic learning) which are found to be extremely effective for online learning (AFLN, 2003). .As well, teachers need to have much more than just technical competence if they are to be successful online. They need an understanding of the dynamics of online communication and interactions and need to learn effective ways of facilitating and teaching online.

One of the most significant aspects of distance learning is that teachers and students rarely, if ever, see one another. Distance learning teachers need to be able to use various technologies and approaches to get to know their students, lead and direct student discussions, evaluate students’ academic progress, and respond effectively to students’ needs. With the majority of communication between teachers and students being email and online discussions, online teachers must be able to write and communicate well (SREB, 2003).  
Instructors should spend some time getting to know their students and should have a repertoire of effective strategies to ensure that students are actively participating in their learning. In addition instructors should be able to manage both their own time schedule and offer scheduled assistance to students in need. Students should be given the opportunity to become familiar with their instructor.  A personal background that serves as an introduction by both instructor and student is helpful in establishing a connection between teacher and student.  Despite having never met their teacher, students in successful online learning programs report a familiarity and comfort level with their instructor, which they believe has assisted them in their learning process (Yang &amp; Cornelius, 2004).  Instructors should provide a means for students to contact them with questions, concerns or comments.  This should include a scheduled “office hours” when students can contact their instructor directly, either by phone or an online chat session.
 
The ultimate goals of effective design of online teaching programs from a teaching perspective should be to facilitate learning, and &quot;meaning making&quot; (AFLN, 2003), and to meet the academic, social and pragmatic needs of learners (AFLN, 2003). Effective online facilitation should engage, guide and motivate learners, and provide a safe and conducive environment for learning and communication exchange for all learners regardless of their prior experience and predisposition or otherwise towards online learning technologies. It should not be assumed that teachers (or students for that matter) automatically know how to communicate or behave online (AFLN, 2003). Many do not and require professional development or mentoring in the skills and techniques of facilitating.
Student Learners: 

Another important characteristic of successful distance learning programs are the learners themselves. Their ability to have well developed autonomy and greater student responsibility (Cavanaugh et al., 2004) are important in achieving success with distance learning. Students should be motivated to want to learn, with the ability to take full responsibility for their own progress. This may be challenging for younger students and thus they need to be scaffolded as part of the distance education learning experience (Cavanaugh, et al., 2004). Virtual school teachers must be adept at helping young students acquire the skills autonomous learning and self- regulation (Cavanaugh, et al., 2004). 

In addition, another characteristic of a successful distance learner is their “internal locus of control” (Cavanaugh, et al., 2004). Older students have a more developed internal locus of control than younger students which reinforces the need for careful design and teaching of distance education at different K-12 levels. Younger students need more supervision, fewer and simpler instructions and need more extensive reinforcement systems than older students (Cavanaugh, et al., 2004). It has been noted in the research that in the design of effective distance learning programs for younger students, there should be frequent teacher contact with students and parents, lessons need to be divided into shorter segments, coming about in mastery sequences so student progress comes about in stages, and rewards for learning such as multimedia praise and printable stickers or certificates. (Cavanaugh, et al., 2004).
	
Realizing that much consideration should be paid to the design of an effective distance learning program has in part to do with the age appropriateness of its design. Research suggests that this design in a K-12 context should reflect Piaget’s stages of cognitive development, in particular preoperational (2 to 7 years), concrete operational (7 to 11 years) and formal operational (11 years to adulthood). As these stages offer pedagogical guidance for delivering effective distance learning programs, which should focus on the major accomplishments of learners in these stages. Each stage is characterized by the emergence of new abilities and ways of processing information which should dictate specialized instructional approaches and attention to a child’s development. As a result, research indicates that web-based instruction for students in their formative years must include age appropriate developmental activities that build on the students’ accomplishments in and through the cognitive stages. An example from research suggests that “an online mathematics or science lesson designed for students at the preoperational stage needs to use very concrete methods, such as instructing the student to develop concepts by manipulating and practicing with real-world objects. This same concept can be built upon for students in the concrete operational stage using multimedia drag-and-drop manipulations and representations, or realistic simulations. Then at the formal operational stage, students are capable of using symbols, language and graphic organizers to continue to learn the concepts in more abstract ways” (Cavanaugh, et al., 2004).

==Curriculum Delivery==

Another critical component of distance learning is the curriculum, based on K-12 content standards, which should be designed under the philosophy that knowledge is constructed, rather than transmitted (Yang, 2005). Developmental theorist, Jean Piaget, makes it clear that student learning should be “holistic, authentic and realistic” (Cavanaugh, et al., 2004, p. 7) and that less emphasis should be placed on learning isolated skills aimed at teaching individual concepts that have little connection to the lives of students. But rather, students are more likely to learn skills when engaged in authentic, meaningful learning activities that are inherently interesting to the student. Thus, web-based technology offers a vast array of opportunities to expand the conceptual and experiential background of the student (Cavanaugh, et al., 2004).

In addition another developmental theorist, Vygotsky, implied through his theory that “cognitive development and the ability to use thought to control our own actions requires first mastering cultural communication systems and then learning to use these systems to regulate our own thought process” (Cavanaugh, et al., 2004, p. 7 - 8). He believed that for children, learning takes place when they are working within their zone of proximal development, where tasks within the zone of proximal development are ones that children cannot do alone and thus need or seek the guidance or assistance of their peers or adults. Therefore, when young students are using web-based technology, teachers must offer students activities that make use of the web’s powerful tools for collaborative learning, and are within the students’ zone of proximal development. An example of this being online communities that are used in distance learning programs where they provide a supportive context that makes new kinds of learning experiences for students possible. 

Additionally, constructivism, a learning theory that is widely used in distance learning, is founded on the premise that “by reflecting on our experiences and participating in social dialogical process we construct our understanding of the world we live in” (Cavanaugh, et al., 2004, p. 8). Further, we make sense of our experiences by constructing our own rules and mental models and learning therefore, is simply a process of adjusting our mental models to accommodate these new experiences. Because young students have not as yet had many experiences to construct their understanding scaffolding or mediated learning is important in helping young students achieve these cognitive understandings and are essential components of web-based learning experiences for children. Research points to the fact that “online learning environments, when designed to fully use the many tools of communication that are available, is often a more active, constructive, and cooperative experience than classroom learning”. As well, technologies that are easily employed in online environments, such as mind mapping tools, and simulations, are effective means for helping K-12 students make meaning of abstract phenomena, and strengthen their meta-cognitive abilities (Duffy &amp; Jonassen, 1992). 

Student learning should be designed with an emphasis on authentic and project- based learning activities. Learning assignments are tailored for individuals or collaborative groups, and assessment is based on learner outcomes that can be evaluated based both on content and execution (NCREL, 2002). The activities should be aligned with the various learning styles. A system for identifying and correcting inaccurate prior learning should be in place. Furthermore, the instructor should have the ability to modify and guide the overall process (Allen, Bourhis, Burrell, &amp; Mabry, 2001).

Presentation is an important factor, especially for younger students.  Graphics, audio, animation, video, text, and internet links should all enhance, and not distract from, the curriculum.  The user screen should be arranged for easy online manipulation  (Chang, 2004).Assignments, exercises, projects, simulations, games and activities should all complement, not distract from, the primary content (Allen, Bourhis, Burrell, &amp; Mabry, 2001). Independent, group, and online and offline assignments, should be interspersed throughout the curriculum, as well as a feedback loop to assess and reinforce comprehension. Assignments should include a description and grading rubric (Odin, 2002).  Grading rubrics and answer keys should also be available, where appropriate. 

==Online Learning System==

The online learning system (OLS) serves as a means of delivering the online course and provides a direct link between the school, teacher and student. It is essential that great care is taken to select an OLS that meets the needs of school, student and teachers.  Students should have access to the OLS at all times from any computer.  Before coursework begins, the OLS should provide an orientation to online learning.  The orientation should focus on the need for students to assume responsibility for their own learning, especially regarding communications with the instructor, personal scheduling and the proper installation and use of online courses. 

Whether the course is completely online or supplemented with a textbook, the online interface should facilitate ease of navigation.  Each student’s login should begin with a custom learning portal, linking to each aspect of the virtual environment and allowing for straightforward navigation. Daily assignments, instructional time log, and important updates should all be posted on this portal.  As well, the choice of OLS should take into consideration the age of the distance learning students the course is being designed for use with. 

==Communication== 

Research provides evidence that interaction in distance education programs involves a “complex array of variables: social, instructional, and technological” (Rice, 2006, p. 438), a pivotal role in the effectiveness of any distance learning program. 
In the development of a distance learning program  consideration should be given to the different types of interchange within a distance learning context: Learner-to-content (appropriateness of the course material and delivery vehicle considering objectives and learners), learner-to-instructor (types of communication and feedback,  access and support, etc., ) and learner-to-learner (types of communication and feedback, support systems, and procedures for dialogue, etc.,) and learner- to-interface where instruction is related to user access and competency with the specific technology employed (Rice, 2006). 

Online courses offer a variety of interaction types. Current research identifies two broad categories of communication: synchronous (real-time) and asynchronous (delayed-time). 
Synchronous communication adds a dimension to distance learning within the K-12 context that is highly interactive and engaging for student learners. These include tools like the telephone, instant messaging or chat, and virtual classroom tools that allow file sharing, audio, and even video communications. While the majority of communication in distance learning programs is through email and discussion boards, asynchronous communication specifically, discussion boards play an important role in the effectiveness of a program in that they act as the primary means of communication amongst teachers and students. Providing the opportunity for teachers to introduce topics for discussion, invite students to contribute and dialogue about topics and provide a platform for students to introduce their own topics for discussion. The discussion board also acts as a record of conversation that a student can go back to when needing clarification or given the chance upon reflection can add to at their own pace. It has been argued in related research that “text-based, nonlinear characteristics of threaded discussions may provide increased opportunities for reflection and sense-making based on constructive cognitive foundations” (Rice, 2006, p. 439). Essentially, Rice (2006) cites research that this type of communication allows students to “write one’s way into understanding”. Specifically in the K-12 environment there are indications of a relationship between student-to-student interaction and learning in a study conducted by Frid (2000) that “increased interaction influenced motivation and engagement in activities that resulted in increased student persistence with a challenging problem” (Rice, 2006, p. 439). Additionally, online teachers need to review these communication channels frequently and respond to student questions and concerns in a timely manner (SREB, 2003).

==Cultivating Community==

It is also important to note the importance of the social dimension to distance learning for K-12 students. As cited by Rice (2006) “although interaction seems intuitively important to the learning experience, interaction should not be added without real purpose” and the focus should be on building collaboration and group interaction which may be more important than focusing on individual participation. Similarly, it can be surmised that ineffective practices used in traditional classrooms will also be ineffective in distance education. For example, translating a classroom lecture to the web will likely not generate the interest or motivation in students that a highly interactive course might. 

Care must be taken to develop in younger students characteristics of successful distance learning students and it goes without saying that regardless of the use of enhanced computer mediated communication tools, they cannot substitute for well designed instruction and opportunities to engage students in age appropriate purposeful, interactive learning activities.

Cultivating an effective online learning community has many benefits, enabling students to more efficiently find solutions, share thoughts and ideas, ask for clarification, and promote accountability . Online discussion boards give students the opportunity to interact in a quasi-classroom environment . They should be utilized not only for problem or solution discourse, but for peer-support and to establish a sense of community within the work group.  Discussion threads should be available for students to discuss frustrations, challenges, ideas and questions that are not necessarily within the scope of the course. 

Online meetings, through synchronous means (e.g., video chats) should be made available to students on a regular reoccurring basis.  These meetings should be fun, interactive, and frequent. Meetings should be educationally oriented, but not based strictly on direct-instruction.  They should actively engage students, offering them the opportunity to lead a group activity, share relevant information, or present a project.  Some suggested activities for building community include: collaboratively building a group identity, creating group rules and procedures, synchronous chatting, picture sharing, video conferencing, face-to-face meetings (when practical), and group projects. (Kennedy, 2000). 

==Time Management==

The unique flexibility of an online course may create a problem of time management for K-12 students as not all students possess the self-regulation necessary for success in an online course.  A system should be in place to assist students to establish and maintain the time management skills necessary for success.  This may also require some form of daily accountability, such as an online status check, or a daily time log. A default work schedule and daily progress report should be implemented into the OLS.  The individual learning portal should include links to cumulative progress reports, and a method for logging academic time . Thus both the teacher and student should be made aware of time spent online engaged in appropriate course work. 

==Conclusion==

In order to create an effective distance learning program within the K-12 context, an online teacher must take into consideration a variety of characteristics. First, the use of clearly defined curriculum content and creation of an effective and easy to use online manner in which student learners can interact with and learn the content. As well, using an online design that attracts and further motivates student interest utilizes technology that enables the online teacher to customize each student’s learning experience through tools and formats such as video, interactive features, resources and links that are related to the course content and reflect the age of the student  Additionally, it should be noted that  “technology in and of itself may have no special powers to improve learning, but it has been argued that distance technologies could offer more powerful learning opportunities than their face-to-face counterparts when embedded with instruction that addresses the cognitive and social processes of knowledge construction” (Rice, 2006, p. 441). Thus the effectiveness of a distance learning program in a K-12 context lies within the quality of an online teacher who knows how to design and develop a distance learning program that engages students to become actively involved in their own learning and achieve success. 

Online distance learning is still a relatively new concept within the K-12 context.  Distance learning teachers are in a unique position to truly be educational pioneers.  We can draw from the successes and short-comings of the many years of  K-12 education and then apply that knowledge to the distance learning environment, in ways that have been previously unexplored. The challenge lies in shifting classical thinking into a new paradigm of learning.  We have a new method of delivery, new curriculum and new information.  This deserves thoughtful focus on a new way of teaching within the K-12 context.  It needs to be more than simply uploading the classroom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following needs to be done in order to use the Postgresql database in Antfarm:

    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-client postgresql-client-common postgresql-server-dev-8.3
    sudo su - postgres
    $ createuser &lt;user name&gt;
    Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y
    $ exit
The user that you create will be the user who is associated with all of the antfarm files and must have permission to all Antfarm files, that is why they will be considered a superuser in this aspect.

For each environment used, the following commands are used to set up your database.    

    createdb &lt;environment name&gt; (this only needs to be done once per envioronment)
    antfarm -e &lt;environment name&gt; db --migrate (this is used to create the tables)
    antfarm -e &lt;environment name&gt; db --reset (this is used to prepare the tables to be filled)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The defaults.yml file is where the environments that you are running in antfarm are defined.  This file usually resides in .antfarm/config

The default environment with no other definitions nor the use of the -e option is 'antfarm'.  The defaults.yml file initially has the following:

    environment: antfarm
    log_level: warn

If other environments are added (userenvironment1 &amp; userenvironment2 are examples here), the defaults.yml file look like:

    environment: antfarm
    log_level: warn
    userenvironment1:
      adapter: postgresql
    userenvironment2:
      adapter: postgresql
           .
           .
           .
and so on

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:32, 8 December 2008 (UTC)</text>
