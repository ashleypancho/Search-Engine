== Overview ==

'''''The Daily Prophet''''' is the Wizard's authoritative daily newspaper. It is delivered by owl post in the morning, at a cost of (variously) 1 to 5 Knuts per issue. There is mention in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], among other places, of ''The Evening Prophet'', which we presume is an evening edition of the same paper, and elsewhere of ''The Sunday Prophet'' which would of course be the weekend edition of the paper.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The ''Daily Prophet'' does tend to publish the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic's]] official line, rather than anything that would be controversial. Unfortunately, as far as daily papers go, it does seem to be a monopoly, so dissenting views have no way to get published except through tabloids like ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|The Quibbler]]'', which can be more damaging to their message than not publishing at all.

== Analysis ==

In the early books (up to the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and the Ministry of Magic are relatively closely aligned in their goals; so for the first three books, the ''Daily Prophet'' appears to be a simple news-gathering organ, and appears to function quite effectively in that role. The paper starts to be adversarial in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], though there what we seem to be seeing is the uniform nastiness of a single reporter, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], who seems to be happiest when she is doing a hatchet job on somebody. In that book, and apparently in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] (based on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s comment &quot;Ministry o' Magic messing up again&quot;), the target of the paper's reporting seems to be the Ministry.

It is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] that the paper seems to start diverging from its role as a news gatherer, and verging on propaganda. Harry has discovered an unwelcome truth ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] has returned); [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], to the dismay of the Ministry, accepts Harry's story. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], then Minister for Magic, perceives that allowing this news to be disseminated will result in an end to his tenure. The Ministry, according to Rita Skeeter, leans on the ''Prophet'' to force it to print stories that would discredit Harry and Dumbledore, and thus weaken the effects of anything they might say in public.

As is so often the case in public life, when the pendulum swings, it swings rapidly and to the other extreme. At the very end of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', the cat is let out of the bag when a number of Ministry wizards actually see Voldemort physically in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry offices]], so that Fudge can no longer deny his return; by the start of the next book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], the ''Daily Prophet'' is hailing Harry as The Chosen One who will defeat Voldemort. Again, Ministry influence is strong; they are building Harry up because their own efforts are pretty ineffectual (in the course of the year, apparently there are only about three arrests of suspected [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], none of whom are confirmed), and the Ministry feels, rightly, that they need a Hero. The ''Prophet'' is still acting as the mouthpiece of the administration. Whether it still carries any hard news at all is uncertain; certainly, anything that would discredit the Ministry is not printed.

However, during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], the ''Daily Prophet'' changes register again: although it isn't seen many times – Harry reads [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] elegy, written by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Elphias Doge|Elphias Doge]], and several excerpts from Dumbledore's biography written by Rita Skeeter – it is mentioned on various occasions that the newspaper is siding with the Voldemort-controlled Ministry, and actually printing stories that show Harry and his friends in the worst possible light. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] appears at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] after the wedding, for instance, he shows the Trio an issue in which it is mentioned that Harry is wanted so that he can be questioned about Dumbledore's death.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
# In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 25|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Rita Skeeter chastises [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], saying that the business of a reporter is to sell newspapers. Is the changing editorial stance of the ''Prophet'' following this pattern? Why or why not?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Over the course of the series, the character of ''The Daily Prophet'' changes. In the first four books, it is quite critical of the efforts of the Ministry, but in the fifth and sixth books it starts slanting its news, particularly those stories that concern Harry, Professor Dumbledore, and Voldemort, at the request of the Ministry. In the final book, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', what we see of the ''Prophet'' leads us to believe that it has become a Ministry-backed propaganda organ, publishing stories that are generated by Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] in line with Voldemort's insane beliefs. Brought up in a country with a nominally free press, the student might find it hard to believe that a news publication could so quickly devolve into a party mouthpiece, but the sequence, when examined, is all too believable.

All news publishers depend to a certain extent on the good will of the government; it is the actions of the government that control people's lives, and a news organ that has no access to government spokespersons will have, in the ordinary run of affairs, very little news that people want to read. So if a government spokesman makes it a precondition of speaking to the press, that the press should follow the government lead, it does become more likely that the news publisher will print what the government wants printed. Additionally there is the option, used by many totalitarian governments, of using force to shut down non-conforming newspapers. In situations where there is only one newspaper, of course, it is easier for the government to apply pressure, and harder for the paper to resist; if there are multiple publishers, the government has to lean on all of them, or someone will publish what the government doesn't want known.

It is generally easier to apply effective pressure to an organization like the ''Prophet'', than to a smaller publication like ''The Quibbler''. We will find out that ''The Quibbler'' is basically a one-man operation, and does not need government access to continue operation. The publisher is also working out of personal belief, rather than for a job. If we look at the ''Prophet'', particularly Rita Skeeter, we can safely guess that most of its employees are there for the money, and do not have significant emotional involvement in the slant of the news. This will make them less likely to fight a change in editorial direction, from opposing to supporting particular government initiatives, no matter how stupid they appear. The tendency to do the job as ordered, in order to keep receiving a paycheque, is all too human.

From the point of view of the final book, it is clear that the ''Prophet'''s bending to Government pressure to denigrate Harry and Dumbledore, which started in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', is the start of a clear progression that ends with the paper parroting Death Eater propaganda. We do not need to point out the parallel between the Ministry's influence over the ''Prophet'', and the Ministry's increasing influence over Hogwarts though ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''; in both cases, it is obvious that the government, acting in an attempt at self-preservation, is simply gradually claiming power, using the existing power it has as a way to leverage more. In the case of the ''Prophet'', it does seem that the amount of time it takes for the government to obtain complete control is somewhat compressed; against this, of course, we have to note the Death Eaters' willingness to use the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] to further their agenda.

features= &quot;Supermarket tabloid&quot; of the Wizarding world|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]|}}

== Overview ==

'''''The Quibbler''''' is a sensationalist newspaper or magazine, much like the ''National Enquirer'' and the ''Weekly World News'' in the Muggle world. It prints stories that have been rejected by the established press, typically because they are apparently nonsense.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see ''The Quibbler'' when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] is reading it on the Hogwarts Express, deciphering a page which is deliberately printed upside down. It carries a story that suggests that in fact [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] is in London, where he is performing in a rock band using the alias &quot;Stubby Boardman&quot;. Luna is upset at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s dismissal of the paper, saying that the publisher of ''The Quibbler'' is her father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]]. 

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is being pilloried in the traditional press for speaking honestly about his adventures, Hermione arranges with Luna and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] that Rita will interview Harry about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s return and write it up for publication, and Luna's father will then publish it. This results in Harry's story getting widely known, particularly at Hogwarts, where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] stooge, bans the paper as part of her attempts to cover up Voldemort's return.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], a party of refugees mentions in Harry's hearing that ''The Quibbler'' is now printing stories about what is really going on, and exhorting its readers to help Harry. Later, Luna Lovegood is taken hostage to force ''The Quibbler'' to toe the party line.  Before any of these new &quot;party line&quot; issues are actually released, however, Xeno Lovegood is himself taken hostage, and it is not mentioned whether ''The Quibbler'' is converted into another Ministry mouthpiece after this or simply shuts down with the absence of the editor.

== Analysis ==

The purpose of ''The Quibbler'', quite simply, is to give us an alternate channel of publicity from the establishment press. If the establishment controls the news reporting, it can slant and censor the news as it chooses; without an alternate channel, the government's views are the only ones that will see the light of day. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 25|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Rita tells us that Fudge and the Ministry are leaning on ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|The Daily Prophet]]'', which is part of why they are slanting the stories the way they are; the other part of it is that nasty stories, like the ones Rita wrote (she is on imposed hiatus at that point), sell papers, and selling papers is actually the whole point.

A secondary purpose of the ''Quibbler'' is apparently illustration of just how necessary to an unjust regime it is to control the means of dissemination of information, and the steps they will take to that end. In the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet#Greater Picture|''The Daily Prophet'']], we see how it becomes, over time, more and more a mouthpiece for the Ministry of Magic, until it finally seems to exist only to parrot the propaganda generated by Voldemort's minions. We note in that article that the ''Prophet'' is easier to influence than ''The Quibbler'', because the ''Prophet'' will follow the money, where ''The Quibbler'' to a large extent will follow Xeno Lovegood's heart. It is unsurprising that Xeno, having found that he so rapidly sold out of the issue with Harry's interview in it, should continue to publish articles about Harry. Equally, it is unsurprising that he should continue to do so after the fall of the Ministry, as he has been, in his own mind at least, fighting the Ministry all along. It helps, no doubt, that articles about Harry would be popular among the resistance at that point. It is somewhat surprising that Death Eaters would resort to kidnapping Xeno's daughter as a way of controlling his press, but it is possible that, like Harry, Xeno is able to resist the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]].

It is worth noting that this sort of personal violence against publishers is not unheard of in the Muggles world. It is also possibly worth noting that, in nearly every aspect which we can see, by the time the Ministry falls, ''The Quibbler'' is classic &quot;samizdat&quot;, printed in relatively small quantities and distributed through a back channel rather than on the news stands. Unfortunately, and possibly because of the relatively small size of the Wizarding population, ''The Quibbler'' is susceptible to threats of violence against a single person; and Xeno is not in a position where he can go into hiding and still keep publishing.

== General Overview ==

'''''Borgin &amp; Burkes''''' is a shop in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]] that specializes in Dark magical artifacts.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo powder]] to get to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], he accidentally turns up in Borgin &amp; Burkes. Rapidly concealing himself, he overhears [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] selling some dark magical items so that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] would not find them in his house.

Among the Dark artifacts that we see in this store are a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hand of Glory|Hand of Glory]] and a cursed necklace. We should also note that the large black cabinet that Harry hides in is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Disappearing Cabinet]]. All three of these artifacts will play roles in later stories.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] sneak off from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] and follow [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] to Borgin &amp; Burkes, where by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ears]], they overhear Malfoy telling Borgin that he needs something fixed. He also needs to buy another object but cannot take it with him. He doesn't want Borgin to tell anyone about it, not even his own mother, and threatens Borgin with one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], who he says is an old family friend. After Malfoy leaves, Hermione goes into the store and attempts to determine what it is that Malfoy had bought, but without success.

In that same book, we also learn that following his 7th year at Hogwarts, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] worked there for a time, much to the surprise of everyone who knew him. We learn that it was while he was employed at Borgin &amp; Burkes that he discovered that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]] owned artifacts of two of the Hogwarts founders: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff's]] cup and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Slytherin's]] locket.

== Analysis ==

As mentioned in the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]], there will be places where Dark wizards can trade, places where &quot;decent wizards don't go.&quot; Borgin and Burkes clearly is one such; while they do appear to do a reasonable amount of trade in non-Dark artifacts, as seen by Tom Riddle's negotiations with Hepzibah Smith regarding a suit of armour, and Smith's purchase of Slytherin's locket, their dealings with Lucius Malfoy clearly indicate that they do not discriminate between Dark and regular magical artifacts. We do not know whether this lack of discrimination controlled their settling in Knockturn Alley, or whether the Alley developed its reputation around the store. We do know that they have been in business since before the birth of Tom Riddle, as Slytherin's locket was sold to them by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]] before Tom was born. However, we don't know how long before that the establishment existed. The name does indicate that it was founded by a Borgin and a Burke, and possibly the original Burke still operates the store; but names mean little, as Ollivander's has been producing &quot;fine wands since 382 BC,&quot; much longer than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]], its current proprietor, can possibly have been alive, without the help of a magical artifact such as the Sorcerer's Stone.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The artifacts that we see in Borgin and Burkes - the Hand of Glory, the cursed necklace, and the Disappearing Cabinet - will re-appear, as mentioned above. The Disappearing Cabinet is apparently one of a pair; the second one is dropped by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' to provide a distraction. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] force [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]] into the same disappearing cabinet, and the following year Draco Malfoy repairs it and uses it and its mate at Borgin and Burkes to manage an invasion of Hogwarts by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. The jinxed necklace is given to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] to give to someone at Hogwarts, possibly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], but she touches it on her way back to the school and is nearly fatally cursed. Finally, the Hand of Glory is used by Draco as he leads the Death Eaters into the school. Having been discovered by members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] guarding that spot, Draco throws [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder|Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder]], then uses the Hand of Glory to navigate himself and the Death Eaters through the resulting darkness.

It is interesting to see that as early as the second book, the author would have been aware of the need for artifacts like the Hand of Glory and the Disappearing Cabinet in the sixth book, and would take the steps necessary to introduce them and their properties to us. The fact that the large black cabinet would have transported Harry to Hogwarts had he closed the door completely in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' is definitely of interest, and close examination of the writing of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|that chapter]], to see how the author misdirects the reader into believing Harry had closed the door, might be valuable.

I Can not understand what's the meaning of oklahome in thie article !!!
and what is the relationship between oklahome and the adjectives !!!
anybody would explain this to me.

Support: It may be a clever idea if anyone knew what it meant. Looks like someones lecture notes- and they are useless without the scribble on the whiteboard. 
ClemRutter :en:Wikipedia

Oklahoma is not a mnemonic, a mnemonic is when the letters of a word spell out a phrase eg the colours of the rainbow - Richard Of York Gave Battle in Vain - Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet.

Oklahoma here is referring to the line drawn, easiest to see in weak declension between the endings -en and -e. I'm not from the US but apprantly it's shaped like the state of Oklahoma. At our school in the UK they just told us to remember where the line was.

I know the memory-aid as the toothbrush, albeit one with a very short handle.  At least everyone who speaks English knows what a toothbrush looks like, not that many know what Oklahoma looks like! Is it possible to insert a black line to make the &quot;toothbrush&quot; clear?</text>

== Policy suggestions ==

I would like to make two suggestions for [[Cookbook:Policy]]:
# We should deprecate lists of recipes and instead use categories. For example, the recipe list on [[Cookbook:Mushroom]] should instead be in [[:Category:Mushroom recipes]] and a link to that category should be provided. Categories should be updated as appropriate.
## Categories should thus have additional text and templates and whatnot to both look like part of the existing Cookbook and also be more user-friendly; as it is categories are virtually invisible to users who don't investigate what they do. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:32, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
##The lists are more powerful in some ways. In a hand-edited list, I can restrict the number of entries for particularly popular ingredients. (tomato, cheese, chicken, salt...) For the unpopular ingredients, I can tweak things the other way. For example, the [[Cookbook:Quince]] page could have a [[Cookbook:Apple Crisp|Quince Crisp]] link that actually goes to the perfectly-suitable Apple Crisp recipe. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:18, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
## I think the category summaries should be used for exhaustive lists and the hand editied lists should serve more as a small selection. For instance, the are many mushroom recipes in the Cookbook, but only a subsection of those use mushrooms as the main ingredients. So the mushroom page gets a small hand picked selection of true mushroom recipes (like mushroom soup and mushroom pasta sauce), with an additional link to the mushroom category for an exhaustive list of all recipes that use mushrooms. [[User:Risk|risk]] 17:57, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
###I disagree in part. I actually don't see the categories as exhaustive lists of every recipe using an ingredient. I see them as categories for the major ingredients. It doesn't strike me as particularly useful to have a list of all recipes involving Flour, for instance. This is my impression from going through a large number of the recipes and adding categories; I don't think listing all Cakes as &quot;Egg recipes&quot; is very productive... redundant me! [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:03, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
####Good point. We could have a 'three tiered' structure. The ingredient page shows a small selection (about 4 or 5) of well formatted recipes to which the ingredient is key. The category page shows a list of all the recipes the ingredients plays an important part in. And finally the what links here page could be used to obtain an exhaustive list of everything to do with the ingredient, should anyone want such a list. [[User:Risk|risk]]
# Images for recipes should be included via a template similar to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipesummary}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; so that the image appears above the summary. For an example, see: [[nl:Kookboek:Oliebollen]]. 
##Pretty, but getting kind of complex. Consider the newcomers. Let's also be sure to avoid making people feel that they should not contribute without having a picture and knowing how many Calories a recipe has. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:18, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
###I agree that we should encourage newcomers; do you think that having a standard of this sort will actually discourage them? I think in most cases they'll add stuff anyway and put pictures in without the template, then a more committed and aware contributor will clean up their work to fit the templates. Is that more reasonable? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:31, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
###I think this might have just the right effect on newcomers. It's not a lack of recipes that the cookbook is suffering from, but rather a lack of well thought out recipes. Right now it seems to me that everybody just adds their own dip-sauce recipe and never returns, leaving the cookbook full of these unchecked uninteresting recipes that we can't remove, because of wiki philosophy. If most recipes look nice, in this way, it might increase the threshold for adding new recipes. To me, the lack of a decent selection process is the one disadvantage of a wiki cookbook. Increasing the complexity of the standard recipe layout may force people to think about recipes a little longer, and look through the cookbook more, to see how things should be done. I'm getting a little sidetracked here, but in short; if it does intimidate newcomers a little (it might I'm not sure), that might not be such a bad thing. [[User:Risk|risk]] 17:57, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

Comments?
[[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:00, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

Sounds good. Here's two more:
# open-license images should be placed on Commons whenever possible. For example [[:Image:ChewyGingerCookies.jpg]] would look great on a Wikipedia article, but the user wouldn't know it existed unless they saw it there first. On Commons images can be deeply catted just as these recipies are so any such images could be easily found by users, regardless of their language or home wiki. That would also allow for different languages' Cookbooks to share their collective images.
# Cookbook images should be catted so they can be easily found by contributors wanting a particular image. For example [[:Image:ChampignonMushroom.jpg]] could make a useful thumbnail on countless recipies. That would also help keep the current images of the project together; right now the only way to see them is to crawl through [[:Category:Public domain]] and similar. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:32, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== transwikied recipies to be integrated ==

There are quite a few recipies on [[Wikibooks:Transwiki log/Articles moved to here]] that have not yet been moved into the Cookbooks structure. These should eventually be sorted through and moved ('''''not''''' by cut-n-paste but by the move tab) to the Cookbook: namespace. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:22, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== Duplication? ==

What does everyone else think about how we should handle different versions of recipes?

For example, what would happen if I had a hummus recipe to add to the Cookbook (as it happens, I do). I see that [[Cookbook:Humus]] already exists under Israel / Palestine cuisine, but my recipe is more like the Greek version. Would it be acceptable to replace the existing redirect to humus from [[Cookbook:Hummus]] with my own recipe, and to categorise it under Greek cuisine?

Consider, for example, what would happen when someone with an authentic Greek hummus recipe came along. Would it be okay for them to replace my recipe, or do they simply add it to the end of may recipe page? Where does it stop, there are many variations of every recipe.

In general, I would list additional recipes (maybe regional variations) in a new section if they are significantly different from the existing one. But, if it were possible (i.e., the variations were quite minor), then I would incorporate them as variations of the existing recipe.

If we are to list several recipes on a page, do we put the most authentic one at the top, or the generic version that more people are likely to use? This is not a major problem yet, but it's something to think about for the future. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:59, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

:: I previously reccomended to [[User:risk]] that a disambiguation-style page be created for the &quot;abstract&quot; type of food (lasagna in his case, hummus here) and that each specific recipe be linked from there, each with some sort of distinguishing name. This name could be as simple as &quot;Hummus (Greek)&quot;, &quot;Hummus (Variation 1)&quot;, &quot;Geo's Hummus&quot; (though I personally hate recipes with people's names in them) -- I don't think that part matters so much. This is almost equivalent to using categories, say &quot;Hummus recipes&quot;. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:33, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

:: OOOOOOOOH!!! This is actually quite the job for: [[m:DynamicPageList]], which I shall request this evening on the mediawiki bug tracker.

::: That sound like a good idea, I'll do that. Don't worry, I don't intend to plaster my name all over it.;)  I suppose my main concern is that, when we get many variations on a single recipe (in addition to the basic regional variations), it will become difficult for readers to decide which one to choose. Also, maintenence of all of those pages may become a chore. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:47, 17 August 2005 (UTC)


:Its a question that we need to address, and Kellen's solution seems like the best idea.  We currently have 5 recipes on [[Cookbook:Guacamole]], at least one of which has variations.  While I don't think 2 or 3 hummus recipes would hurt on a single page, in the future if ingredient searching is enabled, multiple recipes on one module would be difficult to deal with.

:In addition to Kellen's suggestion I'd like to suggest a phase before the creation of a 'disambiguation' page. If it's only two recipes, or if the recipes could be merged a single page might be better. If the number of recipes becomes unreasoble (which is around three of four, I think) the recipes should be merged (if there aren't enough differences) or the page should be turned into a disambiguation page (if each of the recipes has their own merit and merging recipes would mean removing relevant and interesting ideas/information). I think most sets of recipes could simply be turned into a most basic/authentic form with extensive notes, tips and variations. For instance the bechamel sauce recipe tells us to season with salt pepper and nutmeg. Moving the nutmeg to the variations sections would create a basic recipe that everybody can agree on. I think we should use a disambiguation page only if all these methods fail (or, of course, if a definitive recipe is unthinkable, like with Lasagne or Omelet). I'd hate for every casual visitor to add their Guacemole recipe simply because everybody else has done it. [[User:Risk|risk]] 01:20, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

== Names, I's and other personal references ==
Would it be a good idea to add a guideline to the policy against stuff like &quot;Alex's Ice Cream Surprise&quot;, &quot;My husband loves this recipe&quot; and other references to the editor? Stuff like that really doesn't belong in a wiki. You can't refer to yourself in a wiki, because the text isn't written by you, but by the community (There is no I in &quot;wiki&quot; :). I'm not saying a rule in the policy would stop people from writing this way, but if there is general consensus on this, these things can be removed systematically. [[User:Risk|risk]] 01:27, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Agreed. Perhaps the language should be something like &quot;Recipes should be named according to their traditional name, their origin, or their ingredients. Avoid naming recipes for people, unless it is a well-known recipe by that name. Recipes should be written in the third person, with a relativly formal style. Keep comments about the quality of the recipe on the relevant Talk page.&quot; (Please modify this as I'm not completely happy with it) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:48, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

On a related note, I found a wide variety of PD cookbooks over at [http://www.gutenberg.org/ Project Gutenberg] in my search for Custard recipes, including [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13923 Presidential], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13887 vegetarian] ([http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10632 a couple], actually), [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12293 ancient], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7223 Belgian], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6703 Columbian], etc.  Here's their whole [http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/loccs/tx home ec section].  Perhaps unfortunately, some of these were probably written under the old-fashioned definition of &quot;vegetarian&quot;, and might perhaps contain meat ingredients.  I've adapted the recipes (changing &quot;slow fire&quot; to &quot;low heat&quot; and adding &quot;corn starch&quot; where before it had only &quot;flour&quot;, etc.), but left a credit and a backlink in the talk page.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:27, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

::Yes, but in 1887, apparently cornstarch was not available, and so the practice (at least in the White House kitchen) was to thicken custard using wheat flour.  I kept that option in the recipe, but included the (now possible, and in my mind preferable) option of thickening the custard with corn starch.  I certainly wouldn't make that kind of suggestion without considering the context.--[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 16:46, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

== merging of type and category pages ==

Shall we merge the &quot;type&quot; pages and their respective categories? For instance, [[Cookbook:Cake]] with [[:Category:Cake recipes]]? In this instance, the text from Cookbook:Cake has been copied to the Category:Cake_recipes module, with good effect IMO. This implies, however, that we could merge ingredient pages and their listings ([[Cookbook:Okra]] with [[:Category:Okra recipes]]) and national and ethnic cuisines as well ([[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada]] with [[:Category:Canadian recipes]]).

This would be a large shift for the way the Cookbook is organized, but I think it is one that makes sense considering most of what we are doing is categorizing recipes based on these classifications (ingredient, cuisine, type, etc). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:33, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::: Okay, back to the actual topic of this thread &amp;mdash; I agree that merging the ''type'' and ''category'' pages would generally be a good idea.

::::::: The drawback I see of integrating, say, national cuisines with the category page is a lack of multi-dimensional categorization. For instance, with user maintained lists we can have &quot;Cuisine of Canada&quot; with sections for &quot;Dessert&quot; and &quot;Breakfast&quot;, etc. The DynamicPageList (if it ever gets installed......) would allow us to generate such lists by fetching all items in both  the &quot;Desserts&quot; and &quot;Canadian recipes&quot; categories. But pages using DynamicPageLists must be updated (as with templates) to force them to un-cache. I hope to high hell that mediawiki people are actually working on this, because it's starting to annoy me and may result in some hardcore php hacking.

== video ==
I can [http://www.maushammer.com/systems/cvscamcorder/index.html produce video in Xvid *.avi format]. It plays fine on a non-x86 computer running Debian, which should qualify the format as being free enough.

How should I add videos?

There are lots of things to show:
*air-flipping an omelet or pancake
*scrambling an egg
*adding food to a deep-fat fryer as safely as possible
*stir-frying

:Albert, video would be cool. But, maybe you could convert your video to [[w:Theora|Theora]], as used for video content on the Commons (see [[commons:Commons:File types]]). [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:04, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

:I would be '''extremely''' excited to see videos! Seems like they should go to commons as they could be useful on other wikipedia pages. Maybe this is obvious, but I think we should make a template much like the thumbnail boxes for images where a screenshot could go, perhaps with a little video icon and short description. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:45, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

::Converting video is bad for the quality. It's like taking a low-quality JPEG, moving the upper-left corner (crop or add 1 row and 1 column), and recompressing as another low-quality JPEG. Given the harsh stand that Debian takes about free software, anything playable on my system should meet the freedom standards for the Commons.

:::I read the specs of this device, and you're right, 320x240 would look like **** when converted.
:::As for the sidebox there's already this video icon.

That would be really nice. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:50, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

Help me figure out how to do this. I have a video showing how to wrap an [[Cookbook:Egg_Roll|egg roll]].
Hmmm, &quot;Show preview&quot; is giving me a funny-looking video icon in the wrong place. Does it work?
[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:40, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

:What you could do is make a nice screengrab from the video. For example, like this. Also note the : before the Image:, this prevents it from attempting (and failing) to generate a thumbnail. Since there's no thumbnail the browser will do something else instead, which is why you're seeing a video icon and yet I'm just seeing a broken image's alt text sort of link.
:Anyway. as you can see the method at right gives you a preview, both direct and indirect links, and even tells you how big and what format. Later on someone can make a pretty table template to automatically fill in most of this info, but for now this will do fine.
:Oh and the image description page should have a clear link back to the video just in case people click on that instead. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:45, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

::I do have some pretty decent lighting, but the camera has a bad auto-adjustment feature. My fellow CVS camcorder hackers have learned how to extract the firmware though, so that might be fixable.

== Category naming of 'type' pages ==

If we're going to be integrating the category pages with the &quot;types&quot; of food (cake, cookies, etc). Should the categories be named differently? For example, should it be &quot;Category:Cake&quot; or &quot;Category:Cake recipes&quot;? We currently have a mixed system, with mostly &quot;____ recipes&quot; winning out (but that's because I made a bunch of them and inferred that was the format; Gentgeen also did a bunch IIRC), but with notable exceptions (&quot;Pasta&quot; for one).

Also a reminder; we should be sure to create appropriate redirect pages from modules in the cookbook namespace to the merged category pages. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:39, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

:  It would probably be best to have them all be &quot;Category:Pasta Recipes&quot; and such since we could then have &quot;Category:Italian Recipes&quot; and such, &quot;Category:Vegan Recipes&quot; works too, I think that would be the best system for the job.

Looking over the pages that are listed on [[:Category:Cookbook_pages_needing_work]], there are a few types of pages listed there:
* '''Recipes close to being ok'''
** Pages needing simple formatting and categorization. ([[Cookbook:Spritzgeback]])
** Pages with multiple recipes. ([[Cookbook:Pizza_Sauce]], [[Cookbook:Sushi]])
** Pages lacking only one or two measurements/temperatures/times. ([[Cookbook:Black_Forest_Cake]]).
* '''Recipes needing serious work'''
** Pages from the decameron and 1881 books, which usually lack exact measurements, oven temperatures, or cooking times. ([[Cookbook:Spring_soup]])
** &quot;Info&quot; pages ''about'' a type of food which should be recipes, which may or may not have external links. ([[Cookbook:Savoiardi]])
** Recipe ''outlines'', lacking all but the most general cooking information ([[Cookbook:Salted_mustard_greens_and_shredded_meat_noodle_soup]])
** Pages which are convoluted or inconsistent ([[Cookbook:Pizza]])

[[User:AlbertCahalan]] suggested that the banner for &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookwork}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; might be overkill for some of these recipes, and I agree. Shall we incorporate some sort of message, similar to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to suggest that only minor changes are needed (but denote them anyway) rather than the more abusive style of the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookwork}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; banner? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:54, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

:Not to answer you, sorry, but: I intend to deal with Pizza. There are two things I haven't fully figured out yet. First, should the history remain at Pizza or should it follow the recipe there to a new page covering that recipe? Second, what do I call that recipe? Ideas include: Pizzaria Pizza, Standard Pizza, and Easy-to-screw-up Pizza :-). It's not the only style of thin-crust pizza, so I don't like that as a title. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:52, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

:: I talked to Nmontague on IRC and he mentioned possibly doing something with pizza. I am inclinded to just purge it and get a proper recipe. As for the history; we're somewhat inconsistent with that. Some transwikis get the whole history, some just get a link to WP, and when we copy articles around (or at least when I've done it) the histories generally don't follow. That of course doesn't mean it's right though... [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:58, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

:I expect problems with foods that are normally ingredients, but which have recipes: tortilla, crouton, english muffin, ketchup, egg roll wrapper, puff pastry, applesauce, salsa, hot sauce, teriyaki sauce, ravioli, jam, stock, broth, gravy, meatball, mayonaise...

: I've redone [[Cookbook:Savoiardi | savoiardi]], I did it with a good recipe that should be of some use - I am probably just inviting extra work by having done it, since it is the real [[Cookbook:Lady Finger | lady finger]] and most people will more likely expect the sorta muted version that is more common in stores.  So I'll probably touch up the information on the two pages and try to find a more traditional [[Cookbook:Tiramisù | Tiramisù]] recipe too, though the one there turned out alright.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 02:07, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

== English v. Other language Recipe names ==

I suggest that the &quot;common&quot; english name for a recipe be used for the module name. If necessary/desired a redirect from the name in the original language can be created. In cases where the non-english name is the common name, that name should be used (&quot;Huevos rancheros&quot;). This came up as I was beginning to edit [[Cookbook:Khaeng Keaw Wan]], which is a recipe for Thai Green Curry. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:15, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

:: Are there any objections to this? If not, I will be adding it to the [[Cookbook:Policy]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:52, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

::: Well, I don't think the common name is really always the best one to list as the first name.  For example, some of the French don't really like the way anglophones often refer to egged-toast as french toast.  They feel the same way about things like french fries and such, so perhaps ensuring a neutral common name instead of the most common one as the name for the article and putting the others in as emboldened titles within the description of the recipe would be better.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 03:48, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:::: The French should talk! A French term for &quot;condom&quot; translates literally as &quot;English hat&quot;. I expect that fr.wikibooks.org will do as the French speakers like, and en.wikibooks.org will do as the English speakers like. We have enough trouble already with the 30% that are non-American; we sure don't need any additional burdens. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:10, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

::Go with the simple English name. Add redirects as needed, and put the non-English stuff as a secondary name. This is especially important because many of us can't type non-ASCII characters. We have to cut-and-paste. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:10, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

== Formatting of Recipe Pages ==

A couple of Recipe Pages have been reformatted - I think that this change is detrimental. The following Recipe Pages follow a format in which the recipes are listed and categorized when possible: 

Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes
Cookbook:Meat Recipes
Cookbook:Pasta Recipes
Cookbook:Rice Recipes
Cookbook:Holiday Recipes
Cookbook:Small Meals
Cookbook:Bread Recipes
Cookbook:Sauces
Cookbook:Side dishes
Cookbook:Dessert
Cookbook:Snacks
Cookbook:Confections
Cookbook:Easy Dinners

I think that this is the best format for people who are looking for recipes. Ease of use in finding recipes is an absolute necessity for any cookbook. 

The following pages did follow the pattern, but they have been altered:

Category:Salads
From Wikibooks
(Redirected from Cookbook:Salad Recipes)

Category:Stews
From Wikibooks
(Redirected from Cookbook:Stews)
 
Not only do they fail to follow the pattern of the majority of the recipe pages, many of the recipes are listed under &quot;C&quot;, with the preface &quot;cookbook&quot;.  

[[User:Alcinoe|Alcinoe]] 09:55, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

:: See [[Talk:Cookbook#merging_of_type_and_category_pages]]. This is a ''known'' and ''desired'' behavior. Why? It's much easier to maintain the lists via categories (because you maintain them only on the specific recipe page). The lists on the specific pages get horribly out of date and have ''fewer'' recipes than the category pages. True, the category pages are not subdivided, but for most of our '''type''' pages (e.g. salads, stews) this is fine. For breakfast, etc it's a bit more complicated, but there will probably be better resolutions for that kind of page in the future. The sorting is also an issue, but one that should be resolved when we get a proper namespace for the cookbook (there's an open bug for this...). This sort of change is done with an eye on maintainability, and more pages will be like this in the future. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:59, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

:::It was much nicer the way it was before. Look at the Desserts section - it is far easier to use than the Salads page. This is because it is divided into categories - clear, easy to understand and attractive. You don't have to scan through the &quot;C's&quot; if you want a recipe for pudding. Because it is necessary to give recipes individual names because often there are several versions of the same dish available, alphabetical order means very little.  What do &quot;category: salads&quot; &quot;subcategories&quot; and &quot;pages in category salads&quot; mean to the average user who is just looking for a recipe? Have you ever seen another cookbook or another cooking site set up in this manner?[[User:Alcinoe|Alcinoe]] 18:14, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

:::: Some specific technical issues:
::::* [[Cookbook:Desserts]] is a better layout, but consider the fact that it is organizing a different kind of data. It's a fairly high-level category which categorizes a whole range of types of dishes (cakes, cookies, cupcakes), unlike &quot;salad&quot; which is a ''specific'' type of dish. For now, we're only moving the ''type'' pages (think of &quot;cake&quot;, &quot;salad&quot;, &quot;cookies&quot;) into a category structure, so, for instance [[Cookbook:Breakfast]] and [[Cookbook:Dessert]] are '''not''' going to be altered for the forseeable future.
::::* The &quot;old&quot; [[Cookbook:Salad]] page had '''14''' recipes. [[:Category:Salads]] has '''26'''. There have been ''some'' recipes added, but the reason the category is more complete is that each individual recipe can be &quot;tagged&quot; with the correct category w/o having to hand-maintain lists everywhere. Similarly, the [[Cookbook:Dessert]] page has '''70''' recipes, while the category has '''107'''.
::::* The &quot;C&quot; prefix is annoying, I agree, but it is a condition of the (relatively) short-lived lifespan of this version of mediawiki. We should have a proper namespace soon enough and the sorting should work itself out. The problem is that we are using a pseudo-namespace for the titles (&quot;Cookbook:&quot; means nothing special to the mediawiki software).
::::* &quot;category: salads&quot; &quot;subcategories&quot; and &quot;pages in category salads&quot; might not mean much, but it's fairly obvious what the content of those sections are. Also I '''have''' seen a cookbook set up in this way; [http://www.recipezaar.com recipezaar], which I think provides some of the easiest navigation of all recipe sites. Mediawiki needs some improvements to be able to handle category intersections like recipezaar, but that too will occur in time.

== Pork 'n' Ham ==

We currently have [[:Category:Pork recipes]]. Do we need a distinct [[:Category:Ham recipes]], or should the two just get mushed together? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:17, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

: It would probably be best to leave the two apart.  Keeping things that are so specific as ham or bacon apart makes sense because they aren't really inter-changable meats.  You can't substitute a porkchop when the recipe calls for a half pound of bacon.  But it really shouldn't be a problem if they are merged together, just make sure that the recipes in the category are specific as to what cut of meat they need instead of saying flatly &quot;pork&quot;.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 03:54, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== &quot;General&quot; Asian recipes ==

There's [[Cookbook:General Asian cuisines]], which seems like a cop out. &quot;Asian cuisine&quot; should include recipes from Russia, most former Soviet states, most of the Middle East, India, and East Asia, minimally. The category, [[:Category:Asian recipes]] is somewhat better. Anybody feel like reconciling (I don't)? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:19, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

: I can take a look at that this weekend, if someone wants to do it before me that'd be stellar, but otherwise I can run through it.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 03:55, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:No, [[Cookbook:General Asian cuisines]] is perfectly fine. Think about cuisine, not plate techtonics. General Asian cuisine is what you get when you go to the &quot;All-you-can-eat Asian Buffet&quot; in the USA, minus anything that is definitely from one specific Asian country. The general flavors would be those of East Asia, maybe with influences of Southeast Asia, Mongolia, and the Polynesian islands. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:02, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

:: But those are American cuisines, not Asian.  That they use Asian techniques doesn't make them Asian.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 21:14, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

::: You're still thinking about plate techtonics, fault lines, magma movement, and so on. This is an issue of cuisine, not geological processes. The geological definition is useless because it covers everything and nothing, leading to the logical conclusion that general Asian cuisine does not exist. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:41, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

::: Also, while I used &quot;USA&quot; in my example, you may well substitute &quot;Europe&quot; or &quot;International Space Station&quot;. The point is that ''general'' Asian cuisine does not come from a specific Asian country. It's just Asian-like, for a definition of &quot;Asia&quot; that is centered around the eastern part. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:41, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:::: If that is how you want to do it, then there is next to no North American, Canadian, American, Mexican, Brazillian, or any other American-continental cuisines.  They all draw from one of the European or Asian cooking styles.  The national origin of a food is what matters, where it comes from is it's home, not if it's based on the cooking techniques of another nation.  Like with [[Cookbook:Pizza|Pizza]], it's origin is [[:w:Naples|Naples]] - but a [[Cookbook:Deep Dish Pizza|Deep Dish Pizza]] is American, not Italian.  Or anything Creol or Cajun, which are just a modified version of what French cooking is, do they not exist either?  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 17:55, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::Cuisine categories will always be a rough judgement call. Creol and Cajun have greatly diverged from French, though a &quot;'''see also'''&quot; link to French cuisine (and the other way too perhaps) would be appropriate. When in doubt, as with the California Roll sushi, go ahead and use more than one category. The whole point of categories is to help people find things I hope, not to play out odd little wars. So I'd link to General Asian Cuisine from the regular Asian Cuisine page, and I'd link back the other way, and I might link from the California Cuisine page as well. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:27, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

: [[Cookbook:Garlic Pork Chops with Black Mushrooms|Garlic Pork Chops with Black Mushrooms]] has been assigned to California, since the mushroom within only grows along the Rocky Mountains and is pretty uncommon for cooking because of the difficulty of consistantly cultivating it.  I've seen some Australian recipes for it as well, but other than that it is an American product that is cooked in America.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 19:11, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

== Both an ingredient and something to be made ==

How should we name categories for items that will have both recipes ''for'' the item and recipes ''involving'' the item, e.g. barbeque sauce and bread? We have [[:Category:Barbecue recipes]] now, but could conceivably have [[:Category:Barbeque sauce recipes]], which is ambiguous. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:43, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

== Delete multi-parent categories? ==

I think I'd like to do away with most (not necessarily all) categories with multiple parent categories. Examples:
* [[:Category:Barbecued_chicken]]
* [[:Category:Beef_sandwiches]]
* [[:Category:Beef_soups]]
* [[:Category:Beef_stews]]
Reasoning: making categories like this requires that essentially all high level categories be recreated under each ingredient. To make this consistent, virtually every type of dish (appetizers, mains, pies, pot pies, etc etc etc) would need to be created under &quot;beef recipes&quot;.

An appropriate area for multiple-parent categories might be a place where the type of dish is by definition a subcategory of something else. [[:Category:Borscht recipes]] should be a subcategory of both [[:Category:Soup recipes]] and [[:Category:Beet recipes]] because borscht is by definition a beet soup. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:53, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

== Basic foodstuffs ==

(Last one tonight, I promise) What's the purpose of the &quot;Basic Foodstuffs&quot; page/category as opposed to ingredients? I see that [[Cookbook:Basic_foodstuffs]] is fairly high level, but [[:Category:Basic Foodstuffs]] seems very unevenly used, sometimes for very specific things, and other more obvious things seem to be missing (like wheat).

== Adding more nutritional info to the Recipe_Summary template? ==

The Recipe_Summary template seems pretty basic.  It has energy (kj/Cal), but it'd be good to update it to include additional nutritional information, such as:

* amount of fat
* amount of carbs
* total Glycaemic Load  -  [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 14:06, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

: We have a hard enough time getting calories for a dish. I think more complex additions are probably not a good idea at least at this point. We do have a separate nutrition summary template which might be more appropriate for that stuff. That summary is much more complete, but also therefore much more work and much more of a pain in the ass for which to calculate the values. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:19, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:: I agree it's a pain and I expect that a lot of the time it won't be filled in by the original author.  But (in my experience) the nature of wikis is that, if the template has spots available for the information, passersby will tend to fill them in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I, for example, intend to go through the existing recipes and calculate the glycemic load - because that's the bit that interests me.  But at the moment I have nowhere to put the information.  [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 22:14, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

::: I suspect you could make another template that would butt up against the summary for the GI, without needing to go through all the recipes w/ existing summaries and changing them (which due to the nature of mediawiki at the moment, you'd have to do... or get a bunch of ugly crap in every unfilled template...). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:22, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:I think the Recipe_Summary template should be deleted. It's way too hard to fill in. Maybe we could have a template with just one parameter that would make a nice box. You could then add line breaks as desired, along with whatever info you want. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:57, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:: The Recipes_Summary template exists as the backend for the recipesummary one (see [[Cookbook:Policy#Available_Cookbook-Related_Templates]]). If you mean both should be deleted, I disagree. Templates like that encourage standardization and clarity. They maintain a consistent visual appearance throughout the cookbook. As with programming, it may be &quot;hard&quot; at first, but once you get used to it, it's pretty easy. I don't think we can expect first-time users to get everything right from the get-go, and that's why we have more committed contributors do cleanup on their submissions. I don't think a template to produce &quot;a nice box&quot; is all that helpful; we'll end up with a pretty box with the same inconsistent mismash of information that we have right now (or at least had, until recently). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:52, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

::: Do not take this to mean that I think the recipesummary is the end-all for templates and information, but that we should consistently extend it throughout the book if we're going to do that.

::: We sure do have standardization and clarity. It's standard to fill every entry with question marks, which provides clarity of a sort. This isn't being useful. Consistent visual appearance can be had with a very simple template that makes a nice box. Then we can just fill it with keyword-value pairs as we see fit, avoiding all the junk entries for things we have no clue about. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:03, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

::::: Only if we separate the cookbook from wikibooks. Right now we're limited in a few different areas because of the mediawiki software requirements for wikipedia.

We could then mark each ingredient with density, typical cost, typical package sizes for each country, seasonal availability, nutrition, substitutions, restricted diet flags, and so on.

== Table of nutritional information for ingredients? ==

I think it would be a good idea to have a table on nutritional information for ingredients in the cookbook.  If there was a single standardised source for this, it would be easier for people to provide calorie info etc. for their recipes.

== Recent Changes Question ==
There are so many pages here that I'm having difficulty orienting myself to the correct forums for discussion.

Interesting things that now work:
* [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&amp;from=&amp;namespace=102 all pages from the cookbook] (look ma, an automatic index)
* [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?limit=1000&amp;title=Special%3ARecentchanges&amp;namespace=102 recent changes for just the cookbook]
* [[:Category:Recipes|Category:Recipes]] should start being sorted correctly (once each page has an update, I think ... because of how the caching works)
* It shouldn't be necessary to alias the category links on each page any more (in fact, it might be a negative thing to do so if the page gets moved)

Other things:
* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Search?ns102=1&amp;search=chocolate&amp;fulltext=Search  cookbook-limited search for chocolate] doesn't work yet, but should when the search indexes are updated.
* This may affect the [[Talk:Cookbook:Policy|rationale for title case]].

::This is seriously bad. We should not be in a Cookbook namespace. We should be at cookbook.wikibooks.org or similar. Trying to share a wiki keeps hurting us again and again.

:::The Cookbook is an integral part of Wikibooks. Recently there has been a big clean-up campaign on wikibooks, and things are looking better - we're not there yet, but the wiki is improving. The Cookbook will do well as an integral part of wikibooks - It has already been featured as the Book of the Month in March. Once the tidying up of the rest of wikibooks is complete, it will be time to rename all pages in the Cookbook so they begin with &quot;Cookbook/&quot;, just like all other pages in wikibooks and bring the separate cookbook namespace to an end. I can understand why, before the tidying up, there may have been a desire to have a new namespace to separate the cookbook wheat from the wikibooks chaff - but that reason will soon no longer be relevant, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:35, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

:::: Unfortunately it's not the cleanup of the rest of wikibooks that's the problem; it's that there are mediawiki features that are very useful, but which are unavailable to just subpages (read my bulleted list above). A separate wiki, as Albert suggests, is probably the best solution so that the Cookbook can make full use of the available features and extensions to MW. A separate namespace allows us to access some of these features, but as noted above, it did screw up somethings as well.

With the Cookbook: namespace online and functioning, should this page be moved?  Right now, this page is in the &quot;main&quot; namespace, while all the content it links to is in the &quot;Cookbook&quot; namespace.

== Further to a discussion in #wikibooks ==

Hi all.  I may have a vested interest in this, since I am on 2 restricted diets, Gluten &amp; Milk Free, but I think that you may like this.  I have noticed from looking at the recipe index under each category, that you have no (immediate) way of identifying meals as belonging to a restricted diet group, eg. Low Sodium, Low Fat, Gluten Free, Suitable for Diabetics, etc.  

I propose a system of labelling meals in the index using a 2 or 3 letter acronym or sign of some description, which provides immediate guidance to someone on a restricted diet, that the specified meal will be suitable for them to cook.  In all fairness, looking at the index and having to search through every recipe manually, with no immediate identification of its content or suitability, is frankly time consuming.

When I say to identify the recipes, simply add something like these following the name of the recipe:

'''GF''' for Gluten Free

'''MF (or LF)''' for Milk Free or Lactose Free

'''DS''' for Diabetic Suitable

'''RS''' for Reduced Sodium

'''RF''' for Reduced Fat

In fairness, I think also that a pictorial symbol added to the recipe's page, such as pictures of certain foods crossed out, may be needed for people who either cannot read well, or are learning English.

Your views on this idea are most welcome, good or otherwise.  Let's see if we can pull this off.

[[User:Tmalmjursson|Tmalmjursson]] 18:48, 31 January 2006 (UTC) [[User_talk:Tmalmjursson|Talk to Thor]]

: I wonder how could we show reduced sodium food... But I think the idea is good. There already is a section called &quot;Special Diets&quot; on the Cookbook main page, I think we could base on it and create category for most important of these diets. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:00, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

:: When I say reduced sodium for example, I mean meals with Low or Zero added salt, the kind of meals which would be suitable for people with High blood pressure and heart conditions.  Basically, these would be meals where they are cooked with no added salt into them, and we leave it to the consumer of the food to season it according to what they are allowed.  So if a meal has less than one-quarter of a teaspoon of salt, we can mark it as RS, since the amount of added salt is little or none.  Same with reduced fat, like using lean meats, chicken, etc... cooking without butter or excessive amounts of solid fat.  [[User:Tmalmjursson|Tmalmjursson]] 19:24, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

We already have a mechanism for this.  See [[Cookbook:Special Diets]] and [[:Category:Recipes by diet]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 21:24, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
*Yes, Uncle G.  I am aware of the current system, however, I fear it is inadequate for what it does.  Like myself, being Milk &amp; Gluten Free, a better system for categorisation would be to mark the recipes, for example, if you have one which contains neither Gluten or Milk, GF - MF next to the recipe would indicate immediately, a meal which would be suitable on both diets.  I fear that as it stands, if someone posts a recipe like that, we are gonna wind up ultimately with a set of crossover categories, such as *Suitable for Multiple Diets*, or recipes appearing in more than one category under the diets.  &lt;p&gt;As I see this, to identify the recipes like this would provide a clear indication straight away, rather than trawling through the categories to find one which matches all dietary needs.  [[User:Tmalmjursson|Tmalmjursson]] 23:16, 31 January 2006 (UTC) [[User_talk:Tmalmjursson|Talk to Thor]]
**The recipes ''are'' marked, by dint of being in the categories.  And there's nothing wrong with a recipe being in multiple categories if it qualifies for multiple diets.  The entries ''in the [[Cookbook:Recipes|index]]'' aren't marked.  (That's a subject for [[Cookbook talk:Recipes]].)  But the recipes ''themselves'' are.  Now there is scope for improvement.  (For example: We could create a system of template tags that expand to a category and to an image, and tag recipes using those instead of adding the categories explicitly.)  But the basic mechanism for the recipes themselves is already there. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 00:32, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
***I agree that ultimately there is nothing wrong with having recipes in multiple categories, but when it comes to hunting the recipes out for suitability, searching one category is no prob, but then having to go see if that recipe appears in a second or even third category is gonna be a nightmare in my opinion.  You say there is scope there for improvement, through this template thing.  What proposal would you have in mind to organise under that system?  More to the point, would you like me to transfer this section to [[Cookbook talk:Recipes]]? [[User:Tmalmjursson|Tmalmjursson]] 01:25, 1 February 2006 (UTC) [[User_talk:Tmalmjursson|Talk to Thor]]
:::: Uncle G is correct; you are suggesting that we should duplicate the category information into the names of the pages, which is unnecessary. What you ''really'' want is a set-intersection view of categories. The current mediawiki implementation does not do this, but I believe it is being worked on by the development group. Though it's unappealing since we'd all like to have the ideal cookbook ''now'', I suggest you '''wait''' for category intersection. What you are proposing as a stand in requires duplicated effort and could end up being bad/annoying in most cases ([[Cookbook:Boiled Chicken GF LF DS]]). There is one exception I think where having that sort of naming ''is'' useful, and that is when you have recipes for the same item which are substantial variations based upon diet. We already do this for vegan recipes: [[Cookbook:Chili]] and [[Cookbook:Chili (Vegan)]]. So recipes like [[Cookbook:Chili (Reduced Fat)]] or [[Cookbook:Brownies (Gluten-Free)]] make sense to me. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt;

:For trivial or generic changes like &quot;low sodium&quot;, let the cook sort it out. For less obvious recipe-specific substitutions, add a note to the &quot;variations&quot; section. For big changes like &quot;vegan meatloaf&quot;, create a new recipe. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:58, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

::: Hrm, I'm not so sure about the notice that gets printed (since it'll be on essentially ''every'' page)... maybe if you selected a set of otherwise excellent recipes for &quot;photo work&quot;.

: If your recipe is a substantial variant (largely different ingredient proportions, etc) which aims for a different result (say, fudge brownies over cake brownies) then you should make a new page and find some way of distinguishing it (e.g. [[Cookbook:Fudge Brownies]]).

== IMPROVED! Recipe summary template ==

{{recipesummary|
| Category    = Meat recipes
| Servings    = 1-2
| Time        = 30 minutes
| Rating      = 3
| Difficulty  = Medium
| Energy      = 100 Cal (400 kJ)
| Image       = [[Image:Hamburger_sandwich.jpg|300px]]
| Noincludecat  = Any value here means to not include this page in the category.
}}
The recipe summary template has been drastically improved. All parameters to the template are now optional, so empty values will no longer display as nasty wikicode, and we do not need to have &quot;? Calories&quot; in everything. ALSO! There is now room for an image, so you can put an image right above the summary. You can find examples at [[:Template:Recipesummary/Examples]].

==Ingredients ==

I've noticed each ingredient has its own category of recipes, ive been starting the same in the bartending book, to make things easier i made {{tl|vodka}} etc which is used in the ingredient section to add a link to the ingredient's page and it also inserts the category. Saves time and keeps all the links pointing to the right place and categories. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 22:42, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

== Recipe identifiers ==

At the suggestion of [[User:Kellen|Kellen]], I'm bringing this up: I have made two templates so far as recipe indicators. I was thinking that they'd be a quick way for someone too tell if a recipe can fit into their diet. This would work for veganism, vegetarianism (with various degrees, most likely), kosher diets, halal diets, and such. It could also work to say &quot;This recipe has gluten!&quot; or &quot;This recipe has milk!&quot; (Because it'd be easier in the something-free diets to do it like that.)

{{Vegan recipe}}
{{Vegetarian recipe (milk)}}

Thoughts? [[User:Soviet Dolphin|Soviet Dolphin]] 22:14, 10 March 2006 (UTC) [[User:Soviet Dolphin|Soviet Dolphin]]

I like them. Is there a list you're working from for the various categories of recipes that need these little info boxes? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 09:50, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

: I'm not sure about the need to distinguish veg-milk, veg-eggs, etc. Maybe we should just haev &lt;nowiki&gt;{{vegan}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{vegetarian}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (and gluten-free, whatever else you want) - these could automagically include the recipe in the appropriate category as well. If we wanted to get over-fancy, this sort of stuff could be integrated into the recipesummary. The advantage of that would be the consolidation of all that information in a single place, but the downside is of course that it requires a fancy template and knowledge of how to use it. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:10, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

:: I'm not so good with fancy templates, I'm afraid. I would think that these could just be applied in a separate box down the page a bit; I've been choosing the procedure section to host them. I think we could possibly avoid have a specific &quot;vegetarian with eggs&quot; and &quot;vegetarian with milk&quot; and what-have-you, but we'd need to have warnings. Probably red boxes with warnings like: &quot;This product contains milk&quot;, &quot;this product contains eggs&quot;, &quot;this product contains gluten and eggs&quot;. That could be complicated, though, and it might be better to just apply more, uh, solid identifiers for now? Vegan, kosher, halal, et cetera? [[User:Soviet Dolphin|Soviet Dolphin]] 19:12, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

::: Well I could easily do the writing of the template if it was decided it was a good idea. Don't you think if someone is a vegetarian or vegan, they'll be smart enough to read the ingredients (3 inches away from the box) to see if there is milk or eggs? I almost think the boxes are redundant in that respect. I think that ''categorization'' of recipes is key, though, since this is what helps vegetarians/vegans find the recipes in the first place.

:This is something that would require a bot. Without a bot, adding or editing a recipe becomes very painful. Please prefix the names with something like '''BotControlled-''' so that nobody feels they have to add 42 different templates whenever they add a recipe.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:49, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

::Bot or not, I'm supportive of at least the concept. Is it possible to implement it, and let it slowly take hold? While a bot won't be perfect (and for vegan and kosher, it won't work at all), at least it will be a start. Then, we could have a bot put pages with the tag under the appropriate categories, if needed. Why don't we give it a shot? [[User:Scytheml|Scytheml]] 05:19, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== Separate Cookbooks Wiki ==

Should we attempt to persuade wikimedia to move the Cookbook to its own wiki intallation, perhaps at cookbook.wikibooks.org? Over the cookbook's short history, we've had a number of problems which arise from us sharing a wiki with the rest of wikibooks and which have only partially been resolved by bugfixes and the cookbook namespace. Reasons we might want a separate wiki installation:
* Turn off case-insensitive first letters (t versus T for teaspoon and tablespoon)
* Cookbook-only standard wiki features (uncategorized pages, recent changes, search, all pages, etc)
* Turn on extensions that wikimedia developers are unwilling to use wikibooks-wide (e.g. DynamicPageLists)
* Build-in navigation to the wiki theme, so we don't do this by hand
Reasons why we might not want a separate wiki:
* We probably gain contributors from random wikibooks users looking at recentchanges or browsing the frontpage
* More work for wikimedia people

If there is sufficient interest, I'm willing to put in some effort at meta to get us a separate wiki. It would probably be useful for other contributors to help out as well. For myself; I think that the usage model for the cookbook is sufficently different than wikipedia and the rest of wikibooks to warrant a separate wiki (more of a search and category-browse than a follow-links-between-related articles model). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:45, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

:I really don't see (m)any benefits at all. MediaWiki will mean your first issue will apply regardless of whether you are part of wikibooks or not. On the second point, most of those cookbook-specific features don't need to be cookbook-specific - eg it is easy to check which orphaned pages are cookbook only pages as they all start with &quot;Cookbook&quot; and are listed in alphabetical order.

:To the benefits of staying in wikibooks you should add that there is an existing group of wikibookians aiding the cookbook. That transwikis of cookbook-related info come to wikibooks. That by being part of a larger whole there are more visitors to the cookbook. And Wikibooks is well established.

::Case-sensitivity is a MediaWiki config option. In cooking, it is a very strong tradition to use &quot;t&quot; for teaspoon but &quot;T&quot; for tablespoon. Having a separate wiki does not prevent sharing of common pages. (not that that would be terrible though) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:15, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
Is it? As a reader, I'd find this confusing, whilst abbreviations such as tbsp and tsp are not. Besides, I hardly think trying to arrange a permanent split is worthwhile for minutiae like that. I still think that the cookbook would do better by attaching itself more to wikibooks and working within a larger hole. One thing that could usefully done is to rename all the pages so they begin with &quot;Cookbook/&quot; rather than &quot;Cookbook:&quot; and get rid of the separate namespace, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:31, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
:::OK, you're not yet an experienced cook. We'll fix that. :-) The &quot;t&quot; vs. &quot;T&quot; distinction has been popular over many many decades, if not centuries.

: We just got the namespace activated very recently, and it has cleared up some problems we had before (and which would return if we moved to &quot;Cookbook/&quot;), specifically:
:* Sorting of pages in categories is now automatic (without a namespace, everything is sorted under &quot;C&quot; for cookbook)
:* Cookbook-limited search
:* Having AllPages for the Cookbook only is especially useful since a lot of our time was used building indexes, which we don't need to do now
:* We're able to use the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; macro and get the actual name of the recipe w/o the &quot;Cookbook:&quot;
:* We're able to have cookbook-only recentchanges (this makes sense for every book on WB, actually)
:As I said above, this still doesn't allow us to do certain things, which are technically possible (with current MW software and extensions), but not in line with the desires of the wikimedia admins for wikibooks as a whole, specifically:
:* DynamicPageLists (or similar) for lists of recipes from certain categories included on a page
:* Case sensitivity
:* Upping the 1000 page limit on some Specialpages, which currently prevents any cookbook-specific work from being done.

I think the recent clean-ups help - and many of the other things you identify are small, but not significant aids. Addressing in turn:

:*It is possible to sort categories alphabetically by the device of, for example, adding mock turtle soup to a soup category by entering &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Soups|Mock turtle soup]] or [[Category:Soups|M]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. OK, it's slightly longer, but it works.
:*This can be done, if necessary, using google. Also, I'm not convinced that it is difficult to search for things more generally. OK &quot;carrot&quot; may appear in the gardening section rather than the Cookbook. On the flip side, as currently organised, if I search for &quot;carrot&quot; as someone unfamiliar with the point that I should tick to search in a particular namespace, I'm never going to find any carrot recipes.
:*Doesn't search under the prefix index of &quot;Cookbook&quot; solve this (or searching for all pages beginning with &quot;Cookbook/&quot;?
:*A minor convenience.
:*It's easy enough to search recent changes for the word &quot;cookbook&quot;. In terms of identifying vandalism, there are many non-cookbook contributors also doing that.
:*I don't know what DynamicPageLists are
:*I'm confused by this case sensitivity point - could you explain
:*Isn't this now resolved after the recent clean-ups? Mind you, a separate namespace is a hindrance here, as orphaned cookbook pages can't be easily found now.

:In short, whilst there are some small editing benefits in having a separate namespace, I believe these are outweighed by the greater audience available through full integration with wikibooks - and by the additional editorial and maintenance help available through this, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:23, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

::The point of us having a namespace or a separate wiki is that these are '''technical problems''' that are solved by '''technical solutions'''. We shouldn't have to compromise or do ridiculous amounts of extra work to get around these things.
::* Having to &quot;pipe rename&quot; every category link is a waste of time and error prone. It works, but it's not a good or clean solution. The cookbook uses a very large number of categories when compared with every other book, so this is a big issue for us. 
::* Searching with Google is stupid, if we have a search box on the page already. People shouldn't have to search for something prefixed with &quot;Cookbook&quot; to find recipes. Sure, they can, but they shouldn't have to.
::* An automatic index is '''NOT''' a minor convenience. We seriously have spent more time creating and maintaining indexes than we have writing recipes, which is totally unacceptable. As you can see, the relatively simple creating of a cookbook-specific namespace has relieved us of at least dealing with a cookbook-wide index.
::* DynamicPageLists are a way for us to get set-intersection views of our categories (e.g. All recipes in both &quot;fruit recipes&quot; and &quot;dessert recipes&quot;). They are an extension to media wiki which the developers are ''unwilling'' to turn on wikibooks-wide. These would be another tool so that we did not have to hand-maintain indexes.
::* Case sensitivity is the ability for us to distinguish between &quot;Cookbook:t&quot; and &quot;Cookbook:T&quot;. These have different meanings in the context of our recipes.
::* No, this is not resolved. Please see [[Special:Uncategorizedpages]]. You will notice that ''at maximum'' you can see 1000 results.  You will also notice that ''no'' cookbook pages show up there. You ''cannot'' page beyond this limit. This is limited by the wikimedia installation supposedly for some performance reasons (though I don't really buy that), but in any case, getting us off wikibooks would give us more control and separate our uncategorizedpages from the rest of WB, which is generally uncategorized at all.
::I do agree that we benefit from wikibooks admins and its general community, but the problems listed make it much more difficult for us to develop our content in a productive way, or indeed to maintain it in many ways. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:26, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
: It sounds like good idea to get the Cookbook it's own mediawiki installation, but it should be done without turning it into a separate project. Like you said, put it under cookbook.wikibooks.org and emphasize that it's still a wikibook. We might be be able to set a precedent for other wikibooks or bookshelves that are growing too big and getting special needs. I can see a biology wikibook growing into a massive biological reference that could use it's own wiki environment. Come to think of it, the WikiJunior folk have been thinking about getting their own wiki too. If wikibooks allows books their own wiki, there's no need for anybody to apply for a new project (which the cookbook probably wouldn't get) and we could maybe even keep the procedure for this inside wikibooks (instead of voting on meta). 
:I also see a danger of people forking the cookbook out of wikibooks (and wikimedia) entirely and starting under it's own management if we don't get our own wiki, which would be a shame. Long story short, I'm for. [[User:Risk|risk]] 14:41, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

Having looked at the cookbook in more detail, I am now ready to reply further. Responding to Kellen's points in turn:

:* It would be possible to have a bot do the &quot;pipe renaming&quot; you refer to. This should make the exercise (1) quick; (2) not be error prone. Going forward, it will be easier to remember to pipe rename and easy to spot where this has not happened. As you note it works. This may not be ideal, but neither should it take much time to organise (certainly it'd be a lot quicker than getting the Wikimedia Foundation to agree to a new project!)
:* It should be possible to search through browsing from the main cookbook page. If this is not possible, then the cookbook page should be redesigned so that it is possible. I must admit, I'm a bit confused by this one - I though that was what the categorisation system was doing. 
:* Can you show me what you mean by an index? To me, the list of all pages beginning with &quot;Cookbook/&quot; would give you every page in the cookbook. Am I missing something?
:* Could we not persuade the developers to turn on DynamicPageLists for Wikibooks? It may be worth raising on the Staff Lounge. I can't see it benefiting other books, but neither can I see it being a problem. If it's helpful for the cookbook, I'd therefore support introducing it. Also, it seems to me as though it may be useful once we have improved the categorisation system of wikibooks as a whole.
:* Although not convinced by your case sensitivity point, I'd note that if the cookbook were returned to the main namespace, this issue would be resolved, and you would be able to distinguish between &quot;Cookbook/T&quot; and &quot;Cookbook/t&quot;. It is having the cookbook in its own namespace that eliminates this functionality.
:* Is the only problem with the [[Special:Uncategorizedpages]] page? If so, this could be resolved by categorising all pages beginning in letters A, B and C so that the cookbook pages then appear. I'd be happy to help with this task myself if it would clear things up. If not, could you outline what other problems there are?
:* I note that we are in agreement that there are benefits of the cookbook being part of wikibooks.
At present, persuading the Wikimedia Foundation to open a new project is a non-starter. If you garner enough support, and they approve it, we are still looking at a year off at least. Also, it will be difficult to persuade them of the need. Whether it is for the short-term or the long-term, the cookbook will be staying on wikibooks.

This leaves open the question of how it should fit into wikibooks. Surely it should be just another book (albeit one of our best ones, and promoted that way)? Surely it should fit in more - and how many Cookbook contributors are, for example, sysops at present, or contribute regularly to wikibooks discussions, votes and the staff lounge? (Some, but no doubt, not as many as we'd like to see). 

In my view, it would be better to move the cookbook from the current namespace. This would not only give the cookbook the right &quot;feel&quot; for wikibooks, it would also allow us to get the special pages working for the cookbook articles as well as other articles (perhaps by some further tidying up first). It would resolve the case sensitivity point. It would also allow us to get rid of the ghost pages you can see at the end of the Cookbook &quot;allpages&quot;. Another benefit would be that the cookbook modules would count fully in our module count - at present, the cookbook contributes only 1, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:42, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

:I have to disagree. There have been many improvements to the functioning of the Cookbook by moving it to its own namespace. Cookbook enabled search, recent changes, and new pages make the job of editing the cookbook much simpler. The namespace gives the Cookbook project many of the benefits of a seperate wiki, while still benefiting from being an integral part of the english language Wikibooks. To reply to your points:

:*It was possible for people to hand pipe trick categories or run a bot to do it automatically before we moved to our own namespace, yet it rarely happened. I personally have spent many hours category sorting recipes, and the backlog never seemed to get shorter. Additionally, if a page is moved to another title, the pipe sorting would have to be redone, while it is automatic under the Cookbook: namespace. The functionality of categories under the namespace system is far superior to what it was, or what it will return to, without the namespace.
:*It's not feasable to list all the pages in this book from the main Cookbook page. There are hundreds of ingredient pagess, dozens of cuisine pagess, scores of cooking equipment pages, and perhaps thousands of recipes here. Automatic searches of just the Cookbook namespace is more useful than even the best designed category browsing technique. If I had a dead-tree recipe with an ingredient I didn't know, such as an [[Cookbook:aubergine|aubergine]], and came to the Wikibooks Cookbook for help (which I think is part of our goal here) and I didn't know an aubergine is a vegetable (which is quite possible for people not familiar with British food terms), I'd never find it using categories (especially as the module is titled under the American term [[Cookbook:eggplant|eggplant]], and wouldn't appear in the category as aubergine anyway). (Maybe we should consider putting a search box on the main page that searches just the Cookbook namespace?)
:*As I stated in the last point, a list of all the Cookbook pages would be quite large. If you want to see a hand made index, look at [[Cookbook:Recipes]]. The automated recipe index is at [[:Category:Recipes]]. There are also indecies for [[Cookbook:Ingredients]] ([[:Category:Ingredient]]), and other types of cookbook content.
:*As I'm sure you know, features that are requested by Wikibooks and the other sister projects tend to have a lower priority than those requested by Wikipedia. However, as the basic functioning of categories would not significantly change if the Cookbook moved to the subpage model (although they would become less usefull by all being sorted under &quot;C&quot; until pipe sorting was applied), I don't think this is a point for or against either system.
:*The T/t thing is really a minor annoyance. A page at [[Cookbook:T]] that explained that capital T stands for tablespoon and lowercase t stands for teaspoon would solve the problem almost as efficiently as seperate &quot;T&quot; and &quot;t&quot; pages did. I tend to type out Tbsp and tsp, so I'm personally not that interested in this little issue.
:*The problem is with all the special pages. [[Special:Shortpages]], [[Special:Deadendpages]], etc, all become less useful for the Cookbook if it is returned to the main namespace (and would be less useful to everyone working on non-Cookbook content, as well, as the large number of Cookbook pages would push the other pages further down the list).
:*I too agree that the Cookbook and Wikibooks as a whole both benefit from the Cookbook being an integrated part of Wikibooks. The extra admin and editor eyes on RC helps, as does the &quot;wandering around and found this&quot; factor. I believe it is a two way street, that both benefit from the close integration.
:There are other benefits, used and unused, to seperate namespaces for large and well developed projects. Although we don't do it right now, it is possible to change the global .css files to customize the Cookbook namespaces, leaving the others alone. Each book is different, and can benefit from different formatting or layouts. While this could be done with html and css coding on the pages themselves, it would have to be done on every page, would not automatically update if changes were made, and could not be customized by users modifying their own stylesheets.

:Some very active users and administrators have &quot;cut their teeth&quot; in the Cookbook. This book is very approachable for Wikipedia users, as 1) everyone eats, and 2) this book is much more loosely organized than most Wikibooks. It is the single largest Wikibook, with its own policies and procedures, its own featured content, and its own culture, all within the overall community of Wikibooks. Our presence in the mainstream Wikibooks along with our level of autonomy lets new editors who find us from the 'pedia feel more comfortable in the project, while still showcasing the differences between 'books and the 'pedia.

:The issue about the module count is trivial. I don't edit here so that our brag sheet can look more impressive. What really matters is the quality of our content, not the quantity of database entries we have. We could have a million pages, but if they were garbage, no one would care. I'd suggest that if it is really important to boost the module count, someone should submit a bug fix requesting that all even namespace ids over 100 are included in the module count. This would capture Cookbook content, as well as any new namespaces that are developed.

:In summary, right now, I believe the benefits to both the readers and the editors from the Cookbook remaining in its own namespace as a part of the english language Wikibooks far exceed the benefits of spliting into our own wiki or returning to the main namespace.

== Seasonality ==

I've been thinking about adding seasonality information (what's in season when) to recipe pages, but it seems like something that should be done right from the start, so I thought I'd bring it up here, to see if anybody has ideas or other input. Ideas so far:
* A seasonality article explaining why seasonality is important and all the details.
* A category for winter, spring, summer, autumn and 'all year' to group ingredients by season.
* A template that generates a 'bar' based on values of 1 to 5 for each month, to show how much the ingredient is in season each month. There's probably some way to make this highlight the current month as well.
* A small paragraph describing the exact seasonality.
* Separate pages containing seasonality tables for various food groups (like [http://www.rivercottage.net/whatsgoodnow/seasonalitytable.jsp?foodgroup=0 this]). This could just be the bars from the second point, in a long list. On the other hand, in the name of formatting according to the meaning of the data, it might be better to make it a table with some css, to make it look nice.
* It might be nice to feature ingredients that are in season

One thing I haven't figured out yet is how much seasonality is linked to location. If asparagus are in season from april to june in Europe and North America, they should be in season from around october to december in Australia and South America. Since wikibooks is an international site, we really can't count on our visitors all being American and European. This might mean the seasonality information would have to be split by hemisphere as well. [[User:Risk|risk]] 17:35, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

:Location only matters to people who insist on buying local in-season foods for cost reduction, freshness, or enviromentalism. The rest of use eat everything year round, taking full advantage of modern greenhousees and airplanes. Variety is important in the diet, even in winter. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:56, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
::Especially in winter. Though I'd say there's plenty of variety in seasonal produce. I can see I'll need to present two sides to the issue on the Seasonality page. [[User:Risk|risk]] 14:23, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
:Ideally you'd mark ingredients, then have the software automatically propagate this to the recipes. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:56, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
::That sounds like a pretty big 'ideally'. Maybe DynamicPageList can be hacked to do that somehow, but I thinkI'll hold off on grading recipes for now. [[User:Risk|risk]] 14:23, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

I've thrown together two templates to use on the ingredient pages:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Seasonality|Strawberries|=
             |1|1|1|1|1|3|3|2|2|1|1|1}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Displays a table for strawberries. The southern hemisphere is automatically rotated 6 months.
{{Seasonality|Strawberries|=
             |1|1|1|1|1|3|3|2|2|1|1|1}}
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{SeasonalitySpec|Asparagus|=
                 |1|1|1|1|1|3|3|2|2|1|1|1|=
                 |1|1|1|1|1|3|3|2|2|1|1|1}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Allows users to enter the information spearately based on hemisphere (just in case that's ever needed).
{{SeasonalitySpec|Asparagus|=
                 |1|1|1|1|1|3|3|2|2|1|1|1|=
                 |1|1|1|1|1|3|3|2|2|1|1|1}}

I'm fairly new to all this template business, so I haven't quite figured out how to make it highlight the current month (with darker background for the cells). The colors could also use some tweaking, but this is the basic functionality I was thinking of. [[User:Risk|risk]] 14:23, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

: I think you have to use a combination of [[Template:Qif]] and the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTMONTH}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; variable. It gets really dirty really quick, though, because there's not an effective (to my knowledge) looping mechanism, so you have to have a qif for each month you want to highlight.

== Move [[:Category:Recipes]] to [[:Category:Recipe]] ==

I think I am going to move all recipes from [[:Category:Recipes]] to [[:Category:Recipe]]. I will do this by altering the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template. My reason for doing this is to allow the recipe subcategories to show up on fewer category pages. Alternatively, if there are objections, I could move the subcategories of [[:Category:Recipes]] to a different parent category. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:56, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

: Eh scratch that. Instead I think I shall leave the giant index (generated by &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;) in [[:Category:Recipes]] and move the navigational categories into [[:Category:Recipes by...]] or some such category to make the whole navigation easier. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:08, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

== Cookbook redirects deleted ==

We just had a bunch of redirects deleted. See [[Special:Log/Delete]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:29, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

:That's right. I am removing those that are not linked to by any article, taking care not to destroy any links. This should allow for better navigation and easier maintenance of the articles in the Cookbook (if we didn't take this approach, by now we'd have more redirects on Wikibooks than articles, which just makes things difficult to look up and monitor), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:21, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

:: While I appreciate your hard work in keeping wikibooks tidy, it should be obvious that a good number of the cookbook-related redirects were created with the explicit purpose of making editing '''easier'''. This is especially the case with plural forms and pages with differing lettercases. This is a change that I think warrants a post here at least, and some amount of discussion. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:42, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

::Please undelete them. I added many of them when I discovered that we were getting duplicate articles. It sucks to put lots of effort into writing a nice article, then discover later that the article already exists. You may also find a couple deliberately unused disambiguation pages, like &quot;Tomato Sauce&quot; (which I will not link), that instruct the reader to fix the referring pages. Those pages are useful. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:27, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

----

Redirects tend to encourage duplicate articles. For example, suppose that &quot;Cookbook:Apple pie&quot;, &quot;Cookbook:Apple pies&quot;, and &quot;Cookbook:Apple Pies&quot; all redirect to [[Cookbook:Apple Pie]], and users are making links to all four.

Then when users want to add Cherry Pie, they will make red links to &quot;Cookbook:Cherry pie&quot;, &quot;Cookbook:Cherry pies&quot;, &quot;Cookbook:Cherry Pie&quot;, and &quot;Cookbook:Cherry Pies&quot;; then we might get two to four cherry pie recipes instead of one.

:That is '''''exactly what was happening'''''. Adding redirects put a stop to this problem. Many of the redirects were added before the articles they pointed to. For example, if I spotted a cherry pie link, I'd add the redirects immediately -- even if there was no recipe. This worked great. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:58, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

However, those redirects are still far more useful than having &quot;Cookbook/Apple Pie&quot;, &quot;Apple Pie&quot;, and &quot;Apple Pie (Cookbook)&quot; being redirects. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:20, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

: Your pie example is less the issue than ones such as for ingredients (&quot;Kiwi&quot; &quot;Kiwis&quot; &quot;Kiwi Fruit&quot; &quot;Kiwi Fruits&quot;, etc). Not all of the recipes need multiple namings, but many basic types do. We have an abundance of duplicate recipes for precisely this reason. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:09, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[User:Eadmund]]'s edits ==

Eadmund was a user who for a short period of time made an attempt to change articles to conform to his/her preference. Some of these were useful such as spelling fixes, some of these neutral such as changing Tablespoon to Tbsp. but some of these were disruptive such as removing metric measurements from recipes. I have quickly gone through Eadmund's contributions most disruptive ones have already been reverted or modified. However there were a few more I carried out, but I have discussed all my changes in the respective talk pages. There were two I did not modify but perhaps others would feel differently. Specifically [[Cookbook:Lasagne with bean sauce]] he/she added 15 oz. to 1 can of navy beans. [[Cookbook:Pumpkin Scones]] he/she changed whatever in to &quot;other squash&quot;. In both cases, I felt these edits were acceptable.

Note that as I pointed out some of Eadmund's edits were useful or neutral. However in a number of cases, his/her edits were completely reverted. This should be a lesson to people. Don't be disruptive or all you useful work might come to naught as well. If you're making changes to a substial number of articles and these are not spelling mistakes, you should discuss these changes first. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 14:30, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

== This page is not in the Cookbook namespace ==

I just kinda realized this, but the this page, the main page and table of contents for the Cookbook, is not in the Cookbook: namespace. I think this page should be moved to [[Cookbook:Main Page]], [[Cookbook:Main]] or [[Cookbook:Table of Contents]], or something similar. Any preferences, other nominations, or disenting opinions? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 04:22, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
: &quot;Main Page&quot; seems to be the standard for the wikimedia projects; I'd be okay with that. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:11, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

== Suggested rename of pages ==

I'd like to suggest renaming all the pages of the Cookbook so that they begin with &quot;Cookbook/&quot; rather than &quot;Cookbook:&quot;. This would also mean the end of the cookbook namespace. The benefits of this would include:

#Making the cookbook consistent with the naming convention used elsewhere in Wikibooks - and the cookbook feel more like a wikibook as a result.
#A number of the Special pages, such as the Orphaned modules pages would then work for the Cookbook.
#It would also be possible, through categorising other pages, to get Special:Uncategorised pages to work.
#Cookbook modules would count towards Wikibooks' module count.
#The Cookbook would be able to have modules that do not begin with a capital letter. I have had it suggested that [[Cookbook:T]] should really be called [[Cookbook:t]]. Well, although it can't be called that, [[Cookbook/t]] would work.

I also note that there are few real benefits in having the cookbook in a separate namespace in Wikibooks. Some have suggested that the cookbook should move to a separate wiki so that more of the Special clean-up pages can work to aid editors, but this has nothing to do with the cookbook as part (or whilst it is part) of wikibooks. Also if there are MediaWiki featured that are not turned on on Wikibooks, but which would help the cookbook, provided they would not screw up any other part of wikibooks, we could turn these on.

Any move would be bot driven, so would take up little time. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:56, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

: I'd really rather not have that happen. That the special pages, uncategorized pages, etc don't work are bugs in the mediawiki software and we should file bugs to have them fixed. To me, the benefits of having a namespace outweigh the drawbacks. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:00, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

What are these benefits? (I'm afraid I still don't understand what they are meant to be) [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:10, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

: Seriously? Read [[Talk:Cookbook#Separate_Cookbooks_Wiki]] again. Me, Albert, and Gentgeen, all of us major cookbook contributors, agree on this point. I appreciate that you're trying to clean up wikibooks, but you've made no contributions to the cookbook, and indeed have caused problems by deleting redirects which have still not been undeleted despite requests by cookbook contributors. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:07, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

: For reference, the redirects I am referring to were deleted on April 18, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;limit=1000&amp;offset=5000&amp;type=&amp;user=Jguk&amp;page= log here]. While they may have been unused, they were not useless. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:16, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

That was about the possibility of having a separate Wikimedia wiki for the cookbook, wasn't it? I can't see much in there about benefits of having the cookbook on a separate namespace in wikibooks. There is talk of a case sensitivity issue (which only exists ''because'' the cookbook is in a separate namespace). The &quot;sorting of pages&quot; issue is easily dealt with by a bot. The other points seem very minor.

I would add that, whilst at present the naming convention has not yet been applied to all existing books, it is only a matter of time before the Cookbook is the only one not complying with the slash convention. Should the cookbook really be an outlier rather than an integral part of Wikibooks.

Incidentally, I'm not sure which of the redirects you believe should be readded. I'm sure you are not saying all of them were valuable. They can be by yourself, but if you give an indication as to which ones are considered valuable, I will undelete, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 14:23, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

: The redirects between [[Cookbook:Poppy seeds]] and [[Cookbook:African horned melon]]. As reported above, these were created for the explicit purpose of avoiding duplicate articles. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:53, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

::Related to Jguk's original point, I feel the benefits to having the Cookbook as its own namespace far outweigh any possible benefits that would come with the subpage naming scheme. Forcing every project into a particular mold is rather un-wiki in my opinion, and should really be stopped Wikibooks wide. Organized, active, and mature projects should be granted a wide ammount of autonomy, including book-specific policies, guidelines, and style guides. The Cookbook has all of these in place, and to abandon them at this time would be a major step in the wrong direction. If anything should change, it is that more bood specific namespaces should be established for projects that reach a critical mass of activity. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 08:35, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

:::I'd be grateful if you'd list out what you consider the benefits of a separate namespace to be, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:53, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

:Kellen, the problem I have with that discussion is that it is intertwined with discussions on the virtues (or otherwise) of having an entirely separate wiki. I'd be grateful if you would list out what the perceived benefits (and disadvantages) are of having the cookbook on a separate namespace in Wikibooks compared with having it in the main module namespace in Wikibooks. Thanks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:45, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

Thanks, Gentgeen. And I hope others feel free to add or alter this table if something is missed. I do feel a number of the benefits of subpages are being missed, including:

*Availability of Special: features, such as orphaned and uncategorised pages to help with administrtaion;
*Being more noticeable, and getting more attention, from readers (particularly those browsing &quot;Allpages&quot;);
*Being more noticeable, and getting more attention, from Wikibook tidy-uppers and admins;
*Being fully integrated into Wikibooks;
*Having all your modules count to the &quot;good&quot; page count, rather than being included as &quot;bad&quot; pages (which indicate the amount of non-article pages on a wiki)

I also disagree with some of the pros of having a separate namespace. The search function works perfectly well if you search for your &quot;item&quot; by typing in &quot;Book title/ item&quot;. There is even the added benefit of the possibility of some related pages, perhaps on gardening, appearing too. Also, a search on google can easily be restricted to the book in question. Would it be helpful to expand [[Help:Navigating#Searching|Help:Searching]] to outline how this can be done? Recent changes could be checked by adding every recipe to a single category - alternatively we could put on bugzilla a request for functionality to restrict recent changes to items with a given prefix (or alternatively functionality of that everything within the same book title is automatically added to a category, perhaps [[:Category:Pages in Book title]], allowing recent changes to be found by using &quot;related changes&quot;). This would also benefit all other wikibooks.

As far as monobooks are concerned, not being able to program them myself, I do not understand what can be done with them - but is it not possible to ask the monobook to change everything beginning with Cookbook/ in the same way as it is possible to change everything beginning with Cookbook:?

It strikes me that if these issues can be ironed out, there would no longer be any benefit to having a separate namespace, and that the benefits of reuniting the cookbook with the rest of Wikibooks would be worth the effort of a move, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 14:52, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

: Jguk, you are correct that &quot;if these issues can be ironed out, there would no longer be any benefit to having a separate namespace&quot;. We don't want a separate namespace; we want the features that it enables us to have. Given the fact that the mediawiki programmers are more focused on wikipedia than wikibooks, having a namespace is the most effective way (short of moving all content to a separate mediawiki installation) to have these features dealt with so we can get on with actually working on the book. Of your list of benefits, the only one that's actually important to me is that the special pages do not all work properly for non-main namespaces; '''this is a bug in the mediawiki software''' and should be fixed as such. With respect to your comments on the search; in software we call your solution a ''workaround'' -- something that works around ''a bug or defect'' in the software -- the normal search is useless to the cookbook and only becomes useful if limited to a namespace. Your solution is unacceptable for readers of the book; we as contributors might know to take the steps you describe, but they're not intuitive for casual users. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:38, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::I think this leads us to two &quot;bugs&quot; that we can request be fixed: (1) We would like to be able to restrict the results on recent changes to pages with a user-defined prefix (in this case &quot;Cookbook&quot;); (2) We would like to be able to restrict the results coming out of a search query to pages with a user-defined prefix. Additionally, I could add a third (3) Where Special:Prefixindex gives a result that does not fit on one page, the continuation button changes the prefix by reference to which the list is given (ie you do not get a continuation of the list, but instead normally just one page coming up). If the first two were fixed, we could return the cookbook to the main namespace. Additionally, they would potentially benefit every other book on here (and presumably on other Wikibooks).

::If people could check over those two/three fix proposals, I will then list them as a fix request for Wikibooks and argue that they are prioritorised, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:17, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::: If the goal is to use subpages (and I don't agree that should be the goal), my list would be more like:
:::# Make all special pages for a prefix (search, recentchanges, allpages, uncategorizedpages, newpages, etc, etc, etc)
:::# Option to sort categories by &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; automagically
:::# Ability to customize the theme of the book
::: Alternatively, the Cookbook is kept in its own namespace and we do:
:::# Make all special pages work for a namespace (some already do work)
:::# Option to sort categories by &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; automagically
:::# Make cookbook (or other arbitrary) namespace show up in module counts, allpages, etc.
::: These are pretty similar, except that '''some crucial special pages already work for a namespace''' and the bugfixes are ''much'' more likely to happen for namespaces since they have a wider impact (as namespaces are used on all WM projects while subpages are not widely used).

Hi, sorry i am a total newbie to wiki. sorry if i am posting in the wrong place. i am learning.
but one question, what is sweet corn and how is it made? is it grown? the corn i eat is not sweet but some e.g.  the canned corns or 'Magic Corn' is sweet. why is that? can i make normal corn sweet like that? 
also, can anyone tell me how to make the flavorings for corn (bbq, chicken etc), the spice that is sprinkled on it?
thankx
If this is not the place to answer, pls answer me at my email address and tell me the correct procedure too!

== Invented recipes? ==

How do original recipes fit in? I do a lot of inventing and adapting. I've started writing some down, [[User:Singkong2005/recipes and cooking tips|here]]. With Wikibooks supposed to be creating textbooks, I'm not sure how opinion, preference and &quot;original research&quot; fit in. 

I wonder if there's a way to incorporate both? 

If we sign our original recipes, then we could look up the recipes by people we like. People could do their own page of recipes, but a more reliable way might be to sign on the recipe page, and work out some variation of the &quot;What links here&quot; function that only lists &quot;Cookbook&quot; pages and not Talk pages. 

If that's not very clear, I apologize! Obviously these ideas need a lot of work. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 11:26, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

: Don't sign the recipe page, but you can make a note that you created the recipe on the talk page. We haven't really dealt much with this, but allowing &quot;new&quot; recipes or millions of variations on recipes makes for a weird site; more of a &quot;community cooking&quot; site than a wikibook. So it's vague. I'm not sure how I feel about either one really. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:19, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

:: There are two sides to this coin. If we're not careful, the cookbook could explode into a collection of thousands of unchecked crappy recipes, like so many online recipe sites, where more people write the recipes than cook them and all quality control is lost. On the other hand the wiki format does allow peer review, which could lead to wiki recipe creation, with people cooking each other's recipes and improving on them. Of course, nobody's going to cook wikibook originals unless we get a solid reputation for good recipes (which could be some time). I suggest we implement a policy that does not ban original recipes, but does discourage adding trivial stuff. I can think of the following components to this kind of policy.
::* If at all possible, the recipe should be added as a variation. For instance, if the recipe is basically a lasagna with a certain combo of ingredients, the combination could just be added to the notes, tips and variations section under lasagna. If there are a lot of special preparations that need to be described, or the recipe doesn't fit any kind of category, a new page would need to be made, but a lot of stuff could be restricted to this format. An additional advantage of this is that once the variations section gets too large, some of the least notable variation can be removed, or merged with others.
::* We implement a notability requirement for recipes, analogous to the one wikipedia has. Notability would be based on how well known a recipe is (eg. Lasagna, or Curry), and (for original stuff) redeeming qualities like the use of ingredient that doesn't have a lot of recipes yet, originality, quality of the dish, quality of the recipe page (layout, pictures).
::The ideal (for me at least) would be a collection of recipes that grow slowly in quantity and steadily in quality. A policy would at least give us some sense of general direction. [[User:Risk|risk]] 02:53, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

:::Perhaps what I'm looking for is more of a &quot;community cooking&quot; site... it would be great if we could have the best of both worlds on the one site, with the ability to access standard recipes and ingredient info, as well as &quot;community cooking&quot; stuff if desired. 
:::I doubt that it's possible to come to agreement about what's a good recipe by peer review. What's delicious for me will be hippy crap to someone else, and what's delicious to them might be horrible to me. Some form of voting could be good, but I don't think the software allows for that. 
:::It's true, we don't want someone coming onto the site finding thousands of unchecked crappy recipes. 
:::So I suggest something like this:
:::* We adopt a form of sorting, so that the first thing you find when looking for a recipe is the standard version, but there is also a set of links at the bottom to similar recipes, and individuals' variations on these recipes. 
:::* Individual users could put their own recipes in their own userspace, with no notability requirement, and link to there. There could be a problem if we have hundreds of links to personal recipes at the bottom of the single &quot;standard&quot; recipe page... but perhaps by the time we get to that point, we might have a voting feature in the software, which would allow the most popular recipes, and the most popular recipe authors, to be ranked first.
:::* This also means that when we find a user whose recipe we like, we can check their other recipes.

::::::: Because it muddies the clarity of what we are producing: a type of book. We're not a community site. If we at some point become a community site, then some other solution would probably be appropriate (probably categories rather than user subpages). You can put recipes in your user space if you want, but they shouldn't be considered part of the cookbook (and should not be linked from main cookbook pages).

::::::Has any thought been given to moving to a different domain? It seems like a more elegant solution, would make linking easier, and would also allow for some modifications to software (only slight, to maintain maximum compatibility with Wikimedia sites). I notice that http://wikirecipes.net has voting, so it shouldn't be hard to implement on a wiki. 

::::::Efforts at recipe building could potentially fragment (with sites like http://communipes.com/ and http://wikirecipes.net catering more to individuals) or unite. An effort here to make something more inclusive could result in a larger community of editors on the one site. I know that I would rather not be involved in two separate wiki recipe sites, one for &quot;textbook&quot; style recipes and one for recipe sharing and creativity - and if I had to choose, it would be the community site, as I'm an experimenter, and I believe recipes are variable and changing by nature. However, I'd rather be able to contribute to both aspects on the one site. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 16:01, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

While that book is nowhere near as well developed as this one, I think some cross-linking might be nice between the cookbook and the gardening book.

Bm7b5 E7(b9) can be looked at as a II-V in the key of A major or A minor, yet in this case it resolves to the I chord in C major. The E7 Resolves to the Cmajor chord with adeceptive cadence[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deceptive_cadence].

== Scope of page ==

This page should be distinguished as mostly applicable to jazz theory/harmony. '''Chord Progression''' is the main name (in common practice style) for what is here called '''chord structure'''. Also, the use of chord symbols is almost exclusively used for jazz charts and analyses. Common practice style uses (in my experience) the Roman Numeral analysis. The use and inclusion of extensions here I think might be confusing without a preceding discussion about what they are and from whence they are derived (tertian harmony - adding successive thirds on top of triads, etc.) And their use in common practice was limited mostly to 9ths, and then really only in later common practice, and THEN really only as unresolved suspensions or accented appogiatura. See Debussy for 'tensions beyond 9ths. --[[User:Aaronjgardner|A.J.]] 16:03, 28 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

[[w:gnuplot|gnuplot]] is a plotting program. It is command-line driven and multiplatform. The open source project gnuplot name is intended to be lower-case. The source code is copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it). 

== Usage ==
gnuplot can be used interactively, in batch mode, or embedded in (scripted by) another program, such as [[w:GNU Octave|GNU Octave]].

* Interactively, run &lt;tt&gt;gnuplot&lt;/tt&gt; at the command line.
* In batch mode, run &lt;tt&gt;gnuplot input.plt&lt;/tt&gt; (where &lt;tt&gt;input.plt&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of the input file) at the command line.
* In another program, use that program’s plotting facilities – gnuplot will be called transparently.
* For use in one’s own programs, one can run gnuplot via &lt;tt&gt;[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/popen.html popen],&lt;/tt&gt; or use a library that wraps gnuplot for the programming language. These wrapper libraries exist for C, C++(e.g. [http://www.stahlke.org/dan/gnuplot-iostream/ Gnuplot-iostream], [http://code.google.com/p/gnuplot-cpp/ gnuplot-cpp]) Python, Perl, Java, Fortran95, and others.

=== Example ===
As very simple usage, start gnuplot and type:
 plot sin(x)
 exit
This will display a plot of the sine function, and then exit.

=== Outline ===
To plot a function or functions:
* define the '''function;'''
* determine the '''range''' of ''inputs'' and ''outputs;''
* determine the '''style''' for the ''region'' and the ''graphs;''
* plot it (using the &lt;tt&gt;plot&lt;/tt&gt; function)

To plot data, collect the data in a file instead of defining a function.

== Format ==
=== Plain ===
Unsetting the default decorations will yield a completely plain graph area:
 unset title
 unset key
 unset xtics
 unset ytics
 set border 0
These fields can now be set individually, if desired.

=== Axes ===
==== Percentage ====
To format an axis as a percentage, multiply the number by 100 and suffix a “%” symbol using &lt;tt&gt;format,&lt;/tt&gt; as in:
 set format y &quot;%g %%&quot;
 plot &quot;dat1.txt&quot; using 1:($2*100)

== Types of functions ==
=== Piecewise-defined functions ===
:''See: [[w:Piecewise function|Piecewise function]]''


Several ways are possible. 
==== The ?  operator ====

One can plot [[w:Piecewise function|piecewise-defined functions]] in gnuplot with the ternary condition operator (&lt;tt&gt;[[w:?:|?:]]&lt;/tt&gt;). For instance, one can manually define the absolute value function by:
 f(x) = x &gt; 0 ? x : -x
Read this as “if…then…else”: “if ''x'' is greater than 0, then &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x,&lt;/math&gt; else &lt;math&gt;f(x)=-x.&lt;/math&gt;”

One can chain these, for instance by:
 f(x) = x &lt; 1 ? 1 \
      : x &lt; 2 ? 3 \
              : 5
This corresponds to the piecewise function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 1 \\
3 &amp; \text{if } x \geq 1 \text{ and } x &lt; 2 \\
5 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

For piecewise functions, you will likely want many samples, so that discontinuities appear as vertical lines, and corners appear sharp, so:
 set sample 1001
(Using 1001 instead of 1000 avoids artifacts of having a sample point appear directly on a discontinuity, which can introduce &quot;stair steps.&quot;)

==== plot each function individually ====
Or you can plot each function individually, like you appear to be doing now.

 f(x) = a1*x**2+b1*x+c1  for x in [t11,t12]
 f(x) = a2*x**2+b2*x+c2  for x in [t21,t22]
 f(x) = a3*x**2+b3*x+c3  for x in [t31,t32]
 ....
 ....
 ...
where 
 t11&lt;=t12&lt;=t21&lt;=t22, etc.

==== Parametric mode ====
Better yet, switch to parametric mode, map a common t interval [0:1] to 
your individual t ranges, and then:

	x1(t) = t11+t*(t12-t11)
	...

	plot x1(t), f1(x1(t)), x2(t), f2(x2(t)), ...
plot each function individually

== Source files ==
gnuplot allows one to load files via the &lt;tt&gt;load&lt;/tt&gt; command, or by passing them as arguments on the command line.  This is very useful for complicated graphs.

There is no official standard extension, but some semi-official extensions are used:
* &lt;tt&gt;.plt, .gnu, .gpi,&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;.gih&lt;/tt&gt; for general gnuplot files;
* &lt;tt&gt;.dat&lt;/tt&gt; for data;
* &lt;tt&gt;.fnc&lt;/tt&gt; for function definitions.

For formatting source code, two useful pieces of syntax are:
;comments: The hash (&lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;) character starts inline comments, which continue to the end of the line.
;line continuation: A trailing backslash (&lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt;) is a line continuation character, and allows one to split a long expression over multiple lines. One can also indent/line up the continuing lines for legibility (as in piecewise functions), as initial whitespace is ignored.

=== Debugging ===
For debugging a gnuplot file, it is often useful to:
* Change the terminal to interactive (instead of outputting to a file), by commenting out &lt;tt&gt;set terminal&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;output&lt;/tt&gt; lines.
* Start gnuplot interactively, then &lt;tt&gt;load&lt;/tt&gt; the file in question.
* Put &lt;tt&gt;pause -1&lt;/tt&gt; (pause until carriage return) at the end of the file, then run it from the command line.
** Alternatively, run gnuplot with the &lt;tt&gt;-persist&lt;/tt&gt; command line switch, so gnuplot exits, but the window persists.
* Make the file itself executable, by shebang (&lt;tt&gt;#!&lt;/tt&gt;) notation (depends on exact path):
 #!/usr/bin/gnuplot -persist

=== Syntax highlighting ===
[[w:vim|vim]] has syntax highlighting for gnuplot ([http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1737 gnuplot.vim]), and can be automatically used for files with extension &lt;tt&gt;.plt&lt;/tt&gt; in the usual autocommand way:
 au BufNewFile,BufRead *.plt,.gnuplot setf gnuplot

Also see a [https://github.com/vlaadbrain/gnuplot.vim github repository] compatible with pathogen's auto filetype detection features.

== Generating Wikimedia graphs ==
:''See: [[w:Wikipedia:How_to_create_graphs_for_Wikipedia_articles#gnuplot|How to create graphs for Wikipedia articles: gnuplot]]''

To generate graphs for Wikimedia:
* Store your code in a ''file,'' preferably with ''comments''
* Use ''high quality'' (many samples) ''SVG'' output.
* Generate the SVG.
* Optionally post-process.
* Upload the ''graph'' and ''source code'' to Wikimedia Commons.

Details follow.

=== gnuplot options ===
Here is a sample header:
 set terminal svg enhanced size 300 300
 set samples 1001  # high quality
 set border 31 linewidth .3 # thin border
 set output &quot;filename.svg&quot;
(The ''file name'' should be ''changed'' to something more descriptive, though this is not strictly necessary.)

This will create an SVG which is nominally 300 × 300, a common Wikimedia display size:
it is easiest to make graphs whose nominal size is the expected display size, but beware that images can and are resized, and that this affects ''thickness'' and ''legibility'' – if using a large nominal size, so that it will likely be resized down, use ''large fonts'' and ''thick lines.''

Beware that with horizontal writing, the y-axis labels will likely take up more space (horizontally) than the x-axis labels take (vertically), and thus a nominally square graph will have an actually graphing area which is slightly taller than it is wide.

One can set the font via:
 set terminal svg enhanced size 300 300 fname &quot;Times&quot; fsize 36

==== Technical details ====
;set terminal svg: sets output to be an SVG file
;enhanced: means to use enhanced text output, when Greek letters are needed. a table can be found [[http://t16web.lanl.gov/Kawano/gnuplot/label-e.html here]].
;size 300 300: sets the nominal size of the SVG as 300 × 300
;set samples 1001: this sets many samples for high quality; the 1001 (instead of 1000) is so that a sample is unlikely to land directly on a pixel or discontinuity, which can cause aliasing. If you have unexpected aliasing, try changing this to 1002 or 1003, as that will move all sample points, possibly fixing the problem.
;set border 31 linewidth .3: “31” is 1111 in binary, meaning “all borders”; use “3” (0011) in binary for just the lower and left borders. The thin linewidth makes the border less prominent, emphasizing the line. &lt;small&gt;[Note, 31 actually is 11111 in binary.  The fifth bit is irrelevant to this example and the example should be rewritten with 15 instead of 31.]&lt;/small&gt;  Note, use interactive gnuplot command &quot;help set border&quot; to see an explanation of what each bit controls.
;set output &quot;filename.svg&quot;: This sets the output file name.  In normal use, choose a filename more descriptive of file contents.

=== Post-processing ===
One may wish to post-process the SVG, either in a vector graphics program such as [[Inkscape]], or by hand (as SVG files are text). This can be useful to add annotations which would be otherwise hard to produce in gnuplot, or one may incorporate the plot as one component of a larger or more complex figure.

=== Wikimedia Commons Upload ===
* Please use the template &lt;tt&gt;{{[[commons:Template:gnuplot|gnuplot]]}}&lt;/tt&gt; to flag it as made with gnuplot.
* The source code may be included in the “Source” section of the description (if brief), or more often in a separate &lt;tt&gt;== gnuplot source ==&lt;/tt&gt; section.
* The source is most legible if wrapped in [[mw:Extension:SyntaxHighlight GeSHi|Syntax highlighting]] via:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;gnuplot&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* If you use text, it may be translated – please use the template &lt;tt&gt;{{[[commons:Translation possible|Translation possible]]}}&lt;/tt&gt; to indicate that translation is possible.
** Alternatively, minimize the use of text (place in a separate caption) to aid reuse of the image in other languages.

== Design considerations ==
There are a number of design considerations in graphs, considered as information graphics. A good resource are the works and writings of information graphic designers, such as the highly regarded works of Edward Tufte: his ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information'' is most relevant for graphs, but his and others other work can be insightful and inspiring.

The first consideration is what to graph, and whether a graph is the best way to convey certain information: graphs can be unexpectedly useful, or conversely, a graph may not be the best way to convey information. Further, how a graph is connected an integrated with other material is a question – is it referred to? Described and discussed?

Other media that can be an alternative to a graph, or support it, include:
* text, either running text, a list, or an isolated single item (pull quote)
* tables
* schematic diagrams
* animations (possibly animated graphs)
* photographs
Often it is useful to portray the same information in several ways.

A second question is how many graphs to use.
* Most obviously one may use a '''single,''' large, detailed graph, and this is often appropriate, such as if the details of the data are important.
* Alternatively, consider using '''small multiples''' – several small graphs to make a point, through repetition and variation, analogous with written “compare and contrast”.
*:It is especially helpful to align graphs or place them on a grid, so the eye can easily switch between them.
*:Presenting the same data on different scales can also be revealing; a simple example is shown at estimated sign, where the same data is shown on an absolute scale and relative scale.
* One can also use graphs '''in-line,''' as in sparklines.

Beyond these general considerations, there are finer questions:
* Which range of data to display?
* What scale to use? For example, should the range of the graph area agree with the range of the data (maximizing use of space), or should the range be larger, providing context? Often a log scale or log-log scale is appropriate, but may be confusing to novice readers.
* How to distinguish data? What color and line styles to use?
* How prominent to make various data – how thick or thin to make different lines, how large to make text?

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
[[Image:Arda.Tengwar.png|thumb|left|Word '''Arda''' (''world'') written in Tengwar script]]
Quenya is a '''constructed language''' invented by British author John Ronald Reuel Tolkien. His most well-known books are the ''Lord of the Rings'' series and the Hobbit. Tolkien uses Quenya as well as other languages he created in many of his books. This language uses a special kind of a writing system named ''Tengwar''. &quot;Tengwar&quot; in Quenya means &quot;letters&quot;. Letters of the Tengwar '''script''' are different than those of the Roman '''alphabet''', which is used for writing English. However, it is possible to write Quenya using the letters of the Roman alphabet, too. Quenya uses the following letters:

:'''a, á, b, c, d, e, é, f, g, h, i, í, l, m, n, o, ó, p, q, r, s, t, u, ú, v, w, x,''' and '''y.'''

There are also several combinations of these letters used to represent other tengwar: '''ny''', '''ty''', '''ly''', '''gw''', '''nw''', '''cw''' (which is usually spelled as '''qu'''), etc.

Since the Roman alphabet is not the original alphabet used for writing Quenya words, some differences may appear when two different persons write the same word using the letters of the Roman alphabet. For example, some would write '''cirya''' (''ship''), while the others would write '''kirya'''. You may also find the letter '''e''' having two little dots over it: '''ë'''. This does not affect the pronunciation, but is used sometimes to mark the letter '''e''' when it is final in a word: '''minë''' (''one'').

==How many people speak this language?==
There are many people who study this language for fun. In Tolkien's stories, Quenya is spoken by some Elves and Humans in the lands named Middle-Earth and Valinor. However, very few people actually ''speak'' the language.

==Where is this language spoken?==

Tolkien has created a world just like ours, named Arda.  There are many peoples living in Arda, and Quenya is the language of the Elves.  Some Elvish peoples speak other languages such as Sindarin, Telerin, and Nandorin, just like how not all humans speak the same languages.  The other Elvish languages are all similar to Quenya because Tolkien created them as related languages.  Many human languages are related also, for example Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian are all similar because they are related languages.

People who studied Quenya for fun usually use it for writing poems and songs as it is said to be a pleasant and musical-sounding language.

==What is the history of this language?==

In Tolkien's stories, all the Elves at first spoke one single language, usually referred to as ''Primitive Elvish''. Then they started a big journey from Cúvienen, where they lived at first. As the time passed, and they were moving, the language spread, and Elves began to speak it differently. This is why several different Elvish languages appeared, one of which is Quenya.

Tolkien continued to change Quenya for his entire life. He first started to work on it while he was still a young boy, and he kept improving it right up to his death. Because of this, early Quenya words and grammar were very different from the way they would end up at the end of Tolkien's life.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==

Quenya is usually used for writing poems, stories, and songs.

'''J.R.R. Tolkien''' (1892 – 1973) is the creator of Quenya and several other Elvish languages.  His son, '''Christopher Tolkien''', continued publishing Quenya-related material after his father's death.

'''Helge K. Fauskanger''' and '''Thorsten Renk''' are considered some of the best researchers of Tolkien's languages today. They wrote textbooks of Quenya and Sindarin languages, and articles about Tolkien's languages.

==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==
*'''Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo''' -  A star shines on the hour of our meeting.  (In other words: &quot;Hello.&quot;)
*'''aran''' - king
*'''tári''' - queen
*'''Elda''' - Elf
*'''Eldar''' - Elves
*'''atto ar mamil''' - Dad and Mom
*'''malta''' - gold
*'''ondo''' - stone, rock
*'''cár''' - head
*'''masta''' - bread
*'''Anar''' - Sun
*'''Isil''' - Moon
*'''lírë''' - song
*'''laire''' - poem

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==
Try to learn this little song from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; named '''Rhyme of Lore''':

&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px&quot;&gt;
 Hallë ciryar ar hallë arani&lt;br&gt;
 neldë lúr neldë,&lt;br&gt;
 man tuncet Atalantello&lt;br&gt; 
 or i úlëa eär?&lt;br&gt;
 Otso eleni ar otso ondor&lt;br&gt;
 ar minë ninquë alda. *&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''''*''' - translation to Quenya by David F. Ponessa''&lt;/small&gt;

It sounds like this:
&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px&quot;&gt;
 Halle keeryar ar halle aranee&lt;br&gt;
 nelde loor nelde&lt;br&gt;
 man toonket atalantello&lt;br&gt;
 or ee oolea ear&lt;br&gt;
 otso elenee ar otso ondor&lt;br&gt;
 ar meene neenkwe alda&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And that means: 
&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px&quot;&gt;
 Tall ships and tall kings&lt;br&gt;
 Three times three,&lt;br&gt;
 What brought they from the foundered land&lt;br&gt;
 Over the flowing sea?&lt;br&gt;
 Seven stars and seven stones&lt;br&gt;
 And one white tree.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Don't have to answer. Problem solved. - [[User:212.149.219.87|212.149.219.87]] 15:51, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

I have made several edits. &lt;code&gt;sizeof(char)&lt;/code&gt; is defined to be 1 in C (not in C++ though), so I removed it from the call to &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and forced the arg type passed in to be an &lt;code&gt;unsigned long int&lt;/code&gt; (even though the compiler would probably assign it that type). &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; is not always set if &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; fails so the code now displays a hard-coded message. The code was returning 1 to indicate failure which is a bad idea, it should return the value &lt;code&gt;EXIT_FAILURE&lt;/code&gt; (which may be 1, or it may not, it's implementation dependent - on VAX/VMS systems 1 indicates success). 0 can be used for successful exit (in VAX/VMS that is converted to 1 and returned) or &lt;code&gt;EXIT_SUCCESS&lt;/code&gt;. I've added a space after each use of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; as a stylistic hint that it is not a function call. I'm assuming this C book is teaching Standard C as much as possible because I notice specific mentions of UNIX etc. where non-Standard use of C is demonstrated, which is good. -- [[User:Mickraus|Mickraus]] 23:58, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

== The first example ==

In the first example, why are the directives:&lt;br /&gt;
* #include &lt;errno.h&gt; and 
* #include &lt;string.h&gt;
used at all?

The function call &quot;strerror( errno )&quot; is never made in the example code, even though it is mentioned in the preceding paragraph.

On a slightly unrelated topic, I ran the example code, and received a malloc failed response. &lt;br /&gt;
I have 8 GB of RAM on my system.My OS is 64 bit windows 7. I think it should be mentioned in the comments of the example; or in an appropriate place in the preceding text; that this example will (most likely) fail if you have less than 2 gb of RAM on a &quot;32 bit system&quot;. And most likely this example will fail if you have less than 16 gb of RAM on a &quot;64 bit system&quot;.

[[User:V-a-xvi|V-a-xvi]] ([[User talk:V-a-xvi|talk]]) 03:12, 23 November 2010 (UTC)

:I just ran a modified version of this example and it works as expected, and I assume that its an oversight in the example that the line puts(strerror(errno)) is not included. I've corrected the example as I think appropriate.

'''Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies''' - These cookies use [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|sweet rice flour]], also known as glutinous rice flour. Don't be fooled by the name; there's no gluten in glutinous rice flour (or any rice flour, for that matter). This flour, like most [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]] flours, is easy to find if an Asian grocery can be located. It can also be found in many boutique grocery stores, such as Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Other gluten-free flours may be substituted, but be prepared to adjust the amount of flour needed to compensate for variations in starchiness.

It should go without saying, for any household coping with celiac disease, that it is imperative to make sure all your ingredients, work surfaces, and utensils are free of gluten contamination. Special care should be taken with compound ingredients such as baking powder; make sure its ingredients list does not include gluten-containing items such as modified food starch.

The cookies are pictured to the right with various additions to the dough. Experimenting is encouraged, but please be careful choosing additions. Some of the cookies pictured have oats added, which introduce trace amounts of gluten and are '''not''' safe for celiacs.

*[[Cookbook:Chocolate chip|Chocolate chips]] (as many as you like)

==Procedure==
[[Image:Gluten-free chocolate chip cookie dough.jpg|thumb|The finished dough (with various additions), ready for baking]]
#Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
#Mix the sweet rice flour, xanthan gum, baking powder and baking soda in a large mixing bowl.
#In a smaller mixing bowl or stand mixer, [[Cookbook:Creaming|cream]] the butter, sugar, and brown sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla and continue mixing.
#Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Don't worry about over-mixing; since there is no gluten in the flour, there is no danger of overworking it.
#Fold in the chocolate chips.
#Line cookie sheet with silicone mat and spoon on balls of dough, about 1½&quot; (4cm) in diameter.
#Put cookie dough in the fridge for 30-40 minutes, or into the freezer for 10-20 minutes.
#Using a tablespoon, spoon dough out and form little balls.  Set them on the baking sheet a couple inches apart.
#Bake until golden brown.  Makes approximately 30 cookies.

==Notes==
This will likely take longer to bake than a gluten-containing cookie recipe—perhaps about 25 minutes. Baking time will depend on the flour you use, since the protein content of the flour will determine the rate of browning from the Maillard reaction.

The silicone baking sheet liner is important, as these cookies tend to stick to the pan more than most. If you don't have one, parchment paper might also work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Listening Paper consists of 5 questions for Standard Level candidates and 7 questions Higher Level candidates, to be answered in 2 hours, 15 minutes and 3 hours, respectively. It is divided into section A and section B, with an additional section C for Higher Level candidates. All questions are worth 20 marks each. Candidates will have to bring in unmarked scores of the prescribed works, but will be provided with a CD with unidentified tracks.

'''&lt;u&gt;Section A&lt;/u&gt;''' '''(Standard and Higher Level)'''

The three questions in this section are based upon the prescribed works. Candidates can take unmarked scores of the prescribed works into the examination room. No listening tracks will be provided. The first two questions are each based on one of the two prescribed works, and both the Standard and Higher Level candidates have a choice between the two. The third question is one in which a comparison between the two prescribed works is required.

'''''Prescribed Works'''''

The prescribed works for the 2011 and 2012 examinations are &quot;''El Salón México''&quot; by Aaron Copland and &quot;''Symphony No. 41 in C Major, K.551 (&quot;Jupiter&quot;)''&quot; by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

The prescribed works for the 2013 examinations are &quot;''Yellow River Piano Concerto''&quot; by Yin Chengzong and Yu Wanghua (based on Xian Xinghai's &quot;''Yellow River Cantata''&quot;) and &quot;''Symphony No. 1 in D Major, Op. 25 (&quot;Classical Symphony&quot;)''&quot; by Sergei Prokofiev.

&lt;u&gt;'''Section B'''&lt;/u&gt; '''(Standard and Higher Level)'''

The four questions in this section are based on extracts on an accompanying CD provided during the examinations. These can be from any time period, genre or culture. Questions are usually along the following lines: 'Describe what you hear in this extract, relating to appropriate issues concerning musical, structural and contextual characteristics.' Standard Level candidates have a choice between question 1 and 2 (based on Western art music), but must additionally answer questions 3 and 4 (based on jazz, pop and/or world music). Higher Level candidates must answer all four questions.

&lt;u&gt;'''Section C'''&lt;/u&gt; '''(Higher Level)'''

The question in this section asks Higher Level candidates to compare and contrast two of the selections heard in &quot;section B&quot;, with regard to two specific musical links.

{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Nested Classes|next=Aggregate}}
__NOTOC__{{Java Programming/ClassesAndObjectsTopic/Nav}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Java is a strongly typed language, so a field in a class may be typed like this:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-34&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.34: Repository.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
public class Repository {

   public Integer item;

   public Integer getItem() {
      return item;
   }

   public void setItem(Integer newItem) {
      item = newItem;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
This ensures that, only &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; objects can be put in the field and a &lt;code&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/code&gt; can't occur at runtime, only compile-time error can occur. Unfortunately, it can be used only with &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; objects. If you want to use the same class in another context with &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s, you have to generalize the type like this:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-35&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.35: Repository.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3, 5, 13-15&quot;&gt;
public class Repository {

   public Object item;

   public Object getItem() {
      return item;
   }

   public void setItem(Integer newItem) {
      item = newItem;
   }

   public void setItem(String newItem) {
      item = newItem;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
But you will have &lt;code&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/code&gt; at runtime again and you can't easily use your field. The solution is to use [[w:Generic programming|Generics]].
== Generic class ==
A generic class does not hard code the type of a field, a return value or a parameter. The class only indicates that a generic type should be the same, for a given object instance. The generic type is not specified in the class definition. It is specified during object instantiation. This allows the generic type to be different from an instance to another. So we should write our class this way:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-36&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.36: Repository.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1, 3, 5, 9&quot;&gt;
public class Repository&lt;T&gt; {

   public T item;

   public T getItem() {
      return item;
   }

   public void setItem(T newItem) {
      item = newItem;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Here, the generic type is defined after the name of the class. Any new identifier can be chosen. Here, we have chosen ''T'', which is the most common choice. The actual type is defined at the object instantiation:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-35&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.35: Instantiation.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1, 5&quot;&gt;
Repository&lt;Integer&gt; arithmeticRepository = new Repository&lt;Integer&gt;();
arithmeticRepository.setItem(new Integer(1));
Integer number = arithmeticRepository.getItem();

Repository&lt;String&gt; textualRepository = new Repository&lt;String&gt;();
textualRepository.setItem(&quot;Hello!&quot;);
String message = textualRepository.getItem();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Although each object instance has its own type, each object instance is still strongly typed:

{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-36&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.36: Compile error.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
Repository&lt;Integer&gt; arithmeticRepository = new Repository&lt;Integer&gt;();
arithmeticRepository.setItem(&quot;Hello!&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A class can define as many generic types as you like. Choose a different identifier for each generic type and separate them by a comma:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-37&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.37: Repository.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1, 5&quot;&gt;
public class Repository&lt;T, U&gt; {

   public T item;

   public U anotherItem;

   public T getItem() {
      return item;
   }

   public void setItem(T newItem) {
      item = newItem;
   }

   public U getAnotherItem() {
      return anotherItem;
   }

   public void setAnotherItem(U newItem) {
      anotherItem = newItem;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
When a type that is defined with generic (for example, &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;T&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) is not used with generics (for example, &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;) is called a ''raw type''.

== Generic method ==
A generic type can be defined for just a method:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-37&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.37: Generic method.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public &lt;D&gt; D assign(Collection&lt;D&gt; generic, D obj) {
  generic.add(obj);
  return obj;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Here a new identifier (''D'') has been chosen at the beginning of the method declaration. The type is ''specific to a method call'' and different types can be used for the same object instance:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-38&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.38: Generic method call.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Collection&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
Integer number = assign(numbers, new Integer(1));
Collection&lt;String&gt; texts = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
String text = assign(texts, &quot;Store it.&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
The actual type will be defined by the type of the method parameter. Hence, the generic type can't be defined only for the return value as it wouldn't be resolved. See the [[#Class&lt;T&gt;|Class&lt;T&gt;]] section for a solution.

'''Question 4.8''': Consider the following class.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-8&quot;&gt;'''Question 4.8: Question8.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class Question8&lt;T&gt; {
  public T item;
 
  public T getItem() {
    return item;
  }
 
  public void setItem(T newItem) {
    item = newItem;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Question8&lt;String&gt; aQuestion = new Question8&lt;String&gt;();
    aQuestion.setItem(&quot;Open your mind.&quot;);
    aQuestion.display(aQuestion.getItem());
  }

  public void display(String parameter) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Here is the text: &quot; + parameter);
  }

  public void display(Integer parameter) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Here is the number: &quot; + parameter);
  }

  public void display(Object parameter) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Here is the object: &quot; + parameter);
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Here is the text: Open your mind.
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
&lt;code&gt;aQuestion.getItem()&lt;/code&gt; is typed as a string.
{{Hidden end}}
{{Hidden end}}

== Wildcard Types ==
As we have seen above, generics give the impression that a new container type is created with each different type parameter. We have also seen that in addition to the normal type checking, the type parameter has to match as well when we assign generics variables.
In some cases this is too restrictive.  What if we would like to relax this additional checking? What if we would like to define a collection variable that can hold any generic collection, regardless of the parameter type it holds?
The wildcard type is represented by the character '''&lt;?&gt;''', and pronounced '''Unknown''', or '''Any-Type'''. Any-Type can be expressed also by &lt;code&gt;&lt;? extends Object&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Any-Type includes Interfaces, not only Classes.
So now we can define a collection whose element type matches anything. See below:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-39&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.39: Wildcard type.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Collection&lt;?&gt; collUnknown;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

=== Upper bounded wildcards ===
You can specify a restriction on the types of classes that may be used. For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;? extends ClassName&gt;&lt;/code&gt; only allows objects of class &lt;code&gt;ClassName&lt;/code&gt; or a subclass.
For example, to create a collection that may only contain &quot;Serializable&quot; objects, specify:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-40&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.40: Collection of serializable subobjects.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Collection&lt;String&gt; textColl = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

Collection&lt;? extends Serializable&gt; serColl = textColl;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The above code is valid because the {{java:String}} class is serializable. Use of a class that is not serializable would cause a compilation error. The added items can be retrieved as &lt;code&gt;Serializable&lt;/code&gt; object. You can call methods of the &lt;code&gt;Serializable&lt;/code&gt; interface or cast it to &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. The following collection can only contain objects that extend the class &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-38&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.38: Dog.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
class Dog extends Animal {
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-41&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.41: Example of subclass.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
// Create &quot;Animal Collection&quot; variable
Collection&lt;? extends Animal&gt; animalColl = new ArrayList&lt;Dog&gt;();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

=== Lower bounded wildcards ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;? super ClassName&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies a restriction on the types of classes that may be used.
For example, to declare a Comparator that can compare Dogs, you use:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-42&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.42: Superclass.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Comparator&lt;? super Dog&gt; myComparator;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Now suppose you define a comparator that can compare Animals:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-43&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.43: Comparator.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
class AnimalComparator implements Comparator&lt;Animal&gt; {
  int compare(Animal a, Animal b) {
   //...
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
 
Since &lt;code&gt;Dogs&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;code&gt;Animals&lt;/code&gt;, you can use this comparator to compare Dogs also. Comparators for any superclass of Dog can also compare Dog; but comparators for any strict subclass cannot.
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-44&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.44: Generic comparator.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Comparator&lt;Animal&gt; myAnimalComparator = new AnimalComparator();

static int compareTwoDogs(Comparator&lt;? super Dog&gt; comp, Dog dog1, Dog dog2) {
  return comp.compare(dog1, dog2);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The above code is valid because the &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; class is a supertype of the &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt; class. Use of a class that is not a supertype would cause a compilation error.

=== Unbounded wildcard ===
The advantage of the unbounded wildcard (i.e. &lt;code&gt;&lt;?&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) compared to a raw type (i.e. without generic) is to explicitly say that the parameterized type is unknown, not ''any type''. That way, all the operations that implies to know the type are forbidden to avoid unsafe operation. Consider the following code:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-45&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.45: Unsafe operation.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void addAtBottom(Collection anyCollection) {
  anyCollection.add(new Integer(1));
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

This code will compile but this code may corrupt the collection if the collection only contains strings:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-46&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.46: Corruption of list.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
List&lt;String&gt; col = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
addAtBottom(col);
col.get(0).endsWith(&quot;.&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Console for Code section 4.46'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer incompatible with java.lang.String
at Example.main(Example.java:17)
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

This situation could have been avoided if the &lt;code&gt;addAtBottom(Collection)&lt;/code&gt; method was defined with an unbounded wildcard: &lt;code&gt;addAtBottom(Collection&lt;?&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. With this signature, it is impossible to compile a code that is dependent of the parameterized type. Only independent methods of a collection (&lt;code&gt;clear()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;isEmpty()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;iterator()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;remove(Object o)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;size()&lt;/code&gt;, ...) can be called. For instance, &lt;code&gt;addAtBottom(Collection&lt;?&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; could contain the following code:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-47&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.47: Safe operation.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void addAtBottom(Collection&lt;?&gt; anyCollection) {
   Iterator&lt;?&gt; iterator = anyCollection.iterator();
   while (iterator.hasNext()) {
      System.out.print(iterator.next());
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Class&lt;T&gt; ==
Since Java 1.5, the class &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Class&lt;/code&gt; is generic. It is an interesting example of using generics for something other than a container class.
For example, the type of String.class is &lt;code&gt;Class&lt;String&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and the type of Serializable.class is &lt;code&gt;Class&lt;Serializable&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This can be used to improve the type safety of your reflection code.
In particular, since the &lt;code&gt;newInstance()&lt;/code&gt; method in Class now returns T, you can get more precise types when creating objects reflectively.
Now we can use the &lt;code&gt;newInstance()&lt;/code&gt; method to return a new object with exact type, without casting. An example with generics:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-48&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.48: Automatic cast.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Customer cust = Utility.createAnyObject(Customer.class);  // No casting
...
public static &lt;T&gt; T createAnyObject(Class&lt;T&gt; cls) {
    T ret = null;
    try {
        ret = cls.newInstance();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Exception Handling
    }
    return ret;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The same code without generics:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-49&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.49: Former version.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Customer cust = (Customer) Utility.createAnyObject(Customer.class);  // Casting is needed
...
public static Object createAnyObject(Class cls) {
    Object ret = null;
    try {
        ret = cls.newInstance();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Exception Handling
    }
    return ret;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Motivation ==
Java was long criticized for the need to explicitly type-cast an element when it was taken out of a &quot;container/collection&quot; class. There was no way to enforce that a &quot;collection&quot; class contains only one type of object (e.g., to forbid ''at compile time'' that an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; object is added to a &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; that should only contain &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s). This is possible since Java 1.5.
In the first couple of years of Java evolution, Java did not have a real competitor. This has changed by the appearance of Microsoft C#. With Generics Java is better suited to compete against C#.
Similar constructs to Java Generics exist in other languages, see [[w:Generic programming|Generic programming]] for more information.
Generics were added to the Java language syntax in version 1.5. This means that code using Generics will not compile with Java 1.4 and less.
Use of generics is optional. For backwards compatibility with pre-Generics code, it is okay to use generic classes without the generics type specification (&lt;code&gt;&lt;T&gt;&lt;/code&gt;). In such a case, when you retrieve an object reference from a generic object, you will have to manually cast it from type Object to the correct type.

== Note for C++ programmers ==
Java Generics are similar to C++ Templates in that both were added for the same reason. The syntax of Java Generic and C++ Template are also similar. There are some differences however. The C++ template can be seen as a kind of macro, in that a new copy of the code is generated for each generic type referenced. All extra code for templates is generated at compiler time.
In contrast, Java Generics are built into the language.  The same code is used for each generic type. For example:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-50&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.50: Java generics.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Collection&lt;String&gt;  collString  = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
Collection&lt;Integer&gt; collInteger = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Both these objects appear as the same type at runtime (both &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt;'s). The generic type information is erased during compilation (type erasure). For example:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-51&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.51: Type erasure.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public &lt;T&gt; void method(T argument) {
  T variable;
  …
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

is transformed by erasure into:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-52&quot;&gt;'''Code section 4.52: Transformation.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void method(Object argument) {
  Object variable;
  …
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

'''Question 4.9''': Consider the following class.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-9&quot;&gt;'''Question 4.9: Question9.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

      <comment>/* 3. Name three ways to prepare wood for string art. */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|1|1975|Arts and Crafts|General Conference}}
== 1. Describe the following: string craft, symmography, geometric stitchery.==

;String Craft: String Craft is making something (craft or art) out of string.

;Symmography:Symmography is creating 3D designs with string without knotting or knitting.

;Geometric Stitchery: Geometric Stitchery is like Symmography but instead of using nails to hold the string on the surface of the media you use a needle or precut holes to go through the media and come out to a new point in the media. Much like sewing on a patch.

==2. Draw and stitch on cardboard in equally spaced points:==
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:StringArt-RightAngle.png|&lt;center&gt;'''a. A right angle'''&lt;/center&gt;
Image:StringArt-AcuteAngle.png|&lt;center&gt;'''b. An acute angle'''&lt;/center&gt;
Image:StringArt-ObtuseAngle.png|&lt;center&gt;'''c. An obtuse angle'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==3. Name three ways to prepare wood for string art.==
There are many ways to prepare the wood for string art:
;Paint: Paint covers the wood and gives you a smooth surface with the color(s) of your choice.
;Stain: Stain changes the color of the wood while still showing the nature and texture of the wood.  Stained wood can be lacquered or varnished to make it glossy.
;Lacquer: Lacquer (clear) protects the wood without changing its color.  It leaves a glossy finish.
;Felt: Cover the wood with felt.  Use staples on the back or a thin, ''even'' coat of white glue on the front.  Dots of glue will show through, so if you are going to use glue, it must be spread evenly, as if you were painting with it.  Stretch the felt over the wood tightly, eliminating all wrinkles.

Once the wood has been finished, the string artist will drive small nails partway into the board.  These nails are the ''points'' around which the strings are run.  When setting the nails, at least half the nail should be left exposed above the wood.  Care must be taken to drive the nails to a sufficient depth so that they do not pull out when placed under tension by the string.  The project will look far better if all the nails are set to the same height, and if they are perfectly vertical.

If you have difficulty setting the nails (big fingers plus little nails equal trouble!) try holding the nail in place with a pair of needle nose pliers.

It is a good idea to draw the pattern out on paper first.  Then tape the paper over the wood and drive the nails through it.  Once the nails are in place, the paper should be removed.  It is tempting to leave the paper in place to serve as a guide while running the string, but this temptation should be resisted.  It is nearly impossible to remove the paper without removing at least some of the string.  Do yourself a favor and remove the paper ''before'' running the string.

To begin, anchor the first string to the first nail using a slip knot.  Tug on it to be sure it will hold before spending a lot of time running the string.  If it pulls loose halfway through the design, it will be difficult to salvage all that hard work.

==4. Use stringing methods on wood to do four of the following:==
===a. Filled circle===
: In a 'Filled circle', the string would cross the center point of the circle. There would be no empty space in the center area of the circle.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:StringArt-FilledCircle.png|Filled Circle
&lt;/gallery&gt;
===b. Hollowed circle===
: In a 'Hollowed circle', the string would not go pass the center point of the circle. There would be no string in the center area of the circle.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:StringArt-HollowCircle.png|Hollow Circle
Image:StringArt-HollowCircle2.png|Hollow Circle
&lt;/gallery&gt;
===c. Star===
: The hollow and filled circles are also of a star design.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:StringArt-HollowCircle.png|Star design with hollow circle
Image:StringArt-FilledCircle.png|Star design with filled circle
&lt;/gallery&gt;
===d. Edging===
[[Image:StringArt-InsideOutside.png|thumb|200px|Curve from within, Curve from without]]
: Edging basically ''edges'' or outlines the design.
===e. Curve from within ===
: When you ''curve from within'' the string covers some part of the inside curve.
===f. Curve from without ===
: The ''Curve from within'' and ''Curve from without'' are two different types of ''edging''. In the example here, we are using a circle. Edging basically ''edges'' the design. When you ''curve from within'' the string covers some part of the inside curve. When you ''curve from without'' the string does not cross the space on the inside of the curve (because the nails in the wood keeps them on the outside of the curve).

&lt;br&gt;

===g. Filler===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:StringArt-Filler.png|Filler, the zig-zag parts in the leaves
&lt;/gallery&gt;
===h. Wing weave ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:StringArt-WingWeave.png|Wing Weave, using existing circle template
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==5. Complete one original string art hanging on wood for display.==
: This is your part. Enjoy!

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am wondoring where the name ''''Generics'''' comes from. Does anyone knows? [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 21:07, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

== Use Generics other than Collection classes ==

Is there a need to use Generics other than using it for Java Collections? I am looking for an example ,other than Java Collection classes, where the use of Generics would be handy. Currently I do not see one. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 15:49, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

== Things that are needed ==

*Generic type parameter in throws clause
&lt;code lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public &lt;T extends Throwable&gt; throwMe(T exception) throws T {throw exception;}
&lt;/code&gt;
*Subclasses of Throwable cannot be generic
*Cannot create arrays of generic types or pass generic types as arguments to varargs.
*Generic constructors
*special compiler handling of the getClass() method:
&lt;code lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
Rectangle rect = ...;
Class&lt;? extends Rectangle&gt; cls = rect.getClass();
&lt;/code&gt;
*Deep generics (a list that contains either lists of Strings or Objects):
&lt;code lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
List&lt;List&lt;? super String&gt;&gt; list;
&lt;/code&gt;
*Generics and autoboxing:
&lt;code lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
List&lt;Boolean&gt; list = new List&lt;Boolean&gt;();
list.add(true);
list.add(false);
&lt;/code&gt;
*Generics and inner classes
[[User:Subanark|Subanark]] ([[User talk:Subanark|talk]]) 23:54, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

== Needed ==

Sections for the following structures are needed:


&lt;T extends Class1 &amp; Interface1 &amp; Interface2&gt; void method(T parameter);

&lt;T1, T2&gt; void method(T1 t1, T2 t2);</text>

      <comment>Second paragraph in Parameter incomplete thought.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In section 2.1 (Predefined Types), value and reference types are introduced but not well explained.  Since this is a &quot;basic&quot; introduction, it would be helpful to have these terms explained.  Similarly, the concept of boxing needs further explanation.
- Fly4free

Section 1.3 (Parameters) needs to be altered to better explain the difference between values and references being passed into methods.  Since value types and reference types are discussed in later sections, this section may need to be discussed later in the document.

As I have done with other pages, I am going to go through this page and change the examples that are used to be more simple so that the meaning of the example is not lost in the complexity of it. We have to remember that although many of the people who read this have programmed before, some haven't, so using a IO Operation for the example for variables may be too advanced.

Is the bool type in c# really 32 bits? That seems ludicrous.
===Parameter===
It currently reads:
:Since this is the default for the C# compiler, it is not necessary to use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- use what?  ..i think it's &amp;, like c++ --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
that comment was added 2008-Dec-25 (Merry Christmas indeed!). Could someone please complete the thought? --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 20:55, 2 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Cornelius Oswald Fudge''''' is the Minister for Magic, which makes him the senior government official of the Wizarding world. He seems to have decided that he should adopt the dress of a government minister, as befits his office, but like so many wizards, does not quite understand the details of Muggle garments; in the books, one of his signature possessions is his lime-green bowler hat.

== Role in the Books ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Cornelius Fudge is entirely off-stage in this book. It is mentioned that he is perpetually summoning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] to London for consultation, and that Fudge became Minister for Magic when Dumbledore turned down the offer.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Fudge appears briefly in this book, only long enough to accuse [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] of opening the Chamber of Secrets, and place him under arrest. Fudge's behavior in this vignette is already enough to show him as a pompous bureaucrat.
 
=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] arrives at The Leaky Cauldron after catching a ride on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Knight Bus|Knight Bus]], Fudge meets him at the door, much to Harry's shock. Apparently, Fudge has been involved in some effort to find Harry, and is relieved that he has appeared. Fudge takes him to a private room, has the innkeeper, Tom, bring tea, and tells Harry, who has been dreading punishment for his unauthorized use of magic, that it could have happened to anyone, and that it will be forgotten. He goes on to ask if Harry would spend the remainder of his summer vacation there at the Leaky Cauldron, and in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], staying clear of the Muggle side of the inn. He also suggests that Harry should expect to stay at Hogwarts over Christmas and spring breaks, and is politely disbelieving when Harry says he would much rather do that. However, when Harry, taking courage from Fudge's apparent expansiveness, asks Fudge to sign his Hogsmeade permission slip, Fudge refuses, fumbling out some sort of excuse.

Fudge re-appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] at Christmas, where we see him discussing the current state of affairs with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]]. Harry, who is in Hogsmeade without permission, must hide under the table. When Rosmerta complains the Dementors are affecting her business, Fudge explains they are necessary because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] is so dangerous. Rosmerta mentions that Sirius and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]] were great friends once, always in the Three Broomsticks together. This surprises Harry. Fudge says that not only was Sirius James' best friend, but also best man at his wedding and Harry's godfather. As the conversation continues, it is learned that James and Lily knew [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] was hunting them and went into hiding. They used the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Fidelius charm]] to conceal themselves and appointed Sirius their Secret-Keeper. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], aware someone close to them was leaking secrets, offered to be their Secret-Keeper, but they declined. Barely a week later, Voldemort killed James and Lily, although he met his own demise in baby Harry. Obviously Black, tired of playing double agent, had thrown his lot in with Voldemort but, after his defeat, had to flee for his life. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], another Potter friend, caught up to Black the next day and accused him of betraying James and Lily. Black killed him and twelve Muggle bystanders with a single curse. Only Pettigrew's bloodstained robes and a severed finger were left. Black was sentenced to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], where he remained until his escape. It is believed he is now trying to reunite with Voldemort, perhaps after killing Harry to prove his loyalty.

Finally, when Sirius Black is captured, Fudge appears again to take custody of him. He accepts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s version of the story at face value, refusing to believe Harry's and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s protestations of Sirius' innocence and the presence of Peter Pettigrew. After Black escapes, Snape returns to the hospital wing with Fudge alongside, insisting that Harry had something to do with Sirius' escape. Harry states that he was locked into the hospital wing for the entire time that Snape was away, and Fudge expresses the belief that Snape has become somewhat unhinged. Professor Dumbledore, who is present, says that Snape has just suffered a disappointment.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

We first see Fudge when we enter the Top Box at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] with Harry and the Weasley family. Fudge is exasperated because his opposite number, the minister for magic from Bulgaria, apparently speaks no English, and Fudge has been trying to communicate with him by sign language all day. Also present is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], there as Fudge's guest, in gratitude for a large donation that Malfoy has just made to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. At the end of the match, the Bulgarian minister comments that it was a good match, and says that he had not told Fudge that he spoke English because it was so comical watching him try to act out his meaning.

We see Fudge again when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]] appears on the outskirts of the Forbidden Forest, apparently insane, and then vanishes. Foul play is suspected, of course, and Fudge apparently arrives at the school in order to use Dumbledore's and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]]'s input to support placing blame. Harry, standing outside Dumbledore's office door, hears Fudge suggesting that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]], the headmistress of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons Academy]], may be at fault, because of her parentage. Harry is caught eavesdropping, and says that Madame Maxime was nowhere in sight, and she would be hard to miss after all. Fudge, Moody, and Dumbledore depart to look at the place where Mr. Crouch had been seen, leaving Harry alone in Dumbledore's office.

With Crouch missing and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]], his assistant, in some disgrace, Fudge himself takes on the task of judging the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. When Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] emerge from the maze, Fudge tries to disguise the fact that Cedric has been murdered, saying he is only injured. Summoned to Professor Moody's office to interrogate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]], Fudge feels that he must bring a Dementor with him; the Dementor administers the Kiss to Crouch immediately, making it impossible for Fudge to hear his confession directly. He then dismisses Harry's story of the return of Voldemort, saying that it can't be true. At one point, talking to Dumbledore, he almost seems to plead with him, asking Dumbledore to confirm that it can't have happened; but when Dumbledore remains unshakable, Fudge decides that Dumbledore has chosen to stand against the Ministry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Fudge rightly believes that if [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] has returned, his tenure in office will end. In order to deny what [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] have told him and shown him, Fudge has to come up with an alternate explanation; and the explanation he apparently comes up with is that Dumbledore has decided to become Minister for Magic and has set himself up as an enemy of the Ministry. To defend himself against this contrived threat, Fudge must discredit Dumbledore and Harry, so he apparently engineers the removal of Dumbledore from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wizengamot|Wizengamot]], replacing Dumbledore himself. He also leans on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''Daily Prophet'']] so that they will print stories that disparage Harry and Dumbledore, thus attempting to ensure that anything that they say can be easily discredited.

All of this is happening behind the scenes. The first time we actually see Fudge in the story is when Harry is at his hearing for his unauthorized use of magic. Fudge has apparently convened the full Wizengamot for the hearing, and is acting as combination head judge and prosecutor. He has decided Harry's guilt, and even in the face of evidence from Dumbledore and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Arabella Figg]] that there were [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] present, thus making the use of magic justified under the law, insists on bringing up irrelevant information that he feels bolsters the Ministry case against Harry. In the end, however, the panel of judges rules that Harry's use of magic was justified. Fudge sullenly declares him cleared of all charges, and leaves. As Harry departs the courtroom with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], they run into Fudge and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], who is evidently about to make a large donation for something. After exchanging a few barbs with Mr. Weasley, Lucius suggests that he and Fudge should adjourn to Fudge's office, and let Arthur go about his business.

Fudge does not directly appear through much of the rest of the book; instead, he arranges the passage of Educational Decree Number Twenty Two, providing that the Ministry can appoint teachers to fill vacancies at Hogwarts when the Headmaster is unable to fill them himself. Using this decree, Fudge appoints [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] to the school as teacher of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Umbridge apparently has been given the prime mission of preventing the students from learning any useful jinxes, as the class is taught theory only, and apparently from a book that stresses negotiation rather than defence. Harry guesses that this is because Fudge fears that Dumbledore wants to become Minister for Magic himself, and so he is trying to prevent Dumbledore's school from creating an army that can be used against Fudge; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] later confirms this belief. Fudge also acts to increase his control over Hogwarts indirectly, by issuing new Educational Decrees that grant ever more powers to Umbridge.

He returns directly to our story at the point where Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Defence Against the Dark Arts group, &quot;Dumbledore's Army&quot;]], is broken up by the actions of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]]. Umbridge calls him in to witness the capture and punishment of the group, who are supposedly meeting in direct violation of Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four, which prohibits unapproved student groups. Fudge is dismayed to find that the only meeting of which they have direct evidence actually occurred before the Decree was made, and therefore is not in violation, and is further upset when Miss Edgecombe refuses to repeat the story she had told Professor Umbridge, instead silently maintaining that there had been no meetings since the first. However, Umbridge does finally retrieve the Dumbledore's Army membership list, and Dumbledore quietly agrees that, as Fudge had supposed, Dumbledore was creating a private army. However, when Fudge demands that he give himself up, Dumbledore refuses; in the ensuing, brief battle, Fudge, along with Umbridge and the Aurors Fudge has brought, are rendered unconscious and Dumbledore escapes. Fudge, on regaining his senses, runs off thinking that he is chasing Dumbledore.

At this point, Fudge manages to get Umbridge appointed Headmistress. However, she is unable to enter the Headmaster's office, remaining in her original office.

Finally, at the end of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle at the Ministry]], Fudge actually sees the returned Voldemort, who is rescuing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], one of his supporters. Fudge blusters at Dumbledore, but eventually must concede that Dumbledore and Harry were right all along, and that Voldemort has returned.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] === 

At the beginning of this book, we find out that Cornelius Fudge has been fired as the Minister for Magic in favor of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]], though he has stayed on as Scrimgeour's assistant. He appears in the Muggle prime minister's office at the start of the book, to brief the Muggle Prime Minister on the current state of affairs in the Wizarding world and introduce Scrimgeour. When the Prime Minister asks why they can't eliminate the threat by using magic, it is Fudge who points out that the other side has magic also. He has very little additional role to play in this book, though he does attend Dumbledore's funeral.

== Strengths ==
Though it takes seeing Voldemort with his own eyes, Fudge does admit that he was wrong. Umbridge conceals from Fudge the fact that she ordered the dementors to attack Harry and later plans to do the same with her use of the Cruciatus Curse, implying that Fudge has at least enough morals that he would disapprove of these actions if he knew about them.

== Weaknesses ==
Cornelius Fudge is first and foremost a politician.  His primary concerns are the viability of his post and his popularity.  When faced with the inconvenient truth of Voldemort's return, Fudge chooses to deny the danger to the Wizarding World.  Instead, he labors to discredit those who, in his opinion, threaten his political power.  Ultimately he shows himself to be paranoid, self-centered and without scruples.  He also appears to be somewhat gullible, being easily duped by Lucius Malfoy and apparently failing to recognise Umbridge for what she was.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Nowhere in the books do we see Fudge in anything except his political persona. If he has relationships based on anything except political advantage, we remain unaware of them. We note that his relationship with Dumbledore is seen to change over the story arc: Hagrid tells us that Fudge is perpetually seeking Dumbledore's advice in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', but at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', Cornelius determines that accepting Dumbledore's statement would be political suicide, and so turns against him. This rift likely can never heal, as Dumbledore wisely comments at one point that &quot;it is far easier to forgive someone for being wrong, than to forgive them for being right.&quot; Added to the fact that Dumbledore was right about Voldemort, is the fact that Fudge lost office almost immediately after Voldemort's return was independently confirmed, a loss for which he almost certainly would blame Dumbledore, and we can guess that Fudge likely never spoke to Dumbledore again. We suspect that Fudge's motive for attending Dumbledore's funeral was equally political.

== Analysis ==

Cornelius Fudge is presented from the beginning as a classic politician, whose planning horizon extends no further than his own re-election. While it is not safe to guess at his motivations, we can see that he is modeled on any of a large number of politicians active in democratic governments throughout the world. The author has clearly studied the ways of politicians, and has amplified the self-serving characteristics in order to make a thoroughly unpleasant, shallow &quot;leader&quot; for the Wizarding government.

This being nominally a series of books for children, one may wonder why the author chose to install such a venial government? Our introduction to the Ministry is Hagrid's comment in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', about the Ministry of Magic messing up again. One can hear echoes of this statement at very nearly every family breakfast table most mornings, as the daily newspaper is perused. Perhaps part of the intent is to illuminate the reasoning behind the utterance. Alternately, perhaps this portrayal of the Wizarding government's failings is a way to enlighten children as to why they should not blindly trust the government. Fudge's obvious self-serving nature, seen in these books without the intervening shielding layers of &quot;spin-doctors&quot; and mass media common in the Muggle world, can be held up for comparison with the antics of real politicians. As the books' story arc progresses, and the Ministry is ever-more exposed, the reader may be able to draw tighter parallels between the morning expression of distrust of the government and the actual actions of the people involved in it.

On a completely irrelevant note: In [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10419436/JK-Rowling-denies-finding-Harry-Potter-inspiration-on-narwhal-tusk.html October 2013, a narwhal tusk was auctioned off] that had been ''Presented to Cornelius Fudge. Master at Arms. By his mess mates as a mark of respect and esteem on his leaving H.M.S London at Zanzibar to retire from the service. September 1881.'' The owner of the tusk had written to J. K. Rowling to ask if there was any connection, and she responded that there was none she was aware of.

I think the idea of moving lymph to immunity is good- I also think that this chapter has a lot of repeating information said different ways- maybe that's part of the reason it seems so long [[User:Stephanie greenwood|Stephanie greenwood]] 17:15, 19 March 2007 (UTC)


Should we remove the stuff about the lymph system since it has to do a lot with immunity and put it in there?[[User:Danseyffert|Danseyffert]] 04:14, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
I have been doing some research on this subject and the other phys books have alot of anatomy in them also. I think it is necessary and needs more detail, but I could be wrong. It is a very long chapter though and maybe we should reduce some of it. I am not sure where either. [[User:Danseyffert|Danseyffert]] 03:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
I feel like this chapter is huge!! I just don't know where to start as far as removing things- Suggestions would be really helpful. I know that the anatomy is important but it seems like that is all this chapter is. I also agree with Trevan, let's improve the EKG section and take some of the anatomy out. Let me know your opinion  [[User:Stephanie greenwood|Stephanie greenwood]] 03:31, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

I have added a brief blub on cardiac muscle contraction.  I also think there needs to be more on an the EKG portion considering it is important for nurses to know.[[User:Trevan5|Trevan5]] 14:34, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the content from [[Microeconomics/Opportunity Cost]], which should be deleted after merged with this page.


Formally, opportunity cost is the cost of the next best forgone alternative. That is, it is the cost that one incurs by taking a specific decision rather than some other.
For example, assume that I have $5.00 with me, and I have two choices how to spend that money: buy a movie ticket or eat lunch. If I choose to buy a movie ticket, then the forgone alternative was buying lunch with that same money. This is just a small example of opportunity cost using money. However, there are more interesting examples.
Opportunity cost is a result of scarcity. Any limited resource will incur an opportunity cost. In the previous example, the scarce resource is money; there is a finite amount available to me, and I can do only one thing with it. Opportunity cost is important in topics such as life insurance, which provides a hedge against the opportunity cost (in terms of income that will never be earned) of someone's death.
Opportunity cost is also the 'unseen' or intangible cost incurred by a person when undertaking an endeavor. For example, time that could be used working and earning money could be the opportunity cost to someone who is a full-time student. The limited resource here is the student's time, which is &quot;spent&quot; in study rather than in earning income.
A final example is the case of a family business. If a family member works in the business without a salary, there are two opportunity costs involved. The opportunity cost to the business is the wage that it would have paid another non-family employee. Alternatively, the opportunity cost to the family member is the wage she would have recieved if she were working elsewhere.

[[Microeconomics/Supply and Demand]]
[[Macroeconomics/Supply and Demand]]

&quot;The principle of supply and demand is one of the best-known principles of economic theory. It was first posited by Jean-Baptiste Say, an 18th-century Classical Political Economist who suggested that demand and supply are interrelated. His theory was that the higher demand there is for something, the more people want it. The more that people want it (the more they value it), the more they are willing to pay for it. For example: There are 100 dolls and 400 people that want those dolls. Since there are more people that want dolls than there are dolls, people will pay more money for them.

Alfred Marshall, a famous neoclassical economist, went further in the mid-20th century and argued developed a mathematical model of supply and demand. The two variables in this theory are price and amount.&quot;{[[Introduction to Economics]]}

== Overview ==
'''''Fawkes''''' is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|phoenix]] owned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]].

== Role In The Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Fawkes is not directly present, though it becomes apparent later that one of only two feathers he ever gave to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]] is the core of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'s wand, and the other one is the core of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s wand.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

We are introduced to Fawkes initially when Harry is called into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s office; Fawkes, looking very ill, is then at the end of his life and bursts into flame while Harry watches, appalled. This is Harry's first exposure to the phoenix; he doesn't realize that Fawkes will be reborn shortly from his own ashes.

In the climactic battle with the returning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], Fawkes appears in response to Harry's declaration of faithfulness to Dumbledore. Fawkes brings with him the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]], and pecks the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk's]] eyes out so that Harry will not be destroyed by them. When Harry takes an envenomed wound from the basilisk, Fawkes sheds tears on it and heals Harry. And finally, he lifts Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]] out of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] and returns them to safety.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Fawkes is not mentioned in this book; we assume that he is sitting on his perch in Professor Dumbledore's office, but Harry has no reason to visit Dumbledore's office during the course of the year.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Fawkes does not appear to directly play a significant role in this book. He appears briefly when Harry makes two visits to Dumbledore's office. During the second visit, which occurs after a confrontation between Harry and Voldemort accompanied by his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], Fawkes heals Harry's injured leg with his tears.

Prior to this visit, Harry and Voldemort attempt to duel using their wands. Two spells - an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|Expelliarmus]] from Harry, and an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Avada Kedavra]] from Voldemort - intercept each other in mid-flight, and an unusual effect occurs: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]]. Harry and Voldemort are surrounded by a web of light strands, which is then accompanied by phoenix song - Harry recognizes this song as the same music that he heard in the Chamber of Secrets. It is not explicitly ''Fawkes''' music, but it is clearly phoenix song.

The Priori Incantatem effect is explained by Dumbledore during Harry's second visit to his office; Harry and Voldemort's wand cores are phoenix feathers, both of which were given to Ollivander by Fawkes.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Dumbledore wakes Fawkes up so that he can be warned if anyone is approaching while Harry and the others are being sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. Fawkes delivers the message to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] is injured, provides a warning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]'s approach, and then delivers the message from Molly to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] and the Weasley children that Arthur is safe.

Fawkes carries Dumbledore away from Hogwarts after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]] attempt to put him under arrest.

In the climactic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle at the Ministry]], Fawkes saves Dumbledore from Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing curse]] by swallowing the spell. This, of course, kills him, but he regenerates instantly as a chick. When Dumbledore returns to his office, the first thing he does is tenderly place Fawkes into the bed of ashes under his perch.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Fawkes is largely unseen this year. Although Harry makes many visits to Dumbledore's office, Fawkes is only mentioned in the narrative in passing.

Shortly after Dumbledore's death, Fawkes takes flight around Hogwarts, singing his music. The main characters clearly identify his music as a lament: eerie and beautiful, yet speaking of loss and despair. Later in the evening, Fawkes apparently departs, as the phoenix lament stops. 

His location is not known at the end of Half-Blood Prince.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Fawkes is mentioned only in passing, in the discussion of how to destroy a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Apparently, a Horcrux will mend itself if it can do so by ordinary magical means; one of the few things that can destroy it is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] venom, because the only thing that can heal that is Phoenix tears, and the Phoenix is definitely not ordinary magic.

== Strengths ==
His tears have healing powers.

He can carry immensely heavy loads.

He cannot die - If he sustains fatal wounds he will merely burst into flames and be reborn from the ashes.

He can teleport from one place to another instantly, regardless of magical enchantments that prevent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition/Disapparition]]. This is used very rarely; we only see it in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', when Dumbledore sends Fawkes on a number of errands following Harry's dream of the snake, and when Dumbledore escapes arrest.

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships With Other Characters ==
&quot;They make amazingly loyal pets.&quot; Fawkes is Dumbledore's pet, following instructions from him and assisting him in a number of ways. It appears Fawkes also extends this loyalty to Harry, so long as Dumbledore is alive, as Harry is loyal to Dumbledore.

== Analysis ==

In Muggle mythos, witches and wizards tend to have animal familiars, much as Muggles have pets. Possibly the belief is that as we ascribe human-like characteristics to our pets, so must wizards; but with the advantage of magical powers, wizards may be able to enhance the characters of their companion animals to make them more helpful to their owners. We have seen earlier that Hogwarts allows bringing pets, to a limit of one; we see that all three of the principal characters have pets (Harry has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] starts with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], then adopts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]]), and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Trevor|Trevor]]. We also have seen that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermes|Hermes]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] may have a pet eagle owl. It is not surprising, then, that Dumbledore would have a pet, and we could guess a fairly exotic one, given his age and stature, both in the story and in the Wizarding world. What better than a phoenix?

It is worth note, perhaps, that the various attributes ascribed to phoenixes in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' are not part of the Muggle myth. We do note that every attribute ascribed here to Fawkes is used in the story. It is uncertain whether Fawkes was planned to be in attendance at the duel at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', or whether he was added at the last minute, but it is to the author's credit that he seems organic to that battle.

We are told that Fawkes has only ever provided two of his feathers for wand cores. These wands are owned by Harry and Voldemort respectively. This &quot;twin wand&quot; issue will allow Harry to hold his own against Voldemort in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|duel in the cemetery]] in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', and will prove a major distraction to Voldemort in the final book.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#Phoenixes are immortal. The person to whom he was loyal (Dumbledore) passes at the end of book 6. Where is Fawkes now?

== Greater Picture ==

The cycle of renewal that is the life of a Phoenix may symbolize the renewal that Dumbledore himself went through as a younger man, when he was forced to react to the way his youthful, idealistic plans had been subverted. In the final book, we will learn that Dumbledore and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]] had considered overthrowing the Wizarding world's governing structure in favour of one that would allow wizards and Muggles to co-exist in full knowledge each of the other, with wizards ruling all &quot;for the greater good&quot;. When Grindelwald perverted this idea into an excuse for dominating and destroying Muggle civilization in Europe, Dumbledore was eventually forced to duel his one-time best friend. This no doubt either caused his decision, or cemented an earlier resolve, to avoid leadership, including the post of Minister for Magic once offered to him.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] implants a false vision into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s mind to trick Harry into believing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] is being tortured at the Department of Mysteries within the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Despite [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s warnings that the vision may be false and leading him into a trap, Harry, accompanied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], rushes to London. Inside the Department of Mysteries, the group is ambushed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. The students fight for their lives and are nearly defeated when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] reinforcements, including Sirius, arrive to help. 

As a battle ensues, Sirius faces off with his Death Eater cousin, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], in a room containing a raised stone dais in the center of a sunken pit. Upon the dais is a stone archway, covered with a tattered black veil. Sirius is hit by Bellatrix's curse, and his stunned body arcs into the air and floats through the archway, disappearing behind the veil. Harry expects Sirius to reappear on the other side, but he never does. Harry attempts to go after him but is restrained by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], who tells him Sirius is dead. Harry is forced to admit that his godfather is gone.

== Event Details ==

Exhausted from studying for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL exams]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] falls asleep during his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]] exam. He dreams that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] is in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], where he is torturing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. Having previously had similar dreams that contained real events, Harry concludes that this dream, also, is real, and demands that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] assist him in rescuing Sirius. Hermione suggests that Voldemort could be setting a trap for Harry, so Harry decides to use the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]] to see if Sirius is still at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Headquarters]].

Harry breaks in to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]'s office to use her fireplace, the only one unmonitored by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. There, he talks to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-Elf]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], who says that Sirius will never return from the Department of Mysteries. Immediately after this, he is caught by Umbridge, along with Ron, Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], who had volunteered to help distract Umbridge and the students, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

Umbridge summons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] to provide [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]] to determine who Harry was talking to; Snape refuses. Harry, remembering that Snape is a member of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]], tries to pass a message to him, but does not seem to be successful. Hermione convinces Umbridge that Harry had been working with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] and the students to create a weapon, and leads Harry and Umbridge into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Hermione deliberately leads them into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]] territory, knowing Umbridge's feelings about &quot;half-breeds&quot;. When the Centaurs find them, Umbridge insults and attacks them, and as a result is captured and carried away into the woods. Harry and Hermione narrowly avoid the same fate when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]], looking for his half-brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], stumbles into the clearing, and invites an attack by the Centaurs.

While they are considering their next move, they are met by the other four students who, having overpowered the Inquisitorial Squad that had been holding them, have followed Harry and Hermione. When Harry insists on going to London to save Sirius, Luna suggests flying there on the school's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]] (winged horse-like creatures). Though Harry tries to eliminate some of the students, Thestrals keep arriving, attracted by the scent of Grawp's blood on Harry and Hermione. Once there are sufficient Thestrals for all the students, Harry can no longer explain leaving some of them out of the rescue attempt, so all six mount up and fly to London. 

Entering through the Visitor's entrance to the Ministry, Harry is alarmed to find the watch-wizard inexplicably absent. Following his recurring dreams through the year, Harry leads the group to the Department of Mysteries, and after several false paths, into a large room filled with many wooden shelves containing glass orbs. Reaching the place where he believed he had seen Sirius and Voldemort, he finds nobody there. Ron notices a glass sphere with Harry's and Voldemort's names on it. Just as Harry grasps it, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], led by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], appear, demanding he hand over the sphere. On Harry's silent command, the students blast the shelves, shattering many of the orbs. They run from the Death Eaters, but end up separated. Harry, Hermione, and Neville are attacked by four Death Eaters, and Hermione is knocked out, while Neville's wand and nose are broken; in a separate group, Ginny's ankle is broken and Ron is hit with a spell that makes him seem drunk. They re-group, but are attacked again; in the retreat, Ron is attacked by brains floating in a glass tank, and Ginny and Luna are knocked out.

Harry tries to make his stand alone in a room with a stone archway containing a veil. Neville, ineffectively trying to help, is quickly captured and tortured by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]. As Harry is on the verge of surrendering the orb, several members of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]], including Sirius Black, arrive and start dueling the Death Eaters. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] fights with Bellatrix but is injured. Sirius takes on his cousin Bellatrix, taunting her that she can fight better. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] arrives and stops most of the fighting, but Bellatrix and Sirius continue. She casts a powerful curse, blasting him in the chest and sending him through the veiled arch. When he fails to reappear on the other side, Harry realizes Sirius is dead.

== Notable Consequences ==

*Harry loses another father figure. He has already lost his father and his impression of his father, and has lost contact with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]]; the reader may be wondering how many times this will happen, especially considering [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 22|near brush with death]] in this book.

*Harry chases Bellatrix Lestrange into the Ministry Atrium. In his battle with Bellatrix, he uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]]. This marks Harry's first time using an Unforgivable Curse.

*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] appears and comes to Bellatrix' assistance. Dumbledore also arrives to protect Harry, and duels directly with Voldemort. Many Ministry wizards, summoned by Dumbledore, arrive in time to see Voldemort in person. This is unequivocal proof that Voldemort has returned, vindicating Dumbledore and Harry. This is expected to result in the Ministry finally taking an active stance against Voldemort.

*The Death Eaters remaining in the Room of the Veil, and presumably the disabled ones who did not take part in that battle, have openly declared themselves and are sent to Azkaban. As one of them is Lucius Malfoy, we can expect this to have some effect on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]. The reader may wonder how likely they are to stay in Azkaban, given that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] have entered Voldemort's service.

*During the battle with Dumbledore, Voldemort briefly takes over Harry's mind, challenging Dumbledore to kill him by killing Harry. Harry, seeing death as the only way to re-unite with his parents and particularly Sirius, welcomes death. This desire for death, and the love Harry feels for Sirius in particular, causes Voldemort to leave Harry's mind.

*Harry blames Dumbledore for Sirius' death and rages at the Headmaster in his office following the battle at the Ministry. However, Harry initially overlooks his own rash behavior and his reluctance to learn [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] that allowed Voldemort to penetrate his mind and manipulate him. He also fails to realize that Sirius' unstable mental state and careless actions ultimately contributed to his own death.

*Harry also blames himself for Sirius' death, however, he directs his anger at Snape and Dumbledore to ease his guilt.

*Harry's rage at Dumbledore may be part of what allows Dumbledore to realize his mistake in not telling Harry what was going on. Dumbledore had simply informed Harry, through [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], that he was to learn Occlumency, and had not explained why. It is as part of making amends for that, and other omissions, that Dumbledore now, finally, speaks of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]] and what it means to Harry.

*Harry will try a number of things to regain contact with Sirius, including the magic mirror that Sirius gave him at Christmas, and hopeful discussions of the nature of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghosts]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]]. It will be his talking with Luna Lovegood about the Veil that Sirius had fallen through, and how both he and Luna had heard the voices on the other side, that will give him the most peace.

== Analysis ==

After Sirius' death, Dumbledore and Harry speak in Dumbledore's office for an entire chapter. During that conversation, we learn much, but by no means all, of the background of the battle that is going on.

Dumbledore first explains that the fault for Sirius' death lies with him, as he should have been more forthcoming with Harry as to what was happening. Having heard of Harry's dreams in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|July]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 29|May]] the previous (school) year, Dumbledore believed there was a link between Harry's mind and Voldemort's, presumably caused by the abortive attempt by Voldemort to kill Harry, but he was then unsure of its precise nature. With Voldemort re-embodied, he now believes that the link would be stronger, and he has taken steps to distance himself from Harry, so as to prevent Voldemort from using the bond between them as a weapon against either or both of them. He never explained to Harry what he was doing, which had left Harry feeling abandoned. When the link became undeniable at Christmas, when Harry perceived Voldemort's attack on Arthur Weasley, Dumbledore, still without explanation, had sent Snape to teach Harry Occlumency, not realizing that the hatred between Harry and Snape was far too deep to allow instruction in something so complex.

Dumbledore also reveals that a prophecy had been made about Harry and Voldemort. Harry has been marked (by Voldemort) to face a final mortal combat with the Dark Lord. This revelation appears to bring Harry and Dumbledore closer. The prophecy's revelation and its effect on Harry hold great importance in the overall picture.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#What does the veiled arch represent?
#Who is ultimately responsible for Sirius' death? Is more than one person to blame?
#What was the ''whispering'' Harry and Luna heard coming from the veil? What could it mean?

== Greater Picture ==

Sirius' death is a huge loss for Harry, and as we will see in the early part of the next book, he reacts by isolating himself. As he recovers from this blow, Harry realizes that Voldemort used his godfather to get to him, and he fears his friends will always be in mortal danger as long as Voldemort lives. This may be part of the reason Harry allows himself to get closer to Dumbledore: he believes Dumbledore, &quot;the only one he (Voldemort) ever feared,&quot; will not be attacked by Voldemort, so friendship with Harry will not imperil him.

It is because he is trying to protect Ginny from this avenue of attack that he will attempt to end their budding romantic relationship at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. More information is available in the articles about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Harry Potter|Harry's]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Ginny Weasley|Ginny's]] relationships.

Given that this link between Voldemort and Harry exists, we might wonder why Dumbledore feels able to speak so freely with Harry following the battle in the Ministry. It is mentioned above that Voldemort is repelled by Harry's longing for death and love of Sirius when Voldemort occupies his mind during the battle. Dumbledore, recognizing the reason for Voldemort's abrupt departure, now believes that Voldemort will not choose to re-enter Harry's mind, a place that he finds &quot;extremely uncomfortable,&quot; as Dumbledore remarks in the next book. It is likely that Dumbledore initially does not know how long Voldemort's reluctance will last, but believes that he has at least long enough to bring Harry fully up to date. He seems guardedly pleased but unsurprised in the next book when Harry confirms that his scar has not been troubling him since these events.

We will learn in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] that the link between Harry and Voldemort is actually a shard of Voldemort's soul that had broken off when Voldemort attempted to murder Harry, and adhered to Harry's soul. Given that the link is something other than the exercise of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]], and that it is in fact attached rather directly to Harry's soul, it is quite possible that Occlumency would have no effect. As Occlumency appears to be intended to prevent another from reading one's mind, and the specific issue we are trying to prevent is another impressing his thoughts in one's mind, it is uncertain whether Occlumency would be the appropriate technique in any case.

Harry will use the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]] to summon Sirius' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|shade]], as well as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]]'s and his parents' shades, as he leaves Hogwarts to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|meet his doom]] in the final book. It seems it is then that he finally reaches closure in his understanding of Sirius' death, as he is then preparing for his own imminent death.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

After seeing a vision of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] being tortured, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and five members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] go to the Department of Mysteries at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], where they are trapped by twelve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. They are later helped by a few members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order of the Phoenix]], although [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] is killed. When the Order is strengthened by the arrival of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], Harry chases Sirius's killer, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], and duels her. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] appears on the scene, but Dumbledore comes to Harry's rescue. They duel, and Voldemort [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|apparates]] away with Bellatrix, but not before being seen by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|the Minister for Magic]].

== Event Details ==

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] has a vision of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] being tortured by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] in the Department of Mysteries at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Harry tries to find a member of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] to confirm Sirius' whereabouts, but the only one he can remember at the school is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], who he discovers has been sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. In order to attempt direct communications with Sirius via the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]], Harry arranges a distraction with the help of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and accepts assistance from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] to block student access to the hall outside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]'s office. Then, with Hermione, he enters Umbridge's office to use the fireplace, which is the only one not being monitored. When he contacts Sirius's home, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elf]], tells Harry that Sirius &quot;will never return from the Department of Mysteries&quot;.

Umbridge pulls Harry out of the fireplace, and Harry sees that between herself and her Inquisitorial Squad, she has captured all of the conspirators plus [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]]. Umbridge summons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], demanding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]] to allow her to discover who Harry was talking to, but Snape says that he had already given her all his Veritaserum and it would take months to make more. As Snape is leaving, Harry, suddenly remembering that Snape is a member of the Order of the Phoenix, tries to tell Snape what he has perceived, but Snape appears to take no notice.

Umbridge then decides to use cruder methods to extract the truth from Harry. To prevent Umbridge from casting the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]], Hermione makes up a story about a &quot;weapon&quot; in the forest, and says that they were trying to contact [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] to let him know it was ready. Umbridge believes her, and follows Hermione as she leads them into the part of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]] roam. Surprised by Centaurs, Umbridge insults them to the point where they capture her and take her away, in the process, possibly accidentally, breaking her wand. The centaurs now try to determine what to do with Harry and Hermione, who had apparently deliberately brought the irritating Umbridge into their midst. The debate is interrupted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s half brother, who arrives and creates a diversion.

The two, managing to get away from Grawp and the Centaurs, are then joined by Ginny, Neville, Ron, and Luna, who have overpowered the Inquisitorial Squad members and retrieved Hermione's and Harry's wands. Luna points out that they can fly to the Ministry on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]]. Arriving at the Ministry, they enter through the visitor's entrance, and proceed down to the Department of Mysteries. On their way to the place Harry saw in his vision, they step into a room featuring a black veil, behind which Harry, Luna, and apparently Ron can hear voices.

The place of Harry's vision turns out to be a vast hall, filled with shelves full of glass phials. Though they are in the place that Harry had seen, there is no sign of Sirius or Voldemort. Looking around, Ron notices a phial that has Harry's name on it, and Harry, curious, lifts it off the shelf. Suddenly, the six students are surrounded by a group of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. The Death Eaters, led by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], identify the phial as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]] and demand that Harry turn it over.The students use the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Reducto|Reductor Curse]] on some of the shelves, and manage to escape the room and scatter in the confusion. Harry, Hermione, and Neville end up in the Hall of Time, while Ginny, Luna, and Ron apparently end up in a different hall. Harry, Neville, and Hermione are cornered by a pair of Death Eaters. They manage to disable the Death Eaters, but in the process Hermione is knocked out and Neville's wand and nose are broken by a kick from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]].

Harry manages to bring the unconscious Hermione and the wounded Neville to the anteroom, where they meet up with Ginny's group. Before they can find their way into the hallway outside, a second door into the anteroom opens and more Death Eaters, led by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], enter and resume the attack. The students retreat through a doorway, finding themselves in a room lined with large tanks apparently containing floating brains; Ron, who has been left acting drunk by a spell attack, summons one of the brains and is incapacitated by the &quot;tentacles&quot; of thought emanating painfully from it. Retreating again into a study room, Harry and Luna as the only uninjured members of the group start trying to seal the doors, but Death Eaters enter through an as-yet unsealed door, and disable Luna and Ginny. Harry, knowing that the Death Eaters are only after him, tries to draw them away by running through a different doorway, and promptly falls down the stone steps of the amphitheater of the room of the Veil.

Standing on the dais of the Veil, Harry is now alone against the ten remaining Death Eaters. For some reason, they seem unwilling to force Harry to give up the Prophecy which he still holds. The standoff is broken by Neville, who bursts onto the scene trying to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] the Death Eaters and failing; whether it is because he is trying to use Hermione's wand, or because his speech is impaired by his broken nose, his spells are ineffectual. Two Death Eaters seize him, and Bellatrix uses the Cruciatus curse on him, as she had on his parents, to force Harry to give up the prophecy. As Harry wavers, five members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Sirius Black, arrive and start dueling the Death Eaters. During the ensuing battle, Harry gives Neville the Prophecy to free up his hands. Neville is hit by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tarantallegra|Tarantallegra jinx]]. As Harry tries to pull him up the steps to safety, Neville's robe rips and the Prophecy falls on the ground and shatters. 

As the battle rages, Dumbledore arrives and quickly subdues most of the fighters. One battle, though, is still going on, between Bellatrix and Sirius, who by now is standing on the dais of the Veil. Bellatrix fires a spell at his chest, and Sirius falls through the black veil, never to be seen again.

Bellatrix now runs up the amphitheater steps and out through the Hall of Thought, where the tanks of brains are. Enraged, Harry chases after her, catching up to her in the Atrium, where they duel. Suddenly, Dumbledore and Voldemort arrive, and duel each other, with Harry and Lestrange restrained by moving statues charmed out of the Fountain of Magical Brethren. Voldemort then tries to possess Harry, and flees when Harry's love for Sirius chases him out of Harry's mind. As Voldemort returns physically to free Bellatrix, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] and a number of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]], summoned by Dumbledore, arrive and see him. Reluctantly, Fudge must now accept that Harry and Dumbledore were telling the truth all year. While Fudge is still stuttering over these revelations, Dumbledore creates a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]], and hands it to Harry; it promptly takes Harry to Dumbledore's office.

== Notable Consequences ==

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Sirius' Death|The death of Sirius]] will make Harry very sad and angry over the summer, and also deprive him of one of his greatest friends and his godfather. However, Sirius will leave the house at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] to Harry in his will; if Harry is actually able to take possession, a point which we won't have cleared up until the next book, he may be able to use the house as a refuge, it being so well concealed.

The remaining Death Eaters, trapped in the amphitheater by Dumbledore, will be sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]]. With the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] having departed to enter Voldemort's service, this may prove a pointless exercise; however, it does clearly show the Wizarding World where the loyalties of the captured Death Eaters lie. In particular, this will prove an issue for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], who is now clearly a criminal. This will significantly change [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s status as well, as he is now the child of a convicted felon. Draco will end up taking his anger out on Harry, with the mistaken, but all too human, idea that it was Harry's fault that Lucius got caught, rather than Lucius' fault for breaking the law.

The chain of events that culminates with Harry's mission to the Ministry will demonstrate to Dumbledore the risks of being secretive; it is a lack of information that misled Harry into believing the images Voldemort was sending him. This realization will trigger a much more complete statement from Dumbledore regarding the situation with Voldemort and the Wizarding world. Dumbledore will explain the reason for his unwillingness to meet with Harry over the course of this year, and the reason for his setting Snape to teach Harry Occlumency. He will explain why Harry is able to see Voldemort's thoughts, and his worries about what Voldemort would do if he perceived that the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore was anything more than headmaster to student. Finally, and most importantly, he will reveal the text of the prophecy that Voldemort had been seeking, that it states that either Voldemort or Harry must die, &quot;one must die at the hand of the other,&quot; and go into some detail as to how this is interpreted. 

Dumbledore's comments on the loyalty of house-elves and the need to treat them honorably, which he makes in his office after the battle, may have some effect on Harry in later books.

Finally, the Wizarding world is now aware that Voldemort is back, which signals the start of the Second Wizarding War. This also will likely mark the end of the campaign against both Harry and Dumbledore, and may result in the restoration of Dumbledore's various official positions. Dumbledore requests also that the Aurors stop chasing his groundskeeper, which means that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] will no longer be a fugitive.

== Analysis ==

We have been told many times that the purpose of Harry's being taught [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] is to prevent Voldemort having access to Harry's mind. It is after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 21|the attack]] on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] that Dumbledore realizes there may be a mental connection between Harry and Voldemort, and it is at that time that he charges Professor Snape with teaching Harry Occlumency. This actually may be one of Dumbledore's few mistakes. The obvious mistake, and one that Dumbledore later admits himself, lies in Dumbledore's selection of teacher; Harry and Snape hate each other, and Harry is unable to learn anything useful from Snape. This is not the first time Dumbledore has made this mistake; in the closing chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', he apparently assumed that Snape and Sirius would be able to set aside their mutual hatred and work with each other, and while they have managed to work together, we have seen that their mutual friction has still gotten to the point of wands drawn. Less obviously to the reader, Dumbledore apparently assumes that Voldemort's intent is to read Harry's mind, when it becomes apparent to the reader that the intent is rather to insert images into Harry's mind. Our story does not indicate whether Occlumency will prevent this effect. In any event, it is the placement of images into Harry's mind that leads him to the Ministry.

This particular episode is a remarkably good example of the art of the story-teller, as well. The author hurries us along the path that Harry is following, and does not leave us time to consider several large discrepancies. For instance, when Harry sees Voldemort and Sirius in the Ministry of Magic, it does not occur to him, or to us, to wonder how Voldemort could possibly have gotten into the Ministry undetected at three in the afternoon on a weekday. Hermione does bring this point up, but Harry runs over it so quickly that we, as readers, pay little attention to it. Neither we nor Harry think of the magic mirror Sirius had given Harry at Christmas. In Harry's disappointment at finding Professor McGonagall gone, it does not occur to us that Snape is a member of the Order. The author does an excellent job of not only showing us Harry's sense of urgency, but of making us share it.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One of the major things that this particular escapade taught Harry was that it was possible for Voldemort to generate false mental images and plant them into Harry's mind. Knowing that this is possible, it is significantly less likely that Harry will be taken in later by false scenarios that Voldemort generates. Hermione, of course, is less certain. Knowing that Harry has been taken in by mistaken perceptions of Voldemort's thoughts, Hermione is always suspicious of the perceptions Harry receives from him, until almost the end of the seventh book. It is only during the battle at Hogwarts in the seventh book that Hermione actively asks Harry to look into Voldemort's mind, to see where Voldemort is.

In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', the book immediately following this event, Dumbledore will ask if Harry has had any pains in his scar; on being told no, he will say that he is not surprised that Harry's scar has stopped hurting. Voldemort will have found Harry's mind, with its love for Sirius, a very uncomfortable place to inhabit. After this episode, Voldemort never tries to re-enter Harry's mind, with its deep emotions that he cannot understand. However, Harry is able to perceive what Voldemort is thinking at times of great emotional stress for Voldemort. Harry's own emotional stress seems to dampen these perceptions.

As mentioned above, Dumbledore had intended Occlumency to be a means of breaking this mental bond between Harry and Voldemort. It is entirely possible that, even with a more suitable teacher, it would not have worked. Indications are that Dumbledore, as early as the end of Harry's second year at Hogwarts, suspected that Voldemort's already tattered soul ripped again, either at the death of Harry's mother or, more likely, at the attempt to kill Harry himself, and the detached fragment attached itself to Harry; we can see that Dumbledore becomes certain of this by fairly late in Harry's sixth year. It is uncertain whether that link between Harry's soul and Voldemort's can be broken by means of Occlumency, as there does not seem to be any similar event in magical history.

One must wonder when Dumbledore came to this conclusion about the soul shard having adhered to Harry. The reader may suspect that this was a conclusion Dumbledore had reached when he had heard Voldemort's plan to create multiple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], but this is uncertain. The first time we hear of this belief is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|Snape's memory]], from an occasion which we believe to be the same night as Ron's poisoning. Harry's successful retrieval of the memory from Slughorn which seems to confirm the creation of multiple Horcruxes, however, happens significantly after the date of Ron's birthday and poisoning, which means that Dumbledore will not have had confirmation of the number of Horcruxes at that time. As we cannot be absolutely certain of the dates of Snape's memory, however, this is inconclusive. One thing we do know is that Dumbledore had been concerned about the possibility of there being multiple Horcruxes since the discovery of the diary in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. He would have been certain that there were multiple Horcruxes by the beginning of the sixth book, as he had then found and destroyed the ring Horcrux; but we will learn that he had suspected the existence of multiple Horcruxes on hearing of the diary, which he says was crafted as a weapon, rather than as a road to immortality. Believing that at least two Horcruxes had been created, he could easily guess that there would be more, and that as a result Voldemort's soul would be less cohesive than it should be. Learning of Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|ability to speak with snakes]], Dumbledore likely guessed the existence and possibly the nature of the soul shard during the summer between Harry's second and third years. There is more speculation on this matter at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Harry-Voldemort Shared Thoughts|Harry &amp;mdash; Voldemort Shared Thoughts]].

== Interesting link regarding olfactory nerve ==

I discovered that the 2004 Nobel Prize was awarded for work relating to olfaction. I'm just putting this link here now, with hope that someone will come along and incorporate a bit of this into the text: [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2004/press.html 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology] [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 19:35, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

== The Sixth Sense:Balance ==

you know those nifty little semi-circular canals, between the ear drum &amp; the cochlea? They are the organs of balance. Try getting out of bed with out them.[[User:AptitudeDesign|AptitudeDesign]] ([[User talk:AptitudeDesign|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AptitudeDesign|contribs]]) 03:27, 27 April 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You might want to note [[m:ParserFunctions]].  Looks like we can have quite a bit of fanciness in the templates! -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:22, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

== discussion and pre ==

Note that uses of this template occasionally include some small amounts of discussion.  So putting &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; might be less than ideal.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:14, 9 June 2007 (UTC)
:Well, &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; proved to be impossible to put here.
:As for &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; - I think that this template should be split into two templates or more. For example, interactive examples may be better with a different layout. In the meantime, there's no functional change to the old behavior. (Correct me if i'm wrong.) --[[User:Amire80|Amir E. Aharoni]] 16:23, 9 June 2007 (UTC)
::I add new templates which should be able to do this (also added documentation): [[Template:HaskellSourceExample]], [[Template:HaskellGHCiExample]] --[[User:Rudis|Rudis]] ([[User talk:Rudis|talk]]) 13:09, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
:::Ignore my last comment regarding [[Template:HaskellSourceExample]]. It can't be used because wikimedia syntax can't handle &lt;code&gt;{{!}}&lt;/code&gt;s which are used in guards. I updated the documentation for [[Template:HaskellExample]] and will remove [[Template:HaskellSourceExample]].--[[User:Rudis|Rudis]] ([[User talk:Rudis|talk]]) 18:22, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

== Adjustments and etc. ==

I am moving the clipoard icon back to the left side. Having it on the right causes all sorts of formatting troubles due to the other box templates which lodge themselves next to the right margin. By the way, I do not really like this template. Considering that &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is working properly now - doing both pre and syntax highlighting jobs - I'd gladly remove it from all pages of the Wikibook proper (not counting places such as YAHT and so on). --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 02:40, 24 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Not sure if this matters for the cookbook, but these sentences are pretty specific to the western United States: ''&quot;Imported raspberries are from Chile, while most of the fruit comes from California. Raspberry season begins in June and lasts through October.&quot;'' Is the cookbook meant to be specifically for a US audience? -- [[User:SBJohnny|SB_Johnny]] 10:37, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

: No, but the source for many of our ingredient pages is a US government agency, so that is reflected in some of the texts. Update as appropriate. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:57, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== 7. List ways to care for your sailing equipment throughout the year. ==

* Drain and dry the boat. The first thing you should do when your boat is back on shore is to open the portholes and drain bungs. Always leave the boat with the drain bungs open and the portholes open, so the flotation tanks can dry out completely. Prop the boat up if needed to ensure the drain holes are the lowest point. You can place a piece of carpet on the ground under the transom, and raise the bow of the boat onto a sawhorse or support. Remember to close all drain holes before putting the boat back in the water.

* Organize your gear. Keep the hatches, drain bungs and other loose gear in one place, so you know they will always be there. After sailing, and after rinsing out or washing, and drying your sailing gear, put it back in a gear bag. It is frustrating to show up at the lake on a gorgeous day, only to discover that you left your sailing boots or some other piece of important gear, at home. 

* Sail care. You can leave the mainsail on the boom, if you will be sailing the boat again soon. Roll up the main from the head, perpendicular to the luff, so that it ends up in a roll parallel to the boom. Also roll the jib up, put it inside the jib bag, and leave that in the boat. All sails should be removed from the boat if it is to be trailered or stored out of the water for any length of time. All sails should be dried and folded or rolled and placed in sail bags ready for the next launch.

* Centerboard care. Leaving the board resting on the trolley or trailer may damage the leading edge, and you want your slot gaskets left flat (in the normal closed position), so they do not take on a permanent bend. If the centerboard up control does not have a shock cord take up, You can put the line into a cleat, so the board is held all the way up, in the centerboard trunk. Remove the dagger board completely from its slot.

* Rudder care. Lay the rudder in the boat, or buy or make a rudder bag and put the rudder blade in the bag as one of the first steps in derigging the boat.  Also check your rudder fittings. There should be no play in them. Replace them when they are worn. 

* Rig. If leaving the boat with the mast rigged leave the boat with a little rig tension to support the mast, but not so much as to load up the boat. 

* Cover. The boat should be covered with a good top cover that shields the boat from UV radiation. If the cover has holes in it, fix it or replace it. Figure out how to support the cover so that water does not collect in it. 

* Salt. Rinse salt water off the boat, rinsing out blocks, lines and once in awhile, inside the tanks. If the tanks ever leak, you get salt in the tanks, and you will want to rinse that out from time to time.

* Turnbuckle grease. If you have adjustable angle spreaders, lubricate the adjusters.  Use turnbuckle grease. If you don't lubricate these the stainless steel threaded part will permanently bond to the aluminum, and you will not be able to adjust them ever again. 

* Inspections. From time to time complete a visual inspection of your boat. There are lots of highly loaded areas on a small sailboat. The chainplates are among them. Check where your shrouds and forestay or jib halyard attach to the hull. Watch for cracks that could let water into wooden reinforcements. Heavily loaded fasteners should be epoxied into the boat. From time to time take your centerboard out of the boat and check both centerboard and rudder for dings, cracks etc. Pay particular attention to the centerboard bolt hole. If the bolt hole has been damaged such that water can get in, wooden cored boards will soak up water, start to rot and will be weakened. Seal all bare wood with epoxy. Anytime you run aground you should check the centerboard. Inspect all lines from time to time, replace worn lines.

== 8. Have a knowledge of at least 20 terms used in sailing and their meanings. ==

=== Sailing Terms. ===

;Abaft: Behind

;Abate: Become less intense or widespread: the storm suddenly abated.

;Abeam: 90° (perpendicular) to the side of the boat. 

;Aft: Towards the Stern or rear of the boat.

;Heel: The degree of sideways tilt caused by wind on the sails or balance of weight in the boat.

;In Irons: If the boat attempts to tack with a slow initial speed, or otherwise stops forward motion while heading into irons (front of the boat is facing the wind), the boat will coast to a stop and the lack of water flow over the rudder will cause the sailor to lose the ability to steer the boat. 

;Leeward: Away from the wind (downwind).

;Lee shore: Shore the wind is blowing toward

;Let Fly: Sails out of control. 
 
;Luffing: The flapping of the sail when not properly trimmed or when the boat is in irons.

;Luff Up: To turn the boat's head right into the wind.
 
;Reaching: Sailing on a tack with the wind roughly abeam, all sailing points between running and close- hauled.

;Running Free: To sail with the wind aft and with the sheets eased out.

;Trim: To pull the sails in towards the wind.

;Weather Shore: The shore from which the wind is blowing.
    
;Windward: Towards the wind (upwind).

== 9. Identify at least 15 parts of a sailboat. ==
The names of the parts of a sailboat can be broken down into three sets of terms:
* Parts of the sail
* Parts of the rigging
* Parts of the boat

=== Parts of the sail. ===

;Battens: Plastic or wooden slats inserted in the leech of the mainsail to help stabilize back edge.

;Clew: The lower aft corner of the mainsail. The clew is located where the leech and the foot intersect.
 
;Cringle: A grommet or metal ring in a sail though which a line is usually attached.

;Foot: The bottom edge of a sail. The foot of the sail is between the clew and the tack. 

;Grommet: A stainless steel ring within the clew, tack, or head of the mainsail. Used to connect a control line. Also known as cringle.

;Head: Top of the Sail.

;Jib: The sail between the forestay and the mast.  Also called the headsail. There are several sizes of Jibs.

;Leech (leach): The aft or back edge of the sail. Lies between the clew and the head.  

;Luff: The forward edge of the sail or the flapping of a sail when it is not trimmed properly.

;Mainsail: The sail aft of the mast which is attached to the mast and the boom.

;Roach (or roach line): An imaginary straight line between clew and head of the mainsail. Sail battens extend the leech of the mainsail beyond the roach line.

;Port: The boat's left side.     

;Rudder: A control surface located behind the transom. Used to steer your boat. Push the tiller to the left and the rudder goes right.

;Rudderhead: A metal housing that connect rudder, tiller, and transom. A kick-up rudderhead is designed to allow the rudder to &quot;kick-up&quot; or hinge rearward upon striking bottom while sailing. 
 
;Stern: Back of the boat.
 	
;Starboard: The boat's right side.

;Tiller: A spar attached to the rudder.  If you turn the tiller to port the boat will go to starboard.

;Transom: The aft (back) wall of your boat.

=== This illustration shows a number of parts of a small sail boat.===

== 10. Demonstrate the rescue of a person overboard. ==
'''Note: This requirement should be done under the supervision of an adult, with a rescue boat, to give assistance if needed.'''

If you see a person fall off a sailing boat, you should ''immediately'' take the following steps.
* Shout 'Man Overboard' to alert the captain and anyone else on board.
* Throw a life preserver or personal flotation device near the person in the water.
:(Not directly at him, nearby, but somewhat windward (upwind) of him is best)
* Assign a person (if available) to keep constant visual contact with the man over board (MOB). This person should try their best to keep their eyes on the MOB and know where he is in the water. This person should talk to the MOB constantly during a recovery keeping  communications between the boat and the MOB. If sailing with only two people and one should fall over, the remaining person must act as both captain and contact person.

There are two ways generally understood to bring the boat back to pick up the MOB.
* Either tack or jibe the boat around as quickly as possible and approach the MOB on a close reach to his leeward (downwind) side. Approaching from the leeward side avoids the danger of having the wind push the boat into or over the MOB. 
[[Image:Man Overboard Tack.svg|Tack to recover man overboard.]]

Jibing the boat around can be quicker than tacking, but should only be done when wind conditions make jibing quickly a safe maneuver.

[[Image:Man Overboard Jibe.svg|Jibe to recover man overboard.]]

* The second method is also known as a &quot;quick stop&quot;. Tack immediately after the person has fallen overboard, and keep your jib cleated  in place. The jib will turn the boat, and the captain luffs the main to allow the boat to drift toward the MOB. This method keeps the boat close to the MOB, which keeps the boat in contact with the MOB. This should not be attempted in high winds where keeping the jib cleated could cause a capsize.  

[[Image:Man Overboard Quick Stop.svg|Quick Stop to recover a man overboard.]]

In all three cases, if the MOB can't reach the boat as you approach, hold out a paddle for the person to grab.

It is a good idea to practice Man Overboard maneuvers. Dropping a filled 5 gallon bucket into the water and using it as a dummy makes a pretty realistic simulation. Lifting the bucket full of water over the transom gives you an idea of how it might feel to help a waterlogged sailer back on board.

== 11. Demonstrate what to do when a sailboat capsizes. ==
'''Note: This requirement should be done under the supervision of an adult, with a rescue boat, to give assistance if needed.'''

Capsizing is when your boat turns over (some say when the mast is in the water). A capsized boat may be either floating with the mast and sail lying on the water, or may have &quot;turned turtle&quot; lying with the mast pointing downwards. Some sailing schools tie a tether ball or flotation item to the top of the mast, so if a student capsizes the boat cannot turn turle. This is a good idea for beginner sailors.

A keel boat with a water tight or self draining cockpit normally rights herself because of the weight of the ballast keel. A small boat on the other hand has to be righted by the crew and there are a couple of methods. 

Capsizing isn't scary or dangerous on a fair-weather day if you know how to swim. This is the main reason for the swimming requirement before taking the sailing honour.

Capsizing usually results from heeling too far or an accidental jibe. If you feel your in real danger of tipping over, '''luff the main sail at once''' (which is to let out the main sheet to allow the air to flow out of the sail). If your boat does go over on its side, stay with it, '''never swim away.''' You must do several things quickly. 

[[Image:Capsized 001.jpg]]

Capsized boat.

=== Solo method ===
==== Stand on the center board ====
Fall down into the area between the hull and boom and swim out the back QUICKLY, ensuring you are not caught on any ropes. If the boat is very nearly turned upside down on top of you, however, then feel free to go out the side.
As quickly as possible stand on the center board (dagger board) to prevent the boat from turning completely upside down.

[[Image:Capsized 002.jpg]]

==== Free the sheets ====

Make sure that the main sheet (line that controls the main sail) is free and not secured tight in any way. Also if the boat has a jib sail, free the jib sheet as well. This will help the sails not fill with water when capsized, and not fill with air as soon as the boat is righted.

==== Point boat into the wind ====

If possible, get back into the water and position the boat so that the bow (front) is facing the wind. This will help your righting efforts, by not having to pull the sails up against a wind.

==== Lean and right the boat ====

Get back on the center board, and holding on the gunwale or the shrouds, lean back with all of your weight. This leverage should slowly bring the boat back to an upright position.

[[Image:Capsized 003.jpg]]

=== Get back in ===

Hang onto the boat as it rights, and crawl or slither back in over the side. The boat will probably be pretty low in the water since the cockpit will be close to full of water.

==== Bail and organize ====

Once upright and on board, take some time to bail out some water, untangle lines, and sort out any loose items before getting underway again. 

On a calm day, in a protected area and with supervision, capsize your boat and right it several times to get confidence. You will be surprised how easy it will become with a little experience

=== With a crew &quot;Scoop&quot; method ===
=== Check all people ===

Make sure that no one is trapped under the boat or tangled in the rigging. if they are, help them to get free. 

[[Image:Capsized 004.jpg]]

=== Stand on the center board / support mast ===

One sailor supports the mast to keep the boat from turtling. The other sailor maneuvers around the boat '''(not under the hull)''' and climbs on the centerboard. 

[[Image:Capsized 005.jpg]]

==== Point boat into the wind ====

If possible, position the boat so that the bow (front) is facing the wind. This will help your righting efforts, by not having to pull the sails up against a wind.

=== Right the boat and scoop ===

The sailor in the water grabs on to a stationary object in the boat's cockpit.  The sailor on the centerboard leans back and starts to right the boat.  

The sailor in the water is scooped into the cockpit and helps stabilize the boat as it is righted.  

[[Image:Capsized 006.jpg]]

=== Entering the cockpit ===

As the sailors enter the cockpit they should duck to avoid getting hit by the boom. The sheet of the mainsail and jib should be loose and the sails allowed to luff so they will not re-capsize the boat while it is righting. 

[[Image:Capsized 007.jpg]]

=== Get back in ===

Sailor still in the water will crawl or slither back in over the side. The boat will probably be pretty low in the water since the cockpit will be close to full of water.

==== Bail and organize ====

Once upright and on board, take some time to bail out some water, untangle lines, and sort out any loose items before getting underway again. 

=== Remember the following safety rules ===

# '''Never swim toward shore.'''  It looks closer than it is and you may not make it.
# '''Always stay with the boat.'''
# '''Do not swim under the sails or hull.'''         
# Upon entering the boat after it has come upright, be sure to '''duck''' to avoid the swinging boom.

=== Additional information ===
==== Boat flotation ====

All sailboats can capsize and without adequate flotation they will sink.  There should be enough flotation so when the boat is righted it will float high enough to keep it from being swamped with water and allow you to bail it out.  Many manufactured boats have built-in watertight flotation compartments.  The watertight integrity of these compartments should be inspected before you go sailing.  They usually have access holes to allow you to check for leaks and remove any water that may have accumulated.  

These holes may be small drain holes or large enough to pass your hand through them.  Whatever size they are, it is critical that the drain plugs or access covers are securely fastened. If your boat capsizes and the holes are open, water flooding the compartments will deplete their flotation. Air bags or foam in or under the seats may also be used if a boat does not have watertight flotation compartments or the size of the compartments doesn’t provide sufficient flotation.

It is important for small boat sailors to know if their boat has sufficient flotation.  One sure method of determining this is to capsize it in water that is deep enough for the boat, but shallow enough for you stand.  Push down on one side until the boat starts to take on water, and then hand over hand up the shroud to the top of the mast to pull the mast down to the water. After the boat is capsized on its side, bring it upright again. How high does the boat float?  How much water is in the cockpit?  How long does it take to bail out the water?  It shouldn’t take longer than several minutes.

==== Bailing equipment ====

Bailing equipment is also part of standard safety gear.  While few small boat sailors carry a pump, a small bucket or a large plastic bottle with the bottom cut off works well.  Attach the bailer to the boat with a length of cord to prevent it from floating away during a capsize.  A large sponge (the kind used to wash cars) can be used to finish the bailing.

'''Above all, remember to stay with your boat. As long as its floating you will be safe. Remember the boat does not get tired and it can be visible a long way off. Don't ever think of swimming ashore. '''

==1. Retrieve an object from the bottom in chest-deep water, unsupported and with eyes open.==
Start with breath holding at least 10 seconds with eyes open. Sink toys and some coins. Goggles may be used.  It might help to exhale the breath rather than filling the lungs.  This will help the swimmer stay submerged while the small object is sought.

==2. Bob submerging head completely 15 times in chest-deep water.==
When head is out of the water, inhale with the mouth. When underwater, exhale with mouth and nose. Rhythm shall be just like the natural breathing pattern. Inhale quickly and exhale slowly.

==3. Bob in deep water (slightly over head) to travel to safe area or side of pool.==
With the bobbing motion, move forward through the water by pushing the water backwards. With fingers together and palms flat, do a sweeping motion on the water from the front to the back, recover then repeat motion over again. Slightly jump to maintain bobbing pattern while sculling forward.

==4. Jump into deep water from side of pool.==
Stay clear of the sides and make sure that there is no object or swimmer before jumping. Maintain feet first entry and stay safe at all times.

==5. Dive from side of pool in kneeling and compact position.==
===Kneeling dive===
Extend arms overhead with hands together. Link thumbs to help keep forearms tight along sides of head (covering ears). Bend one knee to the deck, the other knee to the chest keeping foot flat on the deck. Curl toes over the edge of the deck for support. Lean forward aiming fingers towards water, push off and bring legs together while entering the water. Fingers enter water first followed by the rest of the body in a straight prone form. Glide into water without kicking. Keep facing down and arms locked over ears. Do not look up. Do not bend your knees. A strong push from the deck will allow you to glide for about ten to fifteen feet. Practice! Practice! Practice!

===Compact Jump===
Cover mouth and nose with one hand, cross the other arm to the opposite shoulder and push both arms as close to the body. Stand at the edge of the water and jump with feet together. Maintain compact and upright position until movement stops underwater then swim to safety.

==6. Prone glide with push-off for two body lengths.==

Prone means on the front.

Stand in waist to chest deep water, push yourself towards the wall by sculling while transferring feet from floor to wall. Streamline your body by extending arms, elbows straight and hands close together. Kick off from the wall and straighten knees. Hold breath as long as possible. When performed properly, this can push-off for up to three body lengths.

==7. Supine glide with push-off for two body lengths.==

Supine means on the back.

Hold the gutter and kick off with both feet extending arms into streamline position. Straighten knees and point toes downward. Exhale when the water covers the mouth and nose. Hold position as long as possible.

==8. Swim front crawl--ten yards.==

==9. Swim back crawl--ten yards.==
==10. Demonstrate elementary backstroke kick--ten yards.==

It is advisable to practice with the student on the deck before entering the water. The child who is timid about the lesson is more apt to become comfortable with the motions of the elementary backstroke if allowed to practice prior to getting in the water.

Start by standing straight with both arms at your side and feet together (Prone Position). Then bring arms up by gliding hands up your sides to your armpits. Then extend arms  straight out to form a &quot;T&quot;. Bring the arms straight down again in a sweeping motion (fingers together to form a solid surface to push the water) to end up in beginning prone position.

The leg motions are basically the same. Out of the water, only one leg can be used to practice this movement. Allow knee to open outward as leg bends and foot raises upward toward buttocks. Then in an outward sweeping motion, open the leg to form a &quot;V&quot; and then snapping it back down toward other foot. The foot will work as a paddle to push the water out of the way. The traditional way of this movement instructed that the knees should stay close together, as if glued together. Currently this isn't practiced as strictly.

Once in the pool, it's necessary to place your hand under the small of the child's back for support. A styrofoam swim &quot;noodle&quot; could be incorporated in place of your hand. This will allow hands-free assistance during the lesson. Have the child practice the arm motions separately from the leg motions. Practicing each motion separately will increase confidence on their part and an easier transition to using both the hand and foot motions together as a complete swimming stroke.

Practice the complete stroke for several minutes while keeping your hand or the noodle in place on the lower back until the child is comfortable enough to go solo. Continue working with child until he/she is comfortable enough to practice without assistance with the goal of swimming across the shallow end of the pool by themself.

==11. Reverse direction while swimming on front.==
==12. Reverse direction while swimming on back.==
==13. Discuss diving safety rules.==
# NEVER dive in shallow water. You can be Paralyzed.
# If you are unsure about being in deep water, don't go there or wear a flotation device.
# If you see someone get hurt, tell a lifeguard or call 911.
# Never swim alone, always swim with a buddy.
# Wait until no one is within {{units|4 meters|13 feet}} of the diving board before diving into the water.
# Never swim without a parent or guardian or Lifeguard on duty.
# If your fingers are turning purple or you are shivering, get out of the water and get warmed up.
# Don't try to dive if you have not been taught how to properly.
# If someone is hurt, do not attempt to move them. Get the nearest adult around.
# Be careful, never run, obey the lifeguards and any posted signs.
# Have Fun!

==14. Tread water.==
Water treading is an aspect of swimming that involves a swimmer staying in a vertical position in the water while keeping his or her head (at least) above the surface of the water. Treading water provides the swimmer an opportunity to keep the head from becoming submerged while not providing sufficient directional thrust to overcome inertia and propel the swimmer in any specific direction.

==15. Jump into deep water with life jacket.==
Cover mouth and nose with one hand, cross the other arm to the opposite shoulder (or grab the arm hole of life jacket of the opposite shoulder) and push both arms as close to the body. Stand at the edge of the water and jump with feet together. The life jacket will assist in a quick resurfacing.

==16. Demonstrate H.E.L.P. position for one minute.==
''HELP'' stands for '''H'''eat '''E'''scape '''L'''essening '''P'''osture.  It is a swimming position intended to conserve body heat, and thus, extend survival in cold-water situations.  It works best when the swimmer is wearing a PFD.  The basic idea is for the swimmer to curl into a compact ball to minimize the amount of the body's surface area that is exposed to cold water.  This is done as follows:

#Draw the knees up to the chest.
#Keep the face turned upwards and out of the water.
#Place the upper arms alongside the torso with the forearms folded across the chest.  The swimmer may grasp the PFD's arm holes to aid in holding this position.

The HELP position should not be used in swift water conditions, as rushing water presents other hazards which are of greater immediate concern.  Specifically, whitewater can dash a person into rocks, or the swimmer's foot can be caught on an obstacle. If the swimmer then falls downstream from the foot entrapment, the current can easily hold the person's head under water.  Moving water conveys tremendous force that even the strongest of people cannot overcome.

==17. Demonstrate huddle position for one minute.==

A group of three or more people wearing PFD's (Personal Floatation Device) form a tight circle by either linking arms or holding onto each other in a side-hugging fashion facing the center of the circle. This will allow the water in the center of the circle to warm up due to the collective body heat. Keeping upper body posture straight and bending the knees inward helps the individuals to float and also keeps more of the legs exposed to the warmer water in the center of the circle.

==18. Demonstrate correct technique for opening the airway for rescue breathing.==

Hi Gerald,

My copy of the Pathfinder Pocket Guide came in today.  I was pretty excited to see your artwork in there.  Congratulations!  I haven't finished reading it yet, but maybe later tonight I'll get a chance to.

BTW, I made an initial stab at [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Lettering &amp; Poster Making|Lettering &amp; Poster Making]].  But then I thought that perhaps you would be a better candidate for working on this one.  Would you like to take a crack at it? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:26, 23 November 2008 (UTC)
::I'm teaching this one, so I might as well add in the answers as I go. May not be instantly done though.[[User:Jazzmanian|Gerald]] ([[User talk:Jazzmanian|talk]]) 08:07, 23 December 2008 (UTC)
::: Thanks! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:46, 23 December 2008 (UTC)
I left a comment on [[Talk:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Lettering &amp; Poster Making|Lettering &amp; Poster Making]].  Maybe you can incorporate that in there somewhere?
::Have you been watching the lettering and poster making honor Jim - There is progress.
:::Yes!  It's looking good.  I like the additional alphabets you added.  Maybe the terminology is obvious, but I don't think it would hurt to define ascender and descender.  I had to think about those for a few moments.  Perhaps adding labels and braces to the lettering guides would be a good way to do that?

== Wikibook Pins ==

Hi Gerald,

I am in the process of trying my hand at pin making.  I have a crude clay model of the book logo you did for us (PF keychain).  I left out the hands, due to lack of skill as much as anything else.  I plan to let the clay harden, cast it in plaster, and then... try pouring molten aluminum in it.  We'll see what happens.  

Hopefully, I can clean it up with a file &amp; dremel tool when it's in its aluminum form.  If it doesn't come out looking ''too'' bad, I'll use it to do another plaster cast and start making copies.  I plan to cast one for every significant contributor to the book (you are one of a handful who fall in that category).  I'd like to have them ready before Oshkosh.  Problem is... they might not do the book justice.  They will almost certainly be sub-professional! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 20:15, 30 December 2008 (UTC)
: Wow - that sounds fun. Let me know if I can send any files that may be of assistance. (just the book as a graphic for instance) [[User:Jazzmanian|Gerald]] ([[User talk:Jazzmanian|talk]]) 17:28, 5 January 2009 (UTC)
:: If I knew how to turn the graphic into clay, that would be very useful.  Right now I've got the clay plug sitting in plaster.  I'm pretty sure that I won't be able to remove the plug without breaking it, and I fear that the plaster won't look all that great when I ''do'' get the plug out.  I'm going to let it dry for a couple more days while I think about it.  While I wait for an idea to come, I'm also trying to think up ways to convince the Mrs that it would be a good idea to blow $250 to have real pins made. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:17, 5 January 2009 (UTC)
:::So your making the &quot;positive&quot; first in clay, then attempting to cast the negative mold in plaster. After which you hope to cast aluminum into the plaster negative ? What is the overall size of the pin you are making ? [[User:Jazzmanian|Gerald]] ([[User talk:Jazzmanian|talk]]) 23:06, 5 January 2009 (UTC)
:::: Yeah, that was my approach.  The positive broke when I pried it out of the plaster, and the plaster didn't look all that great.  I made it as small as I could, but that was not very small (it's about 4cm long).  Back to the drawing board. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:42, 30 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Indentation ==

I changed the label of &quot;Integumentary System&quot; from a first-level (which is generally too large) to be a second-level heading. Also, since the page is named &quot;Integumentary System&quot;, I don't think you also need to have another gigantic heading, that says the same thing, that includes all the other topics. That's just my opinion, you are free to change it back if you would like. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:18, 28 July 2006 (UTC)


It looks great guys!  I love the pictures you have included with the topics.  The only suggestion I have is you have different conditions/diseases for some topics and not for others.  ex: you might want to add something like toe nail fungus or ingrown nails.  Just a thought...so little time though.  keep it up!!!!=)jcran69


I'm jealous, your chapter looks so professional and I want to know how you put your pictures in. I can't even think of anything that you should improve-if your bored, please feel free to work your magic on our cell chapter!! -- Leili


M Sol's Review 
I think it is a very intresting chapter and a least we have or can see ourn hair skin nails i think thath makes it more intresting. I had no idea there was two types of ear wax that blows my mind how did you find that information good job i think your research was very through.

== Jody and Jenn ==

Hey do either one of you know what is ment by &quot;cutaneous senses&quot;, I'm trying to answer the questions and I can't seem to find it anywhere in the chapter. Where am I missing it?

Thanks

--[[User:BrendaJohnson|BrendaJohnson]] 02:36, 21 August 2006 (UTC)


I have had to do a lot of looking around for this answer and what I found is that basically it is refered to &quot;the faculty of touch&quot;  I am not exactly sure how to answer that question.  Not only that, but it never refers to &quot;cutaneous senses&quot; in the chapter.  I am going to look on the answer page and see what I find.--[[User:Jtervortn|Jtervortn]] 15:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

&quot;3. The blood brain barier and mennegis are responsible for controling the PH level and concentrations of hormones amino acids and potasium ions in the fluid around the brain. It is important that these are regulated closly because these substances can cause a neuron to fire. If these were not regulated well there would be uncontroled neural activity in the brain and thus all over the body.

We may want to come up with a different question all together. What do you think?

== Small Evaluation ==

Hey Ladies!  Your chapter looks great.  I like the pictures you have up.  I am not quite sure what to do this phase.  Obviously you guys already have a lot of info in there whether it was from the phase 1 people or you guys.  In our chapter, we have more content to add, but your chapter looks sufficient to me.  I would only suggest grammatical errors, and what the group did to our old chapter was add more definitions in what is your glossary area.  I would suggest reading through your chapter and picking out more key terms to add to your glossary.  And also what Kevin suggested, to add a little story.  You guys have a great chapter!!![[User:Pwoodson|Pwoodson]] 19:00, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

==Review==
I think that the content outline of the chapter is set up well ad I like the links that you have put in also. The information is spread out well and I would suggest mabey a few more pictures etc, to help the reader visualize and learn that way as well. I also like the Did you Know? Good job!--[[User:JamBam16|JamBam16]] 00:34, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

Wow! This chapter is very good! I really I really like how you added P.Stewart's bald head. You found some really great pictures, it really helps in learning the different layers of the skin! Great Job.--[[User:Jacquel|Jacquel]] 18:15, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

==Review==
This chapter is very well written. I really liked the way you placed clinical applications in some the areas it tied in really well. The flow of the chapter I thought was excellent.[[User:Cody M.|Cody M.]] 18:16, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
==RiRi's Review==
I really liked the way the chapter is layed out. When we get our homework on this chapter I think it will be easy to find and read things. I know that everyone is switching chapters next week so, for the next group: There really isn't much to add except the stuff you can think of that would be fun to learn. It might need more review questions. Uhhmmm, oh ya!, I added some links and pictures, if you think they may not go then then feel free to change what i put in. I added the toilet picture, I thought it was funny! Anyhow, keep up the great work!

== Better Late than never... ==

Not that it needs to be done anyway, you guys have done a great job, but my review is a little late.  Looks good, one thing I noticed, is there is a picture of the skin types, but doesn't say anything about which is which.  I think pictures need to be explained, but thats me.  AWESOME  job!  You have done very well.  JAMI--[[User:199.91.33.254|199.91.33.254]] 05:34, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

==kyle review==

I love the picture of the toilet its the first thing that caught my eye. You can always tell when its a well put together when you go though the effort to make if flow and put something in to get them intrested. Good job.

== The sensory function of hairs ==

From the Introduction - &quot;Any other hair on our bodies no longer serves a function, but is an evolutionary remnant.&quot;

This is wrong; hairs (with their nerve rich follicles) are sensory mechano-receptors that extend our sense of touch beyond the surface of the skin and are (according to W.Montagna in &quot;Evolution of Human Skin&quot;) the principle component of the skin's sensibility. Plenty of other references to be found to this function. 

The sensory function is real and has significant survival benefits as it is the primary means of avoiding insect bites. I've been saved from toxic Australian Paralysis Tick bites by feeling them as they bump against hairs - very functional, very useful.

The ongoing omission of the bug detecting sensory function of hairs continues to ''bug'' me. Especially given that - unless their's don't work for some medical reason - all those who claim body hairs are useless have lived their lives immersed in the sensations these humble sense organs provide. And, astonishingly, failed to distinguish from direct skin contact.

I don't want to rush into editing the page, but when I get opportunity to put some time towards it I will give it a try.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Origins==
'DiceFree' originated from the home of a kid during the summer of 2005. As his friend's birthday was coming up, he pondered what kind of present could be gotten for him.

An idea struck; the RPG-loving friend would no doubt like an easy-to-use and easy-to-play RPG manual! As fast as he could, [[User:kidko|kidko]] began to think of an RPG sutable for the occasion. Not finding one that was both low-cost and rule-slim, he began to make him one.

The RPG evolved from a simple system of 3 skills (ATK, DEF, and SKL) with only 3 types of weapons, armor, and magic to the game it is today. 'DiceFree' was created.</text>

Let's start with the skills. A character's skills are abbreviated as [A,B,C,D,E,F,G]. Each letter stands for a different skill. There will be a more in-depth look in the Skills section. However, the skills for every character are:
*Health- (''HP/Stamina'') The amount of damage your character can take before dying
*Attack- (''Strength'') The general weapon use skill of a character.
*Defense- The rating of your character's skill of defending herself.
*H. Speed- Horizontal speed; running movement limit
*V. Speed- Vertical speed; climbing movement limit
*Stealth- (''Sleight of hand'') The ability to conceal a character's actions
*Awareness- (''Spot'') Your character's ability to notice things.

Every starting character will recive 22 points to spend as they see fit for their statistics.

Improvements can be made, of course; every other level (starting at 3), the players recive 2 skill points to spend.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Backgrounds=
Every character has to have ''some'' kind of story, right? Well, talk to your GM about your character's. Find out a few things about him, making them up as you go along:
*Birthplace
*Goals in life
*Kind of upbringing
And other things of that kind. This will help the GM to create an effective, realistic, and deep storyline for the hero(s). Not all of this information is required, but a basic synopsis would be nice.

==Name==
No character can simply exist. They need a name. Names describe the characters, even if indirrectly. They give them a sense of contribution, and an easy way to refer to another charcter.

Names in the ''DiceFree'' world have, generally, three parts: the first name, last name, and clan. Last names can be left off, as they are often the clan name. Every character has a first name, such as Bob or Obediah. If you can't think of a name that would fit your character, try this:

===Description Method===
Take one word that describes him. For example, ''hate''. Now, take the letters and arrange them in an order that is both not common and pronouncable. In my example, a name could be:
*Tahe (tah-hey)
*Ehta (eh-tah)
*Ateh (ah-teh, at-eh)
*Heta (heh-tah, hee-tay, hee-tah, heh-tay)
The longer the word, the longer your choice of names could be. Be creative, and add or remove letters from the name if needed.


==Clan Names==
''Clan'' is defined by [[Wiktionary:Main Page|Wiktionary]] as a noun: '''a group of people all descended from a common ancestor'''. First Cousins or so are the usual edges of a ''DiceFree'' clan.

===Historical===
Many clans might be named after a famous member of them, usually from the days of legends and such. Others may use newer names, for example, Billar's father was Francon, and he slew many a great invasion force. His name, as repetitive is it may be, could end up as Francon Lounic Francon. Clans may name themselves after a heroic member of history, or a leader of the present. It is up to the GM and players to decide this.

===Random===
Found a funny word? Can't think of a historical figure? Then simply rearrange the letters of a word that may or may ''not'' describe the clan overall. In other words, take a random/descriptive word and use the method under Names.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Skills Introduction=
Skills represent every character's physical makeup. The higher a statistic, the better the character is at it, and related activities. Thus, knowing how to use skills efficiently could make a player character's (PC's) adventure slightly easier. Early skill research could also create a well-balanced and suited PC for use in the campaign.
==The Catagories==
*Health
*Attack
*Defense
*H. Speed
*V. Speed
*Stealth
*Awareness
==General==
''Health'' is a representation of the sturdiness of your character. The more damage that you take, the lower this statistic will become. At 0, the PC is dead.

''Attack'' estimates your attack power and physical streangth. Weapons can increase (or decrease) this stat.

''Defense'' describes the ability to defend oneself. A higher Defense score will help a PC to live longer, in the long run.

''H. Speed'', short for Horizontal Speed. It represents the speed and distance that a PC can run, and has many uses.

''V. Speed'', abbreviation for Vertical Speed. A description of the ability of a PC to climb, both the time and distance of said climb.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The next general election in the United Kingdom will be in 2015.  Elections are held every 5 years (previously governments could call early elections)  Local elections are held around once a year in most areas.

==Voting Systems ==

In order to ensure you cast your vote in line with your beliefs it is important to understand the voting system.


===First Past the Post===

Used for general elections and local elections in England and Wales.



The electoral system of first past the post, know as a single member constituency, is when a particular candidate wins when they receive more votes than their rival.  A majority vote is not required.
There are 659 constituencies within the UK, each one elects a single member.

'''Pros :''' 

'''No Confusion''' – Voters are required to make a single cross on the ballot, next to their favoured candidate – Rather than rank prospective candidates.

'''Speed''' – Results can be calculated relatively quickly, therefore local and national results are known speedily.

'''Accountability''' – Each constituency has a particular MP to who esquires and correspondence can be directed.

'''Clear Results''' – Results are relatively indisputable  With 10 candidates the winner can be clear, even if they only received 15%, with the nearest rival on 14.5%.

'''Cons :'''

'''Representation 1''' -  As in the above example, a candidate can be elected to represent a constituency when the majority of constituents did not vote for that candidate.  

'''Representation 2''' -  Following on from above example, but on a nation level, candidates for parties who come second of third may receive a substantial proportion of the national vote but gain a small proportion of the available parliamentary seat. (eg. In 1992 the Liberal Democrats won 18% of the national vote but only 3% of the seats)

===Single Transferable Vote (STV)===

Used for local elections in Scotland (from 2007) and Northern Ireland.  STV is also used for European Elections in Northern Ireland.

===Additional Member System===

Used to elect the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Greater London Assembly.

===Supplementary Vote===

Used for directly elected mayors in England.

== The ice cube data structure ==

This book currently mentions
: ''experiments with the special [[wikipedia:data structure]] &quot;[[wikipedia:ice cube (informatics)|ice cube]]&quot; for higher speed transfer of the data.
: ''The ice cube is a compressed data cube, a set of vectors describing the compiler graphs efficiently.''

Alas, one of those links is broken, leaving me wondering:
Is *any* compressed block of data, in *any* kind of data structure and compressed using *any* data compression algorithm, a kind of &quot;ice cube&quot; (a generic term)?
Or is there some specific data structure, a &quot;data cube&quot; (?) that is compressed in some specific way to create a &quot;ice cube&quot;?

In the east you should be able to find '''Canis Major''', and '''Canis Minor'''.  In the north you should see '''Orion'''.  To the west you should be able to find '''Cetus''' and '''Fornax'''.

==11. At what time of year is the constellation Orion best seen? Locate and identify in the sky the three brightest stars of this constellation.==
Orion is best seen in the '''winter''' because it is then visible just after sunset, and throughout most of the night.  In the Northern Hemisphere the winter sky is generally clearer than the summer sky.  The three brightest stars in Orion are '''Rigel''' (right foot), '''Betelguese''' (left shoulder), and '''Bellatrix''' (right shoulder).

==12. How are the letters of the Greek alphabet used to name stars in a constellation? Give five illustrations of the use of the letters of the Greek alphabet in naming the stars of a constellation.==
The brightest star in a constellation is called ''alpha'' plus the constellation name.  The second brightest is named ''beta'', the third brightest is named ''gamma'', and so forth.  The best known example of this is ''Alpha Centauri'' which is the brightest star in the constellation Centaur.  However, Alpha Centauri is actually a binary star, so the first two stars in our list can be '''Alpha Centauri A''', and '''Alpha Centauri B'''.  '''Acrux''', '''Becrux''', and '''Gacrux''' are the three brightest stars in ''Crux'', the Southern Cross, and are so named as an abbreviation of Alpha-Crux, Beta-Crux, and Gamma-Crux.

==13. Locate the 15 first-magnitude stars as they appear throughout the year.==
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problematic requirement
|This requirement cannot be met as it is written unless the Pathfinder is lucky enough to be able to travel to both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres or into the tropics.  Many Southern Hemisphere stars are visible south of the Tropic of Cancer, so if you happen to be planning a vacation (or a mission trip) to the Virgin Islands, look for the five first magnitude stars in the Southern Hemisphere.  
|Locate the 15 first-magnitude stars on a star chart and observe all of them that appear between sunset and midnight during a three month period in your area.
}}

===First-magnitude stars in the Northern Hemisphere===
====Sirius====
[[Image:Finding_sirius.png|thumb|right|300px|Position of Sirius]]
Sirius is the brightest star in the night-time sky, with a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46. It is located in the constellation Canis Major.  As the major star of the &quot;Big Dog&quot; constellation, it is often called the &quot;Dog Star&quot;.  Sirius can be seen from every inhabited region of the Earth's surface.  At a distance of 2.6 pc or 8.57 light years, Sirius is also one of the nearest stars to Earth. The best time of year to view it is around January 1, when it reaches the meridian at midnight.  Sirius can be found by following Orion's belt from the viewer's right to left.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Arcturus====
[[image:Finding arcturus.png|thumb|right|400px|Position of Arcturus]]
Arcturus is the brightest star in the constellation Boötes, and the third brightest star in the night sky, with a visual magnitude of −0.05, after Sirius and Canopus.  Arcturus can be found by following the arc made by handle of the Big Dipper (away from the dipper's bowl).
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Vega and Altair====
[[Image:Summer_triangle.png|thumb|250px|right|The Summer Triangle]]
Vega is the brightest star in Lyra, and the fifth brightest star in the sky. It is the third brightest star in the Northern night sky, after Sirius and Arcturus, and can often be seen near the zenith in the mid-northern latitudes during the Northern Hemisphere summer.

Vega is a vertex of the Summer Triangle, which consists of Vega (in Lyra), Deneb (in Cygnus) and Altair (in Aquila). If one is to consider this asterism a right triangle, then Vega would correspond to its right angle. This triangle is very recognizable in the northern skies for there are few bright stars in its vicinity.

Altair is the brightest star in the constellation Aquila and the twelfth brightest star in the nighttime sky, at visual magnitude 0.77.  Like Vega, it is a member of the Summer Triangle.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Capella====
[[Image:Finding_capella.png|thumb|400px|right|Locating Capella]]
Capella is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga and sixth brightest star in the sky. Although it appears as a single point to the naked eye, Capella is actually a bright close binary pair of stars along side a second, fainter binary.  Capella can be found by following the line made by the two stars in the Big Dipper's handle and extending it across the Dipper's bowl.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Rigel and Betelguese====
[[Image:Orionin tähdistö.png|thumb|400px|left|The positions of Rigel and Betelguese within Orion]]
'''Rigel''' is the brightest star in the constellation Orion and the seventh brightest star in the sky, with visual magnitude 0.12. Rigel is Orion's left foot.

'''Betelguese''' is the second brightest star in the constellation Orion, and the tenth brightest star in the night sky.  Betelguese is Orion's right shoulder.  Betelgeuse is a red supergiant, one of the physically largest stars known. If it were placed at the center of our solar system, its outer surface would possibly extend to the orbit of Mars.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Procyon====
[[image:Finding_procyon.png|thumb|400px|left|Position of Procyon]]
'''Procyon''' is the brightest star in the constellation Canis Minor and the eighth brightest star in the nighttime sky.  It can be found using stars in Orion in two different ways:
* By following Orion's left foot (Rigel) through the tip of his sword.
* By following Bellatrix (his left shoulder) through Betelguese (his right shoulder).

Procyon, Sirius, and Betelguese also form an equilateral triangle.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Aldebaran====
[[Image:Wintersky.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The Winter Circle]]
Once you can find Rigel, Sirius, Procyon, and Capella, finding Aldebaran is easy, for these five stars, plus Pollux make up the Winter Circle.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Spica====
[[Image:Finding_spica.png|thumb|left|300px|Location of Spica]]
Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo, and the 15th brightest star in the sky.  It can be found by following a line starting at the star ρ Boötis, and continuing  through Arcturus to Spica.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===First-magnitude stars in the Southern Hemisphere===
====Canopus====
'''Canopus''' is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Carina, and the second brightest star in the sky, with a visual magnitude of −0.62, second only to Sirius.  Canopus is a yellowish-white supergiant star. It is located well into the southern hemisphere, at a declination of −52° 42' (2000) and a right ascension of 06h24.0m, and is visible on the southern horizon of even the southern US States as far north as Virginia or Kentucky.  That far north, it can only be seen on a very clear night during the last two weeks of February directly south very low on the horizon just after sunset.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Alpha Centauri A and Hadar====
'''Alpha Centauri A''' is located in the Southern Hemisphere, and can only be seen in the United States from points south of Daytona Beach, Florida or San Antonio, Texas.  Even then, it barely rises above the horizon directly to the South for a few days around July 8.

'''Hadar''' is also known as Beta Centauri, for it is the second brightest star in the constellation Centaurus.  It is just to the West of Alpha Centauri A, so if you can see the one, you can probably see the other.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Achernar====
'''Achernar''' is located in the Southern Hemisphere, and therefore is never visible in most of North America.  It can be seen from Dallas Texas and points south in mid to late November due South, and ''very'' low on the horizon.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Acrux====
[[image:Acrux_kstars.png|thumb|200px|right|Position of Acrux]] 
'''Acrux''' is the brightest star in constellation Crux (the Southern Cross) and the thirteenth brightest star in the nighttime sky, at visual magnitude 0.77.  Acrux is represented in the flag of Australia as one of the 5 stars that comprise the Southern Cross. Since Acrux is at roughly −60° declination, it is generally only visible south of the Tropic of Cancer and therefore didn't receive an ancient traditional name; &quot;Acrux&quot; is simply a combination of the A in Alpha plus Crux (meaning &quot;cross&quot;). Acrux is the southernmost first magnitude star, just a bit more southerly than Alpha Centauri.  Acrux ''can'' be seen as far north as Miami, Florida, but it only ''barely'' rises above the horizon.  You might be able to see it due south around May 8 (any year) at about 9:00 pm.  If you wait a around until midnight, Alpha Centauri and Hadar will also be visible around that date as well (also directly to the south and just over the horizon). 
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==14. With the use of a diagram, show the relative positions of the earth and moon during high and low tides.==
[[Image:Tide_diagram.png]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
Since the Earth's crust is solid, it moves, along with everything inside it, as one whole, as defined by the average force on it. For the Earth's shape this average force is equal to the force on its center. The water at the surface is free to move following forces on its particles.  One of the forces that effect tides is the gravity of the Moon.  The force of gravity gets weaker as the distance between two bodies increases, and since the center of the Earth is farther away than the surface nearest the Moon, the Moon's gravity pulls on the surface water stronger than it pulls on the whole of the Earth.  This causes the water level to rise and causes a high tide.

Meanwhile, on the side of the Earth opposite the Moon, the surface is ''farther'' than the Earth's center, so the Moon pulls more strongly on the Earth as a whole than it does on the water.  This causes the water move away from the Moon, but since this is on the other side of the Earth, the water level ''still'' rises, causing a high tide.

Low tides occur at the points on the Earth where the Moon is just rising or just setting - that is, where the surface is at a 90° angle from the moon.

The Sun also had a tidal effect, but since it is much farther away, the difference between the pull of gravity at the surface of the Earth and the pull of gravity at the center is much smaller  as compared to the Moon.  When the tidal action caused by the Sun and Moon reinforce one another we have a spring tide (which is higher than normal).  When they oppose one another, we have a neap tide (which is lower than normal).

==15. Describe the peculiar individual characteristics of the planets in our solar system. Which ones cannot be seen without the aid of a telescope? Which two planets are seen only near the hours of sunrise or sunset?==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Stars/Planet characteristics}}

==16. Where and in what way does the Bible refer to Orion, the Pleiades, and Arcturus?==
;&lt;nowiki&gt;Job 9:9 (21st Century King James Version)&lt;/nowiki&gt;: ''&quot;Who maketh Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south;&quot;''

;&lt;nowiki&gt;Job 38:31,32 (21st Century King James Version)&lt;/nowiki&gt;: ''&quot;Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?&quot;''

;&lt;nowiki&gt;Amos 5:8 (NIV)&lt;/nowiki&gt;: ''&quot;He who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns blackness into dawn and darkens day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land— the LORD is his name.&quot;''

Most English versions of the Bible translate ''Arcturus'' as ''The Bear''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Radiation Oncology:TOC}}
'''Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor'''


==Epidemiology==
*Account for 5-10% of soft tissue tumors
*Majority arise ''de novo'' or from neurofibromas; prior RT (median 15 years ago) a risk factor


==Pathology==
*Normal nerve sheath: Schwann cells, perineural cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, epineural lipocytes
*MPNSTs - Malignant tumors arising from or differentiating toward cells of peripheral nerve sheath; resemble [[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Fibrosarcoma|fibrosarcomas]] in their basic organization
*Criteria (one of the following):
**arise from peripheral nerve
**arise from pre-existing benign nerve sheath tumor (e.g., neurofibroma)
**displays a constellation of histologic features seen above, and reflecting Schwann cell differentiation
*Cytogenetics
**Loss of NF1 gene (neurofibromin) and high levels of RAS activity; necessary but not sufficient
**In addition, p27-Kip1, p53, or p16


==Treatment Overview==
*Literature mostly consists of small series or case reports
*Primary treatment is surgery
*RT appears beneficial in local control, but has no impact on long-term survival. Dose &gt;60 Gy preferred
*Chemotherapy does not appear very effective


==Outcomes==
*'''MGH''' 1991-2001 PMID 12963767 -- &quot;Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor: the clinical spectrum and outcome of treatment.&quot; (Baehring JM, Neurology. 2003 Sep 9;61(5):696-8.)
**Retrospective. 54 patients. Median f/u 54 months
**Median survival: 66 months
**Local recurrence: 26% after median 22 months; Distant recurrence: 20%
**Univariate factors: tumor diameter &lt;5 cm (HR 0.4), total resection, lower age
**Multivariate factors: extent of surgery, RT (HR 0.22), age, chemo (but caution: small sample size)

*'''Mayo''' 1975-1993 PMID 9788415 -- &quot;Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor: analysis of treatment outcome. (Wong WW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Sep 1;42(2):351-60.)
**Retrospective. 134 patients, 27% extremities, 73% non-extremities. Median f/u 53 months
**Path: 10% Grade I, 32% Grade II, 32% Grade III, 24% Grade IV
**RT (54%): 3-5 cm margins, no attempt to include LNs; 10% BT prescribed median 15 Gy to target volume
**5-year OS (10-year OS): 52% (34%). Median survival 61 months. RT did not affect 5-year survival (58% RT vs. 43% no RT)
**Survival predictors: prior XRT, surgical margins
**Local control: surgical margins, RT dose, use of IOERT/BT
**Distant control: tumor size, grade, histologic subtype
**Conclusion: Goal resection with negative margins. Adjuvant RT &gt;=60 Gy, and inclusion of IOERT/BT provides improved local control

*'''St. Jude''' 1995 PMID 8591083 -- &quot;Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors: the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital experience.&quot; (DeCou JM, Ann Surg Oncol. 1995 Nov;2(6):524-9.)
**Retrospective. 28 patients treated over 30 years. 45% extremity, 34% trunk, 21% head/neck
**5-year OS: 39% (resectable 65%, nonresectable 0% and median 12 months)
**Survival predictors: surgical margins, sarcoma IRS group
**Role for RT: authors recommend only for +margins

==Review==
*'''Zurich''' (Switzerland) 2005 -- PMID 16442014 &quot;Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors: an update.&quot; (Fuchs B, J Surg Orthop Adv. 2005 Winter;14(4):168-74.)


==Malignant Intracranial Nerve Sheath Tumor==
*Historically also called malignant Schwannoma, but '''Malignant Intracranial Nerve Sheath Tumor''' preferred, since it is not yet clear whether these tumors truly arise from Schwann cells
*Only 5 cases reported in literature:
**2/5 patients were disease-free 17 and 19 months after surgery
**3/5 patients recurred (5 months (death 9 months), 10 months (death 18 monts), and last had 3rd recurrence 5 years after surgery)


*'''Saint-Etienne''' (France) 2004 PMID 14744297 -- &quot;Malignant nerve sheath tumor of the right cerebral peduncle: case report.&quot; (Beauchesne P, Neurosurgery. 2004 Feb;54(2):500-3; discussion 503-4.)
**Case report. 35 yo man with right cerebral peduncle tumor
**Treated with stereotactic biopsy and cranial RT to 56.25 Gy in 24 fractions
**After recurrence, treated with doxorubicin with mild benefit
**OS: 29 months (recurred 24 months after initial treatment)

*'''NYU''' 1998 PMID 9452273 -- &quot;Malignant intracerebral nerve sheath tumor: a case report and review of the literature.&quot; (Sharma S, Cancer. 1998 Feb 1;82(3):545-52.)
**Case report. 8 yo girl with right posterior temporal lobe tumor
**Treated with surgery. RT appears to have been used, but no information provided
**OS: healthy recurrence-free 17 months after surgery

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

At the conclusion of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 32|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] orders [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] to kill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] in a cemetery.

== Event Details ==

Because they helped each other during the Triwizard Tournament's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] agree to grasp the Triwizard Cup together. They are unaware the cup is actually a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]], and it transports them to a rundown graveyard with an ancient manor house in the distance. Harry recognizes the Riddle family name on the gravestones; Cedric suggests keeping their wands at the ready. As a hunched figure carrying something resembling a bundled infant approaches, Harry's scar begins burning. A high voice commands, &quot;Kill the spare.&quot; The figure, who Harry soon recognizes as Wormtail (Peter Pettigrew) utters [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|&quot;Avada Kedavra&quot;]], the killing curse. Cedric instantly falls dead, while Harry is incapacitated by his scar's searing pain.

After a ritual restores [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort's]] full human form, he engages Harry in a deadly duel. As they cast spells simultaneously, their wands' streams interlock, creating a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]] effect. Because their wands are &quot;brothers&quot; that share the same magical core (tail feathers from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|phoenix]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]]), they will never battle properly against one another. Harry forces the stream back into Voldemort's wand, causing it to disgorge its previous victims' &quot;echoes.&quot; Cedric's image emerges first, asking Harry to return his body to his parents. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|an old Muggle that Harry does not recognize]] also appear. Lastly are Harry's parents, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]]. The echoes momentarily shield Harry as he breaks the wands' connection, reclaims the Triwizard Cup, and is whisked back to Hogwarts with Cedric's body.

== Notable Consequences ==

Cedric's murder seriously impacts the school's morale, it being the first time many students have experienced a peer's death. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]], Cedric's girlfriend, is deeply affected by his loss; her possibly neurotic need to learn everything she can about the circumstances surrounding his death eventually leads her to connect romantically with Harry. However, her continuing grief throughout the next book casts a pall over that relationship, eventually dooming it.

Harry is also affected by Cedric's death, and has nightmares over the following summer. Harry cannot help feeling that Cedric's death is at least partly his fault; his assuming responsibility will result in his partially closing himself off to friends and other Hogwarts students. It will also make him reluctant to accept his share of the Triwizard prize. This reluctance will be increased when Cedric's parents also refuse to accept even Cedric's share of the prize. Harry will choose to give the entire prize to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], to set up their joke shop. Some of Fred and George's products will play roles in later books as well.

Cedric's death, and the way that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] spins it as being carelessness on Cedric's part, angers Harry and will lead to several confrontations between him and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher who was placed in the school by the Ministry, in the next book. While this is a very minor subplot in the next book, it is perhaps worth mentioning that the true story of Cedric's death is revealed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|the ''Quibbler'']] in early March, following an interview with Harry; and is finally publicly acknowledged by the Ministry following the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle in the Ministry]], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] and several Ministry employees see Voldemort physically present in the Ministry Atrium. As denying Voldemort's return is no longer possible, the Ministry elects to accept and publish Harry's full story.

Finally, as he has now seen death at first hand, Harry will be able to perceive that the horseless carriages that carry the Hogwarts students to and from the train station at each end of the school year are pulled by scary-looking animals. Harry will remain unsure of what these animals are, and whether they are light or dark magic, until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] introduces the class to the herd. It is only at this point that Harry learns that these are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]], and that they are harmless for all their evil appearance.

== Analysis ==

One thing that strikes the reader about Cedric's death is how casual it seems to be. Got two boys where you expected one? Kill the spare. Cedric's death serves to highlight Voldemort's casual inhumanity, his disregard for the value of human life other than his own. It also displays Wormtail's weak personality, in that he is clearly willing to take Cedric's life without question or cavil on the orders of Voldemort. If it is necessary, this is proof that what Harry is set up against is true evil, and confirms for us that Harry is on the right side. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|an earlier book]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] had told us that Voldemort taught him that there was no good or evil, only power; this one episode seems to show that there is in fact evil, and that it is embodied in Voldemort and his followers.

When the spirit echoes appear from Voldemort's wand, they emerge in the reverse order that they were murdered. Cedric appears first because he was the most recently killed. As a side note, it has been mentioned that the order of Harry's parents emerging from Voldemort's wand was accidentally reversed by the author; James was killed first and so should have emerged from Voldemort's wand after Lily, who actually appears after James in many editions of the book. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=19 The author has stated] that this was an uncaught editing mistake, made under the effects of time pressure and sleep deprivation. No mention has been made of whether it will be corrected in later editions, as other mistakes have been.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#Why does Voldemort have Cedric killed? 
#How is Cedric killed and who kills him?
#What is the Ministry of Magic's official stance regarding Cedric's death? Why?
#What eventually prompts the Ministry of Magic to acknowledge how Cedric actually died?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Cedric's death is a very small part of a larger event, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|Duel at the Cemetery]], and barely merits notice on its own. However, as we can see in the Notable Consequences, there are effects that are directly related to Cedric's death, and so a separate section is merited.

To a casual reader, actually, Cedric's death may seem to have little to do with advancing the plot. To this reader, the main effect of disposing of Cedric so lightly is to clear the way for Cho and Harry to start a relationship in the next book. Why this should be done is not immediately obvious, as the relationship is doomed, and in any event has little to do with the main story in any event; why should we, after all, waste time reading about Harry and Cho when there is Voldemort out there to be defeated? Against this, we must mention that it is a strength of this work that Harry is someone that we empathize with, that we actually care about, and a large part of that is our sharing the triumphs and defeats of his life, whether they be against the central evil, or simply to do with everyday living. Many readers will have been refused, as Harry was in this book, on first approaching the object of their desire, and it is reassuring to us to see, not only that Harry succeeds eventually in hooking up with Cho, but also that he learns of his mistake in so doing, and is not fatally wounded in that discovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{center|This category contains books on '''[[Subject:Theology|theology]]''': the study and commentary on the existence and attributes of a god or gods, and of how that god or those gods relate to the world and, especially, to human existence and religious thought; more generally, it is the study of religious faith, practice, and experience, or of spirituality. It is sometimes contrasted with [[:Category:Religious studies|religious studies]]: theology is understood as the study of religion from an internal perspective (e.g., a perspective of commitment to that religion), and religious studies as the study of religion from an external (e.g., a secular) perspective.}}

:I myself am a little reluctant to add anything to the Deathly Hallows timeline at present because, apart from Harry's birthday that is already on there, we don't know about anything that is going to happen. Bill and Fleur are going to get married, yes; school may or may not open, Harry may or may not attend - he has said he wouldn't – so everything else is simply too up in the air to add at the moment. Oh – for what it's worth, the title bar colours for each book's timeline have been selected to coincide with the title colours of the Bloomsbury / RainCoast editions of the books, which is why I had not yet created a timeline for book 7: I don't know what its colours are going to be yet.

== Snape Loyalty / Battle of Hogwarts ==

I reverted the bit about Snape because if you look at the history for that page you'll see that we wanted to hide that fact for lower down. I deleted the battle page because it was incorrectly named and I was hoping someone would just come in and create the page later. Since you mentioned it, I looked up the battle's official name from the book and created the page with the proper template. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:12, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

I just deleted the Order of the Phoenix talk page you just created because there was not even an article corresponding to that talk page and there is no Order of the Phoenix page under Places either.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Arimaa, a tactic is usually a one- or two-turn plan which can be calculated precisely.  Since there are up to four steps per turn, plans which aim farther than two turns ahead are usually impossible to calculate exactly, and therefore generally belong to the realm of [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy | strategy]].  This is in contrast to [[chess]] where precise tactics of three moves and longer (i.e. combinations) are quite feasible.

The most basic tactics to master are those that bring a friendly rabbit to goal or capture an enemy piece within four steps.  If a player can't achieve victory or capture in a single turn, the opponent may bring in reinforcements which change the situation dramatically. Such contingencies require strategic rather than tactical planning.

===One-move goal===

Most simply, a rabbit may be able to move to the goal within one turn, even if the path appears blocked by a trap square and/or opposing pieces which would seem to freeze the rabbit.  At left, the gold rabbit on b5 can step to victory via b6, c6, c7, and c8.  The rabbit is safe on the trap due to the gold dog on c5, and is never frozen because it is always next to a friendly piece on the way to goal. The rabbit will theoretically be frozen once it reaches c8, but Gold will have won regardless.

Pulling away an opposing piece may allow a blocked rabbit to advance.  At left, if the gold cat on h7 moves to h6 while pulling the silver rabbit from g7 to h7, the gold rabbit on g6 can then reach the goal in the turn's final two steps.  Note that the gold camel on f6 is lost when the rabbit advances, but reaching the goal is worth any sacrifice.  Many beginners seem to prefer pushing over pulling, but note that a push is ineffectual in this case.  If the gold cat pushes the silver rabbit, the cat will itself be in the way of the friendly rabbit, which won't then have time to reach the goal in the same move.

Near the goal line, a rabbit which is frozen but not blocked is a constant threat.  Silver to move could push the gold horse on b3 to c3 with the silver camel moving from b4 to b3.  This would unfreeze the silver rabbit on b2, which could then step to victory via a2 and a1.  Occasionally a blocked and frozen rabbit may be unblocked and unfrozen at the same time. Silver to move could pull the gold rabbit from g2 to g3 with the silver elephant sliding from g3 to f3, unfreezing the silver rabbit on f2, which could then step to the vacated g2 and then to g1, winning the game. The silver elephant would be lost as soon as the silver rabbit stepped away from the trap, but since Silver wins immediately, the elephant loss is of no consequence. With the silver rabbit beginning the turn blocked in all directions and also frozen, this one-turn goal is very easy to overlook.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===Trap control===
{{see also|Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Trap_Control|l1=Introduction to Strategy: Trap Control}}
The rules of Arimaa dictate that a piece is captured if it is located on a trap square and not next to any friendly pieces.  In the case of the c6 trap, the relevant squares are b6, c5, c7, and d6.  As long as Gold is able to maintain at least one piece on one of those four squares, Silver will never be able to capture any of Gold's pieces in that trap.  If both players are able to maintain at least one piece next to the trap, neither player will be able to make a capture.

The decision of which traps are worth fighting for and how to allocate forces is strategic, but the mechanics of fighting for control of a trap are in the realm of tactics.  In particular, at any given point in time a trap is either owned by Gold, owned by Silver, or contested.

===One-move capture===
{{arimaa diagram|=

A piece which is two squares away from an undefended trap square can often be dislodged twice and captured. In the diagram at right, if it is Silver's turn, the silver dog on b6 could push the gold cat on b7 to c7 (or pull it to b6) and then push it to c6. A piece which is only one square away from an otherwise undefended trap square is even more vulnerable, because it is threatened even by non-adjacent enemy pieces. If it is Gold's turn, the gold elephant on d5 can step to c5, then b5, and still have time to push the silver dog on b6 to c6.

Sometimes a player may need to push an obstructing piece out of the way to get at a vulnerable piece. Gold to move could push the silver cat on g7 to h7 with the gold camel on g6, then push the silver horse on f7 to f6, capturing it.

A piece on a trap square with only one adjacent friendly piece is extremely vulnerable.  Silver to move could capture the gold horse on c3 by stepping the silver elephant on d4 to c4, then b4, and then dislodging the gold dog on b3.

If one has two friendly pieces near a trap square, and the opponent has only one, it may be possible to capture by stepping through the trap square and pulling in the opposing piece.  Silver to move could step the silver camel on f4 south, where it is safe due to the silver dog on g3, then pull the gold dog on f2 north to f3, capturing it. 

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===One-move capture defense===
{{arimaa diagram|=

|
}}

The most common and fundamental capture defense is to station an elephant next to a trap square.  Since nothing can dislodge an elephant, nothing can be captured in that trap square until the elephant voluntarily moves away.  At left, no gold pieces can be captured in the northwest trap square as long as the gold elephant remains on c5.  If all stronger enemy pieces are tied up elsewhere, a single piece such as a horse may defend a trap square alone, but must beware of a changing situation which liberates any stronger opposing piece to move nearer and threaten it.

The second-most common and fundamental capture defense, ''mutual protection'', is to station two or more pieces next to a trap square.  This allows weaker pieces with numerical superiority to defend against one, and sometimes two strong attackers. However, mutual protection cannot defend against three attackers because they can surround three sides of a trap.  At left, Silver has defended the c6 trap square with a dog on b6 and a rabbit on c7.  If Gold pushes the dog away, there will not be enough steps left to capture the rabbit.  Gold to move can at most set up the threat of a capture for the following move, which gives Silver time to defend.

Occasionally players may wish to defend a trap square without bringing a second piece adjacent to it.  In this case a player generally obstructs the path of the attacking piece with friendly pieces.  The gold camel on g6 can't capture the vulnerable silver horse on f7, because the silver cat on g7 is in the way, and the silver rabbits on h7 and g8 prevent the cat from being pushed.  Gold could pull the cat to g6, but that would only make it a second defender of the northeast trap square.

The situation around the southwest trap square is straightforward.  Because of the gold rabbit on b4, the silver elephant can't get adjacent to the gold dog on b3 with two steps left to dislodge it.

One counter-intuitive way to block the path of an opposing piece is to station a friendly piece on a trap square.  Silver to move could push or pull the gold cat on f3 in a variety of ways, but always to a square from which it defends the f3 trap square long enough to prevent the capture of the gold dog on f2 for at least the present move.  The disadvantage of this strategy is that the cat itself will be captured if the dog can be dislodged.

A last resort capture defense is ''scattering'', i.e. retreating threatened pieces away from a trap to the edges and corners of the board.  Scattering usually only delays captures, because the weak pieces can be frozen and eventually pulled into the trap which has been stripped of its defense.  Furthermore, scattering away from a home trap may leave a hole through which an opposing rabbit can march to the goal.  On the other hand, delaying captures for a few moves may buy time which is critical to making progress elsewhere on the board.  This defensive technique is most often useful late in the game when defenders are few (which makes mutual protection less feasible) and goal threats are imminent (which leaves less time to hunt down fleeing pieces). 

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===False protection===
{{arimaa diagram|=

|
}}

After one has learned the basic ways of defending a trap square, one may be lured into a false sense of security by an illusion of defense.  At right, Silver has two pieces next to the northwest trap square, but since both pieces can be dislodged, Gold has a one-move capture.  First the gold elephant on b5 can push the silver dog from b6 to c6, and then the newly unfrozen gold cat on b7 can push the silver rabbit from c7 to c8, capturing the dog.  Alternatively Gold can capture the rabbit by pushing or pulling the dog away from b6, then pushing the rabbit from c7 into c6.

Around the northeast trap square, the gold camel is blocked from pushing the silver horse into the trap square in one move, but not from pulling it there.  Gold could first step the gold rabbit on g5 to f5, making it safe for the gold camel to step to f6, after which the gold camel could step either east or west while pulling the silver horse south and capturing it.

In the southwest corner Gold has calculated that even if the silver elephant pushes the gold rabbit from b4 to a4, the gold dog on b3 is safe from a push.  This is correct but insufficient, because the silver elephant may still ''pull'' the gold dog from b3 to b4, capturing the gold horse on c3.

The situation around the southeast trap square demonstrates that an enemy piece in a trap square provides less protection than a friendly one.  Silver may voluntarily step east or west with the dog on f3, and still have three steps left to enter the trap square with the camel on f4, then pull the gold dog from f2 to f3, capturing it.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===The fork===
{{arimaa diagram|=

2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |rg|=
1 |rg|  |  |  |  |  |  |rg|=
|The gold elephant has forked the silver dog between the c3 and f3 traps
}}

The fork (or hostage fork) threatens a single frozen piece with capture in two different traps.  It is the most basic of the two-move tactics: On the first move an enemy piece is threatened, and on the second move it is inevitably captured.  In the diagram at left, from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=8241&amp;s=w this game], Gold has threatened to capture the silver dog in either the c3 or the f3 trap square.  Silver to move would need one step to defend the c3 trap square with the elephant, and three steps to defend the f3 trap square with the cat.  Unfortunately for Silver, the gold rabbit on e4 is threatening to reach goal next move, so Silver must spend at least one step defending the goal, and the silver dog is lost.

Forks resulting in immediate material gain are more common later in the game when fewer defenders are available, but even if both relevant traps can be defended, holding a hostage near one or two traps can be an effective strategy to commit enemy pieces to defensive positions.
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===The fence===
{{arimaa diagram|=

|The silver horse on c4 has been fenced in; Silver to move can't save it.
}}

The fence (or hostage fence) is a two-move tactic somewhat less common than the fork.  On the first move a hostage is brought next to a trap, and hemmed in on two sides.  The piece may be unfrozen from a third side, but then its only direction of retreat would be into the trap.  In the diagram at right, from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=8646&amp;s=w this game], Gold has fenced the silver horse next to the c3 trap square.  Silver is on move, but can't prevent the capture of the horse.  The silver elephant could indeed unfreeze the fenced horse by moving to c5 (incidentally capturing the gold rabbit in the c6 trap square), but the technically unfrozen silver horse can't then escape, as its only available move would be suicide.  Furthermore, the silver elephant can't get adjacent to the c3 trap in four steps, a blocking motif common in the opening when the board is still crowded.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===Limitations of tactics===

|There are no forced captures even in this sharp opening.
}}

Beyond the above-listed tactics, there are not many ways to achieve immediate material gain in Arimaa.  Particularly at the beginning of the game, defenders are plentiful, and captures can be postponed.  The position at left arose from a relatively sharp opening in [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=7945&amp;s=w this game].  Gold advanced all the heavy pieces, and Silver on the last move froze three of them.  The horse on f4 and camel on e5 are both threatened with capture in the northeast trap square.  Also the gold horse on d4 can be pushed to d6 with a hostage fork, if the gold elephant evacuates d6.  Yet in spite of these multiple threats, Gold can move to prevent any captures in at least the next three moves of Silver, certainly beyond the ability of humans or computers to analyze exhaustively.

In fact, it may not be obvious to inexperienced Arimaa players that Silver is winning.  Material is even, and Gold, with more pieces activated, may appear more able to make the first capture.  Gold could press the attack by stepping cat to g4, horse to f5, and camel to e6, with a step to spare.  (Perhaps dog to h3 to prepare to defend the southeast trap square again.)  It is entirely a strategic judgement that the vulnerability of the advanced gold pieces is, in this particular position, a greater liability than their attacking power is an asset.

After becoming acquainted with the most basic Arimaa tactics, you should turn your attention to long-term strategy, which will better enable you to get into positions where tactics are of use.

===Introduction to '''Molecular dynamics'''===
You will remember from your spectroscopy that vibrations,
and that includes internal rotations, are quantized. In MD we
use a classical force field and ignore this quantization putting in
classical energy according to Newton's Laws. This might at first sight
appear to be totally unsound in view of all we have been taught about quantum theory
but in fact what it means is we are replacing a ''summation'' with a
Monte Carlo ''integration''.
Only in very special cases is there a dramatic difference.
Situations with strong force constants and light particles ''i.e.''
protons are likely to show this.
If, and this is a big if, the trajectories of the particles are chaotic
all the ''phase space'' of the  molecular vibrations and in particular
internal rotational conformers, will be covered.
Only if this has occurred do we have a ''temperature''. (A temperature
is a single number which allows one to reproduce the occupations of
the states of the system using Boltzmann statistics. If there is no
Boltzmann distribution, there is no temperature.)

One focus of research here has been the development of methods which
allow a reliable temperature to be created for gas phase molecular systems.
(Condensed phases with plentiful collisions are self randomizing and
the Boltzmann distribution is rapidly established.)
Simply apply Newtons laws of motion.  In one dimensional form they are:

&lt;math&gt;f = ma&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
 v = u + a t&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; s = ut + \frac 1 2 a t^2
&lt;/math&gt;


s is a new position.
Force is &lt;math&gt; - \frac {dV_{s}} {dx}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;t + \delta t&lt;/math&gt; then run for ''n'' timesteps.


Verlet algorithm

&lt;math&gt;
s ( t + \delta t) = s (t) + v (t) \delta t + \frac 1 2 a (t) \delta t^2 + ....
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
s ( t - \delta t) = s (t) - v (t) \delta t + \frac 1 2 a (t) \delta t^2 - ....
&lt;/math&gt;

add these together then :

&lt;math&gt;
s ( t + \delta t) = 2 s (t) - s ( t - \delta t) +  a (t) \delta t^2 - ....
&lt;/math&gt;

These are applied to the 3N-6 dimensional hypersurface of a single molecule,
or to all free coordinates of an infinitely repeating system.

===Single molecule dynamics===
Applications in liquid crystals and biological chemistry often
involve dynamics on a single molecule in an infinite vacuum. There are considerable technical
problems here both in establishing a temperature and in ensuring the
3N-6 dimensional phase space is covered with populations according to the
Boltzmann distribution.
In practice this can only be assured in special circumstances and for proteins
there is the continual phenomenon of sticking in a given ''neighbourhood'' of
conformations. In this case the timescales of the physical processes of changing between
energetically equivalent conformations may be longer than the simulation.
Putting molecules in a box with inert gas bumping into it is one way of
trying for conformational equilibrium.

=== Table  - Timescales of molecular processes===
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Secs&lt;th&gt;name &lt;th&gt; Process
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; &lt;th&gt; Surface reorganizations
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; milliseconds &lt;th&gt; Protein Folding
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; 10 nanoseconds &lt;th&gt; NMR
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; Brownian dynamics
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; Lattice Monte-Carlo
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; picoseconds &lt;th&gt; Fast vibrations
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;th&gt; femtoseconds &lt;th&gt; Electronic excitation
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt; &lt;th&gt; &lt;th&gt; (molecular dynamics)
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

A good simulation regime for a teaching exercise is 10 femtoseconds with C-H bond vibrations
frozen out. Research requires considerably more care and much longer runs!
It would not be a good idea to investigate protein folding using a conventional
MD program and a 0.5 femtosecond time step.

===The finite box size===
A finite box is also a problem, but a ''minimum image convention'' allows for
infinitely repeating boxes in the 3 Cartesian directions.
Software for infinite boxes and the AMBER and GROMOS force field exists
within CCP5 (The DLPOLY package). There are problems with electrostatic interactions.
The Coulomb Interaction goes as inverse &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to the power one. This dies away very slowly
over several images of the box before dying away to insignificance.
This must be handled by a complicated procedure known as an Ewald Sum.

Liquid simulations often calculate ''G-of-r'', not to be confused with the
quantum theory matrix ''G-of-R''. This is the radial probability
density, which is experimentally accessible ''via'' neutron diffraction.
It can therefore act as simulation quality check on whether the right
liquid solvation shell structure is being generated.

A good description of modern simulation techniques is in
Allen and Tildesley.
====Problems====

i) A Gas phase liquid crystal molecule

Make a liquid crystal prototype by adding a (CH2)n tail onto phenol's
acidic proton. Run a dynamic simulation at various temperatures to see the side chain
move about.

2) Histogramming

Make hexamine-diamine. Use ANALYZE to monitor the distance
between the N-atoms. Use DYNAMIC and MonSt to create a histogram on this
N to N distance.
Repeat this with a flexible dihedral angle in a molecule of interest to you.

===Introduction===
Our applications of quantum theory here involve solving the wave equation
for a given molecular geometry. This can be done at a variety
of levels of approximation each with a variety of computing resource requirements.

Our applications of quantum theory here involve solving the wave equation
for a given molecular geometry. This can be done at a variety
of levels of approximation each with a variety of computing resource requirements.
We are assuming here a vague familiarity with the Self Consistent
Field wavefunction and its component molecular orbitals.

&lt;math&gt;
&lt; \Psi_{0} | \hat{H} | \Psi_{0} &gt;
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
&lt; \Psi_{0} | K.E. + V_{nuc} + \sum_{i &lt; j} {\frac {1} {r_{ij}}} | \Psi_{0} &gt;
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;ij&lt;/math&gt; summation indices are over all electron pairs.
It is the &lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {r_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; which prevents easy solution of the equation, either
by separation of variables for a single atom, or by simple matrix equations
for a non spherical molecule.

The electron density &lt;math&gt;\rho (x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-electron density
&lt;math&gt;\rho (N)&lt;/math&gt;. If we know &lt;math&gt;\rho (N-1)&lt;/math&gt; we can solve 
&lt;math&gt;&lt; \Psi_{0} | \hat{H} | \Psi_{0} &gt;&lt;/math&gt;
So we ''guess'' &lt;math&gt;\rho (N)&lt;/math&gt; and solve &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; independent  Schrödinger equations.
Unfortunately each solution then depends on &lt;math&gt;\rho (N)&lt;/math&gt; which we guessed.
So we extrapolate a new &lt;math&gt;\rho^{'}  (N)&lt;/math&gt; and solve the  temporary
Schrödinger  equation
again. This continues until &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; stops changing. If our initial guessed &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; was
appropriate we will have the SCF approximation to the groud state.

This can be done for numerical &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; or we can use LCAO
(Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) in an algebraic form and integrate
into a linear algebraic matrix problem.
This use of a ''basis set'' is our normal way of doing calculations.

Our wavefunction is a product of ''molecular orbitals'',
technically in the form of a Slater determinant in order to ensure
the antisymmetry of the electronic wavefunction.
This has some technical consequences which you need not be concerned with unless
doing a theoretical project. Theoreticians
should make Szabo and  Ostlund their bedtime reading.

&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_{k} (x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, .....x_{N}) ~=~
\frac {1} {\sqrt {N!}  } ~determinant &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
 \psi _{A} (x_{1}) \psi _{B} (x_{1}) ..........\psi _{N} (x_{1})
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
 \psi _{A} (x_{2}) \psi _{B} (x_{2}) ..........\psi _{N} (x_{2})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;

 ......&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;

 ......&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;

 \psi _{A} (x_{N})&lt;th&gt; \psi _{B} (x_{N}) ..........\psi _{N} (x_{N})
&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is expanded in terms of the atomic orbitals &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; the troublesome
&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {r_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; term picks out producted pairs of atomic orbitals
either side of the operator. This leads to a number of ''four-centre integrals''of order &lt;math&gt;n^4&lt;/math&gt;. These fill up the disc space and take a long time to compute.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just got Reaktor and I'm super confused, I try opening the presets and I'm instantly overwhelmed by the seeming hermetism of its approach. I just don't know were to start. I don't feel I'm making music with the presets, they just make music for themselves, there is no user agency. I made the tutorial on building a simple synth, but how about a sampler or a drum machine? Mostly I like to learn how can I sequence, with Reaktor itself or using Cubase for example, with maybe two or three instruments. Just so I can start using it on a song.</text>

===Drywall===
 
== Before you begin ==
     *Get your suggested tools. 
     *Plan where you will put the debris. 
     *Use dropcloths to protect the floor coverings. 
     *Cut off the power to any electrical in the wall.

== When you are ready ==
     Remove the doors 
     Remove the trim 
     Remove the drywall by knocking holes in it and pulling it off
     Knock the studs out one at the time and 
      then remove your top and bottom plate
     Remove any electrical by tracing it back 
      to where it originates from and safely leave it in an electrical box.
== Tips ==
     you can reduce the mess by cutting along the center of the 
      wall studs with a sharp knife. You only need to cut through the paper. 
     All the way through will reduce the mess even further.

===Plaster===

===Wood Paneling===

'''''== == Before ==
   Ask yourself questions like.
     What is this paneling applied to?
     Does it have sheetrock or something behind it
     was it attached directly to the studs? 
     Also, are you attempting to salvage the paneling 
       or will you simply throw it away? 
      (If it was applied with an adhesive, plan on not being able to salvage it!) =='''''

== When Ready ==
      Start removing the paneling
      If it was just nailed, start at a joint 
        and work it loose with a small pry bar or a stiff putty knife
        Once the first panel is off of each wall, 
        the rest are easier since you can get to the edge easier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:&quot;'''''religion''': [M.E. religioum, fr. L. religion; religio reverence, religion, prob. fr. religare to tie back - more at RELY] 1 a (1). the service and worship of God or the supernatural (2): commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance b: the state of a religious 2: a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices. 3 archaic: scrupulous conformity: CONSCIENTIOUSNESS 4: a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor or faith.''&quot; -Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (1967)

:&quot;''Religion is a communication system that is constituted by supernatural beings and is related to specific patterns of behavior''.&quot; -H. H. Penner

:&quot;''Religion is man's involvement in the meaning of his existence, and the depth of one's involvement is the depth of his religion.&quot;'' -James L. Christian

:&quot;''Religion is a sense of the sacred.''&quot; -Sir Julian Huxley

:&quot;''Religion is man's ultimate concern for the ultimate.''&quot;  -Paul Tillich

:&quot;''Religion is a human being's total concern about Man's world.''&quot; -Arnold Toynbee

Religion can be distilled as any belief system that rests explicitly on faith, but if you asked ten theologians what &quot;religion&quot; is, you would get 12 different answers. That is because religion is a complex subject and &quot;religion&quot; is only a word. Like all words, it can mean anything we want it to mean, but in a discussion, it is important that we understand how the word is used.

There is a problem with many of the common definitions of religion. If it has to do with how we relate to God, then Buddhism, Confucianism and core shamanism is left out because they have little to say about God. Many Christians claim that, since religion is a formalized system of knowledge, Christianity is not a religion since it is a relationship with Christ. That contradicts the Biblical author James since he maintained that Christianity is &quot;pure religion and undefiled before God.&quot; The Greek word he used was &lt;i&gt;threkeia&lt;/i&gt; or &quot;ceremonial observance, worship, religion&quot;.

Whereas the concepts &quot;sacred&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; are quite basic to Western religion, they are not so in the Orient, so definitions that involve those ideas will not do. Also, definitions like Tillich's and Toynbee's subsume too much for the purposes of this book. One could say that philsophy is the study of man's concern for the ultimate and Toynbee's definition might include plumbing and badmitton, neither of which will be featured in this work.

It was held in the early days of philosophy that a word has an essential meaning - a definition that captured the essence of all uses of the word. That is, perhaps, somewhat naive. Very few words have just one meaning and most have various meaning that have very little to do with each other. For instance, a hat may be something you wear on your head or it might be a symbol used in statistics or it might be a drum. The German philosopher Wittgenstein took another position. Various uses of a word does not have an essential meaning but has more of a family resemblance. It's generally hard to put your finger on why members of a family look alike but it's usually not one particular feature but a set of features that may or may not all be present in the same individual, yet enough of them are present in any one member of the family to preserve the resemblance throughout. We will be working with concepts in the family of religion.

I will bypass all these semantical trivialities by using the following definition for religion: &quot;the study and/or practice of what is generally considered to be religion - personal or organized.&quot; That will include Christianity, Buddhism, Shamanism, and Aunt Polly's talking to her dearly departed Uncle Fred. It will include magic and witchcraft, hermits and wise men.

And, fully aware of the etymological intent of the term &quot;theology&quot; (Meanings of words usually change from their original meanings over time), I will take the word to mean, simply &quot;the study of religions.&quot;

There are a few other words that will be important here. A &quot;doctrine&quot; is a formalization of a system of religious beliefs.

A &quot;dogma&quot; is a doctrine that is considered to be held universally within a religion.

A &quot;creed&quot; is a set of belief (the word means &quot;I believe&quot;) that are central to a religion - beliefs that distinguish members of a religious group from other people.

We should also have an understanding of the meaning of &quot;philosophy&quot;. It can mean a general approach to life as in &quot;what is your philosophy of life?&quot; I have something a little more formal in mind. Philosophy as an intellectual pursuit typically concerns considerations once removed. Science, for instance is the investigation of the physical world or the knowledge obtained from such. The philosophy of science, on the other hand, involves how people approach science - how we think about the physical world, how we can be confident about such knowledge, and how we should (ethically) approach and use such knowledge.  

Then, the philosophy or religion is concerned not with information about God or various religious systems of belief, but with why we should be concerned with such things, if and how we can know about them, and how people think about them. There will be a little admixture here of things that are not exactly philosophy, but are somewhat related. I will be writing some about the psychology of religion, for instance. also, we will consider the relationship of religion with other disciplines such as science, politics, and art.

      <comment>/* Benefits of playing Go */ -remove needless sentence fragment</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Firstly, Go is fun. It is an enjoyable way of stretching your brain and maintaining mental condition in a social context. It is extremely simple to learn to play, yet there is more that can be learned about the game than can be achieved in any single lifetime.

Unlike some mind sports, there is no need to visualise or memorise long continuations (for example, learning openings and endgames in chess). There is a well established handicapping system, which allows players of very different abilities to enjoy a game with equal prospects of winning.

The equipment required to play is fairly easy to generate without expense, as all that is required is 2 sets of 161 counters of a different colour to each other, and a board with lines (a simple computer printout works fine).

=Benefits of playing Go=

* Mind games where luck is not an element are known to exercise both halves of the brain. This has been found to be helpful in avoiding degenerative brain diseases such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimers Alzheimers]
* Go teaches patience, discipline, and open-mindedness. It is a game where greed is punished, and creativity is rewarded.
* Many consider the skills learned and developed in Go to be applicable to all areas of life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Equipment=
The equipment which is used to play Go has remained almost the same throughout the game's four thousand year history and is simple enough that you could make do with things found around your own home.
==Board==
[[Image:Go-tisch.png|thumb|A Go board with stones and bowl on top]]
The Board, or Goban (碁盤) in Japanese, is the surface on which the game is played. Printed on this board is a grid, usually nineteen-by-nineteen though other sizes are common. Games are also frequently played on smaller boards, traditionally 9x9 and 13x13. It's possible to experiment with even more unusual board geometries. A traditional Goban has four feet and sits on the floor, but many modern boards have no feet and are designed for tabletop use. These are also called table boards. Beginning players often play on paper using a thirteen-by-thirteen grid, allowing them to get the hang of the game without spending a lot of money on a board or time on more complicated, full-board games. Physical gobans are traditionally made of light-colored wood.  They range from cheap models (folding boards, roll-up mats) to club-quality boards (solid wood ranging up to 4&quot; thick or so) and truly beautiful traditional &quot;floor boards,&quot; which have legs and are often constructed with great care from exotic woods such as the coveted &quot;[[Go/Glossary_of_terms#Kaya|Kaya]].&quot;

==Stones==
[[Image:Go_board_part.jpg|left|thumb|Go stones on a board]]
Stones are the game pieces of Go and are placed on the intersections of the lines on a board. The stones are black and white, generally made from glass, plastic, marble, slate, or clamshell, and come in many sizes ranging from 7mm  to 11.3mm in thickness. A set of Go stones can cost anywhere from a few dollars to thousands of dollars. The highest-quality stones are made from slate (black) and specially carved clamshells (white), and cost hundreds of dollars per set. A full set of stones consists of 181 black stones and 180 white stones. Stones are uniform and round, reminiscent of an oversized M&amp;M candy. It is traditional to have a bowl for each player's stones (these are often carved pleasingly from attractive woods), using the upturned lid of the bowl to store captured prisoner stones of the opposite color during play.

==Bowls==
[[Image:Go-goban.jpg|thumb|a bowl]]
Bowls are just a place to keep your stones while they are not on the board. They are not a necessary part of the equipment. Bowls are normally made from wood or plastic and are usually the cheapest part of a set. Some boards have drawers to keep stones in so you don't have to have bowls, however most do not. Captured stones are kept in the lid of the bowl.

=Playing on a computer=
If you want to play Go but don't want to buy/make/borrow the equipment needed you could also try playing on a digital board such as qGo.

== Overview ==

The '''''Philosopher's Stone''''' (known in the United States editions of the books as the '''''Sorcerer's Stone''''') is an artifact that can turn inexpensive metals into gold or create an ''elixir'' that would make humans younger, thus delaying death. We are told that elixir produced by the Philosopher's Stone is actually capable of returning someone to full life if there is even the tiniest bit of life left within him.

In the Muggle world, it was a longtime &quot;holy grail&quot; of Western alchemy. In alchemy, making the philosopher's stone would bring enlightenment upon the maker and conclude the Great Work. It is also known as materia prima.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Philosopher's Stone is, of course, the key object in the first book of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] series. The specific instance we see in this story is about three inches long, and is kept under heavy guard much  of the time. We are told that this is the only known Philosopher's Stone in the world at present.

When we first see it, the Stone is in a grubby little paper parcel in one of the high security vaults under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Wizarding Bank]]. It is retrieved from the vault by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], and apparently brought to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].

Once Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] discover what the object is, they understand why people seem to be seeking it. They do eventually determine where it is hidden, and that it is guarded by means of enchantments set by many of the teachers at Hogwarts.

Determining that the Stone is at risk, the Trio then seek out its hiding place, apparently in the hope of defending the Stone. In the end, Harry alone reaches the chamber where the Stone is hidden, and manages to retrieve it from its hiding place and defend it from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]].

In the final chapter of the book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] says that he has destroyed the Stone. This upsets Harry, as he has learned that a friend of Dumbledore's, Nicolas Flamel, has been using the Stone to make the elixir that keeps him alive, but Dumbledore says that, after a very long life, Flamel and his wife Perenelle are quite prepared for death.

== Analysis ==

The Philosopher's Stone is a unique magical artifact; there is only one in the world, and at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' it is destroyed. Although it appears only in this one book, its influence does show up in other books, most notably in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', where it is believed by many that another unique artifact mentioned in that book is simply a distorted impression of the actions of the Philosopher's Stone.

One of the key differences between the two sides in the battle of the entire series is actually highlighted by the Philosopher's Stone, and its role in the first book in the series. Much of the book, and the main conflict at the end of the book, is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], from his perch on the back of Professor Quirrell's head, attempting to capture the Philosopher's Stone and the return to life that it promises, against Harry attempting to keep him from that goal with the assistance of Professor Dumbledore and, surprisingly, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. Voldemort, we learn, will stop at nothing, including the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]], and of his host Quirrell, to return to life himself. Contrasted to that, we have Dumbledore, speaking of Nicolas Flamel (but possibly equally speaking of himself), telling Harry that &quot;after all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.&quot; Although we have not yet properly met Voldemort, we can already see his fear of death, and his willingness to sacrifice anything and anyone else, in order to retain his life; and we can see Dumbledore's acceptance that death comes to all people, Muggle and wizard alike. This difference in the understanding of what death is, and how one becomes master of it, is something of a theme throughout the entire series. We will learn about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] that Voldemort has used to anchor his soul to this world even when his body is destroyed, and we will learn about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], which according to legend give the holder mastery over Death.

In an interview, the author has stated that the theme of death and the afterlife became somewhat more prominent in the series following the death of her mother, which occurred while she was writing. While she did not specifically say which book she was writing at the time, one suspects that it was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], because this particular theme comes into prominence in that book.

A few notes:

- Read as much literature as you can, this will foster your understanding of the game.

- Play with both weaker and stronger players: Playing with strongers will help you gain new strategies, and playing with weakers will allow you to refine them. 

- Watch Pro games and attempt to follow them.  Professional games can be found online for free (as SGF files) or purchased as a collection. There is a free screensaver (Turbogo) that will play games stored on your computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why study other religions? I think I will try to answer that question from a personal perspective. The question then becomes, how can it benefit me or how can it help me benefit others by knowing something about their religions.

If I am concerned about others, I will be interested in their lives. What problems do they have and how do they face them? Certainly religion plays a part in those things. How do I meet them? Should I assume that everyone is like me - that they have the same hope and dreams, that they see the world the same? It is often the case that people make these assumptions when they meet but it is evident that much confusion and misunderstanding would be prevented if instead, the assumptions held were that  new acquainanced were discoveries to be made. Connection is made when I understand another person's point of view. I can connect on points of similarity but I can also connect on shared interest in differences.

If I want to be a benefit to others, I need to understand their world view. Some attempts to help an individual that hold different beliefs may actually be taboo in their religion. Can I be of any benefit to them if they reject me?

In a different vein, I am a Christian. I would not be a Christian if I did not think that Christianity held an accurate view of reality. Yet, on studying other religions, I find that they have different focuses on life and have come to more indepth understanding in some elements of life than I have found in my own system of beliefs. For instance, although Christianity has somewhat to say about materialism and self discipline, Buddhism has explored the issues in much more depth. The native religions of North America have much to say about what it is to live a balanced life. In an age of frantic extremes, balance is greatly needed. I find that other religious people have much of value to say.

And finally, and I think also relevant to this book, it is pleasant to sit back and read the tales of other people that give voice to their spirit as a people, their aspirations, their hopes and dreams.

== Overview ==

'''''Trevor''''' is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville's]] pet toad, who is forever getting lost.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When we first see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], he is standing on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|the platform]] talking to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|an older witch]], apparently his grandmother. It seems that he has lost Trevor. 

We are introduced to Trevor by Neville, who looks in to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s compartment on the Hogwarts Express to ask if they have seen him. Some time later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] stops by on the same errand; apparently she has chosen to help Neville in his search. Trevor remains lost until the students are leaving the boats on the shore of the lake under Hogwarts; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] apparently then finds him and asks whose toad this is.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] had demonstrated making things fly by sending Neville's toad soaring about the classroom.

Neville is apparently trying to catch Trevor again when he overhears Harry, Ron, and Hermione planning how to get through the trap door. Dropping Trevor, he prepares, unsuccessfully, to fight them.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When we meet Neville in the Hogwarts Express, he is dragging his trunk and holding on to a struggling Trevor. He continues to hold Trevor throughout the early part of the trip, dumping him in Harry's lap as he prepares to demonstrate the defensive mechanism of his prized [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mimbulus Mimbletonia|Mimbulus Mimbletonia]]. Harry, holding on to Trevor, is drenched with Stinksap.

We see Trevor again as they leave the train; Neville carefully stores him in an inside pocket.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

== Strengths ==

Although he is often getting lost, Trevor always manages to get found again. It seems he has some ability to transport himself, as he manages to reach the far shore of the lake before Neville himself does.

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

Trevor seems to be present only to give Neville something else to misplace and worry about. He never appears to have any power save that of getting lost, and later appearing where he would have been if Neville had been able to retain him — for instance, he is lost on the Hogwarts Express, in book 1, but then appears near the castle as the first-years are getting out of the boats.

I have spent over 30 years designing, writing, implementing and running computer systems for chemistry research, admin, finance, investment and education around the interface of chemistry, pharmacology, mathematics and computer science.

My other big interest is music where I am a ''portfolio musician'', doing playing, composing, publishing and teaching.

I am hoping not to waste some of my useful written material from over 30 years of work by putting it into open source books.

== Computer Aided '''Drug design'''==

=== Quantum Pharmacology===
This area covers the use of electronic structure theories to ''de novo''
design of drugs, extraction of structure activity relationships and
development of pharmacophores to rationalise the drug's mechanism.
Computations, proteomics and genomics have advanced considerably since Richard's book and maybe new definitions are needed.

W. G. Richards,   ''Quantum Pharmacology'',  (Butterworths,London,1977).

===QSAR===
A lot of work goes into developing Quantitative Structure Activity
Relationships. This can be done by regression analysis even where there
is no adequate model of the active site of the process. Some examples
are being extracted from literature which we have in the Chemistry
Library, (much literatuire of relevance is in biological and pharmacological
journals.
Some QSAR work uses classic physical organic chemistry such as the Taft and Hammett
equations, whereas in recent work all manner of unusual properties may
be incorporated into a QSAR.

There is even interest in exotic artificial intelligence technologies
such as neural nets.
A new technique in this area is known as [[Support vector machines]].

Hansch, C. and Leo, A.  ''Exploring QSAR: ACS Professional Reference Book'', (American Chemical Society, Washington, DC,1995).

===Neural Nets to Design Drugs===
This is a comparatively new area of chemistry / chemo-informatics but it already has a classic textbook:

      <text xml:space="preserve">''' Previous chapter - ''' [[../Drug Design/]]

=== Introduction to '''Continuum Solvation Models''' ===
Most reactions we are concerned with actually go on in some kind of
fluid medium rather than in the gas phase at zero degrees Kelvin.
(There is the interesting but impractical philosophical point that the
commonest reaction in the universe is H2 + proton &gt;&gt; H3+ at
3 degrees Kelvin, (the remnant of the big bang temperature), and very low pressure.
Most of the universe is made of Hydrogen and most of its
matter is in the vast spaces between the stars in galaxies.)

There are ways of dealing with the solvent medium problem, none of them
fully satisfactory but some of them very good for dilute solutions.
Read the electrochemistry and ionic atmosphere sections of Atkins'
''Physical Chemistry'' for a detailed discussion of some of the issues.
=== Continuum plus Quantum Mechanics ===
Our method of choice will abandon a description of the solvent
as discrete molecules but will replace it by a continuous dielectric.
This is like a jelly which can be electrostatically strained by non zero
potentials which both screen and interact with the quantum part of the system.

==== The Dielectric Constant ====
The dielectric constant, a dimensionless number which is a ratio of electrical
permittivities against the permittivity of free space determines the chemical characteristics of the solvent.
Large numbers are ''polar'' solvents. Small numbers ''apolar''. Large numbers mean that the Coulomb terms are attenuated and though the energy still goes off as 1/''r'' the values
are smaller than in free space. 

The following table is a conflation of data from the following primary and secondary sources which need to be consulted over the precise values to use in research.

==== Citations for Dielectric Constant Sources ====

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Hydrogen sulphide (liquid)&lt;th&gt;9.26&lt;th&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;


The molecule lives in a shape where the dielectric is 1, ''i.e.'' free
space, and outside the quantum zone a continuous dielectric with a permittivity
chosen according to the system being modelled. The energies of interaction
are most negative when the dielectric constant is high. This can be rationalized
by image charges in the dielectric being large near the junction and are screened
away rapidly but are near to their opposite values in
polar groups in the molecule. Clearly energy per atom, when decomposed will
follow the atoms with highest Mulliken charge population.

Such a calculation would allow the prediction of the &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; of the
acetic acids discussed earlier but of course would still give
the wrong answer because of the entropic terms being entirely absent from the model.

The solvation model for Macromodel uses functional
group derived charges but of course explicitly uses the
molecular mechanics shape of the molecule.

=== Dielectric Screening ===
For some molecular mechanics application, particularly the calculation
of long-range Coulomb forces ''inside'' macromolecules, a dielectric constant
other than 1 may be used. (A constant of 4 is often used in protein modelling).
A true quantum treatment would allow for the internal
screening by the electrons but molecular mechanics can only deal with this by some
kind of fix. Typically a dielectric constant equivalent to an alkane is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==What writing system does this language use?==
Catalan uses the Roman alphabet, which was originally used in Latin. Today, it is used in almost all European languages.

The letters '''U''' and '''J''' were added to the Roman alphabet in the Middle Ages.  Catalan doesn't use '''K''' or '''W''', except in foreign words.  Catalan only uses '''Y''' in the combination '''NY'''.

Catalan also uses '''Ç''' (which is considered a variant of '''C'''), grave accents ('''À''', '''È''' and '''Ò'''), acute accents ('''É''', '''Í''', '''Ó''' and '''Ú''') and dieresis ('''Ï''' and '''Ü'''). The letter X is usually pronounced like SH in English, but in some words it is pronounced like X in English.

There also exists the combination '''L·L''', using an interpunct between letters; it is pronounced like LL in the world &quot;caller&quot; in English. The combination LL without the interpunct is pronounced like the ''gli'' in the word &quot;tagliatelle&quot; (a kind of pasta).

==How many people speak this language?==
It is difficult to say how many people speak Catalan because immigration in the last half of the 20th century has doubled the population of the area in which it is spoken. But the estimates are that about 6.5 million people speak it as their native language and roughly another 6.5 million people speak it as a second language, for a total of about 13 million speakers.

Catalan is considered to have more speakers than any other minority language in Europe.

==Where is this language spoken?==
The Catalan language is spoken in parts of [[Wikijunior:Europe/Spain|Spain]] (Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands and La Franja), [[Wikijunior:Europe/France|France]] (Northern Catalonia), [[Wikijunior:Europe/Italy|Italy]] (the little city of Alguer) and the small country of [[Wikijunior:Europe/Andorra|Andorra]] in the Pyrenees, where it is the only official language.

==What is the history of this language?==
Catalan is a member of the Romance branch of Indo-European languages, descended largely from Latin. The first documents written in what can be recognized as Catalan rather than vernacular Latin date from about 1000 years ago.

The language was born in Andorra and in the frontier of Spain and France and expanded to the other territories in the Middle Ages.

Except in Andorra, speaking Catalan language has been forbidden three times in history during more than two centuries. Now it can be studied freely in the schools, except in France, where today it is not forbidden but French is the only official language.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
Relatively few Catalan authors are well-known among non-Catalan-speaking people. Here are some examples: Ramon Llull was the first in Western Europe to write about science and philosophy in a modern language. Other important writers of the past were Joanot Martorell (Tirant lo Blanc), Ausiàs March and Jacint Verdaguer (poets).

Important authors of the last century include Quim Monzó, Mercè Rodoreda and Manuel de Pedrolo, who have been translated into many languages.

The goal of this book is to educate children about processes and technologies that can improve the lives of people in poor or disadvantaged communities, while respecting their local environment.

When working on this project, remember that it is aimed at children. It must be simple and easily understood while being quite accurate. Use technical vocabulary when you need to, but don't use big words where simpler language would work.

== Translations ==
The goal of this project is to inform people and especially children in rural communities of technologies that could improve their way of living.

To achieve that goal translating the text into many languages will be an important. As the document evolves it will be probable that each translation will differ from the original English text, in the early stages of the project that would not matter. However, before a text in a language other than English should be deemed complete, it should coincide with the English text. To achieve this either the text in question or the English text could be updated. In case of dispute the English text would prevail as stated in the GNU license.

&lt;b&gt; Previous chapter - &lt;/b&gt; [[../Continuum solvation models/]]

The latest method of obtaining lead molecules for drug design involves using genome
information to generate the virtual proteins and then generate inhibitors for the proteins by molecular mechanics / dynamics methods.
The problem is there is often not enough knowledge of what the proteins coded for actually do. So far the computer programs can generate more lead molecules than can be sensibly tested by the traditional cell assay methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I never understood:
Low-pass filter for improved quality of low-frequency (bass) tones

A low-pass filter lets everything UNDER a sepecific frequency through. A low-pass filter at 20Khz would let everything under 20Khz PASS through, that's why it's called a low-PASS. How a low-pass filter would improve bass is beyond me, as it would only let bass through!

I think what is really meant is that the SNES has a hi-pass filter to improve the quality of low-frequency sounds. But it's written the above way everywhere.

Also, address decoders are NOT required for ROMs over 32Mbits (they're just used because ROMS over 32Mbits were prohibitly expensive).

It doesn't have low pass or high pass, it has an 8-tap FIR filter that is applied to the ECHO output. It can improve bass tones because it can do a low-pass effect on certain channels and thus cut out most high frequencies generated from resampling/errors in the sample data.

*Response:
As you stated, a low pass filter allows the lows to pass, hence the name.  Applying a low pass filter to lower quality samples helps to allow more accurate reproduction, leaving
out high frequency noise in something such as a bass guitar-effectively helping to reduce the bandwidth used by the sample.  For example if the prevalent frequencies are under
5Khz and we apply a low-pass with cut-off at 4.8Khz, we are rolling off the high end of the spectrum of the sample, effectively reducing its bandwidth.  For more information on filters and cuts, there are many examples on YouTube.

If you were to use a high-pass (only allowing high frequencies through) on a sample that was strong in the low end, you would effectively reduce the sound below the 
cutoff threshold, and end up with only high frequency noise.  Remember that this is not to be confused with sampling rate, but actual frequency spectrum.

For example, a 30KHz Sampling rate has a range from 0-15KHz of recorded audio frequency range.

HOWEVER, this filtering is done digitally even though the methods I described were simplified, and you can find more information on this, (including FIR) in the Signal Processing 
Section @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing .

I may have gotten some of this wrong, but just trying to help out :)  If this information needs correcting, please feel free to!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic|
name= Witch Weekly|
type= Newspaper|
features= &quot;Women's Weekly&quot; of the Wizarding world|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]|}}

== Overview ==

'''''Witch Weekly''''' is a weekly newspaper / magazine similar to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] publication '''Women's Weekly'''. It seems to be aimed at middle-aged Wizarding housewives, and is generally full of stories about celebrities (including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] on occasion) and handy household tips.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] writes a story that implies that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is leading both Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] on romantically, shortly after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], she is able to get it published in ''Witch Weekly''. As a direct result of this, Hermione gets great quantities of hate mail, one of which is filled with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bubotuber|Bubotuber]] pus. Because of this, she has to miss several classes.

It turns out that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] also reads ''Witch Weekly'', and because of that story, she rather goes off Hermione; Hermione is dismayed at Easter that year, when the Easter egg that Mrs. Weasley sends Harry is about the size of an ostrich egg, and Hermione's is the size of a chicken's egg. This misunderstanding is not cleared up until the Weasleys come to cheer Harry on in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]], and Harry tells Mrs. Weasley that Hermione was never his girlfriend.

Witch Weekly also gives out a periodic (probably annual) &quot;Most Charming Smile Award,&quot; which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]] is inordinately proud of having won five times.

== Analysis ==

One thing that has been commented on elsewhere is the realism, the fullness of the vision of the Wizarding world. It is easy to believe, at least while the books are open in front of us, that the Wizarding world that Rowling describes could exist. A large part of that seems to be how completely the author has portrayed, not just the magical aspects of that world, but how the wold's inhabitants get along from day to day. ''Witch Weekly'' is a tiny, but intriguing part of that. If this sort of publication can exist in the Muggle world, its absence from the Wizarding world would be a small irritant: what would Molly read in the market line-up? Additionally, gossipy pieces, like the discussion of Hermione, Harry, and Viktor, are clearly not news, and so would have to go into some sort of magazine. Failing to include ''Witch Weekly'', or something very like it, would prevent that plot point appearing.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 25|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Rita Skeeter tells Hermione quite plainly that the object of a newspaper is to make money. Given that, we cannot be surprised that a market of the type served by ''Witch Weekly'' would be overlooked. Just as in the Muggle world, if there are Galleons to be made by selling writings slanted towards one audience, something will come along to make those Galleons. It is to the author's credit that the result is so very believable.

== Overview ==

'''''Rita Skeeter''''' is a free-lance journalist specializing in writing poison-pen stories based on false information and misreported interviews. Her recording tool is a green &quot;Quick-Quotes Quill&quot; that she apparently likes the taste of. Her stories have appeared in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The_Daily_Prophet|''The Daily Prophet'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly'']], and, when blackmailed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|''The Quibbler'']] – this last publication does not pay for stories.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Rita Skeeter is first mentioned after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], where the Muggles in charge of the campsite are attacked by Death Eaters. Rita's story, appearing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''The Daily Prophet'']], over-sensationalizes events, and includes some inventions such as supposed dead people being removed from the forest after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] appeared. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]], reading this, comments that Rita's stories always contain fabrications and should not be believed.

A week later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] mentions that Rita has heard about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]]' disappearance, and she soon writes a story about it. While we are told the story has been published, we hear nothing else about it.

When the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] selects [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] as a Triwizard Champion, Skeeter interviews him at the Wand Weighing ceremony. However, her 'Quick-Quotes Quill' fabricates many of his supposed comments, such as, &quot;Sometimes at night I still cry about them. I'm not ashamed to admit it.&quot; Harry is both troubled and embarrassed by these erroneous statements.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] suggests going to the next [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade weekend]]. When pressed, she admits she is hoping to meet up with Ron in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|the Three Broomsticks]]. Harry vetoes that particular idea, and will only go under his Invisibility Cloak. Hermione protests but agrees, and once in Hogsmeade, Harry is delighted he can travel without people hurling snide remarks. Hermione thinks he can remove the cloak without being bothered, but Harry points out that Rita Skeeter and her photographer just left the Three Broomsticks. It appears she is staying in the village. Harry suggests she is there to watch the first task.

Following the First Task, as Harry returns to the Castle with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], she appears from behind a bush in the Forbidden Forest, asking Harry for a word. Harry provides her with one: &quot;Goodbye.&quot; At some point after the first task, Albus Dumbledore had banned Rita from entering Hogwarts Castle.

Skeeter later interviews [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], supposedly for an article about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skrewt|Blast-Ended Skrewts]]. While she is setting up the interview, Ron wonders how she got there – hadn't she been banned from Hogwarts? She actually wants to pump Hagrid for information about Harry for another scurrilous story, although Hagrid refuses to say anything negative about him. When she later discovers Hagrid's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giant]] ancestry, she writes an awful article claiming he is dangerous to students and brutal in his classes.

When Harry is watching the courtroom scenes in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], he spots a younger Rita Skeeter in the audience, with the same Quick-Quotes Quill, reporting the trial.

During the Hogsmeade visit just before the second Triwizard task, the trio encounters Skeeter, who approaches Harry for another interview, but Hermione chases her off, telling her she ruins peoples' lives. This leads Harry to suspect Hermione will be Rita's next victim. Readers may recall that Rita had hinted about a romance between Harry and Hermione, using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey]] as a source. Shortly after this most recent encounter, a vengeful Rita, now writing for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly'']], claims in a new story that Hermione, whom she calls &quot;plain,&quot; may be using illegal love potions on both Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]]. As a result of this story appearing, ''Witch Weekly'' readers send anonymous and threatening letters to Hermione. One of the readers taken in by this story is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]; this temporarily sours the relationship between Mrs. Weasley and Hermione.

After the final Triwizard challenge, Hermione traps a beetle while visiting Harry in the school infirmary: it is Rita Skeeter, who is an unregistered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]]. That is how she eavesdrops on private conversations and reports them in her articles. Hermione suspected she was an Animagus after observing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] conversing with a small object, shortly before the article about Hagrid appeared. She also recalled that whenever any secrets were discussed in private conversations, and then appeared in Rita's stories, there had always been a large beetle in the vicinity. Hermione tells Skeeter she will not report her as an unregistered Animagus if she abstains from writing any stories for the next year.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Rita is seen again when Hermione meets with her in Hogsmeade village. When Hermione had forced Skeeter to stop writing stories for one year by threatening to expose her as an unregistered Animagus, Rita fell upon hard times. This is evidenced by her once fashionable clothing that has became frayed and worn.

After Harry's assertion that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has returned (in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''), the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] waged a smear campaign against him and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] in ''The Daily Prophet,'' disputing his claims. To garner support for Harry, Hermione blackmailed Skeeter into writing a favorable story about Harry that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]'s father published in his paper, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|''The Quibbler.'']] Rita's story convinced many readers that Harry was telling the truth and Voldemort had returned.

After the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Department of Mysteries]], several Ministry employees, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], personally see that Voldemort has returned. Shortly after, the ''Daily Prophet'' reverses its editorial stance, and Harry once again becomes a hero. The Prophet buys the rights to the Quibbler interview and runs it as an &quot;exclusive&quot;.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Although Rita is presumably writing for ''The Daily Prophet'', she plays no role in the story.

Rita is seen at the end of the book, attending Albus Dumbledore's funeral, with her notebook in hand.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

''The Daily Prophet'' sends a reporter to interview Rita as a result of her having written a book. This book, a scurrilous and unauthorized biography of Dumbledore, is a typical Skeeter hatchet-job, putting the worst possible interpretation on everything that was known of Dumbledore's early life. This book, which alleged that Dumbledore's sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]] who had been locked away from society for all her young life, that Dumbledore had been friends with the evil wizard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]] as a youth and had been discussing his plan to take over the entire world, and that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] had broken Albus' nose at Ariana's funeral, among other things, leaves Harry wondering about his hero. The book plays a major part in this part of the story, appearing first as the interview mentioned above, then twice in excerpts of the book published in the ''Daily Prophet'', and finally Hermione retrieves an actual copy of the book from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot's]] parlour. Harry's worries about Dumbledore, inspired by this book, are only put to rest when Aberforth later tells Harry what actually happened.

== Strengths ==

Little is known about Skeeter's magical talents, though she learned to become an (unregistered) Animagus, which apparently takes considerable wizarding ability. She appears to be an intelligent and resourceful journalist, who uses whatever means she can to uncover information for her stories. As an unregistered Animagus, she uses her beetle form to eavesdrop on unsuspecting witches and wizards who are then victimized by her scurrilous pieces.

Skeeter intuitively knows her readership and works hard and fast to meet their expectations.  Her biography of Dumbledore is researched and written in just a few weeks after his death.  Skeeter is able to gain her sources' confidence, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]] and others, which allows her to document unpleasant aspects of Dumbledore's youth, many based on fact.

== Weaknesses ==

Vain and self-serving, Skeeter is a ruthless and unethical journalist who uses any means to gather information, accurate or false, for her sensationalistic stories. It is quite possible that she employed some magical method on the elderly and senile Bathilda Bagshot to obtain her memories about the Dumbledore clan, information that Bathilda most likely would never have divulged otherwise. Skeeter cares little for how her subjects are affected by her malicious lies, and uses an enchanted &quot;Quick-Quotes Quill&quot; to fabricate &quot;quotes&quot; for her articles. Surprisingly, few, other than her victims, ever seem to doubt Skeeter's words once they are published.

Hermione is eventually able to manipulate Skeeter's shady practices against her, threatening to expose Skeeter as an illegal Animagus to the Ministry of Magic unless she agrees to write a truthful story about Harry Potter and Voldemort. Skeeter's article helps gain the public's sympathy for Harry and Dumbledore's cause.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

While little is shown of Rita's relationships with other people, we do see that she appears to have a good working relationship with her photographer. This is possibly because she never intends to write anything about him. Anyone else needs to guard what they say around her for fear of having their life histories published, slanted for maximum readership (thus maximum scurrilousness). Likely because of this, Rita has co-workers, but few friends.

Among those she interviews, Rita is regarded with emotions ranging from anger at her misinterpreting what has been said (Elphias Doge, Hermione), through fear that similar misinterpretations are forthcoming (Rubeus Hagrid, Harry Potter), to, at its mildest, cheerfully dismissing anything she has to say or write (Albus Dumbledore).

Rita's favourite subjects for her stories appears to be Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore, whose fame in the Wizarding realm makes them especially profitable to write about, particularly when she can distort or smear their sterling reputations. While Harry is continually enraged by her ridiculous falsehoods, Dumbledore generally finds what she writes about him as amusing.

== Analysis ==

At the end of ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''The Daily Prophet'' buys the publishing rights to Skeeter's interview with Harry that appeared in ''The Quibbler''. It is interesting that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|galleons]] paid for that story go to the Lovegoods. Quite possibly, Rita received nothing, and this may have increased her hatred of Harry and Hermione, though any story that appears critical of them will be spiked in the editorial environment of the day. It is entirely possible that this is why Rita turned her eye on Dumbledore at the start of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''; if nothing else, Rita is a realist and would know that with Potter still &quot;the Chosen One&quot;, she would not be able to get anything published against him. As the tide turned, and Harry became &quot;Undesirable Number One&quot; with a price on his head, it is likely that a large part of the venom hitting the press about him was hers.

Rita is hardly selective with her venom. It appears that previous to her biography about Dumbledore, she had written a similar book about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Armando Dippet|Armando Dippet]], the headmaster at Hogwarts before Dumbledore. That book, ''Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?'', is mentioned only in passing, on the cover of the book Rita wrote about Dumbledore.
 
The reader may wonder why Rita is kept in the story, rather than being abandoned like many other single-note characters, when Hermione &quot;pulls her teeth&quot; at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''. In the subsequent book, however, we learn that despite Rita's unavailability, the ''Daily Prophet'' still appears to have a fair amount of venom available, and continues to use it in a somewhat successful attempt to discredit Harry and Dumbledore. The fact that Rita seems unable to earn a living without muckraking is highlighted in that book as well, so it is little surprise that in the final book of the series, she returns to her original style. Additionally, it is necessary to have a skilled and sympathetic journalist available to tell Harry's side of the story of Voldemort's return. Having met Rita, we are certain of her skill, and Hermione's blackmail forces the sympathy. It is a safe assumption that the author believed that Rita would be useful, despite her hatefulness.

In fact, Rita's venom is a major influence on the plot line of the final book. In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', Harry's faith in Dumbledore is shaken by revelations in the book Rita writes, and the apparent inability of anyone to refute Rita's scurrilous claims. As discussed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Life and Lies|the article on that book]], the revelations of Dumbledore's life, and Harry's being forced to deal with them, are an important part of Harry's maturation and becoming an independent individual, rather than just a cog in Dumbledore's machine.

Feuerzangenbowle is a traditional German alcoholic drink, often part of a Christmas or New Year's tradition. The name translates literally as &quot;fire-tongs punch&quot;.

Pay attention to the preparation and don't let drunks light the rum - it can cause nasty burns and you don't want that.

The flambéed and caramelised &quot;Zuckerhut&quot; adds the unique flavour to the &quot;Feuerzangenbowle&quot;.
[[Image:Feuerzangenbowle01.jpg|right|thumb|Ingredients and Utensils]]
=== Ingredients ===
[[Image:Feuerzangenbowle02.jpg|right|thumb|More raw ingredients]]
* 2-3 bottles of dry red wine (e.g. Rioja)
* 0,4l of rum (at least 54% alcohol, 80% would be better) 
* 2 oranges
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 5 cloves
* 1 &quot;Zuckerhut&quot; (literally translated: &quot;sugar hat&quot;)

* ''(optional) a pinch of gingerbread spices''
* ''(optional) 2 lemons''

=== Tips ===
* The rum has to have 50% alcohol minimum, otherwise the flambeing won't work.  
* If the rum has a higher percentage of alcohol (&gt;60%) the flame will be very big. '''Proceed with caution and add the rum slowly.'''
* If you can't obtain a &quot;Zuckerhut&quot;, substitute sugar cubes.
* If you can't obtain a &quot;Feuerzange&quot;, replace it by a grate.
* Instead of the &quot;Feuerzangenbowle&quot; bowl and heater you can also use a big pot on a normal cooking plate.

=== Procedure ===
[[Image:Feuerzangenbowle.jpg|right|thumb|Preparation]]
* Put the wine into the bowl and heat it to about 70 degrees Celsius.
* Wash the fruit with hot water.
* Peel the oranges ''(and lemons)'' in thin stripes.
* Now put the zests, spices and juice in the bowl.
* Place the &quot;Feuerzange&quot; on the bowl and place the &quot;Zuckerhut&quot; on it.
* Put the rum into a soup ladle and pour it over the &quot;Zuckerhut&quot;. Then '''carefully''' lighten it.
* When the flame on the sugar has stopped burning, repeat the process with a fresh ladle of rum. '''Add the rum very slowly this time''' or you will burn your hand.
* When the sugar has completely dissolved, remove the &quot;Feuerzange&quot; and add another ladle of unburnt rum to the bowl.
* Remove all &quot;swimming&quot; parts (oranges, ''(lemons,)'' cloves and the cinnamon stick) from the drink.
* '''Enjoy!'''

== Overview ==

'''''Marcus Flint''''' is an older boy in Slytherin house, who is Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Marcus Flint, here a sixth-year, captains the Slytherin Quidditch team in their game against Gryffindor house.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Marcus Flint is the captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team. He first appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 7|&quot;Mudbloods and Murmurs&quot;]], when the Slytherins arrive to take over the Quidditch pitch from the Gryffindor team. We see him again when he, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] disguise themselves as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] in a failed attempt to put Harry off his game in the Quidditch match against Ravenclaw.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Somehow Marcus Flint is still at Hogwarts, because he is mentioned as being Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, and in the game against Gryffindor (in which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is flying his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Firebolt]]) it is mentioned that Flint has chosen players for size rather than skill.

[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=16 The author has said] that, given a choice between her making a mistake and Flint having had to repeat a grade, she thinks it rather more likely that Flint has had to repeat a grade.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

Marcus Flint never appears except in his role as Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team. In that role, he seems to be relatively unimaginative, and somewhat brutish — rather than using skill to win games, at least against Gryffindor, he seems to prefer to make as many fouls as possible, on and off the pitch, in the hopes that some of them at least will not be seen by the referee.

Outside the context of Quidditch, Flint does not seem to exist; he is never mentioned by other characters.

Like any extended series, the Potter books have a number of small internal consistency errors that purists pick up on and often complain about. With a very few exceptions, these errors do not affect the line or enjoyment of the story at all. The error that puts Marcus Flint at Hogwarts for an extra year was one of the earlier ones detected on the fan sites, and at least one fan site has chosen to call all such errors &quot;flints&quot; in commemoration of its discovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Note==

These lectures aren't specifically designed to go for a day, hour, or week.  If there's any subject within this you want to go into, I can.  I'm giving you a guideline here, and occasional exercises to make sure you understand; but I want you to understand that ultimately the learning process is guided by you.

Ask more questions, or where you want to go more in depth freely.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 03:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

==Reading==

If you feel up to it, you can read [[Calculus/Definite integral]]'s section on the definition of the integral, but we'll just steal their diagrams.

==Background==

The full most general definition of an integral isn't the Riemann-Darboux Definition.  The full, most general definition of an integral would allow us to perform an integral on sets not necesarrily numbers.  The full definition would also include us moving from basic set theory to group theory to ring theory to field theory and defining the nooks, crannies, lemmas, and theorems along the way.  Therefore, initially at least, there's going to be a bit of hand waving here, and occasionally we might need to backtrack to an important theorem.

Set theory wise, the key ideas needed are those of a supremum, its opposite (the infimum), and a partition.

==The Supremum==

The supremum is otherwise known as the least upper bound.  Conceptually, we take the upper bound of a set to be the number that no other number in the set can be higher than (but can be equal to).  In this way the upper bound of the set 1-5 can be 5, 5.1, 6, or a million.  The least upper bound (which, by the way, is unique, but for our purposes we will not prove) is the number that is not only an upper bound, but the smallest upper bound.  In this fashion we can state, at least heuristically, that of the set 1-5, its least upper bound is indeed 5.

If you're a visual learner (I apologize for my lack of artistic ability hereon):

[[Image:Infimumandsupremum.PNG]]

Now the formal definition of a least upper bound.

For a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, a number &lt;math&gt;b \in F&lt;/math&gt; is a l.u.b. of a set &lt;math&gt;E \sube F&lt;/math&gt; iff:

1)b is an upper bound of E, or:

if for all &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \leq b&lt;/math&gt;.

and

2)if c is any upper bound for E:

&lt;math&gt;b \leq c&lt;/math&gt;

The infimum is similarly defined.

So then for the set A = {x | 1 &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; x &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; 5}, prove that 5 is the supremum.

==The Partition==

A partition is a 'cut-up' portion of a field, but doesn't necesarily need to have all elements of that field inside of itself.  For example, in the set of real numbers I could have my {1,2,3,4,5} set, and this would be a partition of that set, similarly I could have {1,1.1,1.2,1.3,....,4.9,5}.

Put more formally:

A partition of [a,b] is a set of points P={x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} with &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; and a=x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=b.  Furthermore if P and Q are partitions of a field F and &lt;math&gt;P \sube Q&lt;/math&gt; then Q is a refinement of P.

Likewise in our two example partitions, {1,1.1,1.2,1.3,....,4.9,5} is a refinement of {1,2,3,4,5}.

==The Supremum/infimum of a function==

When building the definition, we need some strict notions of a subinterval (a subset of a partition), and what it does to a function.  Now by the completeness axiom (actually, not an axiom, but we will take it as such, it states that every subset of the real number system has a least upper bound).

===A Small Exercise===

Now, prove that if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} \supe F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F \supe E&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;sup E \leq sup F&lt;/math&gt;.

By a similar proof  &lt;math&gt;inf E \geq inf F&lt;/math&gt;, and with these two lemmas we can take a subinterval [x&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;] of partition P of [a,b], and if a function f: [a,b] &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, then f is bounded on the subinterval, which allows us to define for each i=1,...,n:

M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = sup f over [x&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]

and

m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = inf f over [x&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]

==The Riemann Darboux Sums==

We're getting one step closer here, and we can finally define the Riemann-Darboux Upper and Lower Sums.  This is essentially the integral only it's missing a key property which will be disclosed in the next lecture.

As an example of the concept of what we're doing here, at least for the upper sum, before showing the jumble of symbols, is we take a partition's subinterval, and find the highest value of the function on that interval, multiply it by the subinterval's length, get the rectangle, and sum like crazy.  The lower sum is similar only taking the lowest value of the function.

The idea of this is similar to figure 5 in the textbook:

[[Image:Riemann Integration 5.png]]

But let's reformat the image a bit:

[[Image:UpperandLower.PNG]]

Now, the GENERAL definition of an integral, in case your curiosity peaks your interest, picks a RANDOM value of the function on the subinterval, which is what is shown in figure 5.

Either way, here it is in its glory:

U(P,f) = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n M_i (x_i - x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;

L(P,f) = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (x_i - x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;

For now I'll leave you a small exercise with the upper and lower sums, but this won't be the end of this lecture.

===Summing Exercise===

Let f: [0,1] &lt;math&gt; \rightarrow \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; be f(x) = x, and let &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; to form a uniform partition P = {i/n | 0,...,n} for i from 1 to n.  Find U(P,f) and L(P,f) explicitly.

===Solution===
1.(n+m)/2n.

==More Details about the Partition:  The point refinment==

There is a very intimate connection that is made between the partition, it's refinement, and the upper and lower sums that will bring about the integral.

For now, let's examine some properties of the refinement of a partition and its upper and lower sums.  Intuitively, it makes sense that the lower sum should be lower than the upper sum.  Also, if we make the intervals smaller by creating a more refined partition, intuitively we should have a smaller upper sum than before (because we aren't overestimating the upper sums), and a higher lower sum than before.

So, say we have a partition P of [a,b] and a refined partition P with ONE extra point P'=P &amp;cup; {z}, and if &lt;math&gt;f:  [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is any bounded function, then by our intuition we stated that &lt;math&gt;L(P,f) \leq L(P',f) \leq U(P',f) \leq U(P,f)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Exercise===

The actual proof I'm going to leave up to you.  The following might be helpful (but if you want to be entirely creative, that's fine too):

-Working with the subinterval containing the point z separately, comparing the sums around that point, and citing the rest by similarity.

-Noting that the proof that &lt;math&gt;L(P,f) \leq L(P',f)&lt;/math&gt; is similar to the proof of &lt;math&gt;U(P,f) \leq U(P',f)&lt;/math&gt;.

-You may have to cite what you've proven before in The Supremum/infimum of a function_A Small Exercise

The main idea about partitions is just that they're an ordered set of a collection of intervals.

==More about partition refinements:  using point refinement==

We're now going to generalize what was just proven, what was proven above could be said to be a 'weak statement' while this is a 'strong statement'.  In fact, it is not just point-refinement that share this quality, but ANY refinement of a partition follows this!

So, if &lt;math&gt;f:  [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded function and P and Q are partitions of [a,b] where Q is a refinement of P then:

&lt;math&gt;L(P,f) \leq L(Q,f) \leq U(Q,f) \leq U(P,f)&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof.''  For &lt;math&gt;r \in \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; let J(r) (in English for simplicity) be &quot;if the Q - P has r elements,  then our statement above is satisfied.&quot;  We will prove that J(r) is true for all &lt;math&gt;r \in \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; by induction.

J(1), the base case, is the point-refinement proof exercise.

For the induction step assume J(r) for &lt;math&gt;r \in \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;. We prove J(r + 1).
Assume Q - P has r + 1 element.  Let Q' be the partition such that Q' - P has r elements.  By the induction assumption:

&lt;math&gt;L(P,f) \leq L(Q',f) \leq U(Q',f) \leq U(P,f)&lt;/math&gt;

And since Q is a one-point refinement of Q', by the exercise proof again:

&lt;math&gt;L(Q',f) \leq L(Q,f) \leq U(Q,f) \leq U(Q',f)&lt;/math&gt;

And with these two inequalities we show:

&lt;math&gt;L(P,f) \leq L(Q,f) \leq U(Q,f) \leq U(P,f)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is what we were trying to prove.  Q. E. D..

==Another property of the supremum==

At least in my local area, we call this &quot;the approxiamation property of the supremum.&quot;  However, local lingo might be different elsewhere, and most of the time it isn't brought up, however, it's important for the integrability criterion later on.

If we have a subset of the real number system &lt;math&gt;E \sub \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; and b = sup E, then we have the following theorem:

b = sup E iff for all &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0 there exists &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt; such that x &gt; b - &amp;epsilon;.

It has properties similar to a limit definition.

I'll go ahead and prove the converse of the biconditional:

if for all &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0 there exists &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt; such that x &gt; b - &amp;epsilon; then b=sup E.

We'll prove this by contradiction, so assume &lt;math&gt;b \neq sup&lt;/math&gt;, and let c be an arbitrary upper bound of E and assume c &lt; b and let &amp;epsilon; = b - c then by some algebra x &gt; c.  However, this can't be, since c is an upper bound of E, therefore &lt;math&gt;c \geq b&lt;/math&gt; by trichotomy, which by the definition of the supremum shows that b = sup E.  Contradiction, reductio ad absurdum.

===Approximation Property Proof exercise===

You do the forward.  It might help to do a proof by contrapositive, and just use the definition of the supremum.

==A final quantity==

With all this talk about partitions and refinement we can show a last little definition:

&lt;math&gt;L(f) = sup_P L(P,f)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;U(f) = inf_P U(P,f)&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively we can think of this as (for the first) the partition that gives the highest lower sum value, and (for the second) the partition that gives the lowest upper sum value.  What these actually are we'll leave as a mystery for now.

===Return of the summing exercise===

for our function f(x) = x and uniform partitions &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; of [0,1], find U(f) and L(f) explicitly.  Do you notice anything?

==Extra==

I've messed up the nomering a bit since the proof I'm about to show that fills in the spots in the proof on the Discussion has as its parts the Archimedean property.  Either way, here we go:

Let &lt;math&gt;a, b, x \in \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; with a &lt; b and x &gt; 0, then we will prove that there exists a rational multiple of x (call it the element b suggessted in the Discussion's proof) in the interval (a,b).

There's quite a bit to build up here, just so we don't have to go back too far, I hope you can take the following by intuition:  that the set of natural numbers (1,2,3,...) is not bounded above in the set of real numbers, therefore for any element x of the set of real numbers, there is an element n of the natural numbers such that n &gt; x.  As an exercise, you could prove this using the completeness axiom (if you try it, and want me to check it, go ahead and title it sub-archimedean proof).  If you want to try, I suggest a reductio absurdum using the definition of an upper bound.

'''The Archimedean Property'''

For every real x&gt;0 there exists a &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that 1/n &lt; x.

By the theorem I just had you take by intuition (or you proved) for all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that:

n &gt; 1/x (since 1/x is also a real number)

And by minimal algebra:

x &gt; 1/n

Quod Erat Demonstratum.

'''Back to the Actual Proof'''

Let &lt;math&gt;q \in \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; be sufficiently large so that by the Archimedean property the following holds:

1/q &lt; (b-a)/x

Then because the set of natural numbers is not bounded above the following set S is not empty:

&lt;math&gt;S = {n \in \mathbf{Z} | n \cdot \frac{X}{Q} \geq b}&lt;/math&gt;

And by the definition of a lower bound, bq/x is such a lower bound for S.  Then by the well-ordering principle (That a set that has a lower bound has a lowest element)  there is a smallest integer in S, call it l and let p = l - 1.  Then by how we set S, and because l is the lowest element of this set,  it follows that &lt;math&gt;p !\in S&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;p \cdot \frac{x}{q} &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;.  Furthermore, by our original inequality for q:

x/q + a &lt; b

&lt;math&gt;b \leq l \cdot \frac{x}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

And by transitivity:

&lt;math&gt;x/q + a &lt; l \cdot \frac{x}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a &lt; l \cdot \frac{x}{q} - \frac{x}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a &lt; (l-1) \cdot \frac{x}{q} = p \cdot \frac{x}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore a &lt; (p/q) x &lt; b, and since (p/q) x is a rational multiple of x, we ahve proved that a rational multiple of x lies in the interval (a,b), which is what we were trying to prove.

'''Comment'''

This fills in the spot sup E &gt; sup F implies an element b such that.....

== Overview ==

An '''''Animagus''''' is a witch or wizard with the rare ability to transform into a particular animal at will. The Animagus spell is very difficult and dangerous to perform, which is one reason that all Animagi are required to be registered by the Ministry of Magic. Another reason is so the Ministry can ensure that an Animagus does not use his or her power for any illegal purpose while in their animal forms.

== Extended Description == 

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While the term is only presented and defined in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], the ability of some witches or wizards to change into the shape of animals is seen in the very first chapter of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]. Here, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] addresses a tabby cat as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], and finds a woman sitting there when he looks again.
 
Animagi are extremely rare. It is revealed that Professor McGonagall is one of the only seven registered Animagi of the century. 

However, we know of four ''unregistered'' Animagi: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail)]], who can transform into a rat, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who can turn into a large, black dog, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]], who transformed into a stag, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], who becomes a beetle.

The Animagus transformation is one of a very few forms of magic that can be performed in a controlled manner without a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|Wand]]. Sirius and Wormtail have displayed the ability to transform into their Animagus shapes without wands.

There is no mention of anything that can prevent an Animagus from transforming, wandless or otherwise; however, there is apparently a spell, as shown by Sirius Black and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], which can be used to force a transformed Animagus, in this case Peter Pettigrew, back into his human shape. This spell is never named, so cannot be cataloged in this volume. We note that the spell was cast by Lupin and Black simultaneously; this may have been necessary to increase the strength of the spell. One wizard casting the spell might not be enough to force the conversion, unless the targeted wizard was magically significantly weaker than the casting wizard.

== Analysis ==

James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew all became Animagi after discovering that their friend [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]]. Because a werewolf is only a danger to humans, they decided that they could keep him company during his transformations by turning into animals. They used their power to wander around the Hogwarts grounds at night, while Lupin was in his wolf form. 

Rita Skeeter, who is a reporter, became an Animagus perhaps so that she would be able to spy on people to get good stories for the papers she writes for, notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly'']]. Note that the witch or wizard performing the spell does not have control over the specific type of animal he will become; the form that the wizard's animal form takes will depend on his personality at the time he performs the spell. The fact that Rita became a beetle, so very close to the proverbial &quot;fly on the wall&quot;, could only be providential – she could not have selected for it.

One must assume that the main purpose for a wizard to choose to become an Animagus is as a way of transforming into an innocuous beast, so as to avoid recognition while acting illegally. It is for this reason that the Ministry requires that all Animagi be registered, so that any Transformed wizard who chooses to act illegally may be identified.

As mentioned in ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'' (in Dumbledore's notes on &quot;Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump&quot;), the Animagus transformation is a form of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]]. There is a difference, though; a wizard who is Transfigured into an animal is fully an animal, with the animal's brain, comprehension, and abilities, which means that he must perforce remain an animal until some other wizard Transfigures him back into his original self. Following the Animagus transformation, the wizard retains his own intellect and abilities, and so can transform himself back to human.

It should perhaps be mentioned that Professor McGonagall has never done anything unlawful while in her Animagus state. Her sole reason for becoming Animagus was as part of her studies of Transfiguration.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# If a wizard performs the Animagus spell twice, can he or she then change into two different types of animal? Or would it change the type of animal he or she could transfigure into? Why?
# Could a wizard's Animagus form be the same as their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]]?
# Could a wizard's Animagus form change from emotional trauma, as a patronus can?
# To become an Animagus, would you be more likely to use a spell or a potion?
# Do you choose the animal you transform into?
# Could a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Metamorphmagus|metamorphmagus]] who became an Animagus change the way they looked when transformed?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It should, perhaps, be mentioned that in fact there is one wizard we see who displays both Animagus and Patronus forms. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 30|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Professor McGonagall sends off three Patronuses to summon the three other Heads of House. These Patronuses, it should be noted, take the same shape as her Animagus form — tabby cats. Thus, it is safe to assume that the Animagus shape and the Patronus shape would be the same, if the two spells were cast at the same time. However, the Animagus spell (as opposed to the transform) is apparently an enabling spell, that allows the transformation to be made at will. What little information we have leads us to believe that the Animagus form is fixed once the spell is cast, while the Patronus can change due to life changes; both the Patronus and the Animagus forms reflect the personality at the time the spell was cast, but the Patronus spell is cast repeatedly while the Animagus is generally performed only once.

== What is general an what is about numbers? ==

I like very much the style of this text, but one thing is not really clear: which definitions can in general be applied to any field and which can be applied only to real numbers?
There is another question: how many upper/lower bounds does a set have? Why we cannot just take the maximum/minimum?
-----
First of all, keep in mind that real numbers are an ordered field.  The supremum can work for any ordered field (thus it works for the real numbers).  And, whenever I say for a field F, it means that it can work for the real numbers.

Technically a set can have an infinite amout of upper and lower bounds.  A set that includes the numbers from 1 to 5 can have the upper bounds 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 9.872347823..., etc..  The only thing that makes the least upper bound special is that it's lower than any other upper bound.

The reason we can't take the maximum of a set is because of a very slight technicality.  Imagine we had a set that went from 1-5 but did not include 5, it approaches 5 ever so slightly, 5 is not the maximum number of the set (because it isn't included in it), but it is the least upper bound /of/ the set.

In case you were asking how many least upper/greatest lower bounds a set has, there is a proof (that I can show, or guide you along), that shows that the least upper/greatest lower bound is unique, i.e., for each specific set, there is one least upper and greatest lower bound.[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 17:37, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

==A Small Exercise==
&lt;b&gt;Exercise&lt;/b&gt; Now, prove that if &lt;math&gt;F \supe \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E \supe F&lt;/math&gt; then sup E &amp;leq; sup F.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Execution&lt;/b&gt; I will try to prove that &lt;math&gt;sup E &gt; sup F&lt;/math&gt; implies absurd.&lt;br&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;sup E &gt; sup F&lt;/math&gt; then there exist an element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; that is bigger than any other element in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. But this is impossible because any element of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is also an element of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Do you think it is a good proof?

====Feedback====

I really apologize for all the typos that were made in that script.  I usually make things in LaTeX, but I guess it didn't transfer over well, either way it looks like you got my meaning.

In Mathematics we tend to be very critical of absolute proofs, what's the reason for this?  What's the reason for that?  What definition is being used here?  What theorem is being used here?  But you don't have access to a large number of theorems or definitions yet, and the general idea is fine.

This is being really picky, and showing each step and why, in case you wanted to know, all I'm looking for is that you understand the gneral areas of the concept of supremum, and it looks like you do:

Let's see, every element x in E is less than sup E, and every element y in F is less than sup F:

sup E &gt;= x by def of supremum

sup F &gt;= y by def of supremum

sup E &gt; sup F by assumption

By another theorem (an Archimedean Theorem, which if you want I can dig up) implies that there is an element b such that sup E &gt;= b &gt; sup F.

&lt;b&gt;An Archimedean Theorem&lt;/b&gt; Yes it would be useful to see something about that.

b is not in F by the definition of supremum

b is an element in E and not F, which contradicts with our other assumption, reductio ad absurdum.

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (x_i - x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;=
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n (i+1/n)(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;=
&lt;math&gt;1/n^2 \sum_{i=1}^n i+1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I did something wrong. :-)&lt;br&gt;
What I haven't understood about that?

====Feedback====

The main part was evaluating M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, good!  That and this will be used extensively later on.

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (x_i - x_{i-1})= \sum_{i=1}^n (i-1/n)(1/n)= 1/n^2 \sum_{i=1}^n i-1&lt;/math&gt;

Because m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=inf f=i-1/n right?

Also, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i = (n/2)(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;  So you can simplify a little more, the two sums look really similar, and will get more similar to come!

==An exercise on partitions and refinements==
Could you please add an exercise on partitions and refinements? Because I think I should work more on this topic.&lt;br&gt;
--[[User:Vitalij zad|vitalij]] 07:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

====Feedback====

This is, ironically, the next part!  I'll add the next part including some more stuff on partitions and refinements (mostly refinements), and see if I can find more exercises.  (After this the definition of an integrable function can easily be slid in.)  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 06:11, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

====More Feedback====

If you want to know more about partitions we can go ahead and do that.  I mainly focused on refinements, which are essential; but I'm not sure if that's what you wanted to cover.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 01:19, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

It is exactly what I wanted. Thank you. --[[User:Vitalij zad|vitalij]] 08:34, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

==The point refinement exercise==
&lt;b&gt;Exercise&lt;/b&gt; We have a partition P of [a,b] and a refined partition P with ONE extra point P'=P &amp;cup; {z}, and if &lt;math&gt;f:  [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is any bounded function, then by our intuition we stated that &lt;math&gt;L(P,f) \leq L(P',f) \leq U(P',f) \leq U(P,f)&lt;/math&gt;. Prove it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Execution&lt;/b&gt; I define &lt;math&gt;A={a \in P | a&lt;z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B={b \in P | b&gt;z}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a'=min A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b'=min B&lt;/math&gt;. This way &lt;math&gt;[a',b']&lt;/math&gt; is the minimal interval that contains &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;a \neq z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \neq z&lt;/math&gt;, I know that both elements are in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. So it is an interval of the partition &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;, suppose it is the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-th interval. I define:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S=\sum _{i=0}^{k-1}M_i(x_i-x_{i-1})+\sum _{i=k+1}^{n}M_i(x_i-x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So I can say:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;U(P,f)=S+(sup_{[a',b']} f)(b'-a')=S+(sup_{[a',b']} f)[(z-a')+(b'-z)]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S+(sup_{[a',b']} f)[(z-a')+(b'-z)]= S+ (sup_{[a',b']} f) (z-a')+(sup_{[a',b']} f)(b'-z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;U(P',f)=S+(sup_{[a',b']} f)(b'-a')= S+ (sup_{[a',z]} f) (z-a')+(sup_{[z,b']} f)(b'-z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now, seeing that &lt;i&gt;[a',z]&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;[z,b']&lt;/i&gt; are subintervals of &lt;i&gt;[a',b']&lt;/i&gt;. Using the Small Exercise I can say: &lt;math&gt;sup_{[a',z]} f\leq sup_{[a',b']}f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;sup_{[z,b']} f\leq sup_{[a',b']}f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From this follows the statement I wanted to prove. For the lower sums the proof is similar.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Do you think I missed something? --[[User:Vitalij zad|vitalij]] 07:30, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

===Feedback===

Good!  However, I think a'=minA is a typo, was a'=maxA what you were going for?  Also, you can go straight from U(P',f) to &lt;math&gt;=S+ (sup_{[a',z]} f) (z-a')+(sup_{[z,b']} f)(b'-z)&lt;/math&gt; since that's technically how it works from the definition, either way, both ways work.  But yeah, good.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 04:36, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Using Water Resources &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Water has always been the most necessary resource for life on earth and therefore human development. Once fire was discovered and used to heat food it became possible to use water to boil some food times to make them more edible. It is believed that water was used for cooking as early as ----- by the poeple who lived in-----. Population density was always highest in river basins as they are very fertile lands. Ancient civilizations flourished near the great rivers such as the Nile and Indus. It is known that water was used to irrigate crops to improve yields as early as 5500BC in Mesopotamia now present day Iraq. These basic types of irrigation are still used in many parts of the world.  Early civilizations also used channelled water as a levelling device for construction. This principle is still used by most builders today; by using a transparent pipe filled with water to compare levels.

==The Water Cycle==

Water is the most important resource for the success of any community or project. All water resources are linked together in a huge global cycle. Understanding this cycle is very important for making decisions about what technologies and processes should be used to utilise the available water resources.

&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Water cycle.png|right|thumb|400px|This image is borrowed from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle Water cycle]], it would be best for a new diagram to be created for this project without text so that it can be used in translated versions. It should also be drawn in a style that is suitable for educational purposes. Use the following disclaimer template [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:PD-self PD-Self]]
]]

The water cycle has four main storage phases. These are: 

* In the ocean
* In the atmosphere 
* On land
* Under the ground

&lt;br&gt;

The majority of the water in the world is stored in the ocean. This water is heated up by the sun and evaporates into the air.  The water is then stored in vapour form in the clouds until it falls to the earth as rain, hail or snow. When the water falls to earth there are many different processes that can happen. It can be stored as snow and ice in cold areas of the world for great lengths of time; it can flow across the ground as runoff and enter into streams, rivers and lakes; it can be absorbed directly by plants; or it can filter its way under the ground. 

The water that infiltrates into earth becomes part of the groundwater system. This water is a very important resource for development because the process of infiltration, which can take a long time with the water flowing over great distances, causes the water to be purified and have important minerals added.

&lt;br&gt;

==Drinking Water==

&lt;br&gt;
Drinkable or potable water is a resource that is scarce in many parts of the world; it is also affected very easily by many types of pollution. Before drinking any water from an unknown source it is important to test its quality.

===Water quality testing===
&lt;br&gt;
A good indication of the quality of a water resource can be taken from the odour, the colour, and the quantity of particles. These three concepts give a general indication, before drinking it is best to filter it or get it tested in a laboratory if available. 

&lt;br&gt;
If water is not potable there are a range of filtering processing that can improve its quality.

===Water filtering===
&lt;br&gt;
In polluted or even unfiltered mountain water there are many parasitic organisms and inorganic chemicals that are dangerous to humans, because of this it is very important to filter water.

If no energy or technology is available the simplest way to filter water is using a cloth.
Water taken from any source is put into a container and left to settle, and then the water is passed through a cloth folded over itself about 8 times. The best type of cloth to use is cotton. This basic filter is effective against simple organisms and to some extent against cholera. However it is not very effective against giardia or cryptosporidium.

Carbon Filters are more advanced filters that require manufacturing; they are most effective for filtering chlorine and volatile organic compounds.

Advanced filtrations systems that are used all over the world to clean drinking water typically have the following components:

* A sediment filter to trap particles including rust and calcium carbonate.
* A second sediment filter with smaller pores is sometimes included.
* An activated carbon filter to trap organic chemicals and chlorination. 
* A reverse osmosis filter with a thin film composite membrane.
* A second carbon filter to capture those chemicals not removed by the RO membrane is sometimes used. 
* An ultra-violet lamp can be used for disinfection of the remaining microbes.

The filters range in size and capacity for large industrial installations to supply water for cities, to small portable devices that use gravity to filter water.

How to make:
* ClayPotFilter : make the lower part of the clay pot with a mix of sawdust and clay... during the baking process, the sawdust will transform into active coal and allow water to pass but retain the bacteria.  Only use a limited diameter range of sawdust, not to big-not to dusty.  Search for ClayPotFilter for more info
* CocaColaWaterDisinfector : works with clear, transparent water. Lay the bottle on its side, paint half of the bottle black... the sun will kill micro-organisms, viruses and cycsts in various ways:
**raise in temperature... it doesn't need to be boiling... boiling is a great visual feedback to know for sure you have reached far beyond survival temperature of micro-organisms, viruses and cysts.  It's actually about getting above a minimun kill-off temperature, and how long you stay at a certain temperature above that minimum temperature.  In a warm country, on a sunny day... 2 hours will do just  fine.
**a certain wavelenght in  the UV in the sunlight, will split oxygen molecules in its radicals, making oxigenated water... that way, you burn little holes in the organisms/organic material... it's a way of chemically burning.
**A certain wavelenght in the UV spectrum has the same lenght as the average bond distance of the molecules in the membrane... it can induce a self-resonance leading to rupture of the membrane, which kills the bacteria
**Idem to the previous but on the DNA level... the bacteria won't be able to survive.  Search for SODIS for more info.

===Extraction from Groundwater===


[[Image:groundwater flow.svg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram of ground water system.]]
Ground water is generally the best quality water available for drinking and irrigation, during the years of natural filtration through the earth the water absorbs minerals which are important for life support, during this process contaminants are generally removed.

The water table is found at different depths in different regions of the earth, this depth also varies over time due to water extraction and the regeneration process that depends on rainfall and natural water storage in lakes and rivers.
  
In areas where the water table is close to the surface small wells can be dug by hand or using machinery if available. 

One option that has been used for centuries is the hand power percussion drill. It was first used by the chinese around 3000 years ago. 

If drilling machines are available they can be used to extract water from greater depths.

==Pumps==

===Rope and washer pump===

===Manuel pumps===

===Treadle pump===

==Irrigation for agriculture==

===Channel sytems===

===Sprinkler systems===

===Drip systems===

==Water diversion==

In many areas around the world rivers and streams are partially or fully diverted for irrigation purposes. This has the advantage of supplying water using gravity. However it is very important to consider the effects of reducing the flow in the river or stream. The flora and fauna may not be able to survive in a dry season without the normal flow; these changes can affect the lives of the people and animals living downstream.

==Water storage==

===Damming===
===wadis for soaking in groundwater===

==Environmental concerns when dealing with Water==

Water absorbs almost everything that it comes into contact with. However, only over long times and through specific processes does water returned to a clean state. When dealing with water it is important to consider that the water you are using is just in one of the phases of its continual cycle. Therefore, by keeping it as clean as possible at every stage of the water cycle, you can be sure that when the water comes back around it will be fit for use.

eh, hi. I edited your first example in this section. You say:

''or written completely in numeral form''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
4 &amp; -3\\
-2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

=

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Which is wrong since it is not equal. It should be:

''or written completely in numeral form''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; -2\\
1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

=

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

And from this point, I edited the rest of the example. Good work though. Keep it up :) [[User:Dr_Darsh|Dr_Darsh]]

name=Thestral|
type=Magical Creature|
features=Invisible winged horse, can be seen only by people who have seen death|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Thestrals''''' are skeletal creatures about the size of a horse, with a reptilian hide, white eyes, and leathery black wings. They are considered a breed of winged horse.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Thestrals are invisible except to those who have seen death; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] can see them, but because his friends can't, he is initially afraid that they are a sign that he is going mad. It is Thestrals that pull the (apparently horseless) Hogwarts carriages to and from the train station at the beginning and end of the school year. They are carnivorous, and are attracted to the scent of blood. They are strong flyers and can carry you anywhere you want to go, and they have a good sense of direction. Because of the relationship with death, it is widely believed that seeing a Thestral is a bad omen.

It is not until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] teaches a class on Thestrals that Harry is reassured that these are real creatures and he is not losing his mind. Only three students in Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] class can see the thestrals: Harry himself, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], and a &quot;tall, stringy Slytherin&quot; who the author has identified as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Theodore Nott|Theodore Nott]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] (who saw her mother die) can see them as well; but she is in Ravenclaw, and a different year, so she attends a different class. Hagrid is proud of having the largest domesticated herd of Thestrals in the UK.

The ability of Thestrals to fly, and their navigation ability, will prove invaluable to Harry when he, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], Neville, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and Luna need to get to the Ministry of Magic. We will see them again briefly in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

== Analysis ==

One of the things we are beginning to perceive, by the time that Thestrals are introduced, is that Wizards in general are every bit as afraid of death as Muggles are. This is somewhat perplexing, as Wizardkind can create and perceive [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|Ghosts]], where Muggles cannot, and one would think that ghosts prove the existence of life after death. (For purposes of these discussions, we will ignore the matter of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|Shades]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Horcrux|Horcruxes]], as those are extremely rare in the Magical world, so the average Wizard will not have seen them.) In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], we are told that there is an entire book written about Death Omens, and from Ron we learn how seriously the Wizarding world takes them. The association with death that is caused by the Thestrals' selective visibility makes them undeservedly one such omen.

The author has commented that her mothers' death, midway through writing the series, may have caused something of an additional preoccupation with that transition in the books. However, the main story line, involving Horcruxes as a means of cheating death, and the Deathly Hallows, perforce will involve itself with death.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Neville's parents have not died, they are alive still, if insane. Who did Neville see die?
# Hagrid must also be able to see them, but he didn't see his father die: Hagrid told Harry that his father had died during Hagrid's first year. Who would he have seen die?
# How come the Thestrals drawing the carriages at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] were still invisible to Harry? Does it take some time for the fact that you've seen a death to set in before you can see them? For that matter, why does he not see them from the very first story, as presumably he had seen his mother die?
# Are Thestrals dark creatures?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The question has come up that Harry should have been able to see the Thestrals when he rode the horseless carriages down to the train at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]; after all, he had just seen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] killed. There are actually two answers to why he could not, one in the context of the books, one in the context of the author's plans.

In the context of the books, then, while Harry has seen Cedric Diggory die, at that point he is still in shock and has not yet completely internalized it; Cedric's death is not entirely real to him, and it is only after he has been brooding over it all summer that he accepts that Cedric is dead. Only then, when he fully believes that he has seen death, is he able to see the Thestrals. Did he not see death earlier, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] killed his parents? No, in fact he did not; he was not fully aware of it, being only a baby, and it happened beyond the sides of his cot so he could not see it. While it could be argued that Voldemort would have to see him in order to kill him, and the spell rebound killing Voldemort would have been visible to Harry at the time, Voldemort is not really dead, is he? Did he not see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] die at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]? No, he didn't; he had lost consciousness by the time Quirrell actually died.

The author has stated that she also had the idea that having the Thestrals visible to Harry just before the end of the book would have left another puzzle for the readers, a very uncomfortable one in fact: what are these creatures, are they Dark? So she made the conscious decision to leave them invisible to Harry until the next book.

The above is a paraphrase of [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=21 the author's own comments on the matter].

[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=25 The author has also stated] that the magical core of the Elder Wand is a tail hair from a Thestral, &quot;a powerful and tricky substance that can be mastered only by a witch or wizard capable of facing death.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Assignment==
The &quot;=&quot; operator is used for assignment. The operator also serves as a comparison operator (see Comparison).

* To set values:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  x = 7     ' x is now seven; in math terms we could say &quot;let x = 7&quot;
  x = -1294
  x = &quot;example&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can use variables in the equal operator, as well.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Integer
  x = 4  ' Anywhere we use x, 4 will be used.
&lt;/source&gt;

==Comparison==
The &quot;=&quot; operator is used for comparison. The operator also serves as a assignation operator (see Assignment).

* To compare values:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  If 4 = 9 Then       ' This code will never happen:
    End  ' Exit the program.
  End If
  If 1234 = 1234 Then ' This code will always be run after the check:
    MessageBox.Show(&quot;Wow!  1234 is the same as 1234.&quot;) 
      ' Create a box in the center of the screen.
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

You can use variables in the equal operator, as well.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  If x = 4 Then
    MessageBox.Show(&quot;x is four.&quot;)
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's try a slightly more advanced operation.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  MessageBox.Show(&quot;Seven equals two is &quot; &amp; (7 = 2) &amp; &quot;.&quot;)
  ' The parentheses are used because otherwise, by order of operations
  ' (equals is processed last), it would be comparing &quot;Seven equals two is 7&quot; and &quot;2.&quot;.
  ' Note here that the &amp; operator appends to the string.  We will talk about this later.
  '
  '  The result of this should be a message box popping up saying &quot;Seven equals two is
  '   False.&quot;   This is because (7 = 2) will return False anywhere you put it.  In the
  '   same sense, (7 = 7) will return True:
  MessageBox.Show(&quot;Seven equals seven is &quot; &amp; (7 = 7) &amp; &quot;.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

You will get an error if you try to assign a constant or a literal a value, such as 7 = 2.  You can compare 7 and 2, but the answer will always be &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;False&lt;/font&gt;.

In the case of two equal operators appearing in a statement, such as
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Boolean
  x = 2 = 7
&lt;/source&gt;

The second equal operator will be processed first, comparing 2 and 7, giving a &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;False&lt;/font&gt;. Then the first equal operator will be processed, assigning &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;False&lt;/font&gt; to x.

===More Comparison Operators===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 (x &lt; y)  (x &gt; y)  (x &lt;&gt; y)  (x &lt;= y)  (x &gt;= y)
&lt;/source&gt;
(x less than y), (x more than y), (x not equal to y), (x less than or equal y) &amp; (x greater than or equal to y)

Note the way round the operators are on the last two, putting them the other way round is not valid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Arithmetic operators==

Visual Basic .NET provides a basic set of operators to calculate simple arithmetic.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
+   Addition
-   Subtraction
*   Multiplication
/   Division
\   Integer division
Mod Remainder Division
^   Exponentiation
&amp;   String concatenation

7 + 2     produces 9
7 - 2     produces 5
7 * 2     produces 14
7 / 2     produces 3.5
7 \ 2     produces 3
7 Mod 2   produces 1
7 ^ 2     produces 49
&quot;7&quot; &amp; &quot;7&quot; produces &quot;77&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's look at a short example of arithmetic operations before we jump into the operators themselves.

In this example we will also be using some basic variables.  The &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Dim&lt;/font&gt; operator creates the variable.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim Commission As Single
  Dim Sales As Single
  Sales = 3142.51
  Commission = 0.3 * Sales  ' Calculate 30% commission.
&lt;/source&gt;
First, we set the total sales to 3142.51.

The * operator calculates multiplication, so the last line is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;Commission = 0.3 * Sales&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that our second step is multiplying 0.3 and Sales.  Sales is 3142.51, so our result should be the product of 0.3 and 3142.51.

===Why the funny symbols?===
With the exception of addition and subtraction, the symbols used are different to the ones used in real life. This is simply because the other symbols are not available on a standard keyboard.

A good reference for the operators in Visual Basic .NET is Windows's built-in Calculator.  If you set Calculator on scientific mode, you have access to the same operators as in .NET.



===Addition===
This adds two numbers together, and is denoted by the &quot;+&quot; symbol. If strings are involved it may also do String concatenation.  Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  x = 7 + 2     ' Results in 9.
  x = 25 + -4   ' Results in 21.
  Dim StringA As String
  StringA = &quot;A string&quot; + &quot;Another string&quot; ' Results in &quot;A stringAnother string&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

By using funny symbol it will become easy to parse during execution. mostly that is the reason why they have used.

There is a second addition operator, &quot;+=&quot;. It increments the variable on the left of the += by the amount indicated on the right.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Integer = 54
  x += 89       ' result is 143
  x += 7       ' result is 150
&lt;/source&gt;

It also works with Strings as a concatenation operator.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As String = &quot;A fox&quot;
  x += &quot; jumped&quot;          ' result is &quot;A fox jumped&quot;
  x += &quot; over the fence&quot;  ' result is &quot;A fox jumped over the fence&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Subtraction===
This subtracts two numbers, and is denoted by the &quot;-&quot; symbol. Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Double = 12.045
Dim Y As Integer= 12
  x = x-Y     ' Results in 5.
  x = 25 - -4  ' Results in 29.
&lt;/source&gt;

===Multiplication===
This multiplies two numbers, and is denoted by the &quot;*&quot; symbol.  Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Integer
  x = 7 * 2   ' Results in 14.
  x = 25 * -4 ' Results in -100.
&lt;/source&gt;

===Division===
There are more types of division than the one denoted by the &quot;/&quot; symbol.  There is also integer division and remainder division.
  
:'''Division'''
::This is the most commonly used form of division and is denoted by the &quot;/&quot; operator. Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Single
  ' (note that we must use the Single class to have decimals)
  x = 7 / 2  ' Results in 3.5.
  x = 25 / 4 ' Results in 6.25.
&lt;/source&gt;

:'''Integer division'''
::This divides two numbers, and gives the result without the remainder if the quotient is a decimal. Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Integer
  x = 7 \ 2    ' Results in 3.
  x = 25 \ 4   ' Results in 6.
&lt;/source&gt;

:'''Remainder Division'''
::This divides two numbers, and gives the result's remainder if the quotient is a decimal.  This is denoted by the operator &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Mod&lt;/font&gt;.&quot; Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Integer
  x = 7 Mod 2  ' Results in 1.
  x = 25 Mod 4 ' Results in 1.
&lt;/source&gt;

===Exponentiation===
This is raising a number to a power. For example &lt;math&gt;7^2&lt;/math&gt; in VB .Net code is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Integer
  x = 7 ^ 2   ' Results in 49.
&lt;/source&gt;

This results in the number 49 being assigned to the variable x. It can also be used to calculate the square root of a number. The square root of a number is the number raised to the power of 0.5.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Single
  x = 7 ^ 0.5 ' Results in a number around 2.645.
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: It is necessary to ensure that the variables be correctly declared to get the desired results. The following example works, but will produce the wrong result.  This is because the Integer class does not allow decimal places (just like mathematical integers).
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Integer
  x = 7 ^ 0.5 ' Results in 3.
&lt;/source&gt;

Since x is declared as an Integer type, the value square root, a real number, is stored incorrectly.  

Any nth root of number is the can be calculated by raising the number to the power of &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim x As Single
  Dim n As Single
  n = 7
  x = 2 ^ (1 / n)
&lt;/source&gt;

This is because &lt;math&gt;x ^ \frac{1}{n} = \sqrt[n]{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Rounding ===
* &lt;code&gt;Round()&lt;/code&gt;: round to the nearest integer.
* &lt;code&gt;Floor()&lt;/code&gt;: round to inferior.
* &lt;code&gt;Ceiling()&lt;/code&gt;: round to superior.
* &lt;code&gt;Truncate()&lt;/code&gt;: truncate the decimal digits.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;

    Sub Main()
        Dim Number1 As Single = 1.5
        Console.WriteLine(Math.Round(Number1))  ' 2

        Console.WriteLine(Math.Ceiling(Number1))  ' 2
        Console.WriteLine(Math.Truncate(Number1))  ' 1
        Console.ReadLine()
    End Sub
End Module
&lt;/source&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;Max()&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Min()&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==String Operator==
===String concatenation===
The &quot;&amp;amp;&quot; operator joins two strings together. Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim String1 As String = &quot;123&quot;
  Dim String2 As String = &quot;456&quot;
  Dim String3 As String
  String3 = String1 &amp; String2 ' Results in &quot;123456&quot;.
&lt;/source&gt;

This will result in String3 being equal to &quot;123456&quot;

The &quot;+&quot; operator may be used in place of &quot;&amp;amp;&quot;. However, it is not recommended.

===Concat===

You may concatenate a number of strings:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim String1 As String = &quot;Let&quot;
  Dim String2 As String = &quot; us&quot;
  Dim String3 As String = &quot; concatenate!&quot;
  Dim strOutput As String
  strOutput = String.concat(String1,String2,String3) ' Results in &quot;Let us concatenate!&quot;.
&lt;/source&gt;

If you have defined a string array, such as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim strArr As String() = {&quot;I&quot;, &quot; am&quot;, &quot; your&quot;, &quot; automatic&quot;, &quot; lover.&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;

then all the elements of this array may be concatenated in a simple way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  strOutput = string.concat(strArr) ' Results in &quot;I am your automatic lover.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== String manipulations functions ==
* Lcase(): converts in higher case.
* Ucase(): converts in lower case.

To create some substrings, the VB6 functions are still available:
* Left(): left part.
* Right(): right part.
* Mid(): middle part.
* InStr(): substring location into a string.
* Replace(): replace a substring by another one.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    Sub Main()
        Dim StringName As String = &quot;lorem ipsum dolor sit amet&quot;
        StringName = StringName.Replace(&quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;)
        Console.WriteLine(Mid(StringName, InStr(StringName, &quot; &quot;), 6))
        Console.ReadLine()  ' Displays &quot; opsum&quot;
    End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]}}

== Overview ==

A '''''Remembrall''''' is a glass sphere filled with white smoke. If you hold the ball in your hand, the smoke will turn red to indicate you have forgotten something. The name is apparently a portmanteau of &quot;remember&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, and &quot;ball&quot;.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] is sent a Remembrall by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|his grandmother]] in his second week at Hogwarts, and it immediately turns red when he holds it, to tell him that he has forgotten something. However, it cannot tell him what he has forgotten.

== Analysis ==

As written, the Remembrall, while neat, is not particularly useful; everyone has always forgotten something, so the Remembrall would always indicate that something had been forgotten. Perhaps the shade of red would indicate how important the forgotten item is? 

The main purpose of the Remembrall is to give [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] something that he can steal, to show off his character, and to make it necessary for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to fly to recover it. Forcing Harry onto a broom, in a situation where he can show off his natural talent unfettered by organized lessons, is necessary to allow us to share Harry's joy at finding something he is good at in the Wizarding world.

After the byplay on the brooms, Neville's Remembrall plays no further significant part on the story, and no others are mentioned.

features=Turns off wand light|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]|}}

== Overview ==

'''''Nox''''' is the counter-spell to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Lumos|Lumos]]; it darkens a lit wand.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Nox spell is used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], and in the depths of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]], to extinguish their wands, previously illuminated by means of the Lumos charm, when they no longer needed their light.

== Analysis ==

An extinguishing spell is, in retrospect, necessary; otherwise, you have the equally ludicrous cases of a wand that, once illuminated, never goes out, or of a wand that, once lit, goes out eventually of its own accord, likely at the worst possible moment. It is surprising, perhaps, that we see the extinguishing charm used so very infrequently, given the number of times that wandlight is invoked. However, looking at the behavior of magic in the stories, this is something of a pattern; time-limited spells, such as the effects of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] only wear off inconveniently when such is necessary to the story line, and otherwise remain in force as long as necessary for the action, but no longer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The menstrual cycle ==

[[Image:Gcsebiolmenstrual1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Menstrual cycle]]
The '''menstrual cycle''' is a cycle of events that occurs in the womb ('''uterus''') and ovaries of female mammals. It is associated with the production of eggs and preparing the uterus for the implantation of fertilised eggs.  

The menstrual cycle occurs over a period of about 28 days. The changes during the cycle are due to four hormones, '''progesterone''', '''oestrogen''', '''FSH''' (follicle stimulating hormone) and '''LH''' (luteinising hormone). Progesterone and oestrogen have wide ranging effects on the body but in the context of the menstrual cycle progesterone is mainly involved in '''maintaining''' the lining of the uterus and oestrogen is mainly concerned with '''building up''' the lining of the uterus. FSH stimulates the production of eggs and LH stimulates the release of the egg. FSH and LH are produced by the '''pituitary gland''' in the brain.

There are four stages in the menstrual cycle.

'''Stage 1'''. Days 1-4. '''Menstruation''' (bleeding) occurs.  The lining of the uterus disintegrates and is shed. This is due to low levels of progesterone.

'''Stage 2'''. Days 4-14. The uterine lining grows back. This is due to high levels of oestrogen.

'''Stage 3'''. Day 14. The egg (called an '''ovum''') is released. This is due to LH.

'''Stage 4'''. Days 14-28. The lining of the uterus is maintained in case the egg becomes fertilised and implanted in the uterus. Maintenance of the lining is due to high levels of progesterone.

The four hormones interact with each other. FSH causes Oestrogen release and oestrogen inhibits FSH.  LH stimulates both oestrogen and progesterone production. Before ovulation LH release is stimulated by oestrogen but after ovulation it is inhibited by both oestrogen and progesterone.

In summary, the hormones have the following effects:

:'''Oestrogen''': causes growth of the uterine lining. Inhibits FSH. Stimulates release of LH and hence release of the egg. Inhibits LH after ovulation.

:'''Progesterone''': maintains the uterine lining. Inhibits LH after ovulation.

:'''LH''': Stimulates the release of the egg (called '''ovulation'''). Stimulates oestrogen and progesterone production.

:'''FSH''': Stimulates egg development and the release of oestrogen.

Birth control tablets contain high levels of progesterone and oestrogen. The oestrogen inhibits FSH production so that eggs cease to develop. 

FSH is used to treat infertility because it stimulates the production of eggs.

===Learning the menstrual cycle===

The menstrual cycle is easy to learn. The best approach is probably to break it down into parts.

==Background==
[[Image:Obsolete CDs.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
FreeBSD is a Unix-like free operating system descended from AT&amp;T UNIX via the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) branch through the 386BSD and 4.4BSD operating systems. It runs on processors compatible with the Intel x86 family, as well as on the DEC Alpha, the UltraSPARC processors by Sun Microsystems, the Itanium (IA-64), AMD64 and PowerPC processors. It also runs on the PC-98 architecture. Support for the ARM and MIPS architectures is currently in development.

FreeBSD is developed as a complete operating system. The kernel, device drivers and all of the userland utilities, such as the shell, are held in the same source code revision tracking tree (CVS). This is in contrast to Linux, a similar but better-known operating system, in which the kernel is developed by one set of developers; userland utilities and applications by others, such as the GNU project; and all are packaged together by other groups and published as Linux distributions.

As an operating system, FreeBSD is generally regarded as quite reliable and robust, and of the operating systems that accurately report uptime remotely [1], FreeBSD is the most common free operating system listed in Netcraft's list [2] of the 50 web servers with the longest uptime (uptime on some operating systems such as some versions of Linux can't be calculated). A long uptime also indicates that no kernel updates have been deemed necessary, as installing a new kernel requires a reboot and resets the uptime counter of the system.

===History and development===
Initial development of FreeBSD started in 1993, taking its sources from 386BSD. However, due to concerns about the legality of all the sources used in 386BSD and a consequent lawsuit between Novell (then owner of the UNIX trademark) and Berkeley, FreeBSD ended up re-engineering much of the system with the FreeBSD 2.0 release in January of 1995 using the 4.4BSD-Lite release from the University of California, Berkeley. The FreeBSD Handbook includes more historical information about the genesis of FreeBSD.

Perhaps FreeBSD 2.0's most notable advance was the revamp of the original CMU's Mach Virtual Memory system, which was optimized for performance under high loads, and the creation of the ports system that made downloading, building and installing third party software very easy. FreeBSD powered extremely successful sites like cdrom.com (a huge repository of software that broke several throughput records on the net), Hotmail, and Yahoo!.

FreeBSD 3.0 brought many changes: it switched to the ELF binary format, initial support for SMP systems and also added support for a new 64 bit platform: the Alpha. At its time the 3.X branch was severely criticized as many changes were not evidently beneficial and affected performance, but it was a necessary step to develop what would become the very successful 4.X branch.

Initially, FreeBSD employed the BSD Daemon as its logo, but in 2005 a competition for a new logo was arranged. On October 8, 2005, the competition finished and the design by Anton K. Gural was chosen as the new FreeBSD logo. The BSD Daemon will remain as the FreeBSD Project mascot.
[edit]

===FreeBSD 5 development and changes===

The latest and final FreeBSD release from the 5-STABLE branch is 5.5, and was released in May 2006. FreeBSD developers maintain (at least) two branches of simultaneous development. A -STABLE branch of FreeBSD is created for each major version number, from which releases are cut about once every 4-6 months. The latest 4-STABLE release of FreeBSD is 4.11, which is the last of the 4-STABLE branch releases. The first 5-STABLE release was 5.3 (5.0 through 5.2.1 were cut from -CURRENT). The first 6-STABLE release was 6.0. The development branch, -CURRENT, is now 7.0-CURRENT, which contains aggressive new kernel and userspace features. If a feature is sufficiently stable and mature, it is eventually backported (&quot;MFC&quot; - Merge from CURRENT in the FreeBSD developer slang) to the -STABLE branch. FreeBSD's development model is described in an in-depth article by Niklas Saers [3].

The big difference in FreeBSD 5 was a major change in the low-level kernel locking mechanisms to enable better symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) support, releasing much of the kernel from the MP lock, sometimes referred to as the Big Giant Lock. It is now possible for more than one process to execute in kernel mode at the same time.

Other major changes include an m:n threading solution called KSE which is now the default threading (pthreads) library, starting with 5.3 (the creation of the 5-STABLE branch). The terminology m:n, where m and n are small positive integers, implies that m userland threads correspond to n kernel threads. Many other new features are security related. The TrustedBSD project was formed by Robert Watson for the express purpose of adding trusted operating system functionality to the FreeBSD operating system. An extensible mandatory access control framework (the TrustedBSD MAC Framework), filesystem Access Control Lists (ACLs), and the new UFS2 filesystem all came from TrustedBSD. Some of the TrustedBSD functionality has been integrated into the NetBSD and OpenBSD operating systems as well.

FreeBSD 5 has also significantly changed the block I/O layer with the introduction of the GEOM modular disk I/O request transformation framework, contributed by Poul-Henning Kamp. GEOM enables the simple creation of many kinds of functionality, such as mirroring (gmirror) and encryption (gbde). The recent release of FreeBSD 5.4 has confirmed the FreeBSD 5.x branch as a highly stable and well-performing release, albeit one with a long gestation period due to the large feature set.

===FreeBSD 6 and 7===

FreeBSD 6.1 was released on May 8, 2006, and 7.0-CURRENT is under active development. These versions continue the work on SMP and threading optimization, as well as additional work in the area of advanced 802.11 functionality, and TrustedBSD security event auditing. The primary release accomplishments of this release include the removal of the Giant lock from VFS, replacement of the libthr library with a better performing implementation of 1:1 threading, and the addition of a BSM audit implementation, called OpenBSM, created by the TrustedBSD Project which is heavily based upon the BSM implementation found in Apple's Open Source Darwin which has been released under a BSD-style license.

===Linux compatibility===

FreeBSD provides binary compatibility with several other Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. The reasoning behind this is generally attributed to being able to run applications developed for Linux, often commercial, that are only distributed in binary form and thus cannot be ported to FreeBSD without the will of those who control the source code.

In a nutshell, it allows FreeBSD users to run a majority of the applications that are only distributed as Linux binaries. When compared to the vast number of native applications available for FreeBSD using the Ports Collection, these applications are in the minority. Applications used under the Linux compatibility layer include StarOffice, the Linux version of Netscape, Adobe Acrobat, RealPlayer, VMware, Oracle, WordPerfect, Skype, Doom 3, Quake 4, the Unreal Tournament series, SeaMonkey, and so on. Generally, there seems to be no noticeable performance penalty when running Linux binaries as opposed to native FreeBSD ones.

Though there are many applications that run flawlessly under the compatibility layer, it should be noted that the layer is not complete, thus rendering some Linux binaries unusable on FreeBSD or limiting their functionality, possibly because this compatibility layer only supports the system calls of Linux Kernel 2.4.2, a historic release. One example of this is Cedega, TransGaming's product to run Microsoft Windows games on Linux. Its usage is largely crippled at this time due to an incomplete compatibility layer. There has, however, been limited success in using it to run games on FreeBSD [4]. A 2006 Summer of Code project to update the compatibility layer and implement missing system calls has been accepted [5].

For most scientific applications, the Linux compatibility layer performs correctly; applications such as nmrpipe, ccp, Mathematica and Matlab perform as expected.

===License===

As with its sister operating systems, the code in FreeBSD is released under the terms of a variety of licenses. All of the kernel code and most newly created code is released under the terms of the two-clause BSD license, which allows everyone to use and redistribute FreeBSD as they wish. There are also parts under the GPL, LGPL, ISC, three-clause BSD license, and four-clause BSD license.

Also available are binary blobs for particular functionality, such as the Atheros HAL for wireless functionality and a binary only tool for Adaptec's AAC RAID.

===Derivatives===

A range of products are directly or indirectly based on FreeBSD. These range from embedded devices, such as Juniper routers and Nokia's firewall operating system, to portions of other operating systems including Linux and the RTOS VxWorks. Darwin, the core of Apple's Mac OS X, borrows heavily from FreeBSD, including its virtual file system, network stack and components of its userspace. Apple continues to integrate new code from and contribute changes back to FreeBSD. The open source OpenDarwin, originally derived from Apple's codebase but now a separate entity, also includes substantial FreeBSD code. In addition, there are a number of operating systems originally forked from or based on FreeBSD including PC-BSD and DesktopBSD, which include enhancements aimed at home users and workstations; the FreeSBIE and Frenzy live CD distributions; the m0n0wall and pfSense embedded firewalls; and DragonFly BSD, a notable fork from FreeBSD 4.8 aiming for a different multiprocessor synchronization strategy than that chosen for FreeBSD 5 and development of some microkernel features.</text>

I was going over the lesson and I noticed an inconsistency between the characters displayed for numbered words in the lesson's list and the number given for those characters on the stroke order page.  This seems to start with number 10 on the stroke order page.

Jay

I think it would be helpfull if this page had the readings of every character. As a user of this wiki book I find it annoying to have to go back and look at the lesson to find out what each character is.[[User:Ulfrinn|Ulfrinn]] 22:28, 7 August 2006 (utc)

It would be very helpful if the seemingly random numbers on the left were replaced with the pingyin for each character. [[Jacob GNAA]]

I am using the Wikibook and find the Stroke Order section very useful. But there is a problem, the stroke order figures do not correspond to the numbered Vocabulary list in the Wikibook anymore, starting at number 11. After detailed analyisis of the symbols and the stroke order table, I realized the character for Word #11 (to be named) is missing from the table, and is instead replaced by characters called (in the stroke order table) 11a and 11b, which are actually the characters for the 12th Word in the vocabulary list. I will correct this and try to get the numbers in the Stroke Order table to match the ones in the vocabulary list again. Reverse if I'm wrong and please explain me why. &lt;br&gt;
Edit: I will also correct the numbers 1a and 1b, since they're actually 1 and 1f (the second one is the character for singular femenine &quot;you&quot;), and add a brief explanation on top explaining what the letters in the numbered column mean, so as to make this table clearer for future readers (it took my a while to figure it out, although it is quite obvious). &lt;br&gt;
Edit 2: I have fixed it and finally, the Stroke Order Table and the Vocabulary list match perfectly once again. It seems the character for Word #11 had been inserted as #10 in the table. This was causing all the following ranks in the table to shift and not to match the list. This is fixed, I hope it makes things clearer for new readers. To everyone who is doing the images and stroke orders, thanks a lot and keep up the great work! [[User:MHaaZ|David Haas]] &lt;br&gt;

Edit 3: Once again there is something I want to correct in the table, but this time I need the support of someone who is fluent in Chinese (since I'm just a beginner). My doubt is about the &quot;1&quot; and &quot;1f&quot; characters in the table. After reading Lesson 1 of the Wikibook again, I got the impression that this differentiation between genders is made only in Traditional Chinese (since it is indicated in parentheses in the WikiBook). Would someone please clear this for me, so that I know whether the second character should be referenced to as &quot;1f&quot; or, more correctly, &quot;1tf&quot;? Thanks again! [[User:MHaaZ|David Haas]]

Maybe some could write also the pinyin and meaning next to each sign.

      <comment>/* Blood pressure info under &quot;Body Composition&quot; */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Homeostasis may seem uninteresting, but it is the basis of all physiology.  I am an anesthesia resident and the concepts of negative and positive feedback loops play into every medication and action I take during an operation.  These concepts are the building blocks for everything else you will learn in your class.  I think you've done a good job updating the chapter, keep it up for the others.

== Goals for this chapter ==

*Introduce physiology as a science and its relevance to those going into the medical profession
*Introduce homeostasis and explain why it is an appropriate framework for the study of physiology
*Provide several good examples of homeostasis
*Provide illustrations that help understand homeostasis, control mechanisms, etc
*Show how all body systems tie together and introduce subsequent chapters of the book

[[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 14:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== Additional Information ==

I have found an old page from a dead book, that contains a large amount of information about homeostasis:

*[[Physiology: Homeostasis]]

You are welcome to &quot;harvest&quot; any useful information from this orphaned page for your use here. Feel free to copy information, tables, or whatever if you need them. If this page is completely useless, let me know and I will delete it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

==Brent's Comments==
I was doing some research on osteoporosis and cancer and found that apoptosis is suspected of playing a role in both of these disorders.  I wrote a brief section on apoptosis in the development chapter, but it may be more appropriate for your chapter.  I saw that it is in your further research section, but maybe it is important enough to warrant its own section in your chapter.[[User:Brentwaldrop|Brentwaldrop]] 19:58, 7 August 2006 (UTC)


== Principles to keep in mind ==

Some basic components of a system that tries to maintain a constant level: 1) some sort of sensor to detect changes in the variable of interest. So our body has baroreceptors to measure blood pressure, ways to measure glucose levels in the blood, oxygen &amp; CO2 levels in the blood, body temperature, levels of various ions, etc. Your body cannot regulate something that it cannot detect and measure in some way. 2) a mechanism for changing the variable--if the body is too hot then there must be a mechanism for cooling it down; if blood pressure is low, then there is a mechanism to increase it. The control mechanisms are under nervous and/or endocrine control. When a change is made to offset any imbalance, that change must then be registered by the sensor. Otherwise it is possible to overcorrect.[[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 21:26, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

== Homeostasis throughout the body ==

That section still needs work. I fixed several spelling errors (there are more) and I removed broken links and added links to our chapters. However, the content still needs work too. This needs to be textbook quality, with a brief description of homeostatic mechanisms within each body system, emphasizing physiological parameters that systems work within, what control mechanisms exist to correct for deviances, and how multiple systems work together to maintain homeostasis of the whole body. We need to remove any first-person tenses (after all, there isn't a single author). We need to make sure that any statements made are in fact sound physiological principles and not just popular opinion. [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 17:31, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

== 2007 Revisions ==
This chapter was changed dramatically from time to time during the 2006 class, not always for the better. I deleted several sections that were more related to alternative views on health than homeostasis. This chapter needs to be thoroughly revised to serve as the foundation for the rest of the book. [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 18:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
:The section &quot;Pathways that alter homeostasis&quot; worries me a bit. Some of those are rather vague statements. The lifestyle advice may be valid, but the connection to homeostasis is not well established for several of the statements. [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 04:10, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
:'''Homeostasis throughout the body''' still needs to be revised. What should be in the section is a brief example of how each body system contributes to the well-being of the entire body; what should NOT be there is a description of lifestyle practices that will help maintain health of that system. Herbal medicines may indeed have an effect on the endocrine system, but that tells us nothing about what the endocrine system actually does and certainly nothing about how it is involved in homeostasis! [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 17:39, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== Degrees Fahrenheit? ==

I was browsing this book and was surprised to see an example using a non-international unit of temperature at the very beginning of the text,
in '''Home Heating System Vs. Negative Feedback''':
  Let's say today you set it at 70 degrees. (...) far below the 70 degree set point (...)
Readers of wikibooks.org, especially of its English version, are obviously not restricted to the USA, which is the only country using such a non-standard unit (the international system of units has been officially adopted [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units everywhere except in Burma (Myanmar), Liberia, and the United States]). I suggest at least writing 70&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F explicitly, at best giving an example in &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. Otherwise non-US readers will initially feel, like me, that the thermostat was set to an absurdly hot temperature: almost twice the natural body's heat!

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt; Previous chapter - &lt;/b&gt; [[../Molecular quantum mechanics/]]

===Semi-empirical Philosophies===
There is a difference in philosophy between the Pople and Dewar schools.
Dewar's parameterisation aims to absorb all the missing parts of the model
where SCF is inadequate, (Correlation , relativity, algebraic approximation),
into the semi-empirical parameters, whereas Pople's initial idea was to produce
cheap practical equivalents of minimal Slater orbital basis SCF
calculations which would have all the mathematical niceties and limits of Hartree-Fock theory.
In recent times Dewar's ideas and programs have prevailed because computing power
has increased to make the real SCF wavefunction routinely computable for all but the largest molecules so MOPAC style programs are used for the largest molecules where Hartree-Fock 
is still uncomputable.

Programs for linear scaling SCF, where small approximations are made to make the effort scale linearly with the size of the molecule rather than scaling to the power of 4 dictated by the integrals evaluation, are hoping to make uncomputable Hartree-Fock problems a thing of the past.
  
====A Brief Technical Description of Semi-Empirical Methods====

The ZDO approximation, (Zero Differential Overlap).
The first approximation is core-valence separation.
The core electron MOs  are independent of molecular environment and can be parameterised out.
This is a good approximation, the all valence approximation - effective nuclear
charges (Za)  adjust for the missing inner electrons.

Basis functions belong to individual atoms in semi-empirical methods. In all methods
For NDDO, (the most complete approximation i.e. nearest the full Hartree-Fock
solution)
i.e. all 3 and 4 centre integrals disappear.
In CNDO the least complete method the Kroneka deltas are
so only integrals like
survive.
In INDO 1-centre ''exchange'' integrals are added to the CNDO set

Remember 2J - K in Hartree-Fock theory.

=====The Invariance Problem=====

To insure the values of calculated properties do not change with
rotated orientations of the molecule:

&lt;pre&gt;

         (sAsA|pxBpxB)  =  (sAsA|pyBpyB)

        and

         (sAsA|pxBpxB)  =  (sAsA|sBsB)

&lt;/pre&gt;
This is a considerable approximation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The process by which [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drywall drywall] is installed.

==Materials==
*Types of Drywall
#Gypsum Board
#*Used for walls and ceilings.
#*Size
#**Length x Height: 4'x8', 4'x10', 4'x12', or larger
#**Width: 1/2&quot; or 5/8&quot;
#Greenboard
#*Typically used in wet areas, including walls around bathtub and shower.
#*Note: Greenboard is NOT water-proof.
#Concrete Backerboard
#*Marketed under the names &quot;Durock&quot; and &quot;Wonderboard&quot;.
#*Used as backing for ceramic tile.
#*Also ideal for wet areas such as shower walls and bathtub surround.
*Drywall Screws
**1-1/4&quot; Screws for 1/2&quot; Drywall
**1-5/8&quot; Screws for 5/8&quot; Drywall

==Tools==
*Utility Knife
*Drywall T-Square
*Tape Measure
*Drywall Saw
*Edge Sander (rasp)
*Contractor's Pencil
*Chalk line

==Measuring and Cutting==


===Procedure===
#Measure the dimensions of the space in which drywall is being installed
#Mark these dimensions on a full sheet of drywall
#Extend marks with T-square
#Mark locations of studs on drywall (studs are typically 16&quot; on center)
#Snap chalk line on drywall to extend stud marks
#Score drywall along edge marks
#Snap drywall along score
#Score back of drywall along the break.  Separate piece to be used from remainder.
#If the piece covers an outlet, switch, or other fixture, complete the following steps:
##Measure distance from intended edge of sheet to bottom left hand corner and top right hand corner of fixture
##Mark these points on drywall
##Use T-square to extend point 1 right and up and point 2 left and down.  
##Score these lines, using a utility knife.
##Re-score lines several times in order to make a thick cut.
##Gently punch out hole.

==Wall Installation==


===Notes===



===Procedure===
====Ceiling====
#Prop a full sheet butted against a corner perpendicular to the length of the ceiling joists.
#Drive Screws
#*Drive one screw in each corner of piece.  
#*Drive row of screws (one per stud using chalk lines) on each length edge.  Drive additional row every foot (if the sheet is 4' wide and 8' long there should be 4 rows of 6 screws each).
#Prop another full sheet butted against wall and first sheet perpendicular to length of the ceiling joists.  Repeat step 2.
#Continue to prop and hang full sheets butted against wall and previous sheet as space permits.  
#Follow measuring and cutting procedure for finishing ceiling with pieces smaller than full sheets.
====Top Sheets====
#Prop full sheet butted against the ceiling and adjacent wall horizontally.
#Drive Screws
#*Drive one screw in each corner of piece.  
#*Drive row of screws (one per stud using chalk lines) on each length edge and middle of the sheet (length-wise).  Drive additional screws every foot along each width edge. (if the sheet is 4' wide and 8' long there should be 2 rows of 6 screws each along each length edge, one row of 4 screws along middle and 2 additional screws in each width edge).
#Prop full sheet butted against ceiling and previous sheet.  Repeat step 2.
#Continue to prop and hang full sheets butted against ceiling as space permits (each wall should be considered as separate spaces).
#Follow measuring and cutting procedure for finishing wall with pieces smaller than full sheets.
#Repeat for all walls.

====Bottom Sheets====
#Prop full sheet butted against top sheet and adjacent wall horizontally.
#Drive Screws
#*Drive one screw in each corner of piece.  
#*Drive row of screws (one per stud using chalk lines) on each length edge and middle of the sheet (length-wise).  Drive additional screws every foot along each width edge. (if the sheet is 4' wide and 8' long there should be 2 rows of 6 screws each along each length edge, one row of 4 screws along middle and 2 additional screws in each width edge).
#Prop full sheet butted against top sheet and previous sheet.  Repeat step 2.
#Continue to prop and hang full sheets butted against top sheets as space permits (each wall should be considered as separate spaces).
#Follow measuring and cutting procedure for finishing wall with pieces smaller than full sheets.

==Floating and Sanding==
===Materials===
*Joint Compound
*Joint Tape and/or Mesh Tape
*Corner Bead
*Water

===Tool List===
*Putty Knife
**Sizes: 4&quot;, 8&quot;, 12&quot;
*Tin Snips
*Joint Compound Trough
*Sanding Sponge Block
*Hand Sander w/ Sanding Screens (various grit available)

===Suggested PPE===
*N95 Dust Mask (for sanding)
*Goggles (optional for sanding)

===Puttying Procedure===
*'''Outside Corner''' (two walls meet to form a convex corner)
#Measure length of corner
#Using tin snips, cut corner bead to match length of corner.
#Align bead with corner, flaps along each wall.
#Gently hammer bead into place with rubber mallet.
#Secure in place with screws through the holes manufactured into the bead. Space these screws about 5&quot; apart.

NOTE: The screws should be sunk as far in as possible without breaking through the metal corner bead  
#Run a dry knife up and down the corner bead 
#If the Knife rubs against the screw or the outside edge of the corner bead sink the screws more or place more screws as needed 
#Apply heavy narrow layer of compound along bead with 4&quot; knife
#Place one edge of 12&quot; knife perpendicular to edge of corner bead at the top of the corner.  Drag knife at a 45% angle along length of bead. 
NOTE: Maintaining the same angle the entire length of the corner bead helps keep the mud as smooth as possible 
#Continue to add compound using 4&quot; knife and repeat step 7 until a uniform layer is achieved.  Bead edge should be free of excess compound and wall edge should be feathered (not pronounced).  
#Allow to dry, lightly sand knife marks, bead edge and wall edge to achieve smooth finish.
#Repeat procedure at least once, widening the layer with each application.

===Everything below is under construction===
*'''Inside Corner'''
*#Apply a thin coat of compound to the corner area. Make this wide enough to extend past the width of the tape
*#Using a corner knife, embed paper tape in compound.
*#*Start at the top with the edge of the tape and run it down the seam.
*#*Make sure that half is on each wall.
*#*Use only one piece of tape for the whole corner.
*#Cover the compound on one side at a time, until tape is not visible on either side.
*'''Regular Seams'''
*#Measure the length of tape needed by holding one end of the tape at one end of the seam and pulling the roll along the seam until the other end of the seam is met. 
*#Fold the tape vertical and tear along the fold to insure a straight edge on the tape will meet another seam or the corner
*#using a 4 inch knife place a thin layer of mud the width of the knife starting at one end of the seam and ending approximately 18 inches (the length from one screw on the seam to another)from where you started making sure that one-half the knife is on each side of the seam as you place the mud on the wall
*#Taking the tape already cut to length place one end of the tape at the edge of the mud that was already placed on the wall
*#With your fingers smooth the tape onto the wall covering the mud already placed on the wall to insure a tight smooth fit to the wall 
*#Pull a dry knife along the tape holding it as parallel to the wall as possible but still putting constant pressure on the tape 
NOTE: If there are bubbles visible between the wall and the tape pull that area pf tape back off the wall and resmooth it as needed 
*#
*'''Nail Dimples and Other Blemishes'''
*#Apply a dab of compound to the dimple or blemish , holding the knife at 45 degrees to the wall.
*#Level the surface with the knife, holding it at 90 degrees to the wall. This will create a smooth layer.
*'''Additional Coats'''
*#Allow the initial coat 24 hours to completely dry.
*#Lightly sand all edges and large ridges.
*#Re-putty all areas, feathering out to 6&quot;.
*#Wait for drying, re-sand, and apply a final coat of putty, feathering out to 12&quot;.
*#After allowing time to dry, lightly sand over every area with compound until the wall is smooth.

== General Overview ==

'''''Honeyduke's Sweet Shop''''' is a candy and treat store in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Village of Hogsmeade]]. It is very popular among Hogwarts students, on those occasions when they are allowed into the village (&quot;Hogsmeade weekends&quot;).

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Honeyduke's is also the terminus of one of the secret passages out of the school, used extensively by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], and also presumably by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] to enter the school in that same book. Once Harry has received permission to visit Hogsmeade on the weekends, which he does at the end of the book, he has little further need for that passage. The only other mention of that passage is the note in passing that &quot;all known secret passages into the school&quot; have been sealed, mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

Because of this, it seems that we see Honeyduke's to any great extent only in the third book. There is passing mention of the store, which Harry apparently visits many other times he is in Hogsmeade, but it seems much of his interest in the village is centered on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|The Three Broomsticks]]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 12|the sixth book]], we do visit Honeyduke's during the only Hogsmeade visit that year: Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] run into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], who is there buying some of his favorite crystallized pineapple.

In the third book, it is noted that there is a section of the store devoted to &quot;unusual tastes&quot;, including blood-based treats clearly intended for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Vampire|vampires]], and Cockroach Clusters. One must wonder exactly which sub-group of wizards would be interested in the last, however, as we are not introduced to any insectivore wizards in the series. That specific treat, though, does reappear; for some unknown reason, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], who uses the names of sweets as the password for his office door, at one point is found to have Cockroach Cluster as his office password.

== Analysis ==

What could possibly be more likely than having a confectionery within walking distance of a boarding school? It is almost necessary to have a candy store near Hogwarts. Strictly speaking, though, it is not necessary to the story, and as such could have been left out without any immediate harm to the main story, as in fact it is not mentioned in the first two books, and barely even touched upon after the third. It is, however, a testament to the forethought of the author that, needing a place for a tunnel from Hogwarts to surface, she recognized the necessity of a sweet shop in the village and placed the tunnel terminus there. In fact, having the tunnel lead to Honeyduke's is quite possibly the reason it was initially created; one can see a perceived need on the part of students to get to a sweet shop, and it would be possible for a student, of magical ability on a par with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marauders|the Marauders]] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]], to create such a passageway in their hour of perceived need.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When it was first created, the Waterfall Model of Software Development presumed that writing software is a linear process, with clearly defined phases. Many experts have come to realize that this is not true in all cases. However, Waterfall is always useful as a checklist, even if it is not followed in a linear, rigorous fashion. A summary follows.


Phases:

1.Requirements Allocation

2.Preliminary Design (AKA Top Level Design or Architecture)

3.Detailed design

4.Code and Unit Test

5.Integration and Integration test


I.Requirements
* Capabilities – what the software does
* Human interface – all screens and messages defined
* All interfaces to external hardware and software identified
* Size and timing requirements

II.Preliminary Design
* Structure diagram
* Functional flow diagrams
* All major function prototypes defined and comments for functions written
* All major data structures and data bases defined
* Header files defined
* Sizing and timing estimates (may be deferred to detailed design)

III.Detailed Design
* PDL C Program design language (or pseudo code) written. Rule of thumb: 1 line of pseudo code = 3 to 10 lines of “C” code (approximately).
* Better sizing and timing estimates

IV.Code And Unit Test
* Convert PDL to code
* Design unit test plan and test code. Test Drivers, test stubs, and any special requirements defined (e.g., special test hardware configurations, test software, lab equipment, etc.).
* Better sizing and timing estimates
* Metrics, test coverage tool results, etc.

V.Integration and Integration Test
* Design integration test plan and test code
* Run code on target system and debug
* Take sizing and timing measurements and ensure that you are meeting requirements.
* Line count - Total lines of text, and lines of code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
Welcome to the Wikibook of Classical Chinese（Chinese:文言）. This book teaches the Classical Chinese language.

Knowledge of some basic Chinese characters before starting this course is assumed. You do not have to know a lot of characters, but you should already have an overall understanding of them, such as structure, radicals, and how to use a dictionary. Knowledge of Pinyin, Vernacular Chinese and Japanese could be beneficial, but is not required.

For background knowledge, such as what Classical Chinese is, the history of the language, etc., please read the Wikipedia article on [[:w:Classical Chinese|Classical Chinese]].

=== Organization of the book ===
The Chinese language, especially Classical Chinese, does not have strict grammatical rules. It does follow some elementary rules, but they are not as strict as in English. Here we teach you Classical Chinese by using multiple texts as examples, and explain each of them.

==Introduction ==
Classical Chinese was heavily used across East Asia until the 20th century. Classical Chinese is a poetic and sophisticated language, and might be one of the most compact languages in the world. That means, for expressing the same idea, fewer characters (or 'words') are needed than would be the case in modern Chinese or most other languages. (This holds true only for topics (ideas) that were known and could be expressed by ancient Chinese - there are no terms corresponding to 'Quantum Theory' or 'Psychoanalysis' in Classical Chinese, because these topics, as one would expect, were unknown at the time.)

Also, unlike most other languages, Classical Chinese is not a spoken language; that is, it is not designed to be said out loud. It is essentially a written language. If one does choose to read a Classical Chinese text, they can do so in a number of different ways, depending on whether their native language is Chinese, Korean or Japanese. In the case of Chinese language speakers, your native dialect will also influence the pronunciation due to the large differences that exist between the dialects. Here in the course, we use the pinyin system for the pronunciation, but do not worry if you do not understand pinyin, as we will not frequently mention pronunciations. If you are interested in how to speak the text out loud, please go to Wiktionary and check the pronunciation of each character in Mandarin, Japanese, Korean or other languages or dialects. However, Classical Chinese has its rhythm. As we have already said, it is a poetic language; so when considering how to speak text out loud, in some language or dialect, one must  speak it in a particular way.

Traditionally, Classical Chinese employs no punctuation at all. However, books published nowadays usually come with punctuation to aid reading. The technique of recognizing each word or sentence from a piece of text is called &quot;句讀/句读/Ju4 Du2(Sentence grouping)&quot;. It is one of the most important parts of learning this language. This course will teach you this language in a traditional way, but we will also introduce a limited amount of punctuation, and use spaces to split sentences to help learning.

Traditionally, the Chinese language is read from top to bottom, right to left. Because of the limitation of current web techniques, we use left to right, top to bottom in the course.

Next, we have some examples as an introduction to start our course.

No self-respecting bartender would put a lemon slice on a gin and tonic.  I mean, I'm willing to hear differing opinions before I change it, but as far as I know, a lime is the only standard garnish for a gin and tonic, and nothing else should be used unless it's requested.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mold treatment is the process by which mold is removed and a structure is sanitized.  There are a variety of methods that yield acceptable results that vary in required time and financial investment.

[[Category:Reconstruction]]


====Mold treatment steps====


Prepare Site:
*Turn off Electric, if damage, set up generators outside of home.
*Open windows, doors for airflow.
*Stay outside, and wait till utility company comes.

Debris Removal:
*Remove, everything that was wet from flood. Carpet, Bed, Electronics.
*Place pots and house products in places where mold would not be attracted.

 HEPA Vacuum:
*Remove mold growth on exposed framing using dry bristle brushing 
*Reclean any remaining visible areas of growth 
*Homes where studs are already fairly dry,use only the dry cleaning/HEPA vacuum

 Wet Cleaning:
*Use a damp non-phosphate detergent and water.
*Starting at the ceiling, with sponge mops and hand sponges untill all is removed
*If wood does become saturated, allow it to dry completly before restarting
*Failure to allow surfaces to dry result in water damage (wood rot) or new mold growth.

 Sanitizing:
*Hard surfaces that are in the house, should use a disinfectant to kill contaminants.
*Damp wipe all tubs, bath and kitchen, surfaces use a solution of 1 cup recon to 1 gallon of water. (Please note that bleach
will not kill the spores of the mold, and mold will be able to regrow)

 Borate Treatments:
*With a moisture meter, measure wood surfaces for moisture content
*moisture content should be less than 20%, for application of a borate solution.
*Wash or mist the wall with an borate solution useing a paint brush or brush roller

 Final Drying:
*Continue to keep windows open, for at least 7days to let the house dry out
*Try to avoid future spreds of mold or debris to enter by, wearing proper equipment</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prior to beginning work at a site, an evaluation of the structural integrity of the building as well as potential hazards should be made and the dangers should be managed.

===Structural Integrity===
Signs of poor structural integrity:
*Walls slanted, tilted or bowed
*Building tilted
*Severe cracks in walls or ceilings
*Evidence of building movement
*Floors uneven or slanted
*Structural support beams or pillars moved or missing
*Excessive floor or ceiling loading such as trees on roof or wet debris piled high
*Detached or weakened stairways

Note: Buildings that appear to be unsound should not be entered.

===Potential Hazards===
Upon evaluation, note the following hazards:
*Mercury
*Live electrical wire
*Remaining floodwater
*Potential for trips and falls
**Water and debris may hide trip and fall hazards
**Falls from heights
**Holes in flooring
**Slippery surfaces
**Excessive floor debris
*Confined spaces/poor ventilation
*Wildlife
*Sharp edges
**Protruding nails
**Broken glass
**Bent or broken metal
*Potential overhead dangers
**Trapped water
**Unstable ceiling material
**Unsecured fixtures
*Threatening/violent occupants
*Gases
**Oxygen deficiency
**Explosive gases
**Toxic gases
*Airborne particulates
**Dust
**Asbestos
**Lead
**Mold

===Risk Mitigation===

====PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)====

Suggested [[w:Personal protective equipment|PPE]]:
*3M Half-face respirator with p100 filters
*Gloves
*Boots
*Tyvek suit (optional)
*Safety goggles (optional)

Proper usage and instruction for PPE:
*Respirator Wear:  Always make sure that the 3M Half-face respirator has a good fit.  One way to test this is while in normal wear put both hands covering the vents and suck in.  This should tighten the mask and create a sucking feeling to your face.  If you don't have this feeling you should resecure the mask on your face.

*Tyvek Suit Wear:  Make sure that the tyvek suit is loose enough that you can move around comfortably without it binding.  But remember you do not want it to be so large that it gets caught on everything you walk past.

====Management of health====
*Hydration
**try to drink twice as much as you think you need
*Sanitation
**Rinse your hands then sanitize before touching anything
**Do not touch your face or food with unsanitized hands 
*Nutrition
**Even if you are not hungry eat something its hard work you need the energy(no meal skiping)

====Securing the work site====
{| 
| Danger: 
| Solution: 
|- 
| Poor structural integrity 
| Do not enter house, mark visibly as unsound or dangerous, report to supervisor 
|- 
| Live electrical wire in structure
| Turn off main electrical switch in breaker box
|- 
| Live electrical wire outside of structure
| Contact energy company and do not approach live wire
|- 
| Tripping and falling
| Clear paths prior to continuing work.  Secure or mark holes or uneven flooring.
|- 
| Confined spaces/poor ventilation
| Do not work extended periods of time in such spaces, if there are windows try to open them so that some fresh air can circulate.
|- 
| Wildlife
| Do not approach and assume as dangerous.  For larger wildlife, contact animal control
|- 
| Sharp edges
| Mark or remove prior to continuing work
|- 
| Overhead dangers
| Remove prior to continuing work
|- 
| Threatening or violent occupants
| Do not confront.  Alert supervisor and authorities (if necessary) and leave premises
|-
|Make sure water to the house is off
|Around the outside of the building there will be a pipe coming out of the ground to a spigot then into the building.  If you look at the base of the pipe you will find a valve(you might have to dig a little) close the valve.
|-
|Mercury
|The most common places to find mercury is in old thermostats.  You can just remove the mercury from the thermostat and put it in a container, and place it in the EPA pile.  If there is a mercury spill evacuate the house and call the EPA
|}

====Safe work practices====

*Always be aware!
**Know where coworkers are in relation to you

===First Aid and Emergency Care===
====First Aid====
'''If you seek outside medical attention, make sure to report to your supervisor and fill out an incident report'''

If a person is having pain of any sort, trouble breathing, etc - the acronym OPQRST can be used to ask the appropriate questions:&lt;br&gt;
Onset (When did it start?)&lt;br&gt;
Provocation (Does anything make it better or worse?)&lt;br&gt;
Quality (Can you describe the pain?)&lt;br&gt;
Radiation (Does it move or stay in the same place?)&lt;br&gt;
Severity (On a scale from 1-10 what is your pain?)&lt;br&gt;
Time (How long has it been going on?)&lt;br&gt;

Cuts and Scrapes:&lt;br&gt;
If wound is severe:
*Always wear gloves when helping others
*Stop the bleeding by:
     - applying pressure to the wound
     - elevating the wound
*If bleeding does not stop, apply pressure to nearest artery and call 911
*Watch for signs of shock 
If wound is minor: 
*Clean the wound
*Apply an antibiotic
*Cover the wound
*Change the dressing
*Get stitches for deep wounds
*Watch for signs of shock
*Get a tetanus shot

Punctures:
*If object is embedded in skin, do NOT remove it
*Apply gauze around object to control bleeding and prevent movement
*Watch for signs of shock

Foreign Object in Eye
*To help someone else:
**Put on gloves.
**Seat the person in a well-lighted area. 
**Examine the eye to find the object. Pull the lower lid down and ask the person to look up. Then hold the upper lid while the person looks down. 
**If the object is floating in the tear film on the surface of the eye, try flushing it out. If you're able to remove the object, flush the eye with a saline solution or lukewarm water. 
*Caution
**Don't try to remove an object that's embedded in the eyeball. 
**Don't rub the eye. 
**Don't try to remove a large object that makes closing the eye difficult. 
*When to call for help:
**You can't remove the object. 
**The object is embedded in the eyeball. 
**The person with the object in the eye is experiencing abnormal vision. 
**Pain, redness, or the sensation of a foreign body in the eye persists after the object is removed.

Head Trauma
*Dial 911 or call for emergency medical assistance if any of the following signs are apparent:
**Severe head or facial bleeding 
**Clear substance appears in ears/nose/mouth
**Change in level of consciousness for more than a few seconds 
**Black-and-blue discoloration below the eyes or behind the ears (known as Battle Signs)
**Cessation of breathing 
**Confusion 
**Loss of balance 
**Weakness or an inability to use an arm or leg 
**Unequal pupil size 
**Repeated vomiting
**Slurred speech
*If severe head trauma occurs:
**Keep the person still.
**Stop any bleeding.
**Watch for changes in breathing and alertness.

Heat Exhaustion
*Signs and Symptoms:
**Feeling faint 
**Nausea 
**Heavy sweating (diaphoresis)
**Ashen appearance 
**Rapid, weak heartbeat 
**Low blood pressure 
**Cool, moist skin 
**Low-grade fever 
*If you suspect heat exhaustion:
**Get the person out of the sun and into a shady or air-conditioned location. 
**Lay the person down and elevate the legs and feet slightly. 
**Loosen or remove the person's clothing. 
**Have the person drink cool water, not iced, or a sports drink containing electrolytes. 
**Cool the person by spraying or sponging him or her with cool water and fanning. 
**Monitor the person carefully. Heat exhaustion can quickly become heatstroke. If fever greater than 102 F, fainting, confusion or seizures occur, dial 911 or call for emergency medical assistance.


Sprains
*Follow the instructions for P.R.I.C.E.
**1. '''P'''rotect the injured limb from further injury by not using the joint.
**2. '''R'''est the injured limb.
**3. '''I'''ce the area.
**4. '''C'''ompress the area with an elastic wrap or bandage.
**5. '''E'''levate the injured limb whenever possible to help prevent or limit swelling.
*Seek medical attention if:
**You heard a popping sound when your joint was injured, or you can't use the joint.
**You have a fever, and the area is red and hot, you may have an infection .
**You have a severe sprain.
**You aren't improving after the first two or three days.

Unconsciousness:
*If a person for any reason becomes unconscious, follow these steps:
1. Put on gloves/check the area for possible dangers
2. Call 911
3. Look, listen, and feel for breathing
4. If person is breathing, then move to recovery position (on side)
5. If person in NOT breathing, begin CPR

==invention==
Attributing the invention of the light bulb to Edison, whilst generally accepted, might not be historically correct? Also I wonder if a distinction should be made between ordinary light bulbs and the energy saving alternatives?
:*Fixed the invention section.
:*The scope of this item needs to be clarified. Is it strictly about the incandescent light bulb, or about electrical lighting in general. So far it seems to be the former, but the existence of other types of lightbulbs should at least be acknowledged. If the latter, then it should probably contain not just compact fluorescent lights, but also LEDs, halogen lights, etc. [[User:Cmadler|Cmadler]] 20:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

== City at night ==

Minor point, but all the office lights in the image of London at night would be fluorescent tubes (and some compact fluoro's) not incandescent bulbs. Offices have used fluorescent lighting for some time now, due to their greater energy efficiency. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:22, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

:True. The flood lights along the waterfront and on the outside of the building are probably incandescent though as well as the street lamps and the exterior lights on the ship. There's some neon in there as well. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:57, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

::Well, actually the street lamps would be gas-discharge (HID, sodium, or mercury vapour) - see [[w:Lamp (electrical component)]]. Some of the flood lighting may also be gas-discharge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Wikipedia:Arimaa|Arimaa]] is a two-player board game invented by Omar Syed, a computer engineer trained in artificial intelligence. Inspired by Garry Kasparov's defeat at the hands of the chess computer Deep Blue, Syed wanted to design a new game which would be difficult for computers to play well, but would have rules simple enough for his four-year-old son Aamir to understand. In fact, &quot;Arimaa&quot; is &quot;Aamir&quot; spelled backwards plus an initial &quot;a.&quot;  In 2002 Syed published the rules to Arimaa and announced a $10,000 prize, available through 2020, for the first computer program able to defeat a top-ranked human player in a match six games or longer.  The prize has [[Arimaa/Arimaa Challenge History | not yet been won]]. 

Arimaa was specifically designed so that it could be played using a chess set&amp;mdash;an 8×8 board is used, and each player has sixteen pieces, in a 1-1-2-2-2-8 distribution. It can also be played on-line at the [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/ arimaa.com gameroom].  In 2009, Z-Man Games began producing a commercial Arimaa set. Only one face-to-face [http://web.archive.org/20090220171726/web.mac.com/idahoev/iWeb/Site/Arimaa%20at%20Gateway2007.html tournament] has taken place, but about 900 games are played on-line every week.  Omar Syed hosts four events per year in the gameroom:

* The ''World Championship'' is a tournament for human players which typically runs from January to March. Jean Daligault of France was the Arimaa world champion five times, in 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013. On a scale of ratings comparable to [[Wikipedia:Elo_rating_system|Elo chess ratings]], Daligault is rated near 2400.

* The ''Computer Championship'' matches the top Arimaa bots in an elimination tournament. David Fotland's program ''Bomb'' placed first every year from 2004 to 2008. Jeff Bacher's ''Clueless'' prevailed in 2009, Mattias Hultgren's ''Marwin'' in 2010, and David Wu's ''Sharp'' in 2011; ''Marwin'' repeated in 2012; and Ricardo Barreira's ''Ziltoid'' won in 2013. 

* The ''Arimaa Challenge'' takes place following the Computer Championship.  The top two bots are for a time available to play. The bot with the better record against humans who have played two games against each moves on to face three ultimate human defenders, who have been selected beforehand and prohibited from playing in the initial round. If this bot can defeat all three human defenders, its developer wins the $10,000 prize.  So far, [[Arimaa/Arimaa Challenge History |humans have dominated]] every challenge match.

* The yearly ''Postal Mixer'' begins in April and ends around October.  The emphasis of this tournament is participation, rather than determining a champion.  The objective is to advance the frontiers of strategic knowledge, as well as to spread around existing knowledge by pairing people to a variety of opponents.

In addition to these events, the [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/mwiki/index.php/1st_Arimaa_Online_Festival 1st Arimaa Online Festival] has been organized for 11 September 2010. This event included Arimaa matches, a strategy workshop, and an interview with Omar Syed.

Omar Syed also holds a trademark on the name &quot;Arimaa&quot;.  Syed has released an experimental license called [http://www.arimaa.com/arimaa/license/current.txt &quot;The Arimaa Public License&quot;], with the declared intent to &quot;make Arimaa as much of a public domain game as possible while still protecting its commercial usage&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Understanding gameplay ==

Arimaa, like [[chess]], is played on an 8×8 square board.  The two players, Gold and Silver, control sixteen pieces each: one elephant ([[Image:Arimaa egb74.gif|26px|Elephant]]), one camel ([[Image:Arimaa mgb74.gif|26px|Camel]]), two horses ([[Image:Arimaa hgb74.gif|26px|Horse]]), two dogs ([[Image:Arimaa dgb74.gif|26px|Dog]]), two cats ([[Image:Arimaa cgb74.gif|26px|Cat]]), and eight rabbits ([[Image:Arimaa rgb74.gif|26px|Rabbit]]), in descending order of strength.  If Arimaa is played using a chess set, the pieces may be represented by the [[Chess/Playing_The_Game#King|king]], [[Chess/Playing_The_Game#Queen|queen]], [[Chess/Playing_The_Game#Knight|knights]], [[Chess/Playing_The_Game#Bishop|bishops]], [[Chess/Playing_The_Game#Rook|rooks]], and [[Chess/Playing_The_Game#Pawn|pawns]] respectively.  Unlike their chess counterparts, however, Arimaa pieces move only in [[Wikipedia:Cardinal direction|cardinal directions]], and must all step from square to square. The relative strength of each piece lies in its power to push, pull, or immobilize weaker enemy pieces.  Four squares of the game-board are distinguished as '''trap squares''', on which a piece can potentially be lost&amp;mdash;these are the squares designated as c3, f3, c6, and f6 when classified by rank and file.

The game begins with an empty board. Gold arranges his pieces on the first and second ranks, in whatever configuration he chooses&amp;mdash;Arimaa pieces do not have fixed starting positions. Silver then arranges his pieces on the seventh and eighth ranks.  The diagram at right shows opening setups which are fairly common. 

Once the pieces are on the board, Gold and Silver alternate turns, starting with Gold.  A turn consists of one to four steps&amp;mdash;each player is allowed four steps per turn and must take at least one, but can choose to pass on any of the rest. The steps of a turn can be distributed however the player chooses&amp;mdash;four different pieces can each take one step, one piece can take four steps, two pieces can each take two steps, etc.  A turn must make a net change to the position&amp;mdash;one may not, for example, simply take one step left and one step right with the same piece, effectively passing the turn.  A player who has ended two different turns on an identical position may not end another turn with that same position, no matter how far apart the turns are.  As a further safeguard against indefinite loops of pieces moving back and forth, rabbits are prohibited from retreating homeward. Elephants, camels, horses, dogs, and cats may each step left, right, forward, or backward; rabbits may only step left, right, or forward.   

The objective of the game is to move any rabbit of one's own color onto the home rank of the opponent.  Thus Gold wins by moving a gold rabbit to the eighth rank, and Silver wins by moving a silver rabbit to the first rank.  It is no easy task, however, to get a rabbit past an opposing army of stronger pieces&amp;mdash;a player must out-maneuver the other army while at the same time keeping all enemy rabbits at bay.  

The second diagram, portraying a position which could occur later in a game, helps illustrate the remaining rules of movement.

A friendly piece can ''pull'' or ''push'' a weaker enemy piece which is next to it, provided there is an empty square allowing for the necessary movement.  To pull, a piece steps onto an adjacent empty square and drags the weaker enemy piece onto the square from which it came.  The silver elephant on d5 could step to d4 (or c5 or e5, since the pulling piece and the pulled piece don't have to move in the same direction) and pull the gold horse from d6 to d5.  To push, the weaker enemy piece is moved onto an adjacent empty square, and the piece which pushed it moves onto the square it had occupied.  The gold elephant on d3 could push the silver rabbit on d2 to e2 and then occupy d2.  Note that the rabbit on d2 can't be pushed to d1, c2, or d3, because those squares are already occupied.  Remember also that a piece can only push or pull a ''weaker'' enemy piece&amp;mdash;for example, a dog may dislodge an enemy rabbit or cat, but not a dog, horse, camel, or elephant.  A push or pull uses two steps, since two pieces are moved. Although a rabbit may not retreat toward its home row, it can nonetheless be pushed or pulled in that direction. For example, the gold rabbit on g3 could not itself step back to g2, but the silver horse could take a step right and then pull it down.

A piece may not push and pull simultaneously&amp;mdash;for example, the gold elephant on d3 could not push the silver rabbit from d2 to e2 and at the same time pull the other silver rabbit from c3 to d3.  

A piece which is adjacent (in any cardinal direction) to a stronger enemy piece is ''frozen'', unless it is also adjacent to a friendly piece. A piece which is frozen may not be moved by its owner, but may still be pushed or pulled by the opponent.  The silver rabbit on a7 is frozen, but the one on d2 is able to move because it is next to another silver piece.  Similarly the gold rabbit on b7 is frozen, but the gold cat on c1 is not.  The dogs on a6 and b6 do not freeze each other, as they are of equal strength.  An elephant cannot be frozen ''per se'', just as it cannot be pushed or pulled since there is nothing stronger. However, if enough enemy pieces are utilized against it, an elephant can be '''blockaded''' so that it has nowhere to go&amp;mdash;this is possible because only one piece can be pushed at a time, regardless of relative strength.

A frozen piece can freeze another still weaker piece just as it would otherwise. The silver elephant on d5 freezes the gold horse on d6, which itself freezes the silver rabbit on e6.

A piece which enters a trap square is removed from the game unless there is a friendly piece adjacent to the square.  The silver elephant could capture the gold horse by pushing it from d6 to c6.  The silver rabbit on c3 is still alive because of the silver rabbit on c4 as well as the silver horse on c2&amp;mdash;however, if the silver pieces protecting the c3 trap were to leave their positions, either voluntarily or by being dislodged, the silver rabbit on c3 would be lost.

Note that a piece may voluntarily step into a trap square, even if it is lost thereby.  The second step of a pulling maneuver may be completed, even if the piece doing the pulling is captured on the first step.  For example, Silver to move could step the silver horse from f2 to f3, which would be suicide for the horse, and still pull the gold rabbit from f1 to f2 as part of the horse's move.

In the diagrammed position, if it were Gold's turn to move, Gold could win in three steps: The dog on a6 can push the enemy rabbit from a7 to a8, and when the dog is on a7, it unfreezes its own rabbit on b7, which can then step to b8 for the victory.

Note that an adjacent friendly piece does '''not''' protect against pulling or pushing. For example, on Silver's turn, its horse on c2 could push the gold cat from c1 to b1, or pull it to c2, even though the gold cat has a friendly piece next to it on d1.

Although most games conclude with a rabbit reaching goal, there are two other circumstances which can bring about an end.
* '''Complete immobilization'''. If upon his turn a player has no legal move available, that player loses.
* '''Loss of all rabbits'''. A player can win by capturing the last remaining enemy rabbit, even if he sacrifices his own last rabbit in the same turn.  

Finally, if an enemy piece dislodges a rabbit onto its goal line and dislodges it off within the same turn, the game continues.

== Setting up ==

As mentioned previously, Arimaa players decide how to arrange their pieces at the beginning of a game, with the only restriction being that they must be placed on the player's first two rows (i.e. the first and second ranks for Gold, and the seventh and eighth ranks for Silver.) The finer points of initial piece placement will be explored later, but for now you just want a setup that gives you flexibility and denies the opponent an easy attack plan. Most or all rabbits should start in the ''back'' row&amp;mdash;it might seem logical to put the rabbits closer to their goal, but you will not achieve a goal without first clearing a path for it, and the strong pieces must take the lead in accomplishing this. Strong pieces should not begin stuck behind weaker pieces, and rabbits should not begin exposed to enemy forces, which could quickly pull them up and capture them (remember that unlike other pieces, rabbits cannot retreat homeward.) At first, think of your rabbits as forming a final barrier against an enemy goal.

|Gold has used the 99of9 setup; Silver has switched the dogs and cats.
}}

The '''99of9''' setup is optimal for beginners.  In the diagram at right, Gold has chosen the ''classic'' 99of9 setup.  The elephant is placed in the center so that it can quickly attack any part of the board.  The camel is placed in the center as well, but for defensive purposes.  A centralized camel will make it harder for an enemy horse to attack on either wing.  Furthermore, a centralized camel can't be pinned against the edge of the board by the enemy elephant as the first stage in taking a [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Camel_Hostage | camel hostage]].

The gold horses are set to move up to b3 and g3, to assert control of the c3 and f3 traps. A rabbit is placed forward on each flank, because a2 and h2 are likely to be safer places for rabbits than the centralized d1 and e1 would be.

Beginning back and center, the gold dogs will soon move up. The gold cats will most likely remain behind the traps for a while, ensuring that Gold will not lose a camel, horse, or dog in his own home trap.  

Since Silver goes second, he can take Gold's setup into account when deciding on his own. At right, note that the silver elephant is not placed directly opposite the gold elephant.  If the elephants directly face each other to begin, Gold can put Silver in an awkward spot by advancing the gold elephant four squares to fence in the silver elephant. Silver has used a variation of the 99of9 setup, switching the dogs and cats. Gold has chosen &quot;cats behind the traps, dogs back&quot;, while Silver has used &quot;dogs behind the traps, cats back&quot;. The strategic difference is subtle. Silver's dogs are guarding his home traps, and thus are potentially vulnerable to capture themselves&amp;mdash;Silver stands to lose a dog in the opening if he's not careful. Silver is, however, compensated for this disadvantage in that his home traps are less vulnerable to takeover as long as they are guarded by multiple pieces, since the dogs could not be pushed aside by enemy dogs. Cats, however, are most commonly placed behind one's home traps, as most players prefer to have their dogs readily available for other purposes.

You may wonder why ''rabbits'' do not begin behind the home traps; while some players do in fact go this route, the downside is that a rabbit could be pushed or pulled into a protected trap and then wouldn't be able to step back, creating a mess for the home defender. Unless you are willing to quickly abandon a home trap, you need something stronger than a rabbit serving as its final defender. Typically, those who begin with rabbits behind their home traps are planning to play very aggressively, and thus don't mind losing control of their home territory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;PCI&quot; bus is the central communications bus in the Jeep Liberty.  The BCM, PCM, TCM, WCM, EVIC, dash cluster, and audio equipment use it to communicate with each other.  The bus is a superset of OBD-II and uses the J1850 VPW communication format.  It travels throughout the entire car and the OBD-II port taps directly into it.  The ELM327 chip from Elm Electronics should allow reading and writing to the bus via a serial port. One of the many available OBD-II interface tools could also be used.  The Liberty won't switch to the newer and faster CAN bus until it is federally required in 2008.

== 1. Build and successfully fly an airplane from a kit made of balsa wood and tissue paper, and rubber band or gas powered. ==

Many kits are available for building that will meet this requirement.

=== [http://www.sigmfg.com/ SIG Manufacturing] is a major supplier. ===

To help you navigate, SIG uses the following shorthand on their website.

F/F = Free flight   C/L = Control line  R/C = Remote control

BIY = Build it yourself  ARF = Almost ready to fly  RTF = Ready to Fly

Some possible models from SIG include:

==== [http://www.sigmfg.com/images/yy1SIGFF5.jpg AMA Cub] ====

This model has been also called &quot;Delta Dart&quot; and has been sold by SIG for beginner modelers since 1968. Designed by Frank Ehling, these can be built by even younger modelers with little or no experience. Rubber band powered, the wing covering paper is pre-printed with markings to show where to glue the wood pieces. Kit includes everything you need except some glue. Likely the most cost effective model for club purposes as well.

Ask your local hobby shop if they stock this model, or order from SIG.

==== [http://www.sigmfg.com/images/yy1SIGFF12.jpg Thermal Dart] ====

Basically a larger version of the AMA Cub.

As built by a Pathfinder.

[[Image:Sig 01 450.jpg]]

==== [http://www.sigmfg.com/images/yy1SIGFF15.jpg SIG Parasol] ====

Easy to build like a cub, this model looks a little more like a scale airplane.

==== [http://www.sigmfg.com/images/yy1SIGFF1.jpg SIG Cub] ====

This model is more challenging to build than the AMA Cub, or Thermal Dart. The wing includes airfoil shape, and dihedral angle for stability. This model would be better suited for either older modelers or modelers with some experience already. A nice rubber band powered free flight model.

=== [http://www.guillow.com/ Guillow's] is also a major supplier. ===

Some possible models from Guillow's include:

==== [http://www.guillow.com/kitimages/300/prod_det_4201.jpg Cadet] ====

A simple to build rubber band powered model.

==== [http://www.guillow.com/kitimages/300/prod_det_4301.jpg Cloud Buster] ====

Similar to the SIG Cub. This model has airfoil wing, and dihedral angle as well.

==== [http://www.guillow.com/kitimages/300/prod_det_4401.jpg Fly Boy] ====

This model involves more skill and work with its built up (3D) fuselage. Still a fairly simple model, this kit will involve a larger time commitment, and a bit more skill. An experienced modeler to help instruct would be an asset for this kit.

== 2. Build a balsa wood glider from a kit and observe its flying characteristics as related to variable positions of the wings. ==
=== [http://www.sigmfg.com/ SIG Manufacturing] is a major supplier. ===

See the shorthand help above to navigate their site.

A possible glider model from SIG is:

==== [http://www.sigmfg.com/images/yy1SIGFF14.jpg Flip] ====

This model is a nice free flight glider kit. It does not technically meet the needs of this requirement since the plans call for the wing to be in a fixed location. This does not allow the modeler to observe its flying characteristics as related to variable positions of the wings. With a bit of spare balsa and some simple modifications, this glider can be built with movable wings.

=== [http://www.guillow.com/ Guillow's] is also a major supplier. ===

Almost all of their toy balsa gliders would qualify for this requirement since they all have the ability to adjust the wings forward or back. Some possible models include:

==== [http://www.guillow.com/kitimages/300/prod_det_26.jpg Eagle] ====

Very basic balsa glider.

==== [http://www.guillow.com/kitimages/300/prod_det_30.jpg Jetfire] ====

Similar to Eagle, with a wider wingspan and dihedral angle.

=== Do It Yourself &quot;Penny Glider&quot; plans. ===

Due to an ordering mix-up with our glider kit supplier, our club was forced to get creative to meet the glider requirement in this Airplane Modeling honor. The end result was that I designed a glider that could be made from stock pieces of balsa. The glider flew well for the students who made them, and the plans made for very cost effective kits. I found the most efficient way to use balsa sheets is to make 12 glider kits. I am publishing the plans here in the hope that other youth groups can make good use of them.

==== Stock pieces required. ====

One set of the following pieces will create twelve glider kits.

* (3) 3&quot; X 36&quot; X 1/16&quot; sheet
* (4) 1/8&quot; X 3/8&quot; X 36&quot;
* (1) 1/8&quot; X 1/8&quot; X 36&quot;

==== Other required supplies. ====

Wood glue / Hobby knifes

Ruler (Metal is best)

Water based sanding sealer - (I used Varathane Crystal Clear Waterborne thinned 50% with water)

150 grit sandpaper

Pencil / Hobby paint brushes

12 Pennies

Hot glue gun and glue

One copy of plan page printed for each student.

[[Image:Glider Stock.jpg]]

==== Make the kits in advance ====

Cut the pieces from the stock to the sizes shown in the plan. Use a hobby knife and steel ruler.

Fuselage - Cut the ⅛” x ⅜” stock into 12” long sections to make 12 fuselages.

Wings - Cut 6 pieces 11” x 1½” from 2 of the 1/16” sheets to make 12 wings. 

Wing Mounts - Cut ⅛” x ⅛” stock into 12 - 2½ ” sections. 

Wing Mounts – Cut 24 - ¼” x 2½ ” parts for wing mounts from 1/16&quot; sheet balsa.

Horizontal Stabilizer – Cut 12 - 3½” x 3/4” horizontal stabilizers from 1/16&quot; sheet balsa.

Vertical Stabilizer - Cut 12 - 1½” x 1” vertical stabilizers from 1/16&quot; sheet balsa.

(ensure grain runs the long direction on all 1/16&quot; sheet balsa pieces)

Optionally cut the tapered notches in the fuselage for the horizontal stabilizer, or leave this step for the students depending on level of students ability with hobby knifes.

[[Image:Glider kits.jpg]]

Each kit will contain one wing, one fuselage, one horizontal stabilizer, one vertical stabilizer, and the wing mounting pieces. One single kit is pictured below.

[[Image:Glider kit.jpg]]

==== Have the students follow steps 1 through 8 to build the kits. ====

Instructions:

# Cut out all pieces.
# Seal and sand all pieces
# Assemble wing mount
# Glue wing to mount
# Mount stabilizers
# Use elastics to mount wing on fuselage
# Add penny to nose for weight, (use hot glue) and adjust wings front to back for best flight.
# Add cardstock ailerons, rudder, and elevators if wanted.

== 3. Make and successfully fly two different styles of paper airplanes using sheets of paper between eight (20.3 cm) and fourteen (35.6 cm) inches in width and length. ==

[http://fatlion.com/science/paperairplanes.html Paper Plane] with airfoil wings is a fun paper airplane to build. It requires more than simply folding a piece of paper up, and can be used to teach the concept of Bernoulli's Principle.

[http://www.dacbsa.org/Resources-DACWorkshop/Resources-Space.htm Boy Scout Paper Plane plans] include many creative and fun paper airplane plans.

== 4. Define, locate, and explain the usage of the following basic items: ==

* Fuselage
* Wing
* Aileron
* Rudder
* Horizontal stabilizer
* Strut
* Cockpit 
* Engine
* Landing Gear
* Propeller

;Fuselage: The elongated body or frame of an airplane, any kind of frame or body. The central body of an airplane that is designed to accommodate the crew and passengers (or cargo). 

;Wing: Any surface used primarily for supporting an airplane inflight by forward motion. 

;Aileron: Ailerons are movable control surfaces that are present on the trailing edge of both the right and left wings of a plane.  Each surface moves in opposite directions enabling a plane to roll right or left. For a plane to roll to the left, the left wing aileron moves upwards while the aileron on the right wing moves downwards.

;Rudder: This is the term used to describe the part of the tail that moves back and forth. This movement causes the tail of a plane to move which then turns the plane.

;Horizontal stabilizer: The horizontal &quot;mini wing&quot; at the tail section of the airplane. The elevator is attached to the horizontal stabilizer with hinges.

;Strut: A diagonal brace going from the fuselage to the bottom of the wing consisting of a bar or rod used to support the wing on the airplane.

;Cockpit: Compartment where the pilot sits while flying the aircraft.

;Engine: The source of power to turn the propeller or turbines and generate thrust. Can be an internal combustion engine, jet engine, or in the case of an airplane model a rubber band engine.

;Landing gear: An undercarriage that supports the weight of the plane when it is on the ground.

;Propeller: The mechanical device attached to the engine that rotates to push against air and create thrust.

;Dihedral: Dihedral is where the right and left wing tips are higher than the fuselage. More dihedral generally means that a plane will be more stable in the air, but will be more difficult to turn. Most planes require a bit of dihedral to fly well.

;Elevator: Elevator is the term used to describe a plane's horizontal control surface on the tail. This surface enables a plane to pitch upwards or downwards. When an elevator surface moves upwards, the tail moves downwards (the nose of the plane then points up) and vice-versa. Without an elevator, it is hard to control the altitude of a plane as you can't control the rise and fall of the nose of the plane. 

;Thrust: The mechanical force generated by the engine to move the airplane through the air.

;Vertical stabilizer: The vertical fin which is part of the tail assembly of the airplane. The rudder is attached to the vertical stabilizer with a hinge.

; V-Tail: V-Tail aircraft are planes that have only 2 stabilization surfaces (in the shape of a V) instead of a conventional horizontal and vertical stabilizers. In a V-Tail aircraft, the 2 control surfaces of the V-Tail work together to give elevator and rudder responses.

}}

== Overview ==

The '''''Fidelius''''' charm is &quot;an immensely complex spell&quot; that conceals a secret within a living soul -- the &quot;secret-keeper&quot;.  It is coined from the Latin '[[wikt:fides|fides]]' -- faith. It is first described in detail in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], and is also mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Fidelius charm is a very powerful protection for information; having locked the secret into a soul, even direct inspection of the secret will not, apparently, reveal it. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], in the description of the spell, says &quot;As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting-room window!&quot; ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]] had gone into hiding at that point because they had information that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] was specifically seeking them.) The conclusion reached at that time, correctly, is that the Secret-Keeper must have voluntarily divulged the secret to Voldemort.

The location of the headquarters of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]], also, is protected by the Fidelius charm; in this case, the Secret-Keeper is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]. At this stage in the story, Dumbledore is not willing to talk directly to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], but he is able to convey the information about where the Order is located to Harry, by means of writing. Having shown him the note, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] cautions him about reading it out loud or repeating it; one has to wonder why, because the Fidelius spell blocks anyone but the Secret-Keeper from revealing the secret... so presumably Harry would have been somehow blocked from speaking the contents of that note.

# What would have happened had Harry tried to read the note about the location of the Order out loud?

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_poll.cfm J. K. Rowling had implied] that when a Secret-Keeper dies, the ability to divulge the secret dies with him. The Fidelius Charm prevents anyone except the secret-keeper from revealing the secret; the people to whom he releases the secret are privy to it, of course, but cannot tell anyone else. At the death of a Secret-Keeper, then, everyone who knew the secret would retain that knowledge; but, the implication was, as before they could not pass it on, so the secret would go no further.

If that were the case, it could prove difficult to move the headquarters of the Order after Dumbledore's death. The secret that Dumbledore is protecting is the location of the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix; if the ability to pass on that secret died with the secret holder, it would not be possible to tell anyone, even holders of the current secret, where the new Headquarters were. If the Order were to disband, presumably that would make the secret moot and break the charm, but that is not likely to happen until some time after Voldemort's final defeat.

Additionally, it would cause some problems for Harry in book 7. It is his stated intention to visit his parents' house in the village of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]]; but as the secret-keeper, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], is apparently still keeping the secret, it may prove difficult for him to find it. In fact, it did not seem to be too difficult for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] to find it immediately after the incident; while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] was also present at the time, he almost certainly had been told the secret by Pettigrew earlier.

There is a great deal of discussion on various fan sites about the &quot;missing day&quot;; Voldemort had been dead for a full day before Hagrid appeared at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] with Harry. It is believed by many fans that the occurrences during that day would be important, possibly even pivotal, to events in the seventh book. It is entirely possible that, if the Fidelius spell was still active, Hagrid would have been unable to find the place until one of the parties to the secret was there. We can safely assume that Sirius, as one of the Marauders, would have been aware of the Potters' location; in fact, he does say, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], that he had seen &quot;the bodies and the destruction&quot; of the house, so he must have known the secret, either before the Fidelius charm was performed, or by Peter informing him of it afterwards. If the Fidelius charm was still active, Hagrid would have been unable to enter the remains of the house to recover Harry until Sirius appeared on the scene; and it would have been Sirius who actually removed Harry from the wreckage and passed him to Hagrid to carry back to Little Whinging. Against this, of course, is Hagrid's statement that he carried little Harry out of the wrecked house himself, which would strongly imply either that Hagrid had been informed of the secret, or that the Fidelius charm's effect ended with the deaths of the Potters.

It turns out, however, that the author's statement is at the very least misleading. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] explains that with the death of Dumbledore, everyone who had been party to the secret before is now a Secret-Keeper for the secret themselves. As a result, when Hermione accidentally [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Side-Along-Apparates]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]] (a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]]) to the front step of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], she assumes that she has revealed the secret to him.

The Fidelius spell is one of several that seem to have their effects altered at the whim of the author in the course of the story arc. Firstly, of course, there is the question of what happens to the secret when the Secret-Keeper dies; what was written on the author's web site, and what actually happened, were subtly different, as mentioned above. It seems the author changed the behavior, to make all secret-holders become secret keepers, as it seemed necessary in order to force Harry, Ron, and Hermione out of Grimmauld Place. Further, and again in the final book, Harry, with assistance from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], escapes to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], a safe house that is protected, we are told, by the Fidelius charm. Yet Harry, despite not having been told its location by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]], the secret-keeper, is able to see the cottage immediately upon arriving. Granted, we are told that Dobby is able to take people to Shell Cottage earlier, though it is unlikely he would have been granted access to that secret by Bill Weasley; it is possible that Dobby's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]] magic would give Dobby the ability to bypass the Fidelius charm, but that would not extend to Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]], all of whom accompany Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] to Shell Cottage on that occasion, and none of whom have had occasion to be let into the secret by Bill Weasley.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I found the onigiri sold in Lawson's and Family Mart to be pretty damn good, altho perhaps a little pricey. Still, a great value, tasty, filling, and oishi

I removed the line '(I prefer it soggy, actually)' as it doesn't add anything to the recipe or article.

It would be great if the article would have a difficulty rating

I'm going to make this in a bit. I've had to cross reference a bunch of different recipes. If what I had works, I'll add some information to this Article. (In addition to a Difficulty rating)
--[[User:71.36.17.26|71.36.17.26]] 18:14, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

Please to be add more fillings thx. It would be great if this dish got into the American/European mainstream. Some American-style fillings could be good, especially for people who don't like fish, but I'm drawing a blank right now. Also, the Wikipedia article describes grilled / fried onigiri, which sound tasty. Anyone know how to make this?

While it is true that every jurisdiction in Canada requires some form of an &quot;originating notice,&quot; it is not always referred to as such.  For instance in Ontario it is called an &quot;originating process&quot; (Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure, at Rule 14).  Some discussion of the differences in names and requirements may be useful as the page develops.

      <comment>/* False Protection */ &quot;Push&quot; is misleading here since it's Gold's own piece</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the majority of Arimaa positions, the side to move will not be able to directly force a goal or capture.  Nevertheless, Arimaa is a highly tactical game.  If both players are armed with a knowledge of [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy | basic strategy]], then advantage accrues to the player who can execute better on those ideas.  Knowing that an [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Blockade | elephant blockade]], [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Camel_Hostage | camel hostage]], or [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Mobility#Frames | horse frame]] is strategically valuable is only half the battle: one must also know how to bring about such advantages against intelligent opposition.

|Silver threatens to capture the g5 gold horse.
}}
===False Protection===
In the position shown here&lt;!-- to the right --&gt;, from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=38937&amp;s=w this game], no pieces have yet been exchanged, but Gold is apparently in great trouble.  The gold horse on g5 is threatened with capture in f6.  The g3-dog could unfreeze the threatened horse, but this would only allow it to advance further into danger.

The gold elephant could, in two steps, occupy e6, which would make f6 safe from capture, but then the gold camel would be threatened in c6.  The gold camel is frozen, and it needs three steps to retreat.  Either the b4-rabbit can advance, allowing the camel to push back to c4, or the d4 cat can push away the c4-rabbit, allowing the camel to step to b5.  Unfortunately, neither of these camel-rescue maneuvers leaves the requisite two steps for the gold elephant to protect f6.

The gold elephant could ''temporarily'' protect both c6 and f6 by pushing the silver dog on e6 into f6, and then return to d6 with a step to spare.  However, that would waste three steps doing what could be undone by Silver in one step, allowing him three steps to consolidate/improve his position.  One can prove that this delaying move does no good for Gold by analyzing in detail each of his possible fourth steps, and considering of Silver's replies.  In a live game with limited time, however, it is best to assume that trading three steps for one step will make one's position worse.  That assumption would be borne out in this case.

It remains to consider charging forward with the camel to set up a threat to balance Silver's threat.  Gold could advance the b4-rabbit, then advance the camel and push away the silver cat on c7.  Silver then couldn't take the g5 horse without losing the b6 horse and allowing a thunderous attack in the west.  This attack by Gold looks promising, but it opens a fatal weakness.  Silver could simply slide his elephant to c5 and advance his newly-liberated c4-rabbit to b2, through the now unoccupied b4.  Gold would then be unable to save goal, his camel, and his horse all at once.

In short, it appears that no move will stave off material loss for Gold, and some attempts to do so will only make matters worse.  It seems that capturing the c4 rabbit in exchange for the g5 horse is the best Gold can do.

Remarkably, Gold has a tactical save that relies on the elephant to protect neither c6 nor f6.  Gold can advance his elephant to d7, capture the c4-rabbit with his cat, and slide the unfrozen camel to b5.  This exposes a subtle weakness in the Silver position: the false protection of the b6-horse and c7-cat.  If Silver were to then capture the threatened gold horse in f6, Gold could respond by capturing the b6-horse in c6.

The difference between finding this tactic and missing it is an entire horse.  Instead of losing a horse for a rabbit, Gold has gotten a rabbit for free.

===Elephant Blockade===
In the position at right, from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=21996&amp;s=w this game], the gold elephant is in great danger of [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Blockade | blockade]] on the seventh rank.  Silver to move can't prevent the gold elephant from moving away from e7, but most of the walls of a larger box are already in place.  If Silver can cut off all avenues of retreat, then the noose can be drawn tight around the gold elephant in later moves.

One brick in the wall is the f6 trap square.  With no supporting gold pieces, the gold elephant can't pass through f6.  The e6 square can be sealed in two steps by the silver elephant.  The g6 square is blocked by the T-shaped configuration of four silver pieces on f6, g6, h6, and g5.  A second T-shape (d8, d7, d6, c7) can block access to d7 if Silver uses one step to put his c6 rabbit onto d6.  Therefore, with a total of three steps (elephant to e6 and rabbit to d6), Silver can create a nearly complete box.

The tricky tactical issue is the use of Silver's fourth step.  If Silver attempts a blockade, Gold retains two resources: the gold elephant can still threaten an end-around to push out through h6, and the gold horse on g3 can pull the g5 dog out of the blockade.  In combination these threats pose a serious puzzle for Silver to solve, but they are not necessarily enough.

For example, if the gold elephant moved directly to h7, Silver could slide his dog to h5, horse to g7, f8-rabbit to g8, and f6-cat to f7.  True, the gold horse could then pull away the silver dog from h5, but Silver could re-establish the blockade with camel to h5 and elephant to g6.  Such a perfect blockade is easily worth a dog sacrifice.

It is tempting for Silver to use the fourth step to advance his f8-rabbit to f7.  We know already that the gold elephant can't simply push across to h7.  But consider what happens if instead Gold pushes the rabbit back to f8, stations his elephant on g7, and advances his horse to g4.  Gold now threatens to pull the dog and push the camel, creating a path to freedom.  Silver has many ingenious attempts to maintain the blockade, but none of them quite work.  For example, Silver might try putting his dog on h5 and using the camel to pull the horse to g5, so the gold horse actually becomes part of the blockade!  This fails, however, as the Gold elephant can move to h7, pulling the silver camel along to g7, then push the h6-rabbit to g6 as the elephant escapes through the h-file.

It turns out that preventing this latter maneuver is precisely the key to sealing the blockade.  If Silver uses the fourth step to advance a rabbit to h7 (instead of f7), Gold cannot escape unscathed.  Gold's previous escape plan now only has three useful steps: elephant to g7 and horse to g4.  Let's suppose rabbit to g2 is the fourth step, in order to unfreeze the gold horse in some lines.  (to be continued...)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Does the title &quot;old testament commentaries&quot; imply that this wiki-book is intended to be from a Christian viewpoint?

== [[WB:NPOV|NPOV issues]] ==

This book appears to be of non-secular character and of little academic use. I am of the opinion that Wikibooks should not be used to churn out evangelical material-&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ravichandar84|My coffee shop]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 10:47, 10 October 2008 (UTC)


Nothing in the Wikibooks NPOV policy excludes books of religious character. The Bible has profoundly influenced Western culture in secular as well as religious ways. To be entirely ignorant of the Bible is to fail to understand modern and postmodern Western culture. Nothing limits those who may comment on a biblical subject to an Evangelical perspective. Unbelievers are as free to contribute as believers. Bible classes are taught in many state universities from an avowedly neutral, even antagonistic stance, sometimes by faculty members who profess no religous faith themselves. Thus, there is no sound reason why this book should not have a place among the Wiki collection. [gllyons 5 January 2009]


== No ==

Biblical studies is a distinct discipline from Christian theology.  Biblical studies should have a focus on the history of the bible and its historical context and interpretations while Christian theology should approach it from the point of view of a believer.  Keep the two separate.

== Issues with this Wikibook ==
As previous posts indicate there is a problem with this Wikibook title and intended scope and what contributors have been adding to the work.
I've attempted to clarify the scope and put the title in context with that. I have also been reviewing edits and have noticed that there is a lack of understanding on the basic evolution of the biblical texts and the history behind them, I've attempted to create a structure that could help willing people to fix that problem and help put the rest of the Wikibook in shape to the evolution of the source texts.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:10, 12 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

==Goal: Excellent Writing Style==
One of the challenges we face in making this textbook is creating chapters that flow logically from one to another and that maintain a consistent format and style throughout. We can begin by making sure our individual chapters are as well-written as possible. This is not an English class, but we are all using writing as a teaching and learning tool and will gain more from this process if we pay attention to the quality of our writing. To guide us in this process, here are descriptions of &lt;i&gt;outstanding&lt;/i&gt; writing and &lt;i&gt;weak&lt;/i&gt; writing, from my colleague N. Straight, who teaches in the English department.

====Outstanding====
:The essay will be thoughtfully structured with logical and coherent organization, have an excellent beginning and ending, and earn its conclusions. [. . .] There will be smooth transitions, varied and forceful sentences, fresh diction, compelling voice, and an appropriate tone.  The reader will respond by thinking seriously and critically about the arguments.

====Weak====
:The writing is unfocused, and the thesis is too general, vague, or confusing.  Weak writing often begins with a thesis that is a topic rather than an argument.  The argument may be incomplete or superficial, with flawed reasoning and insufficient supporting detail.  There may be areas where the writer supplies inappropriate or extraneous information.  The writer does not really have a point to make, or the essay merely exploits the obvious.  This writing may be largely summary or description rather than argumentation.  There are major errors in mechanics, usage, logic, or sentence structure that interfere with the communication of the argument.

== Templates for use: A note from Whiteknight ==
Your [[Human Physiology]] book looks fantastic! I am very impressed with all the work that is being put into it. Because all your students are getting more advanced with editing here, I wanted to point out some useful templates that Wikibooks provides for working with text:

{{warning|This is a warning box. you can create one by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{warning|YOUR TEXT}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This is useful for pointing out dangers.}}

{{info|This is an info box. You can create one by typeing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{info|YOUR TEXT}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. These are useful for pointing out additional information, or calling attention to a particular fact.}}

{{SideBox|float=left|This is a floating box on the left.}}

Also, you can create floating text boxes on the left or the right side of the page. The text from your page will automatically wrap around this floating boxes. To create a floating box on the left, use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SideBox|float=left|YOUR TEXT}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{{-}}

{{SideBox|This is a floating box on the right}}

However, if you want to create a box on the right, you can use the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SideBox|YOUR TEXT}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to put it on the right. Inside a floating box, you can use formatting like normal. Here is a good example:

{{-}}

==Sections to Include in Each Chapter==
{{SideBox|float=left|When Kevin was 14 years old he started having &quot;stomach pains&quot; a week after returning from a family vacation to Disney World. After three days the pain was intense and he went to bed early. The next morning when he awoke, he realized immediately that the pain in his lower right abdomen was even worse than when he went to bed the night before. Now the pain was accompanied by nausea and fever. He went to the kitchen and tried drinking a little juice, but promptly vomited. A few minutes later an excruciating wave of pain shot through his abdomen. He let out a scream, fell to the ground, and passed out. When he awoke his mother was standing over him and said, &quot;okay, you can miss school &lt;u&gt;today&lt;/u&gt;, but that's it!&quot; What do you think may be causing Kevin's pain? Should his mother take him to a doctor? A hospital? Or just send him to bed?}}

&lt;i&gt;The &lt;u&gt;true&lt;/u&gt; story (about me!) in the sidebox is to remind you to make a little case study at the start of your chapter to draw your reader in.&lt;/i&gt; We want our chapters to be so compelling that readers will be anxious to read more. We want our chapters to be so well-organized and well-written that readers will easily gain new understandings about how the body functions. We want them to see new connections between body systems and be in awe of the millions of chemical reactions that are continuously happening within their cells to keep them alive. &lt;i&gt;~Kevin&lt;/u&gt;

===Overview===
A single paragraph that describes your system in a nutshell, and perhaps highlights some key physiological processes that will be introduced

===Headings and subheadings for your content===
Note that this is a subheading. Headings have two = signs on each side and show up as a distinct section with a line beneath.

===Review Questions===
We will have an appendix to enter your answers to review questions. Should we do open-ended questions? I think that would be easier than multiple-choice. 

===Glossary or Key Terms===
What do you think we should call this section? Where should we put it? I prefer it at the end of the chapter so it is out of the way but easily found if you need it, but others might feel it is best at the beginning of the chapter so you can have an overview of the vocabulary before you dive into the content.

Formatting for the glossary should be &lt;u&gt;consistent&lt;/u&gt; between chapters (hit &quot;edit&quot; to see code)
;human physiology :study of the functions and processes of the human body
;''Phrynosoma'' :The genus of a group of 14 species of horned lizards, commonly referred to as &quot;horny toads&quot;

==References==
I want you to reference quotes or ideas with footnotes and and references. Hit &quot;edit&quot; to see the code for formatting. First put in a reference in the form:

&quot;This lizard eats ants!&quot;{{ref|Young2006}}

That makes a superscript number that your readers can click on. Then at the end of your file put in the note:
:If you have a long block of text that you are quoting (try to avoid this, but sometimes it is useful), then you don't put quotation marks but instead indent the entire quote by putting a colon directly in front of it.

Footnotes could be a separate subheading under References. Maybe put books under the &quot;References&quot; section, Footnotes here, and then external links below. In writing footnotes, remember the pound sign (#) to make the matching number appear.

===Footnotes===
# {{note|Young2006}} Young, K.V., &quot;Food Habits of Ant-Eating Lizards&quot; &lt;i&gt;Journal of Very Specialized Research&lt;/i&gt;, 2006.

      <comment>colourist's-&gt;colourists, as plural</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Colour grading is the process of manipulating each shot in a film in order to achieve a certain 'look'. The producer/director will require that the whole movie has the same range of colour saturation, contrast, highlights and shadows. The colour treatment is very important in conveying an emotional context that is consistent with and complements the action, sound design and musical treatment of the movie. Simple, but extreme examples are Bollywood extravaganzas that use strong lighting and clear saturated colors to complement a simple story. In contrast, art movies may use low contrast lighting, a palette of soft colours and subtle tones to convey a subtle nuanced story. The Lighting Cameraman or Director of Photography will be shooting to create the desired look, but colour grading is always necessary to fine tune the raw footage.

The job of colour grading is usually done by the editor, in lower budget work, or in higher budget productions the task falls to a specialist referred to as the ''colourist''. Professional colourists can use sophisticated digital finishing units such as the [http://www.davsys.com/ Davinci 2k] system.  

Grading normally starts with analysis and colour correction of each shot to fix problems such as unwanted colour casts. Next, the colourist can use a myriad of techniques to colour the scene to reflect the artistic preference of the producer/director (for example, reducing saturation can give the scene a bleak look). Once a look is decided upon the grading process for the rest of that scene (or even the whole film) is generally routine, as the colourist aims to provide consistency between shots.

There are many tips and tricks you can learn in Python:

==Strings==
* Triple quotes are an easy way to define a string with both single and double quotes.
* String concatenation is ''expensive''.  Use percent formatting and str.join() for concatenation:
(but don't worry about this unless your resulting string is more than 500-1000 characters long)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.pycs.net/users/0000323/weblog/2004/08/27.html
 | title = 'concat vs join - followup' on 'Python Rocks! and other rants 27.8.2004 Weblog of Kent S Johnson'
 | date = August 27, 2004
 | accessdate = 2008-08-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Spam&quot; + &quot; eggs&quot; + &quot; and&quot; + &quot; spam&quot;               # DON'T DO THIS
print &quot; &quot;.join([&quot;Spam&quot;,&quot;eggs&quot;,&quot;and&quot;,&quot;spam&quot;])            # Much faster/more
                                                        # common Python idiom
print &quot;%s %s %s %s&quot; % (&quot;Spam&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;)   # Also a pythonic way of
                                                        # doing it - very fast
&lt;/source&gt;

==Optimized C modules==
Several modules have optimized versions written in C, which provide an almost-identical interface and are frequently ''much'' faster or more memory-efficient than the pure Python implementations. Module behavior generally does differ in some respects, often minor, and thus C versions are frequently used.

This is primarily a Python 2.x feature, which has been largely removed in Python 3, with modules automatically using optimized implementations if available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html What’s New In Python 3.0], Guido van Rossum&lt;/ref&gt; However, the &lt;code&gt;cProfile&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;profile&lt;/code&gt; pair still exists (as of Python 3.4).

===importing===
The C version of a module named &lt;code&gt;module&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Module&lt;/code&gt; is called &lt;code&gt;cModule&lt;/code&gt;, and frequently imported using &lt;code&gt;import...as&lt;/code&gt; to strip off the prefix, as:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import cPickle as pickle
&lt;/source&gt;
For compatibility, one can try to import the C version and fall back to the Python version if the C version is not available; in this case using &lt;code&gt;import...as&lt;/code&gt; is ''required,'' so the code does not depend on which module was imported:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
try:
  import cPickle as pickle
except ImportError:
  import pickle
&lt;/source&gt;

===Examples===
Notable examples include:
* (Python 2.x) &lt;code&gt;cPickle&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;pickle&lt;/code&gt;, up to 1000× faster.
* (Python 2.x) &lt;code&gt;[https://docs.python.org/2/library/stringio.html#module-cStringIO cStringIO]&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;[https://docs.python.org/2/library/stringio.html StringIO]&lt;/code&gt;, replaced by &lt;code&gt;[https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html?highlight=stringio#io.StringIO io.StringIO]&lt;/code&gt; in Python 3
* &lt;code&gt;[https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile cProfile]&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;[https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-profile profile]&lt;/code&gt; – the Python &lt;code&gt;profile&lt;/code&gt; adds significant overhead, and thus &lt;code&gt;cProfile&lt;/code&gt; is recommended for most use.
* (not needed in Python 3.3+) &lt;code&gt;cElementTree&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;[https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html ElementTree]&lt;/code&gt;, 15–20 times faster and uses 2–5 times less memory;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://effbot.org/zone/celementtree.htm The cElementTree Module]&quot;, January 30, 2005, Fredrik Lundh&lt;/ref&gt; not needed in Python 3.3+, which automatically uses a fast implementation if possible.

== List comprehension and generators==
* List comprehension and generator expressions are very useful for working with small, compact loops. Additionally, it is faster than a normal for-loop.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
directory = os.listdir(os.getcwd())       # Gets a list of files in the
                                          # directory the program runs from
filesInDir = [item for item in directory] # Normal For Loop rules apply, you
                                          # can add &quot;if condition&quot; to make a
                                          # more narrow search.
&lt;/source&gt;
* List comprehension and generator expression can be used to work with two (or more) lists with zip or itertools.izip
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
[a - b for (a,b) in zip((1,2,3), (1,2,3))]  # will return [0, 0, 0]
&lt;/source&gt;

==Data type choice==
Choosing the correct data type can be critical to the performance of an application. For example, say you have 2 lists:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
list1 = [{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'c': 3, 'd': 4}, {'e': 5, 'f': 6}]
list2 = [{'e': 5, 'f': 6}, {'g': 7, 'h': 8}, {'i': 9, 'j': 10}]
&lt;/source&gt;
and you want to find the entries common to both lists. You could iterate over one list, checking for common items in the other:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
common = []
for entry in list1:
    if entry in list2:
        common.append(entry)
&lt;/source&gt;
For such small lists, this will work fine, but for larger lists, for example if each contains thousands of entries, the following will be more efficient, and produces the same result:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
set1 = set([tuple(entry.items()) for entry in list1])
set2 = set([tuple(entry.items()) for entry in list2])
common = set1.intersection(set2)
common = [dict(entry) for entry in common]
&lt;/source&gt;
Sets are optimized for speed in such functions. Dictionaries themselves cannot be used as members of a set as they are mutable, but tuples can. If one needs to do set operations on a list of dictionaries, one can convert the items to tuples and the list to a set, perform the operation, then convert back. This is often much faster than trying to replicate set operations using string functions.

==Other==
* Decorators can be used for handling common concerns like logging, db access, etc.
* While Python has no built-in function to flatten a list you can use a recursive function to do the job quickly.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def flatten(seq, list = None):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;flatten(seq, list = None) -&gt; list

    Return a flat version of the iterator `seq` appended to `list`
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    if list == None:
        list = []
    try:                          # Can `seq` be iterated over?
        for item in seq:          # If so then iterate over `seq`
            flatten(item, list)      # and make the same check on each item.
    except TypeError:             # If seq isn't iterable
        list.append(seq)             # append it to the new list.
    return list
&lt;/source&gt;
* To stop a Python script from closing right after you launch one independently, add this code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 'Hit Enter to exit'
raw_input()
&lt;/source&gt;
* Python already has a GUI built in: Tkinter, based on Tcl's Tk. More are available, such as PyQt4 and pygtk3.

*Ternary Operators:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]

x, y = 50, 25

small = x if x &lt; y else y

&lt;/source&gt;

*Booleans as indexes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
b = 1==1
name = &quot;I am %s&quot; % [&quot;John&quot;,&quot;Doe&quot;][b]
#returns I am Doe
&lt;/source&gt;

DakeDesu:

You should probably set aside a section _-here-_ for getty, or atleast setting up getty for use with xdm, gdm or kdm. Also it is a little unfair that xdm gets mentioned and gdm + kdm do not get mentioned. Yeah, I know they probably have their own subsection in various GNOME and KDE books, but looking at other software on here, I am not sure how many systems have both XFree86 and X.org setup at the same time.

Xhost is also very important. Why not include it?</text>

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

==Merge proposal==

I've proposed that suggested that {{bad link|Category:English}} be merged into [[:Category:English language]]. They seem to describe mostly the same thing. I favor '''English language''' as it's clearer. 

Note that appropriate articles in {{bad link|Category:English}} will have to be edited individually to move to this category. If that category page is then empty, it should be either deleted, or if we're worried about people linking to it when they create pages, it could be made the parent category of [[:Category:English language]] and [[:Category:English literature]]; it should then be checked regularly and articles recategorized as appropriate.   

Arguably there should be other categories - [[:Category:English as an additional language]] as a subcat of this one, though it may be hard to decide which category some pages belong in, which are suitable for younger native speakers and also for speakers of other languages. 

[[:Category:English literature]] might be needed, and should be referenced from here in a top dab (disambiguation) for people who've come to the wrong place. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 08:47, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

: The standard convention is to name a book's category after its title. I think {{bad link|Category:English}} should be used for the [[English]] book and the other English books ([[English as an Additional Language]], [[Business English]]) should either go here or into their own categories. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 03:50, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

::Ah, thanks for the explanation. In that case, I s'pose [[:Category:English as an Additional Language]] is the way to go - and there's no ambiguity. It can still be made a subcategory of {{bad link|Category:English}}, or linked from that category page - I don't see any reason against it, and it could help people find the right page. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 10:57, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;width:60%; float:right; border:1px solid #000000; padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome!&lt;/b&gt;  This book began as a class project in July 2006 with a small class of pre-nursing students. We knew nothing about how to create or edit a Wikibook, but we decided to do it anyway. We received a lot of help from the active Wikibooks community, and through the chaos a book emerged! I didn't teach physiology again until spring 2007, when we used this book as our textbook and improved upon it chapter by chapter. We are happy with our accomplishments, but the book could still be much improved. We need YOUR help to make this the &lt;u&gt;best introductory physiology textbook&lt;/u&gt; available, not simply the best &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; physiology textbook. No other classrooms have adopted this book or used it significantly as far as I know. If you ''do'' use it or are ''considering'' using it, please [[User:Provophys|send me a message]], and we can discuss future directions for the book. Of course, even the casual reader should take the liberty of editing ''boldly and bravely''. Here is a list of suggested [[Human Physiology/Wish List|ways to contribute]] if you are looking for a place to start. If you are new to editing Wikis, then please register on Wikibooks, and read through [[Help:Editing|this editing help page]].&lt;/div&gt;

Here is a list of additional, special pages, that are used in this book, but which don't appear in the table of contents:

*[[Template:Human Physiology]]
*[[:Category:Human Physiology]]
*[[Human Physiology/Print Version]]
*[[Human Physiology/Page List]]

These pages can be changed to anything you need them to be. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:26, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

== Please be careful downloading images! ==

This wikibook uses a lot of images, and most of these do not have copyright status tags.

== This Book is Used as an Authoritative Text ==

Please be cautious when editing or changing this resource as it is now a permanent part of the Free Open University Curriculum. Thanks for all the good work. [[User:Freeopenuniversity|Freeopenuniversity]] ([[User talk:Freeopenuniversity|talk]]) 20:03, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

== suggested merge ==

I suggest merging the &quot;[[Medical Physiology]]&quot; wikibook into the &quot;[[Human Physiology]]&quot; wikibook.
Both books discuss the same topic and have about the same target audience, right?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 17:56, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

:Does [[Medical Physiology]] have any content?  Would it even be worth doing? [[User:Sethwoodworth|Sethwoodworth]] ([[User talk:Sethwoodworth|talk]]) 21:30, 31 January 2008 (UTC)
:As a primary author of the human physiology book, I would welcome any content from the medical physiology book, but recognize that it may be appropriate to have two books. I would like our book to be more rigorous, but perhaps the intended depth for the medical physiology textbook would overwhelm undergraduate students (my primary audience). In looking at the renal physiology chapter, I liked the focus on medical application, rather than just description. I would like to hear from the creator of the medical physiology textbook whether he/she thinks that the goals of the book could be reached simply by adding content to what we already have put together. I would enjoy collaborating on a project to improve the existing book if it would serve the purpose. [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] ([[User talk:Provophys|talk]]) 17:48, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

Medical physiology tends to be much more indepth and intense than Human physiology - also human physiology tends to focus on how the system works when healthy, and medical physiology does that and then takes it a step further and covers pathophysiology. Totally different aims. I vote for keeping them seperate. And if the renal chapter is anything to go by, the Medical physiology could become a good wikibook in its own right. To be honest, merging these would be like merging a book on Bach with a book on Mozart simply because they both deal with famous composers....

:I agree with the readers who think that Medical Physiology should be separate from Human physiology. Although there is a lot of overlap, the former is aimed really at medical students - and thus should be more detailed, the latter  should be sused as a primary text. Medical Physiology should have sections on &lt;i&gt;Clinical Physiology&lt;/i&gt;, either as a separate section, dispersed through the text or both.[[User:Boumphreyfr|Boumphreyfr]] ([[User talk:Boumphreyfr|talk]]) 16:17, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

== Problem Sets ==

Ideas to make this the greatest book on Human Physiology :

- Lot of problems, cases with good solutions. current set is good but could be lot better
- Recorded audio if used in a class.

I would love to contribute to this - but I am just a student.

== PDF Version ==

Would it be possible for an updated PDF version of this Wikibook to be created? The current one is from 2007, and there have been many improvements and changes since then.

==Can we add a chapter on ''exercise physiology''?==
This is an amazing textbook and I wonder if we can add a chapter at the end on exercise physiology since some universities (like mine) include some topics like cardio-respiratory responses to exercise... A chapter like this will even make the textbook more 'complete' than what is already now &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:U1012738|U1012738]] ([[User talk:U1012738|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/U1012738|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Skeletal System ==

I don't see anything about the Skeletal System at all, which I would think would be a fundamental requirement for any book about human physiology. Am I missing something, or is perhaps this book not really completed? --[[Special:Contributions/71.51.24.253|71.51.24.253]] ([[User talk:71.51.24.253|discuss]]) 20:51, 13 February 2013 (UTC)</text>

The Finnish language books must not be sorted under &quot;Other Indo-European&quot;, but under &quot;Finno-Ugric&quot;, since Finnish is not part of the Indo-European branch. Can someone correct this? [[w:User:JorisvS|JorisvS]] 13:50, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;Q-Celtic&quot; ==

&quot;Q-Celtic&quot; should be changed to just &quot;Celtic&quot;; Q-Celtic is a somewhat outdated term that reflects a particular theoretical POV. Also, [[Irish:Gaeilge na hÉireann]] and [[Scottish Gaelic for the Family]] should be added to the list. [[w:User:Angr]] 19:42, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

Could this wikibook be added to the list of constructed languages? [[User:Jonathan Webley|Jonathan Webley]] 07:54, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

== Reorganising this template ==

On the [[Wikibooks talk:Languages bookshelf|bookshelf's talk page]] we have been discussing ideas to reorganise both the [[Wikibooks:Languages bookshelf|full languages bookshelf list]] and the associated template (this one). The main idea is to replace classification of the books by language families and instead to classify languages by continents only. I would like to refer anyone interested in reading or participating in this discussion (you're still in time!) over there. We have now implemented the chief, consensually agreed changes as far as the full list is concerned, but it remains to adapt the template. If somebody with the authority needed to edit the template would like to do so, the following could be copied there for now any time you like. In view of the ongoing discussion it is still possible that there will be some further changes, but they will be less major than this one.

:I'm not sure if the template was unlocked, or if we had just confused registered-user-only locking for protection, but in any case, I have gone ahead and implemented the change. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:28, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Rules&quot; for inclusion in the languages bookshelf template ==

These are negotiatable, of course, but I thought it would be useful for future reference to summarise here the conclusions from recent discussion of this on the Languages bookshelf page:

&lt;u&gt;'''Organisation by continents'''&lt;/u&gt;: Items are organised by continents where applicable, followed by other categories (such as &quot;constructed&quot;, &quot;other books&quot;...).
*'''Note:''' &quot;Continents&quot; refers to the continent where a particular language was formed (thus English and Spanish are &quot;European&quot;, but Tok Pisin is &quot;Pacific&quot;, Afrikaans is &quot;African&quot;, etc.).
&lt;u&gt;'''Order of continents'''&lt;/u&gt;: On the template, the continents are ordered according to the number of items listed for each (most first), otherwise alphabetically.
*'''Note:''' In the complete bookshelf list, on the contrary, all the continents are in alphabetical order.
&lt;u&gt;'''Which items to include'''&lt;/u&gt;: Normally, only books whose progress icons indicate at least 25% completion will be included in the template.
*'''Exception:''' Other books may be included to bring the number of items for a continent up to a minimum of three.
&lt;u&gt;'''Languages with more than one book'''&lt;/u&gt;: When more than one book for a single language is elegible for inclusion in the template by the above criteria, the template will not contain a link to the individual books but to a listing of ''all'' the wikibooks relevant to the language in question. (These lists will also be transcluded into the complete language list on the bookshelf page.)

:I have tweaked Alan's comment to say &quot;negotiable&quot; instead of &quot;not nonnegotiable&quot; :-) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:38, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

::I shall not refrain from saying: &quot;thank you&quot;! :-) :-) --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 09:46, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

== Bookshelf for &quot;Other Language Books&quot;? ==
There are now a couple of &quot;other language books&quot;. Since they tend to have rather long titles, I think they take too much space in this template. What about making a bookshelf for them? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 20:04, 4 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Lychee Martini''' is a cocktail made of Lychee Liqueur (such as Lichido or Soho), Vodka and a dash of Lime Juice. To make it less strong and more fruity, you may add lychee juice to the recipe.  The ideal garnish for this cocktail is a single pitted lychee nut.  But most anything will do. And it tastes great!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Partnerships ==

A Partnership is a form of business organization in which two or more individuals carry on a business. It is a creature of both common law and statute, and has both contractual and agency dimensions.  

Partnerships are contractual because the terms of the relationship may be determined or altered by agreement between the parties.  It should be noted, however, that a partnership contract will be implied by law in some situations.

A partnership is also an agency relationship because each partner is the agent of the other(s) for the purpose of the business.  This means that one partner may bind all the other partners to a contract, or exercise any other power agents generally have.  Importantly, this also means that each of the partners owes a fiduciary duty to the others.

Similar to a sole proprietorship (with limited exceptions), the business of a partnership does not have a separate legal identity from the partners.  For example, the income of the business is taxed as income to the individual partners.  Conversely, if the business fails, each partner is responsible for a proportional share of the losses.  The joint responsibility of the partners for any and all losses incurred by the business means the partners have unlimited liability in a general partnership.

In general, a partnership has no legal identity separate from that of its principles.  As such it is not capable of things such as owning land or acquiring debt on its own.  It may, however, have a separate legal existence in the limited sense that the partners of a business may be sued in the name of the business where civil procedure rules allow for it (see Civil Procedure Rules - Nova Scotia, at Rule 7.01).  Further, some partnership legislation in Canada uses language that implies separate legal existence (see Partnership Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 334, at s. 47(b)).

There are several different ways in which a partnership may be structured.  The most basic form is the general partnership, but partnerships may also exist as limited partnerships or limited liability partnerships.

===Types of Partnerships===

====General Partnership====

The general partnership is the most common form of partnership and has all of the features discussed above.  It may occur by agreement or by operation of law.  Each partner has unlimited liability with respect to the business and is jointly and severally liable with all other partners.  


====Limited Partnership====

A limited partnership is a staturoy creation that differs from the general form in that it provides a way for one or more of the partners to limit their liabity with respect to the operation of the business.  Unlike a general partnership, which can be inferred based on the relationship between the parties, a limited partnership must be structured intentionally in accordance with the statutory provisions in the jurisdiction, which will usually require registration.  Not all Canadian jurisdictions allow for limited partnerships, and as such, they can only be created in jurisdictions that have passed supporting legislation.

Typically, the legislation will require that there is at least one general partner, whose liability is unlimited.  As many additional limited partners as desired can then be added.  The limited partners liability will be restricted to the amount of their capital contribution to the business.


 
====Limited Liability Partnerhip====



====Joint Venture====

===Partnership Agreements===

===Dissolving a Partnership===

== Rule 4 ==

'''Rule 4''': A point on the real axis is a part of the root-locus if it is to the left of an odd number of poles or zeros.
:Does this mean: to the left of either an odd number of poles, or an odd number of zeroes, or both? Or does it mean: to the left of an odd number of (poles and zeroes together)? E.g. if there are 1 zero and 3 poles, then the total number is 4, which is even. If there are 1 zero and 2 poles, then the total number is 3, which is odd. What is the rule exactly? --[[User:Gerrit|Gerrit]] 14:11, 20 October 2007 (UTC)


Its both. The root locus on the real axis is to the left an odd number of roots on the real axis. --Ben f

== Example 1 is incorrect ==

The closed-loop transfer function given in Example 1 is:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = { 1 \over 1 + 2s}&lt;/math&gt;

But earlier on the page, the closed-loop transfer function is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;T(s) = { K G(s) \over 1 + KG(s)H(s) }&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these two expressions, it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;KG(s) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = 2s&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the open loop transfer function is:

:&lt;math&gt; KG(s)H(s) = {a(s) \over b(s)} = 2s &lt;/math&gt;

which has a single zero at 

:&lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt; 

and a single pole for

:&lt;math&gt;|s| \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;

Based on the closed-loop transfer function, it follows that as ''K'' approaches 0, the location of the pole must satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\angle s = -\pi &lt;/math&gt;

which means that the pole is on the negative real axis at &lt;math&gt;s = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

It then follows that the root locus begins at minus infinity on the negative real-axis, and then moves forward along the negative real-axis until reaching the origin.  This result is quite different from the analysis and associated graph shown in Example 1.

Computer simulation shows that the example is correct. In Matlab/Octave:

Hi, i might be very wrong here(sorry if i am) but I think there's a typo in the transfer function given, i think it ought to be s^2 +4.5s +5.625 . (i checked by plotting it in octave)</text>

== Example: Optimized vs Non-Optimized Code ==

{{TextBox|1=
The following example is adapted from an algorithm presented in Knuth(vol 1, chapt 1) used to find the greatest common denominator of 2 integers. Compare the listing file of this function when compiler optimizations are turned on and off.

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 /*line 1*/
 int EuclidsGCD(int m, int n) /*we want to find the GCD of m and n*/
 {
 	int q, r; /*q is the quotient, r is the remainder*/
 	while(1)
 	{
 		q = m / n; /*find q and r*/
 		r = m % n;
 		if(r == 0) /*if r is 0, return our n value*/
 		{
 			return n;
 		}
 		m = n; /*set m to the current n value*/
 		n = r; /*set n to our current remainder value*/
 	} /*repeat*/
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Compiling with the Microsoft C compiler, we generate a listing file using no optimization:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 PUBLIC	_EuclidsGCD
 _TEXT	SEGMENT
 _r$ = -8	; size = 4
 _q$ = -4	; size = 4
 _m$ = 8	; size = 4
 _n$ = 12	; size = 4
 _EuclidsGCD PROC NEAR
 ; Line 2
 	push	ebp
 	mov	ebp, esp
 	sub	esp, 8
 $L477:
 ; Line 4
 	mov	eax, 1
 	test	eax, eax
 	je	SHORT $L473
 ; Line 6
 	mov	eax, DWORD PTR _m$[ebp]
 	cdq
 	idiv	DWORD PTR _n$[ebp]
 	mov	DWORD PTR _q$[ebp], eax
 ; Line 7
 	mov	eax, DWORD PTR _m$[ebp]
 	cdq
 	idiv	DWORD PTR _n$[ebp]
 	mov	DWORD PTR _r$[ebp], edx
 ; Line 8
 	cmp	DWORD PTR _r$[ebp], 0
 	jne	SHORT $L479
 ; Line 10
 	mov	eax, DWORD PTR _n$[ebp]
 	jmp	SHORT $L473
 $L479:
 ; Line 12
 	mov	ecx, DWORD PTR _n$[ebp]
 	mov	DWORD PTR _m$[ebp], ecx
 ; Line 13
 	mov	edx, DWORD PTR _r$[ebp]
 	mov	DWORD PTR _n$[ebp], edx
 ; Line 14
 	jmp	SHORT $L477
 $L473:
 ; Line 15
 	mov	esp, ebp
 	pop	ebp
 	ret	0
 _EuclidsGCD ENDP
 _TEXT	ENDS
 END
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how there is a very clear correspondence between the lines of C code, and the lines of the ASM code. the addition of the &quot;; line x&quot; directives is very helpful in that respect. 

Next, we compile the same function using a series of optimizations to stress speed over size:

 cl.exe /Tceuclids.c /Fa /Ogt2

and we produce the following listing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 PUBLIC	_EuclidsGCD
 _TEXT	SEGMENT
 _m$ = 8	; size = 4
 _n$ = 12       ; size = 4
 _EuclidsGCD PROC NEAR	
 ; Line 7
 	mov	eax, DWORD PTR _m$[esp-4]
 	push	esi
 	mov	esi, DWORD PTR _n$[esp]
 	cdq
 	idiv	esi
 	mov	ecx, edx
 ; Line 8
 	test	ecx, ecx
 	je	SHORT $L563
 $L547:
 ; Line 12
 	mov	eax, esi
 	cdq
 	idiv	ecx
 ; Line 13
 	mov	esi, ecx
 	mov	ecx, edx
 	test	ecx, ecx
 	jne	SHORT $L547
 $L563:
 ; Line 10
 	mov	eax, esi
 	pop	esi
 ; Line 15
 	ret	0
 _EuclidsGCD ENDP
 _TEXT	ENDS
 END
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, the optimized version is significantly shorter then the non-optimized version. Some of the key differences include:

*The optimized version does not prepare a standard stack frame. This is important to note, because many times new reversers assume that functions always start and end with proper stack frames, and this is clearly not the case. EBP isnt being used, ESP isnt being altered (because the local variables are kept in registers, and not put on the stack), and no subfunctions are called. 5 instructions are cut by this.
*The &quot;test EAX, EAX&quot; series of instructions in the non-optimized output, under &quot;;line 4&quot; is all unnecessary. The while-loop is defined by &quot;while(1)&quot; and therefore the loop always continues. this extra code is safely cut out. Notice also that there is no unconditional jump in the loop like would be expected: the &quot;if(r == 0) return n;&quot; instruction has become the new loop condition.
*The structure of the function is altered greatly: the division of m and n to produce q and r is performed in this function twice: once at the beginning of the function to initialize, and once at the end of the loop. Also, the value of r is tested twice, in the same places. The compiler is very liberal with how it assigns storage in the function, and readily discards values that are not needed. 
}}

== Example: Manual Optimization ==

{{TextBox|1=
The following lines of assembly code are not optimized, but they can be optimized very easily. Can you find a way to optimize these lines?

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov	eax, 1
test	eax, eax
je	SHORT $L473
&lt;/source&gt;

The code in this line is the code generated for the &quot;while( 1 )&quot; C code, to be exact, it represents the loop break condition. Because this is an infinite loop, we can assume that these lines are unnecessary.

&quot;mov eax, 1&quot; initializes eax.

the test immediately afterwards tests the value of eax to ensure that it is nonzero.
because eax will always be nonzero (eax = 1) at this point, the conditional jump can be removed along whith the &quot;mov&quot; and the &quot;test&quot;.

The assembly is actually checking whether 1 equals 1. Another fact is, that the C code for an infinite '''FOR''' loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 for( ; ; )
 {
    ...
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

would not create such a meaningless assembly code to begin with, and is logically the same as &quot;while( 1 )&quot;.
}}

== Example: Trace Variables ==

{{TextBox|1=

Here are the C code and the optimized assembly listing from the EuclidGCD function, from the example above. Can you determine which registers contain the variables '''r''' and '''q'''?

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 /*line 1*/
 int EuclidsGCD(int m, int n) /*we want to find the GCD of m and n*/
 {
 	int q, r; /*q is the quotient, r is the remainder*/
 	while(1)
 	{
 		q = m / n; /*find q and r*/
 		r = m % n;
 		if(r == 0) /*if r is 0, return our n value*/
 		{
 			return n;
 		}
 		m = n; /*set m to the current n value*/
 		n = r; /*set n to our current remainder value*/
 	} /*repeat*/
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 PUBLIC	_EuclidsGCD
 _TEXT	SEGMENT
 _m$ = 8	; size = 4
 _n$ = 12       ; size = 4
 _EuclidsGCD PROC NEAR	
 ; Line 7
 	mov	eax, DWORD PTR _m$[esp-4]
 	push	esi
 	mov	esi, DWORD PTR _n$[esp]
 	cdq
 	idiv	esi
 	mov	ecx, edx
 ; Line 8
 	test	ecx, ecx
 	je	SHORT $L563
 $L547:
 ; Line 12
 	mov	eax, esi
 	cdq
 	idiv	ecx
 ; Line 13
 	mov	esi, ecx
 	mov	ecx, edx
 	test	ecx, ecx
 	jne	SHORT $L547
 $L563:
 ; Line 10
 	mov	eax, esi
 	pop	esi
 ; Line 15
 	ret	0
 _EuclidsGCD ENDP
 _TEXT	ENDS
 END
&lt;/source&gt;

At the beginning of the function, '''eax''' contains m, and '''esi''' contains n. When the instruction &quot;idiv esi&quot; is executed, eax contains the quotient (q), and edx contains the remainder (r). The instruction &quot;mov ecx, edx&quot; moves r into '''ecx''', while q is not used for the rest of the loop, and is therefore discarded.
}}

== Example: Decompile Optimized Code ==

{{TextBox|1=
Below is the optimized listing file of the EuclidGCD function, presented in the examples above. Can you decompile this assembly code listing into equivalent &quot;optimized&quot; C code? How is the optimized version different in structure from the non-optimized version?

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 PUBLIC	_EuclidsGCD
 _TEXT	SEGMENT
 _m$ = 8	; size = 4
 _n$ = 12       ; size = 4
 _EuclidsGCD PROC NEAR	
 ; Line 7
 	mov	eax, DWORD PTR _m$[esp-4]
 	push	esi
 	mov	esi, DWORD PTR _n$[esp]
 	cdq
 	idiv	esi
 	mov	ecx, edx
 ; Line 8
 	test	ecx, ecx
 	je	SHORT $L563
 $L547:
 ; Line 12
 	mov	eax, esi
 	cdq
 	idiv	ecx
 ; Line 13
 	mov	esi, ecx
 	mov	ecx, edx
 	test	ecx, ecx
 	jne	SHORT $L547
 $L563:
 ; Line 10
 	mov	eax, esi
 	pop	esi
 ; Line 15
 	ret	0
 _EuclidsGCD ENDP
 _TEXT	ENDS
 END
&lt;/source&gt;

Altering the conditions to maintain the same structure gives us:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int EuclidsGCD(int m, int n)
 {
     int r;
     r = m % n;
     if(r != 0) 
     {
         do
         {
             m = n;
             r = m % r;
             n = r;
         }while(r != 0)
     }
     return n;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

It is up to the reader to compile this new &quot;optimized&quot; C code, and determine if there is any performance increase. Try compiling this new code without optimizations first, and then with optimizations. Compare the new assembly listings to the previous ones.
}}

== Example: Instruction Pairings ==

{{TextBox|1=
;Q:Why does the '''dec'''/'''jne''' combo operate faster than the equivalent '''loopnz'''?
;A:The '''dec'''/'''jnz''' pair operates faster then a '''loopsz''' for several reasons. First, '''dec''' and '''jnz''' pair up in the different modules of the netburst pipeline, so they can be executed simultaneously. Top that off with the fact that '''dec''' and '''jnz''' both require few cycles to execute, while the '''loopnz''' (and all the loop instructions, for that matter) instruction takes more cycles to complete. loop instructions are rarely seen output by good compilers.
}}

== Example: Avoiding Branches ==

{{TextBox|1=Below is an assembly version of the expression &lt;code&gt;c ? d : 0&lt;/code&gt;. There is no branching in the code, so how does it work?

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
; ecx = c and edx = d
; eax will contain c ? d : 0 (eax = d if c is not zero, otherwise eax = 0)
neg	ecx
sbb	eax, eax
and	eax, edx
ret
&lt;/source&gt;

This is an example of using various arithmetic instructions to avoid branching. The '''neg''' instruction sets the carry flag if ''c'' is not zero; otherwise, it clears the carry flag. The next line depends on this. If the carry flag is set, then '''sbb''' results in &lt;code&gt;eax = eax - eax - 1 = 0xffffffff&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;eax = eax - eax = 0&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, performing an '''and''' on this result ensures that if '''ecx''' was not zero in the first place, '''eax''' will contain '''edx''', and zero otherwise.
}}

== Example: Duff's Device ==

{{TextBox|1=What does the following C code function do? Is it useful? Why or why not?

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
void MyFunction(int *arrayA, int *arrayB, cnt)
{
  switch(cnt % 6) 
  {
    while(cnt != 0) 
    {
      case 0:
        arrayA[cnt] = arrayB[cnt--];
      case 5:
        arrayA[cnt] = arrayB[cnt--];
      case 4:
        arrayA[cnt] = arrayB[cnt--];
      case 3:
        arrayA[cnt] = arrayB[cnt--];
      case 2:
        arrayA[cnt] = arrayB[cnt--];
      case 1:
        arrayA[cnt] = arrayB[cnt--];
    }
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Wikipedia|Duff's device}}
This piece of code is known as a '''Duff's device''' or &quot;Duff's machine&quot;. It is used to partially unwind a loop for efficiency. Notice the strange way that the &lt;code&gt;while()&lt;/code&gt; is nested inside the &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement? Two arrays of integers are passed to the function, and at each iteration of the while loop, 6 consecutive elements are copied from &lt;code&gt;arrayB&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;arrayA&lt;/code&gt;. The switch statement, since it is outside the while loop, only occurs at the beginning of the function. The modulo is taken of the variable &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; with respect to 6. If cnt is not evenly divisible by 6, then the modulo statement is going to start the loop off somewhere in the middle of the rotation, thus preventing the loop from causing a buffer overflow without having to test the current count after each iteration.

Duff's Device is considered one of the more efficient general-purpose methods for copying strings, arrays, or data streams. }}</text>

==Complete a high school or college course in accounting or the following requirements:==

==1. Show transactions necessary for acquisition or deposit of assets, and acquisition and disposal of liability. Show transactions necessary to close income and expense accounts at year end.==
==2. Be able to correctly classify balance sheet items with short term asset, long term asset, contra asset, short term liability, long term liability, and equity.==
==3. Be able to write an income statement from a trial balance.==
==4. Be able to reconcile bank balance to book balance in checking accounts, including deposit in transit, service charge, returned NSF, interest on account, and checks in transit.==
'''[[W:Bank_reconciliation|Bank reconciliation]]''' is the process of matching and comparing figures from accounting records against those presented on a bank statement. Less any items which have no relation to the bank statement, the balance of the accounting ledger should reconcile (match) to the balance of the bank statement.

It allows individuals to compare their personal bank account records to the bank's records of the individual's account balance in order to uncover any possible discrepancies.

===History===
When ledgers were written manually, regular checks were important to ensure they remained in balance. It was important to have a reliable source against which to check the accounts ledger.

The statement of account from a bank would have been hand written by a clerk and checked carefully by the bank manager. The statement can be taken as a reliable source, as banks' primary business is to ensure their ledgers correctly tracked the flow of funds. Hence the bank balance at the end of a given period could be obtained from bank and matched to a bank ledger kept by a company's accountant.

== Example: Identify C++ Code ==

{{TextBox|1=
Can you tell what the original C++ source code looks like, in general, for the following accessor method?

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov eax, [ecx + 8] ;THISCALL function, passes &quot;this&quot; pointer in ecx
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret
&lt;/source&gt;

We don't know the name of the class, so we will use a generic name MyClass (or whatever you would like to call it). We will lay out a simple class definition, that contains a data value at offset +8. Offset +8 is the only data value accessed, so we don't know what the first 8 bytes of data looks like, but we will just assume (for our purposes) that our class looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 class MyClass
 {
   int value1;
   int value2;
   int value3; //offset +8
   ...
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

We will then create our function, which I will call &quot;GetValue3()&quot;. We know that the data value being accessed is located at [ecx+8], (which we have defined above to be &quot;value3&quot;). Also, we know that the data is being read into a 4-byte register (eax), and is not truncated. We can assume, therefore, that value3 is a 4-byte data value. We can use the '''this''' pointer as the pointer value stored in ecx, and we can take the element that is at offset +8 from that pointer (value3):

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 MyClass::GetValue3()
 {
   return this-&gt;value3;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''this''' pointer is not necessary here, but i use it anyway to illustrate the fact that the variable was accessed as an offset from the '''this''' pointer.

'''Note''': Remember, we don't know what the first 8 bytes actually look like in our class, we only have a single accessor method, that only accesses a single data value at offset +8. The class could also have looked like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 class MyClass /*Alternate Definition*/
 {
    byte byte1;
    byte byte2;
    short short1;
    long value2;
    long value3;
  ...
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, any other combinations of 8 bytes.
}}

== Example: Identify C++ Code ==

{{TextBox|1=
Can you tell what the original C++ source code looks like, in general, for the following setter method?

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 cmp [ebp + 8], 0
 je error
 mov eax, [ebp + 8]
 mov [ecx + 0], eax
 mov eax, 1
 jmp end
 :error
 mov eax, 0
 :end
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret
&lt;/source&gt;

This code looks a little complicated, but don't panic! We will walk through it slowly. The first two lines of code set up the stack frame:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
&lt;/source&gt;

The next two lines of code compare the value of [ebp + 8] (which we know to be the first parameter) to zero. If [ebp+8] is zero, the function jumps to the label &quot;error&quot;. We see that the label &quot;error&quot; sets eax to 0, and returns. We haven't seen it before, but this looks conspicuously like an '''if''' statement. &quot;If the parameter is zero, return zero&quot;. 

If, on the other hand, the parameter is not zero, we move the value into eax, and then move the value into [ecx + 0], which we know as the first data field in MyClass. We also see, from this code, that this first data field must be 4 bytes long (because we are using eax). After we move eax into [ecx + 0], we set eax to 1 and jump to the end of the function. 

If we use the same MyClass defintion as in question 1, above, we can get the following code for our function, &quot;SetValue1(int val)&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int MyClass::SetValue1(int val)
 {
   if(val == 0) return 0;
   this-&gt;value1 = val;
   return 1;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that since we are returning a 0 on failure, and a 1 on success, the function looks like it has a '''bool''' return value. However, the return value is 4 bytes wide (eax is used), but the size of a '''bool''' is implementation-specific, so we can't be sure.  The '''bool''' is usually defined to have a size of 1 byte, but it is often stored the same way as an '''int'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Note: For simplicity, many examples below will assume that Gold is attacking the c6 trap.  Naturally, the same theories apply equally in all 4 quadrants.'''''

This chapter describes how to best position one’s pieces for an attack while outlining the methods a defender will employ to thwart the attacker. Attacking an enemy trap has multiple purposes such as capturing enemy pieces, clearing a path for a rabbit advance, obtaining a space advantage, etc.  Fortunately, it is easy to establish one set of rules for positioning pieces that will apply in most attacking and defending situations.

== Positioning the Elephant ==

The attacking elephant should usually remain centralized.  Moving the elephant to a square such as b6 or c7 will usually lead to a failed attack or even a blockaded elephant, though there are a couple of exceptions discussed below.  On the other hand, experience has shown that an attacking elephant on the d6 square is ideally placed to support an attack and disrupt enemy defenses while still remaining nicely centralized.  As will be shown later in this chapter, the c5 square is an acceptable square for the attacking elephant but, in many cases the elephant is less effective on c5 than it would be on d6.  If the attacking elephant temporarily moves away from the d6 square, the defending elephant should seize the opportunity to occupy d6 whenever possible.  Not only is d6 a good square for the defending elephant, but it is also worthwhile to deny the attacking elephant the square for its own sake.  Therefore, once an attacking elephant occupies d6, it should not relinquish the square until a better opportunity appears elsewhere (such as the e6 square during a double-attack).

|Diagram 1: An ideal Elephant and Horse Attack with Silver to move
}}

The ideal situation in diagram 1:  The elephant and the horse have taken control of the c6 trap with devastating efficiency.  Notice all of the following features of the position:

* the silver elephant, usually the key defender against an [[Arimaa/Elephant_and_Horse_Attacks | Elephant and Horse Attack]], is more than four steps away from the c6 trap.
* the silver camel, also highly effective against an Elephant and Horse Attack, is on the wrong wing.
* the a5 dog can reach c5 with da5e ra8s ra6s db5e, but Gold can easily push the dog to c4, with double-trap threats at c3 and c6.
* the defender cannot scatter all pieces away from the c6 trap and, even if Silver were able to do so, it would allow Gold to begin a highly potent rabbit advance such as Rd1n Rd2n Rd3w Rc3n.
* if the gold elephant were on the c5 square rather than d6 then the defender could simply defend with 2 steps such as he7s he6w while still being able to move the elephant towards the northwest quadrant with Rf4s eg4w.


Two important keys to this powerful attack are the combination of attackers on b6 and d6 that make it very difficult and time-consuming for the weak defenders to reach the c5 square (where they are also vulnerable to a south-push), and the lack of balance in the silver army (i.e. silver should not have all the strongest pieces on the same wing).

|Diagram 2: The gold elephant fails to secure d6 with silver to move.
}}

By contrast, the position in diagram 2 will turn into a disaster for gold with silver to move.  Notice that Silver can immediately play ed5n ed6n ed7s hc7e, holding the gold horse hostage.  As discussed in another chapter (provide link), a hostage that is frozen by an elephant on d7 is very difficult to protect.  For example, if Silver plays ed6s hd7s on the subsequent move, the horse will be forked between the c6 and f6 traps.  This illustrates both the danger of a hostage piece in the d- and e-files and the importance of having an elephant on d6.  As an aside, Silver should not continue with the Camel and Horse Attack in the southeast quadrant until first holding the gold horse hostage on d7 - otherwise, Gold will likely retreat the c7 horse from danger while still having sufficient time to defend the southeast trap.  

Exceptions:  Although the elephant should generally not be decentralized during an attack, there are exceptions.  If there is a silver camel on b6, then it could be worthwhile to temporarily place a gold elephant on b6 in order to push the camel south.  This could eventually lead to a camel hostage near the c3 trap.  Also, if gold has a powerful goal threat in the northwest quadrant then it may be worthwhile to decentralize the elephant and move it onto the 7th or 8th rank.  Be very, very careful when doing so, however, as an elephant can easily become blockaded if it ventures into the corners.  Use a weaker piece to support a rabbit advance on the perimeter whenever possible.

}}

Controlling the b6 and/or c7 squares is vitally important for the great majority of Arimaa attacks.  The horse or camel should normally be used to secure these important squares since rabbits and cats are easily pushed out of the way.  A dog can be a useful attacker in some cases (see [[Arimaa/Elephant_and_Minor_Piece_Attacks | Elephant and Minor Piece Attacks]]), but a dog is not normally considered a “strong” piece for the purposes of securing a vital square in enemy territory.  To see why control of b6 and c7 is so important, the reader should study diagram 3 from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=25021&amp;s=w this game].  Gold had planned to aggressively advance pieces on the west wing before gaining control of either b6 or c7.  However, Silver was able to thwart this attack and now the gold elephant is pinned to d6 with no prospects for continuing the attack (other than a futile attempt to control c5).  However, any piece that stands on c5 is at risk of being pushed to e5, creating a double-threat certain to result in a material gain for Silver.  Eventually, Gold had to abandon the c6 square and suffered through an inferior position in the middlegame.  It cannot be stressed enough that one should normally control vital squares first (elephant on d6 and strong pieces on either b6, c7) before threatening material or attempting to advance rabbits on the wing.

Once the attacker has firm control over key squares, it becomes possible to either flood the trap with rabbits, cats and dogs or, if the silver elephant is not in the vicinity, it may become possible to begin capturing material around the trap.

== Positioning a Dog or Cat ==

It is often helpful to bring in additional pieces after the key b6 and c7 squares have been controlled.  By bringing a cat and/or dog towards the c6 trap, Gold may eventually be able to move the elephant elsewhere on the board while still maintaining control around c6 with multiple pieces.  As explained below, cats and dogs are best placed on either c5 or b6 after a trap has been fully controlled.  A dog is sometimes strong enough to secure the vital c7 square, but that job is often best left to a horse or camel.  It is not advisable to place any pieces on d6 unless absolutely certain that they will not be pushed towards the f6 trap!

|Diagram 4: With silver to move, the gold rabbit on c5 becomes a liability
}}

A rabbit can be a very useful piece during a swarm attack but they can often be a liability for the attacker if the objective is to capture material.  In diagram 4 with silver to move, it might appear at first glance that silver cannot prevent the loss of material at the c6 trap.  However, there is one &quot;nuisance move&quot; at Silver's disposal that will delay a capture:  hd6s Rc5n hd5w hc5e.  If Gold responds with Rc6e Mc7s Mc6s Db3n then Silver will be able to counter with dc8s cd8s Rd6e cd7s.  Although Gold should be able to win material in this tactical melee, the game will not proceed as smoothly as initially expected.  This loss of time by Gold may not be a decisive factor in this game, but in many open, tactical games it is crucial to prevent nuisance or delaying tactics by the defender.  Notice that Gold would have been able to immediately win material if it weren't for the rabbit on c5.  Due to the weakness of the rabbit and its inability to retreat, they are much better employed for goal threats and blockades rather, and should normally be kept at least two spaces away from an important trap.

== Defending Against an Attack ==

The most important consideration for Silver’s defense of the c6 trap is the placement of pieces.  If the trap is not defended by strong pieces, or if the pieces are misplaced, then Gold will easily be able to gain control of the key squares.  Virtually all strong Arimaa players will setup their horses on the b and g files.  This will allow the horses to defend the crucial b6 and g6 squares by taking just one step forward.  A silver camel is also an excellent defender for the b6 square, but Gold could easily respond in that case by attacking the f6 trap instead.  The camel is excellent at disrupting an Elephant and Horse Attack and, therefore, it is often best to keep the camel on c7, d7, e7 or f7 so that it is flexible enough to defend both traps.  This is an important point, so it should also be stated from the attacker’s perspective:  Gold should not attack with a horse unless the silver camel is far away and/or blockaded from approaching the trap in question.  For example, if the silver camel is on f7, pulling silver rabbits onto d7 and e7 will make it much easier to conduct an Elephant and Horse Attack.

Silver can defend the c6 trap by placing horses on both the vital b6 and c7 squares.  However, this would leave the f6 trap without a defending horse, and the opponent should always be expected to attack the weakest wing.  In practice, most players will defend the c7 square (and similarly f7) with a cat and then place additional pieces on b7, c8 and d7 to prevent a horse or camel from pushing its way onto c7 via the c6 square.  With the b6 and c7 entry points well defended, Gold will have to spend time disrupting Silver’s defenses before commencing an attack.  One possibility for Gold would be to push/pull a piece from d7 to d5 with the elephant on d6. This creates an entry point at c7 for a strong piece while also flipping an enemy piece into the center of the board.

The defender should always look for opportunities to take an attacker hostage or frame a piece on the trap square.  These opportunities present themselves quite frequently.  Note that if the attacking elephant is pinned to the c5 square while a horse is framed on c6, then it will be possible for the horse to be pulled to d6 where it becomes forked between the c6 and f6 traps.  This is yet another reason that the gold elephant should occupy the d6 square during an attack.

== Positioning After a Trap Is Fully Controlled ==

After Gold has controlled the c6 trap, it is often advisable to advance some weaker pieces towards the trap while maintaining a strong piece on c7 and an elephant on d6.  Eventually, Gold could have enough pieces around the enemy trap to allow the elephant to move elsewhere on the board.  If so, Silver may attempt to regain control of the c6 trap at a later time; it is important for Gold to control the crucial square c7 with a strong piece such as a horse or camel.  Since Silver will often counter-attack from the east, the c7 square will usually become more important than the b6 square.  Silver will be reluctant to move a piece to c5 if there is a risk of capture at c3, and so c7 and d6 (if there is no elephant there) will be the key infiltration points.  If Gold can swarm the c6 trap with many weaker pieces, it will become extremely difficult and time-consuming for Silver to ever fully re-capture the trap. 

If Gold gains full control over the c6 trap, the enjoyable task of trapping material becomes possible!  Since Silver will probably have many pieces on the two back ranks, Gold will want a strong piece on the c7 square for trapping pieces standing on b7, c8 or d7.  If Silver scatters the defenders, leaving a gap on c8, then Gold should immediately take the opportunity to advance a rabbit towards the gap.  Gold should not normally finish a turn with a gold rabbit standing on c6 because that will allow silver to blockade the c8 square without any immediate risk of capture (due to the rabbit blocking the trap).

== Overview ==

'''''Fairies''''' are tiny humanoid creatures with functional wings. They glow with their own light, which makes them useful as decorations.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] notes that an area of lawn just outside the Entrance Hall has been turned into a sort of grotto filled with fairy lights. He thinks that this means that there are hundreds of actual fairies sitting in the conjured rose bushes and fluttering over the statuary. 

== Analysis ==

Apart from their ability to fly and their light, we have little description of fairies. Much of what we know of them comes from ''Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them'' by &quot;Newt Scamander&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== New DOS Serial COMM programs ==

While it may seem a little unusual to be creating a DOS serial communications package, this isn't really all that far fetched as embedded systems are still very common and you can get very inexpensive hardware that has x386 or even Pentium processors on them, where operating systems like FreeDOS are all that is really needed for the application.  To have to resort to a full operating system like Linux or (heaven forbid!) Windows CE when all you need is some simply communications drivers, why not do them in DOS?

While I will admit this is a section has historical purposes, it still demonstrates operating directly with the UART chips (something all serious serial programming will have to deal with in one form or another) and how to perhaps even write and debug the drivers.  In addition, I dare anybody to show how serial communications subroutines can be more efficiently written than dealing with hardware on this level.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Explicit dates ==

&lt;s&gt;Wikibooks is not Wikipedia. We are not a place that dumps long lists of useless facts and dates. This page will soon be designed with a flow in mind, and so explicit dates will not be helpful. We are looking for continuity, not explicit citations. The books do not refer to events with dates and neither will we since this is a story and '''not a history lesson'''. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 22:13, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
:Understood... and yet, the dates do tend to make things easier to understand and put in sequence. I would like to make one suggestion: that dates be provided for Harry's birth and first year. The rest can be left dateless... but if we have dates in for the earlier stuff, as I think we should because otherwise it all kind of bunches up and is incomprehensible, we should have a date for the starting point of the story.
:Dates are only really important for when the story interacts with our world. Book 6, we have the conversation with the Muggle Prime Minister, which from internal evidence would be John Major. Is it worth mentioning that the prime minister who tried to kick Cornelius Fudge out the window would, in that scheme of things, have been Maggie Thatcher? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 23:27, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
::I understand that it would make current sense to have years there to mark lapses of time, but only temporarily. Once a proper diagram is created, I don't think those years should be there. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 01:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
:::The fact that Harry and Neville are born &quot;as the month of July is dying&quot; is important to the story and should, I think, be retained. The fact that this happened in 1980 as per internal evidence in the story, I will grant, is only important to mark the length of time from when the Chamber was last opened. I am going to replace a very limited set of dates, with the intent as you suggested that they be kept only until a proper diagram is in place. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 03:01, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
::::The best way to go about this may be to just create a table and have different background colors for regions of time. Embedding a good look into a wiki is often a hard task, and I'll have to do some research. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 03:04, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
:::One thing I will note is that until I had the time to actually work it out, it didn't seem possible to me that Riddle could have been born in the 20s. One of the reasons for retaining dates is to make that sort of timing plain to the reader... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 03:14, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
::::Is it useful to tell a reader that someone was born in the 1920s though? To me, that brings in bias about the time period and doesn't have to do with the story. Working with something like &quot;60 years before Harry's birth&quot; seems much more appropriate. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 00:38, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
:::::A very valid question. My feeling is that it does make some difference, as Merope's life in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; seems unnecessarily primitive unless we do notice that it is in the 1920s; knowing that, it merely seems somewhat backward, as we would expect from the Gaunts. (Granted, the wizards seem to cling to what we would consider outdated technology, and purebloods would do so even more -- though it seems that Grimmauld Place is on the electric grid.) Likewise, Tom Riddle's orphanage, and the street scene there, seems incongruous until we know that it is 1935 or so. Is it important that this timeline, by the way, makes Hagrid about 60 years old? (Voldemort also, but he's had a body refresh so it doesn't count...) [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 17:19, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

:::::Revision: Grimmauld Place is not on the electric grid; it is evidently illuminated by gas lamps, or some wizarding equivalent --- hopefully one that's a little less dangerous, gas lamps burn a methane / carbon monoxide mixture. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 20:42, 22 August 2006 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

:''See below for further info, but explicit dates should be included now that the entire series is set and explicit dates exist in the last book. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:28, 25 July 2007 (UTC)''

=== Shrieking Shack timeline ===

Online ephemeris at [http://www.sunrisesunset.com sunrisesunset.com] states that sunset in Glasgow on 10 June 94 was at 9:59 PM, and civil twilight at 11PM. As the Dementor attack was in full dark, it must have happened around midnight. While I am not wedded to the specific date, we do know that it is early June, and that Hogwarts is in Scotland, which gives us a very late sunset in any year. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 09:08, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

=== Death of Moaning Myrtle and Tom Riddle Sr. ===

There is considerably more speculation in the Notes On Dates in that particular part of Riddle's history than I would like; I'm actually assigning hard dates to Myrtle's and Riddle's deaths. I don't like that because it does border on the sort of hardcore speculation that we are trying to avoid. But what I'm trying to establish is sequence – what the actual sequence of deaths is. We don't yet know whether it was the death of Myrtle that allowed Riddle to make the diary Horcrux; it seems unlikely because the diary is aware of things that happened after Myrtle died. &lt;strike&gt;It is relatively certain that it was the death of Riddle Sr. that allowed creation of the ring Horcrux, and possibly of Riddle's parents (Voldemort's grandparents) that allowed for creation of the diary Horcrux.&lt;/strike&gt; We can be certain that the locket Horcrux was created later, as it was only in this visit with Morfin, immediately preceding Riddle Sr.'s death, that Tom found out that the locket existed at all; he had definitely not had time to charm it out of Hepzibah Smith. And I believe it may yet be important &lt;strike&gt;that Myrtle died a few years before Tom Riddle Sr.&lt;/strike&gt; to know when Myrtle died relative to Tom Sr. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 09:01, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

:Revision pending: I ran across something in HBP tonight that throws all this lovely reasoning right away. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 08:57, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

::Revision: Tom talked with Slughorn about Horcruxes after he had killed his father; in Slughorn's memory we see Tom wearing the Gaunt ring. Presumably he didn't yet know enough about Horcruxes to create one, and Dumbledore does say that after he had made the ring into a Horcrux, he no longer wanted to wear it. So the order of deaths is once again uncertain; Riddle could have killed his father in the summer preceding his fifth year, or in the summer following his fifth year, though not in the summer following his sixth year – Slughorn would have said &quot;You're head boy&quot; rather than &quot;You're a prefect&quot; if it had been Tom's seventh year. But we are led to believe that the death of Riddle's father and grandparents did not allow him to make a Horcrux, because he did not yet know how. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 17:08, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Second revision: Harry says in DH that Dumbledore believed that Riddle had already made one Horcrux when he talked to Slughorn. Thus the ring we see on Tom in Slughorn's memory was a Horcrux, made at the death of his father, and it was only when he had made a second one, and was sure his hiding place, Gaunt's shack, was never going to be disturbed (after Morfin's death), that he stopped wearing the ring, and jinxed and hid it. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:20, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

=== Hepzibah Smith and DADA application ===

We don't have a clear indication of when Hepzibah Smith died, except that it was very shortly after the episode where she showed Tom Riddle the Hufflepuff cup and the Slytherin locket. There is an implication that it was within a couple of years after Riddle graduated from Hogwarts, as he was then working for Borgin and Burke, and the implication is that that job did not last very long. We do know that it was ten years afterwards, and winter, when Riddle, then calling himself Voldemort, came to Dumbledore (who had then replaced Dippet) and asked for the Defence Against the Dark Arts job. I have arbitrarily placed both events in mid-February. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

=== Voldemort's first reign of terror ===

In chapter one of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', Dumbledore says, regarding the celebrations, &quot;They have had precious little to celebrate these past eleven years...&quot; The implication is that Voldemort's reign of terror got properly underway in 1970, to be ended in 1981 when he tried to kill Harry. Thus, Voldemort's application for the teaching position must have happened before that, in 1960 or thereabouts. This does align with our tentative placement of Voldemort's application in February of 1960, and Hepzibah Smith's death in February of 1950.

== Graphical timelines ==

Question: I have added to the timeline in year 2 as I was updating the summaries... and I find that there is a heck of a lot there now. I almost shudder to think what the timeline for the later books (GoF, OotP, HBP) will be like when it's fully populated. Have I gone overboard in putting events on the timeline? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 18:13, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
:I think you're fine. This will eventually be placed in a better-looking format and I think it will work more easily that way. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:43, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
:I've found what we'll use to show the timeline. I dumped a few quick lines in the &quot;Year One&quot; section (even though it looks terrible). It's called [[meta:EasyTimeline|EasyTimeline]] and it's integrated into MediaWiki here. Examples exist on that page and we'll have to start playing around with them to make the dates here look good. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:22, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
::EasyTimeline seems to always want to put recent at the top when set to vertical... I haven't found a way to fix that yet, though I granted have only skimmed it. I'm thinking that we might want to go horizontal instead, which will also allow us to fold the timeline... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 20:16, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
:::So be it. I'd still like to have a method that doesn't use exact years, but we may be stuck with them. It is a complex system, but its integration with MediaWiki is ideal. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:22, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
::::We could, of course, go with relative dates in the timeline; or we could set a date format that doesn't include a year. The fact that the actual years (which we luckily have) are required to generate the PNG doesn't mean that we have to show them, unless we want to. But if you don't want to include years, we may have to redact the family tree of the Ancient and Honourable House of Black, which does include dates... and as that is sourced from J. K. Rowling herself, I don't think I want to do that. 
::::I think I can see a way to make this look decent; I'll play with it tonight if I can. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 19:22, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
:::::I can understand a direct map of information from a person like Rowling to be acceptable. Those dates are also mostly very far in the past. Several dates on our timeline will be from direct references in the book which I also see as acceptable. It's all the speculation of the 1980s and 1990s that I want to avoid since this is not some poppy fan site but a solid documentary of events. I don't ever want this book to be a crystal ball and conspiracy theory archive. We present the facts and form intelligent inferences from them. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:23, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
::::I have started building the year 2 timeline, and it is, as you can see, very congested... is this the way we want to present this? Of course, it can be de-congested by stretching it either vertically or hoizontally... I have commented out the text version of the timelines for which graphical versions have been completed, for now, pending approval of the graphics. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 21:01, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
:::::The graphics look pretty good to me. We can just expand a timeline horizontally for now. When the book goes to print we may have to recondense the timelines, but for now I think stretching will suffice. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

Chapter 11: Buckbeak's hearing will take place on 20 April according to the letter. Chapter 14: the hearing is the Friday after the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, which falls in mid February. Somehow we've lost two months. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 07:28, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

The long gap in the action between the middle of January, when Harry has his first anti-Dementor lesson, until the middle of April, when he gets the Firebolt back, has confused many readers, including me, as to exactly when in the year we were. It is not immediately obvious that we have reached June, so the Divination exam seems to be happening a lot earlier in the year than we would expect.

== Explicit date provided in ''Deathly Hallows'' ==

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 16|the last book]], the date of the death of James &amp; Lily Potter is explicitly recorded on their gravestone as &quot;31 October 1981&quot;.
Does this provide a solid enough anchor for the rest of the timelines?
HTH HAND —[[User:Phil Boswell|Phil]] | [[User talk:Phil Boswell|Talk]] 16:01, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

:Grr, explicit dates have become unavoidable now it seems. We've secretly kept them behind the scenes to design the timelines, but now with so much in context now that the series is complete I concede defeat (although I still agree with what I wrote before this last book came out!). With the epilogue especially, my comments last year shouldn't hold up anymore and I'll strike them. I still would like to avoid contextual references (i.e. WWI / WWII) since they don't have to do with the story, but giving some grounding to what's happened with explicit dates is a good idea.

::Well, it only really works for &quot;modern times&quot;: the above discussion also mentioned historical events, such as Riddle/Voldemort's birth: this new data won't make any real difference to those, right? —[[User:Phil Boswell|Phil]] | [[User talk:Phil Boswell|Talk]] 20:39, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

:::No, what's there for the distant past is far enough away that I think it actually makes sense to references dates for some context, as long as we're not playing into other events of the time period too much and those dates are fact and not extrapolated from various pieces of information. What I mean by this is I want solid explanation for why unknown or vague dates are being set, not just fan-like predictions (we're a solid literary guide and need solid references). Since it's clearer in our memory, modern events should be very careful to reference any other contextual events outside the HP series. What I'm writing here has to do with other issues mostly, but those far-away dates don't seem to have any need for reassessment based on new facts from the seventh book. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:19, 26 July 2007 (UTC)

::::For what it's worth, and granted this is a long time after this discussion has been closed, still... Explicit dates do little to enhance the understanding of the story except in a very few cases. The fact that Riddle was born in the 20's, for instance, gives us a better feel for the relative standard of living there, and for the orphanage. Apart from that, the Wizarding world spins on its own, largely independent of ours. I feel that we don't, in honesty, need to add any dates that aren't already there. Having the firm dates in book 7, and the one firm date in book 2, allows us to use real world events if we ned to, but by and large we don't need to.

== Voldemort's second reign of terror ==

Should the series timeline show Voldemort's second time in power from when he regained his body and full powers (late in GoF/June 1995), when the Ministry of Magic became aware of his actions (late in OotP/June 1996), or when he took over the Ministry of Magic (early in DH/1 August 1997)? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:41, 1 May 2011 (UTC)
:The initial reign of Voldemort is based on when he was clearly in power (as it is based on Dumbledore's &quot;They have had precious little to celebrate these past eleven years&quot; in PS:1). We certainly can't date it from his return in late June of GoF, because he was still hidden then. My personal feeling is that his return to power should be from when he declared himself (early June of OotP), because that's when the panic started, to conform to that same pattern. Waiting until August in DH fits the wording better, but not, IMO, the facts; throughout HBP Voldy is exerting considerable influence over the Wizarding population.

== DH epilogue ==

Should the series timeline be extended to include the DH epilogue (which, using the phrase &quot;nineteen years later&quot; [the title of the epilogue] and the known years of the earlier events would fall on 1 September 2017)? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:39, 7 May 2011 (UTC)
:I'd argue against; there isn't really anything that happens then that is timeline-worthy, and I think it might compress the timeline unacceptably to add 20 more years on the end of it. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:46, 7 May 2011 (UTC)

:::::Even on my big monitor, it ended up making the whole thing need side scrolling, which struck me as a not very good thing. I've brought it back to 1050 width, freed up some vertical space by dropping Harry's children to the Hogwarts bar, and eliminated some words that were making things overlap. I think it works a bit better this way... But note that 2017 would be Albus' first year, James Sirius would have been there since at least the year before.

== Careers Advice ==

We have been over this ground a few times in the actual chapter ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 29|OotP:29]]). In the UK / Canadian version of the books, the title is &quot;Careers Advice&quot;, advice on careers that are available. To that end, we have used that form of the word throughout that chapter, and using it the same way in this timeline is simply retaining consistency. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:46, 7 May 2011 (UTC)
:You sure about that? My copy of OotP says &quot;Career Advice&quot;. --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:40, 7 May 2011 (UTC)
::Absolutely positive. Yours is the Scholastic edition, yes? There are several differences between the Scholastic (US) and Bloomsbury (UK) editions. My edition is the Raincoast (Canada), which is word-for-word identical to the Bloomsbury. Generally, we use the UK version as being more authoritative, closer to what the author wanted. If there is content in the US editions that don't appear in the UK version, we try to at least note it. In a case like this, where the difference makes no effective difference, we normally keep to the UK version. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:40, 8 May 2011 (UTC)

::::Elementary, my dear Watson. Your insistence that the name of the chapter was &quot;Career Advice&quot; means that you are using a different edition than I am, and I have seen before that the single letter difference is one of the few places where the Scholastic and Bloomsbury editions differ. Another is in PS:7, or &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; as Scholastic titled theirs, where you will find that Dean Thomas is described as a tall, black boy; that text is absent in the Bloomsbury edition, where there is nothing between mention of Quirrell and his purple turban, and the Sorting of Lisa Turpin. There is a note to that effect [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 7|in our text.]] [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:06, 8 May 2011 (UTC)

== Battle of the Department of Mysteries ==

Should there be a subsection of the &quot;Year Five&quot; section for a timeline of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle at the Department of Mysteries]]? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:28, 13 May 2011 (UTC)
:Withinfocus suggested that at one point, but I'm not sure... it seems to me to be a very linear section of the book, very easy to follow, though fast.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Disassembly/Page}}

== Example: Identify Purpose ==

{{TextBox|1=
What does this function do? What kinds of parameters does it take, and what kind of results (if any) does it return?

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov esi, [ebp + 8]
 mov ebx, 0
 mov eax, 0
 mov ecx, 0
 _Label_1:
 mov ecx, [esi + ebx * 4]
 add eax, ecx
 inc ebx
 cmp ebx, 100
 jne _Label_1
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret 4
&lt;/source&gt;

This function loops through an array of 4 byte integer values, pointed to by esi, and adds each entry. It returns the sum in eax. The only parameter (located in [ebp + 8]) is a pointer to an array of integer values. The comparison between ebx and 100 indicates that the input array has 100 entries in it. The pointer offset [esi + ebx * 4] shows that each entry in the array is 4 bytes wide.}}

== Example: Complete C Prototype ==

{{TextBox|1=
What is this function's C prototype? Make sure to include parameters, return values, and calling convention.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov esi, [ebp + 8]
 mov ebx, 0
 mov eax, 0
 mov ecx, 0
 _Label_1:
 mov ecx, [esi + ebx * 4]
 add eax, ecx
 inc ebx
 cmp ebx, 100
 jne _Label_1
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret 4
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how the '''ret''' function cleans its parameter off the stack? That means that this function is an STDCALL function. We know that the function takes, as its only parameter, a pointer to an array of integers. We do not know, however, whether the integers are signed or unsigned, because the '''je''' command is used for both types of values. We can assume one or the other, and for simplicity, we can assume unsigned values (unsigned and signed values, in this function, will actually work the same way). We also know that the return value is a 4-byte integer value, of the same type as is found in the parameter array. Since the function doesnt have a name, we can just call it &quot;MyFunction&quot;, and we can call the parameter &quot;array&quot; because it is an array. From this information, we can determine the following prototype in C:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 unsigned int STDCALL MyFunction(unsigned int *array);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

== Example: Decompile To C Code ==

{{TextBox|1=
Decompile this code into equivalent C source code.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov esi, [ebp + 8]
 mov ebx, 0
 mov eax, 0
 mov ecx, 0
 _Label_1:
 mov ecx, [esi + ebx * 4]
 add eax, ecx
 inc ebx
 cmp ebx, 100
 jne _Label_1
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret 4
&lt;/source&gt;

Starting with the function prototype above, and the description of what this function does, we can start to write the C code for this function. We know that this function initializes eax, ebx, and ecx before the loop. However, we can see that ecx is being used as simply an intermediate storage location, receiving successive values from the array, and then being added to eax. 

We will create two unsigned integer values, a (for eax) and b (for ebx). We will define both a and b with the '''register''' qualifier, so that we can instruct the compiler not to create space for them on the stack. For each loop iteration, we are adding the value of the array, at location ebx*4 to the running sum, eax. Converting this to our a and b variables, and using C syntax, we see:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 a = a + array[b];
&lt;/source&gt;

The loop could be either a '''for''' loop, or a '''while''' loop. We see that the loop control variable, b, is initialized to 0 before the loop, and is incremented by 1 each loop iteration. The loop tests b against 100, ''after it gets incremented'', so we know that b never equals 100 inside the loop body. Using these simple facts, we will write the loop in 3 different ways:

First, with a '''while''' loop.

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 unsigned int STDCALL MyFunction(unsigned int *array)
 {
    register unsigned int b = 0;
    register unsigned int a = 0;
    while(b != 100)
    {
       a = a + array[b];
       b++;
    }
    return a;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, with a '''for''' loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
unsigned int STDCALL MyFunction(unsigned int *array)
 {
    register unsigned int b;
    register unsigned int a = 0;
    for(b = 0; b != 100; b++)
    {
       a = a + array[b];
    }
    return a;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

And finally, with a '''do-while''' loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
unsigned int STDCALL MyFunction(unsigned int *array)
 {
    register unsigned int b = 0;
    register unsigned int a = 0;
    do
    {
       a = a + array[b];
       b++;
    }while(b != 100);
    return a;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example: Number of Parameters ==

{{TextBox|1=
What parameters does this function take? What calling convention does it use? What kind of value does it return? Write the entire C prototype of this function. Assume all values are unsigned values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov eax, 0
 mov ecx, [ebp + 8]
 cmp ecx, 0
 jne _Label_1
 inc eax
 jmp _Label_2
 :_Label_1
 dec eax
 : _Label_2
 mov ecx, [ebp + 12]
 cmp ecx, 0
 jne _Label_3
 inc eax
 : _Label_3
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret 
&lt;/source&gt;

This function accesses parameters on the stack at [ebp + 8] and [ebp + 12]. Both of these values are loaded into ecx, and we can therefore assume they are 4-byte values. This function doesn't clean its own stack, and the values aren't passed in registers, so we know the function is CDECL. The return value in eax is a 4-byte value, and we are told to assume that all the values are unsigned. Putting all this together, we can construct the function prototype:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 unsigned int CDECL MyFunction(unsigned int param1, unsigned int param2);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

== Example: Identify Branch Structures ==

{{TextBox|1=
How many separate branch structures are in this function? What types are they? Can you give more descriptive names to _Label_1, _Label_2, and _Label_3, based on the structures of these branches?

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov eax, 0
 mov ecx, [ebp + 8]
 cmp ecx, 0
 jne _Label_1
 inc eax
 jmp _Label_2
 :_Label_1
 dec eax
 : _Label_2
 mov ecx, [ebp + 12]
 cmp ecx, 0
 jne _Label_3
 inc eax
 : _Label_3
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret 
&lt;/source&gt;

How many separate branch structures are there in this function? Stripping away the entry and exit sequences, here is the code we have left:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov ecx, [ebp + 8]
 cmp ecx, 0
 jne _Label_1
 inc eax
 jmp _Label_2
 :_Label_1
 dec eax
 : _Label_2
 mov ecx, [ebp + 12]
 cmp ecx, 0
 jne _Label_3
 inc eax
 : _Label_3
&lt;/source&gt;

Looking through, we see 2 '''cmp''' statements. The first cmp statement compares ecx to zero. If ecx is not zero, we go to _Label_1, decrement eax, and then fall through to _Label_2. If ecx is zero, we increment eax, and go to directly to _Label_2. Writing out some pseudocode, we have the following result for the first section:

 if(ecx doesnt equal 0) goto _Label_1
 eax++;
 goto _Label_2
 :_Label_1
 eax--;
 :_Label_2

Since _Label_2 occurs at the end of this structure, we can rename it to something more descriptive, like &quot;End_of_Branch_1&quot;, or &quot;Branch_1_End&quot;. The first comparison tests ecx against 0, and then jumps on not-equal. We can reverse the conditional, and say that _Label_1 is an '''else''' block:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 if(ecx == 0) ;ecx is param1 here
 {
    eax++;
 }
 else
 {
    eax--;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

So we can rename _Label_1 to something else descriptive, such as &quot;Else_1&quot;. The rest of the code block, after Branch_1_End (_Label_2) is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov ecx, [ebp + 12]
 cmp ecx, 0
 jne _Label_3
 inc eax
 : _Label_3
&lt;/source&gt;

We can see immediately that _Label_3 is the end of this branch structure, so we can immediately call it &quot;Branch_2_End&quot;, or something else. Here, we are again comparing ecx to 0, and if it is not equal, we jump to the end of the block. If it is equal to zero, however, we increment eax, and then fall out the bottom of the branch. We can see that there is no '''else''' block in this branch structure, so we don't need to invert the condition. We can write an '''if''' statement directly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 if(ecx == 0) ;ecx is param2 here
 {
    eax++;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

== Example: Convert To C ==

{{TextBox|1=
Write the equivalent C code for this function. Assume all parameters and return values are unsigned values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov eax, 0
 mov ecx, [ebp + 8]
 cmp ecx, 0
 jne _Label_1
 inc eax
 jne _Label_2
 :_Label_1
 dec eax
 : _Label_2
 mov ecx, [ebp + 12]
 cmp ecx, 0
 jne _Label_3
 inc eax
 : _Label_3
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret 
&lt;/source&gt;

Starting with the C function prototype from answer 1, and the conditional blocks in answer 2, we can put together a pseudo-code function, without variable declarations, or a return value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 unsigned int CDECL MyFunction(unsigned int param1, unsigned int param2)
 {
    if(param1 == 0)
    {
       eax++;
    }
    else
    {
       eax--;
    }
    if(param2 == 0)
    {
       eax++;
    }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, we just need to create a variable to store the value from eax, which we will call &quot;a&quot;, and we will declare as a '''register''' type:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 unsigned int CDECL MyFunction(unsigned int param1, unsigned int param2)
 {
    register unsigned int a = 0;
    if(param1 == 0)
    {
       a++;
    }
    else
    {
       a--;
    }
    if(param2 == 0)
    {
       a++;
    }
    return a;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Granted, this function isn't a particularly useful function, but at least we know what it does.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This material from the old &quot;CISC Certification&quot; book, should be merged into the appropriate chapter:

===Introduction to the Internet===

The Internet has become an essential resource in our society. It is necessary for the day to day operation of many businesses, government and educational institutions, and even home users. The Internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks. The networks are of varying sizes and can be private, public and government owned. A stable, well working network requires a full understanding of its workings on all levels.

The Internet can be compared to current telephone networks in the world, a road system, or even the circulatory/nervous system of your body. Just as cars can function without roads, so too can computers function without networking. However, like roads, networking greatly improves and extends the capabilities of computers.

High-speed access to the Internet is currently available to the general public in most the western world and large parts of Asia. High-speed access is still somewhat lacking in remote areas due to cost.

End users computers sit at the very edge of the internet, much as the leaves on a tree are the very end of the twigs, or a person's driveway the end of the road system.

=== Network Topologies ===

There are various ways computers can be physically connected.  These are called topologies.

*'''Bus''' - In a bus topology, all computers connect to the same 'wire'.
*'''Star''' - A star topology consists of a central 'hub', which each computer connects to with a separate wire.
*'''Ring''' - Computer in a ring topology are connected in a loop. Information is passed around the loop until it reaches its destination.
*'''Hierarchical''' - A hierarchical topology involves several distinct layers, where each layer combines the connections of lower layers.
*'''Mesh''' - A mesh topology is unique: each computer has multiple connections to other computers.

The Internet can be best described as a hierarchical mesh.

== Relevancy of book ==

Just wondering if anybody is reading/editing this book, and if anybody is likely to use it as part of their CCNA study (the subject is broadly covered). If there is any interest I'll keep contributing, but not gonna wast time writing a book no one will read?

:I believe there is room for a free, living book on CCNA that keeps up with the changes in the Certification and technology.  I would like to donate a good outline and several articles and diagrams.  It needs a lot of organization and materials, but after it starts taking shape, it will be widely read.[[User:kgrr|&lt;font style=&quot;background: lightblue&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;kgrr&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:kgrr|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]][[User:Kgrr|Kgrr]]16:35, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== fixing links ==

All the copying from wikipedia has left the book with a lot of bad links.
They Need to be fixed. We have a few things we can do.
We can:
Remove the links
find an existing link to
add pages/books that fit the links


I would like us to decide what we feel would be best for this book.
If no one adds to this discussion. I will move ahead fixing this.
--[[User:2tailakitsune|2tailakitsune]] 20:06, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

== Lets try this again ==

Soon the exam is going to change. So we need some incite into what is going to change. The Cisco site tells all.

2nd, most of the pages are still just copes of other wiki pages. Some of the things in the pages are not on the exam, and a lot of things are missing from the pages. Most of the pages that are not just copes are stubs at best.

All of the things in the INTO exam can be learned from other Wiki books. I feel that this book would not be hard to do.

I'm going to start cutting out things that are not on the CCNA Exam.

== % Complete ==
Some of the % complete boxes seem horribly wrong. I am going to go through the book and update some of them, as I work through it.

== rhetorical question ==

When a character poses a rhetorical question in a sentence of dialogue should I use a question mark at the end?

for example: 

&quot;I don’t think anyone knew. I mean, they might have guessed. It was all so long ago who can remember.&quot;

After remember?

dmc



A: Yes, you do need a question mark in this situation—inside the quotation marks at the end. (A comma after &quot;ago&quot; would help as well.)

rbs

Answer: Your example would best be written this way, &quot;I don't think anyone knew. I mean, they might have guessed. It was so long ago. Who can remember?&quot; I would divide the last sentence into two.

-----

Any thoughts on specific styles/approaches to writing comments for online/wiki writing (to go in your 'advanced' section)?

== rhetoric ==

what different types  of rhetoric are there?

Answer: There are three basic kinds: Judicial Rhetoric, Deliberative Rhetoric, and Epideictic Rhetoric. Judicial rhetoric is used to judge what is right or wrong- for example a lawyer defending in court uses judicial rhetoric. Deliberative rhetoric is used to persuade a person to do something, like you would use to persuade friend to come to dinner. Epideictic rhetoric is used to praise (or blame) somebody. It is most often used in eulogies.

== Rhetorical Description  ==

Do you have any example of description of a person?

== Summarizing ==

Can you give me some tips about summarizing an article?

Think of it as an extreme condensation of the article, one that shows what the article is about and what it emphasizes. If the title is &quot;John Adams&quot; -- then ''which'' John Adams is the article about? Is it the second President of the United States? Is it the composer? Or is it someone else? To get something so basically wrong is to show either failure to understand the article, a superficial reading, or failure to look at it.  

Take the most important parts of an article. If the article is a description, then look for the key pints of the article. Begin with a definition of the item in question and then the leading facts -- the ones that the author seems to hold most important, even if those leading facts are less interesting than some tangential material that you find more interesting. 

The title is a clue. Ideally an author of what purports to be truth will create a structure that centers upon the aspects of a phenomenon, object, event, or work that the title suggests.  It could be very broad or very narrow. Needless to say, an article on &quot;The Tiger -- an Endangered Species&quot; will say little about circus tricks involving tigers, and an article &quot;Tiger Taming&quot;, on training tigers to perform in circuses without getting the trainer or the tigers hurt, won't dwell on a tiger's endangered state in the wild. &quot;The Battle of Waterloo&quot; won't be about the desirability or non-desirability of war, it won't be about the childhoods of Wellington or Napoleon, and it certainly won't be about D-Day. When it happened, participants, events leading to it, how troops were moved into battle, size of forces and their weapons, the win-loss situation, and consequences will all be relevant.     

With an object, a living thing, a place, or a natural phenomenon in general you will need to describe it so that you prevent confusion. If the article is &quot;Pencils&quot;, then you might want to show what pencils are, their primary uses, what materials they are made of, when they came into use (typically, when they were invented) how many are made, what was used before them, and characteristics that make them desirable or undesirable.

An author might try to connect very different things, so look for such -- and find the connection. Show it.

== Rules for writing  ==

Can someone tell me what are the rules for writing not only and but also.

== ESSAY ==

HOW DO YOU WRITE AN ESSAY WITHOUT KNOWING 
ABOUT THE SUBJECT?

First, clarify what is asked for. Maybe you got verbal instructions from someone who did not speak clearly. Maybe you have a difficulty with hearing. Most good teachers gladly accommodate a student on that by putting the assignment in writing. 

Second, find out what the subject is. Wikipedia is one of the most accessible stores of basic information in a wide variety of subjects. Maybe you know more about the subject than you think for the simple reason that someone has called something by some odd name unfamiliar to you.

Find multiple sources for information. Those can include books and magazines. Video? That's tricky. If your essay is on &quot;Lions&quot; and you see a wildlife documentary on lions, then how do you cite that you saw lions in a group? However instructive video is, watching it for information is not an effective use of time when you are trying to get information quickly as you must do for creating an essay under the pressure of time. You can search the Internet for websites that offer the information that you seek. That's reading, but it's easier to find some information on the Internet than to take a trip to a library far away. 

NEVER -- NEVER -- NEVER directly copy any material, especially from an encyclopedia of any kind, and then put it into your essay unmodified or even paraphrased. Your teacher will know what is in Encyclopedia Brittanica, World Book, and perhaps the June 1962 edition of National Geographic Magazine should it be in the classroom. Your teacher will also be able to look into Wikipedia for the relevant article, and if your article on George Washington reads like this:

''George Washington (February 22, 1732 – December 14, 1799) served as the first President of the United States of America (1789–1797), and led the Continental Army to victory over the Kingdom of Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).

''The Continental Congress appointed Washington commander-in-chief of the American revolutionary forces in 1775. The following year, he forced the British out of Boston, lost New York City, and crossed the Delaware River in New Jersey, defeating the surprised enemy units later that year. As a result of his strategy, Revolutionary forces captured the two main British combat armies at Saratoga and Yorktown. Negotiating with Congress, the colonial states, and French allies, he held together a tenuous army and a fragile nation amid the threats of disintegration and failure. Following the end of the war in 1783, Washington retired to his plantation at Mount Vernon, prompting an incredulous King George III to state, &quot;If he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world.&quot;''

(These two paragraphs come unmodified from the beginning of the Wikipedia article &quot;George Washington&quot; -- and your instructor will discover that quickly and easily -- then you will have committed plagiarism. That is a huge no-no in writing; it shows that you did nothing creative and individual. You WILL get a poor grade!

You can use encyclopedias for finding other sources of information. (You may make a direct quite of the clever words of a well-renowned thinker -- but identify the person and the source).

The rest is easy to say and hard to do. You then find different threads of information and put them together in a way that only you can do. That is exactly what you would do if you knew something about the subject in the first place.

= About the Exam =

The purpose of this page is to make you more familiar with the test itself, what options you have, and how to sign up.

==The Available Exams==
To receive the [http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le0/le9/learning_certification_type_home.html CCNA certification], you must pass either:
* the ICND1 Exam (640-822) and the ICND2 (640-816)
* the combined CCNA Exam (640-802)

===The Material Covered In Each Exam===

The '''ICND1''' covers &quot;Network Types, Network Media, Switching Fundamentals, TCP/IP, IP Addressing and Routing, WAN Technologies, Operating and Configuring IOS Devices, and Managing Network Environments.&quot; [http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/current_exams/640-822.html More information about the ICND1] is available from Cisco.

The '''ICND2''' covers &quot;Extending Switched Networks with VLANS, Determining IP Routes, Managing IP traffic with Access Lists, Establishing Point-to-Point connections, and Establishing Frame Relay Connections.&quot; [http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/current_exams/640-816.html More information about the ICND2] is available from Cisco.

The combined '''CCNA''' covers all topics cover on the ICND1 and ICND2. [http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/current_exams/640-802.html More information about the CCNA] is available from Cisco. 

===Which Should You Take?===

The cost of taking the combined CCNA test is significantly lower (approximately $295 as on 20Mar2012) than taking the ICND1 and ICND2 Exams (approximately $150 as on 20Mar2012 each). The only disadvantage to taking the combined CCNA is that you will be tested on a larger amount of information. The ICND1 and ICND2 exams allow you to focus on smaller subsets of the entire course.

==The Format of the Test==

All tests are given on a PC at the testing center. Everyone who is comfortable using a computer should have no difficulties using the testing software. If you like, you can take a practice test to get the hang of the program. 

All questions fall into one of the following categories:
* Multiple choice
* Fill-in-the-blank
* Drag-and-drop
* Simulated lab

The multiple choice questions requires you to select a circle next to the correct answer. Some questions will have multiple correct answers. In these cases, you will usually be told how many answers you should select.

The fill-in-the-blank questions require you to enter the word that missing from a sentence. You must type the answer exactly right to receive credit.

The drag-and-drop questions require you to click and drag a button or icon to another location on the screen. Often you will have to order multiple items into a list with the correct order.

The simulated lab will give you access to a theoretical network with multiple routers. You must be able to navigate the routers, find the cause of a malfunction, and fix it. To prepare for these questions, you should practice on a real lab set-up or on a network simulator until you feel comfortable. There are many software network simulators. One of these is available [http://www.softpile.com/Education/Miscellaneous/Review_19075_index.html here].

==Signing up for Exams==

You can sign up to take the test with [http://www.vue.com/cisco/ Pearson Vue]. As of now, Pearson Vue is the only authorized testing center for CCNA certifications. You should be able to schedule the time of your test and will be able to select the location from a list of Testing Centers in your area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Perseus''' is the son of Zeus and Danaë, only child and daughter of King Acrisius of Argos. He was known as the slayer of the Gorgon Medusa. Before his birth, it was predicted by the oracle of Apollo that he would kill his grandfather. King Acrisius first locked Danaë in a bronze house, but Zeus saw the beautiful Danaë and visited her in the form of showers of gold (because the bronze house was sunk underground and only part of the roof was left open). Danaë became pregnant and kept it secret to her father, but soon it was discovered (when Perseus was a young child). When Acrisius found out about the boy, Danaë told to him that Perseus was her son to Zeus. Even though the young Perseus was the son of Zeus, Acrisius was still afraid of the prediction about the young boy, so Acrisius locked the mother and son into a chest and floated them in the sea.

Perseus and his mother drifted to an island called Seriphus and was discovered, still inside the chest, by a fisherman named Dictys. Dictys took them in to his home where he lived with his wife, and they were treated as his family.

The ruler of the island, Polydectes, fell in love with Danaë and thought that Perseus would hinder his plan to marry her. He thought of a plan that would get rid of Perseus: He announce that he will marry Danaë and invited all his friends to a celebration. Perseus was among the guests. Each guest should have a present for the celebration, but Perseus had nothing to give. Polydectes asked Perseus to slay and behead the Gorgon Medusa and bring back her head as his gift. Perseus agreed to do so.

He received a mirror-like shield to take on his journey. Because the Gorgons could turn anybody to stone by looking in their eyes, Perseus cleverly looked in the shield, so that Medusa couldn't look directly into his eyes.

ok, first of all, routers should be considered. 
* as far as i know you can still run a webserver if port 80 is blocked, for example by using a an adress like 127.0.0.1:31337
* i changed the whatismyip.com to whatismyip.org, because the latter is ad-free and just contains the IP adress
* if you're connected directly you can also see your own IP in the network prefs.
* there is advertising language in use &quot;as you'd expect, apple makes it easy&quot;. yeah neutral...

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Open Source and Open Access - a New Revolution in Publishing=

==Open Source==
Open source software is software that includes source code and is usually available at no charge. There are additional requirements besides the availability of source code that a program must meet before it is considered open source including: the software must be free to redistribute; derivative works must be allowed; the license can not discriminate against any persons; and the license cannot discriminate against any fields of endeavor. Software that is licensed under an open source license allows for a community of developers from around the world to improve the software by providing enhancements and bug fixes.  The recent success of free software projects such as GNU/Linux, Mozilla Firefox, and the Apache web server has demonstrated that quality works can be created even in the absence of a copyright-enforced monopoly rent [2.1]. Instead, these products use copyright to enforce their license terms, which are designed to ensure the free nature of the work, rather than securing exclusive rights for the holder for monetary gain; such a license is called a copyleft, free software license, or open source license.  Mozilla is an example of an open source license.

Libraries can realize many advantages by using open source software. One of the most obvious advantages is cost. Open source software is generally available for free (or at a minimal cost) and it is not necessary to purchase additional licenses for every computer that the program is to be installed on or for every person who is going to use the software. Open source software not only has a lower acquisition cost than proprietary software, it often has lower implementation and support costs as well.

Another advantage is evaluating usability.  It is easier to evaluate open source software then proprietary software. Since open source software is typically freely available to download, librarians and systems administrators can install complete production-ready versions of software and evaluate competing packages. This can be done not only without any license fees, but also without having to stick to a vendor's trial period, evaluate a limited version of the software, or deal with the vendor's sales personnel. If the library likes an overall open source package but would like a few added features they can add these features themselves. This is possible because the source code is available. Even if a library does not have in-house expertise they can benefit from source code availability because another library may be able to provide them the fix or they can hire a consultant to make the changes that they desire. Fuchs (2004) points out that if a proprietary program &quot;is deficient in some way [the user] must wait until the vendor decides it is financially viable to develop the enhancement -- an event that may never occur.&quot; With open source software the user can develop the enhancement themselves.

Open source software allows for more support options. Proprietary software vendors often package service with the product. This is particularly true of proprietary library-specific software. When support from a vendor is inadequate it is an additional expense to purchase another tier of support, assuming that it is even available. Open source software allows for different vendors to compete for support contracts based on quality of service and on price. Access to the source code also allows for self-support when practical and desired.  There are also usually several support forums for developers and users to troubleshoot and brainstorm off each other.

 
==Open Access==
Open access to scholarly information has been a hot topic for debate among librarians, scholars, and publishers over the last few years. Recent proposals by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States (requiring for scholarly works that come out of NIH funded research to be made available via NIH's PubMedCentral open access database), by the government in the United Kingdom (requiring that all UK government-funded research to be available via open access), and by others has expanded this debate. Various definitions of open access exist with the Budapest Open Access Initiative definition being the most widely used (Goodman 2004). Other definitions include the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities, the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing, and the Washington DC Principles for Free Access to Science. While there are multiple definitions of open access, open access basically calls for scholarly publications to be made freely available to libraries and end users.

There are eight versions of open access that are most popular. They are: 1) e-print archive (authors self-archive prints), 2) unqualified (immediate and full open access publication of a journal, 3) dual mode (both print subscription and open access versions of a journal are offered), 4) delayed open access (open access is available after a certain period of time), 5) author fee (authors pay a fee to support open access), 6) partial open access (some articles from a journal are available via open access), 7) abstract (open access available to table of contents/abstracts, and 8) co-op (institutional members support open access journals).

The growth of the open access movement is partially in response to the enormous costs of many scholarly journals. With traditional journal publication methods it is not uncommon for an institution to have to pay for an article twice. First they pay scholars to produce the work and then the institution's library pays to purchase the work back from the journal publisher. Anderson (2004) is correct that there is no such thing as free information and that there are costs involved in producing scholarly information. However, with the advent of new technologies and software programs, it is becoming increasingly less expensive to compile and distribute scholarly information. By using different funding methods and electronic delivery of journals, the costs can be absorbed by alternative means to subscription fees. One of the great benefits to open access is that libraries in smaller institutions or in economically disadvantaged areas around the world can have greater access to these scholarly resources.

Open access helps to ensure long-term access to scholarly articles. Unlike articles that are licensed in traditional article databases, libraries and others can create local copies and repositories of these resources. Libraries, by working together to make repositories of open access literature, can ensure continued access to these scholarly publications into the distant future. 

===The Budapest Initiative===
[http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml  The Budapest Intiative]is an organization striving for open access publishing of scholarlly materials using the Internet as the primary form of dissemenation.

===Manner of Access===
The typical manner of access is electronic access over the Web to HTML or PDF versions, with publication in other formats considered as optional and subsidiary. The entire OA concept depends upon the very low incremental cost for additional users of electronic material delivered over the Internet, whereas printed material must have an incremental cost for each copy printed. (This can be a small cost if we are talking about millions of copies, but we are not.) The financing of OA is always computed on the basis of electronic-only publication. To this calculation can be added the cost of the production of a small number of printed copies, either from specialized PDF or as short-run printing of the electronic version. These versions can be sold conventionally by subscription to those who wish the print for intensive reading of key journals, those requiring print for taxation or regulatory purposes, and those maintaining print archival backup as a supplement to electronic archiving. Before the development of electronic distribution, there were proposals for the distribution of materials in other manners. These generally involved the distribution of individual articles in paper or microform, or the distribution of a totally comprehensive periodical in large numbers. (4)
A decreasing number of locations remain without suitable access to the Internet, but these areas almost always have even worse access to printed publications.  Facilities for electronic access are likely to improve long before those for print. 

===Type of Material===
&quot;Scholarly publications&quot; cover a very wide range and can be taken to mean all scientific material, or only journal articles, or only those journal articles that are primary research reports. The concept is often extended to include material that is technically &quot;unpublished,&quot; such as preprints or working drafts or primary data. It excludes material from which authors expect direct monetary profit, such as textbooks or popularizations. It recognizes that authors eventually expect some form of psychological or monetary compensation, such as the increased prestige among their colleagues, the satisfaction at the diffusion of their ideas, and the possibility of hiring, promotion, or tenure. 
The basic material covered is primary journal articles, defined as those in which original experiments, discoveries, or calculations are presented. Their publication is described in detail elsewhere, (5) but what follows is an outline of steps at which some of the controversies of OA occur. Typically, such articles are peer-reviewed before publication by two or three other scholars in the field. The reviewers generally recommend either rejection, or acceptance with alterations; the process of making the alterations is brokered by the editor. There are variations, and for some journals, the editor or editorial board alone decides. The end result of peer review is the author's accepted final draft.

The journal editor is generally compensated, at least for expenses. The peer reviewers are generally not directly compensated. (6) The peer-reviewed author's accepted final draft is checked before printing by copyeditors, who are usually paid staff or outside service providers. The author does not usually see the revisions at this stage. The costs associated with these inherently human and non-automated processes are always present, even if not paid in money. However, these costs are dependent only on the size of the journal, the production quality, and the number of articles reviewed (both those accepted and the usually greater number not accepted)--not upon the number of users. A difference exists between the facilities needed for large and small systems, but the effect is small compared to the production for print. 

When only electronic versions are produced, the material is usually converted into the publisher's PDF, and added to the journal's Article Database. The cost of operating such a database depends primarily upon the size of the journal, and only to a slight extent upon the number of readers. When both print and electronic versions are produced, usually a common XML version is prepared. From this version comes the HTML and PDF versions for online distribution, and PDF for printing. Producing print adds the cost both of the preparation of the final version for printing, (which is independent of the size of the edition) and the cost for printing and distribution of each copy (which does depend on the size of the edition).

Secondary material, such as editorials and review articles in academic journals, are sometimes OA and sometimes not. News items, explanations or summaries of current work, and announcements are usually written by paid writers, at least for major publications. Paid writers expect to be actually paid in money, and most earn their primary income from this source. Major review articles are usually arranged in advance, and some relatively small monetary compensation is often provided--probably nobody makes a living writing review articles alone. Book reviewers are generally compensated by getting to keep the book they review. Although they could sell these books, probably nobody makes a full living in this way either. Some of the ethical arguments that call for the public to have access to publicly supported research do not necessarily apply to review articles, and neither do some of the economic reasons. A research article (and thus the single journal in which it is published) is inherently a monopoly--no other article can be substituted. That is not usually the case with reviews, where there may be a number of equivalents covering the same material. The users, however, often do not make this distinction and expect them all to be OA. 

Some journals contain advertisements, and their treatment under OA varies.  Some textbooks and similar items are available as OA, with or without a paid equivalent. Also common is OA availability for older editions, often developed and maintained on a voluntary basis. Some electronic publications carry material that is not in the printed versions. The continuing Nature Web Focus on OA is one example, and supplementary data is another. It is customary to have OA to this material even when the base journal is non-OA. The spread of OA has reached beyond the sciences. Scholarly book publishing in the humanities has similar problems, and the distribution of primary data in the humanities is now often organized at least partially as OA. (7)

==What All This Openness Means==
Open access and open source software each offer a number of significant benefits to libraries. When they are combined the results can be even greater. Open source can help libraries provide patrons with easier access to open access materials and other resources. There are literally thousands of open access titles available and without open source or standards it would be very difficult to find what one is looking for or to view various articles. Imagine the difficulty, and costs involved, in maintaining a library's information technology infrastructure if each electronic journal required a separate, proprietary piece of software to read or search the journal. Open standards together with open source make it possible to create interoperable systems to access the literature in various open access journals seamlessly.

Open source can help preserve long-term access to open access and other types of electronic journals.  Without the assistance of the software manufacturer (who may or may not even still be in business, let alone willing to help) proprietary software and file formats may make migration practically impossible. By utilizing open source software and open standards from the beginning, libraries can assure that this type of systems migration will be possible years down the road.

Not only has the growing cost of serials caused libraries to drop journal subscriptions, it has also factored into a 26% decrease of monograph acquisitions by the typical research library between 1986 and 1999 (Create Change 2002). Library budgets can be reallocated to monographs and other areas because of the lower costs typically involved with open access, open source, and open standards. 

==Implications of Open Access==
Both of the facts that information is inherently costly, and that information is not usually a public good, pose challenges for the idea of open access. For information to be made freely and permanently available to the public, the costs of creation, publication, and distribution must be absorbed by someone other than those who wish to use it. The Internet eliminates most distribution costs, but not all of them, and does not affect creative costs or publication costs to any appreciable degree.

Do these inconvenient facts mean that open access is not desirable or that it cannot work? No. But they do define some limits to the options, and a recognition of those limits should lead to patience with publishers that are moving more slowly towards that model than most might like. Any proposal that is built on the premise that information is inherently free, or that online publication can be undertaken without significant cost, will not work in the real world because both of those premises are demonstrably incorrect. If  the intrinsic costliness of information is not taken into account, it will be hard to discuss intelligently the intractable economic realities that govern its creation and distribution, let alone formulating pricing and distribution strategies that will provide maximum public benefit.

Nevertheless, the problems that have led to the current controversy over journal pricing and open access are real and need to be solved in some way. Clearly the status quo is insupportable; if the price of scholarly journals continues to rise at the present rate, research libraries will quickly lose the ability to meet the needs of their patrons. At the same time, it is not reasonable to expect all journal publishers to move immediately into an open-access model simply because the Internet has lowered the cost of distribution.

= Copyright Concerns in Open-Source =

==What is Copyright?==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright Copyright] is a set of exclusive rights regulating the use of a particular expression of an idea or information. At its most general, it is literally &quot;the right to copy&quot; an original creation. In most cases, these rights are of limited duration. The symbol for copyright is ©, and in some jurisdictions may alternately be written (c). 

An author's exclusive right to his creation is mandated in the US Constitution in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, which also gives Congress the power to enact statutes: To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.(See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright Copyright], Wikipedia, for a more detailed explanation of copyright basics).

==Copyright, a historical perspective==

Historically, U.S. copyright law has sought to balance private incentives to engage in creative activity with the social benefits that arise from the widespread use of creative works. In the past, the emergence of new technologies has threatened to tilt the scales of the copyright control by loosening the control that copyright owners enjoy over subsequent uses of their works. Such a development could reduce the revenues that creators of copyrighted material obtain from their efforts and thereby restrict the future supply of creative works. Over the years, however, three important factors have helped to preserve some balance in the U.S. copyright regime: the judicial interpretation of existing copyright law; the enactment of new legislation; and the ability of copyright holders and the industries that market and distribute creative products to find ways of applying those new technologies to generate sufficient returns to maintain the flow of new creative works. 

An economically efficient outcome in markets for creative works is elusive. Efficiency in markets for goods and services generally requires that the cost of producing the last (or marginal) unit must equal society's valuation of it. However, once a copyrighted work has been created, relatively few costs are incurred in its reproduction and distribution--especially if the work is in digital form. Offering a creative work at the relatively low marginal cost of reproduction and distribution, therefore, would not generate the returns needed to recoup the overall expense of supplying it. To encourage creative works, copyright law has traditionally allowed for licensing rights that enable pricing above marginal cost, while placing a limit on the scope and duration of copyright protection to ensure that creative works eventually become widely available. Copyright law therefore accepts some static inefficiency (copyrighted works are typically not distributed as widely as is economically feasible) in the interests of beneficial dynamic effects (getting those works created in the first place). 

It is difficult to determine how close the current copyright regime is to being efficient--that is, whether the optimal balance between private incentives and social benefits has been reached. Given society's desire for creative works, as well as its endowments of talent, technology, and other resources needed to generate and distribute those works, the question is whether current law and practice provide incentives for the greatest quantity and highest quality of original works to be created and consumed over time. Although the answer to that question is not straightforward, the magnitude of illicit consumption of copyrighted works in digital form today--music files shared over the Internet, for example, or movies and software illegally reproduced and distributed on CD-ROM--suggests that potential efficiency gains can be realized by applying advances in digital technology to legal markets for creative works. 
  
==The Digital Challenge to Copyright Law==

The digitization of creative content poses a more serious challenge to copyright law than did earlier episodes of technological advance. A particularly significant aspect of that challenge is that digital technologies continue to increase the ways in which individuals can consume and enjoy creative works--for example, by &quot;ripping&quot; music files from a CD to store on a computer or portable music device--despite the fact that copyright law does not explicitly permit those uses without the authorization of the copyright owner. At the same time, advances in digital technologies provide copyright owners with growing capacity to either restrict or charge for subsequent uses of their creative works. 

Furthermore, copyrighted works in digital form can be flawlessly and inexpensively reproduced and instantaneously distributed worldwide. Copyright holders consequently fear that unauthorized copying and redistribution of their works will cause their economic returns to decline. 
At the same time, copyright law today applies to a growing number of products. Although the most prominent disputes over digital copyright concern music and movies, copyright law also applies directly to other products, such as computer software. Some manufacturers of software and other products have responded to technological advances by proposing new types of product licenses to protect and extend their commercial interests. Those new licensing practices could, however, potentially run counter to consumers' interests. 

Changes to copyright law, moreover, can have ramifications that extend beyond the concerns of producers and consumers of copyrighted material to the well-being of related sectors of the economy. The availability of creative content in digital form contributes to the growth of industries such as computer hardware and peripherals, as well as telecommunications goods and services. Measures to protect copyrighted works--for example, a government mandate that a particular access- or copy-control technology be used to prevent infringement of copyrighted materials in digital form--therefore require careful deliberation. When and how the digital copyright debate is resolved could influence the nature and pace of future technological progress--and hence the growth of the economy. 
  
==Economics and Copyright==

Because of the growing number and diversity of interests with a stake in the digital copyright debate, many observers believe that the Congress may need to legislate a balance in copyright law between private incentives and societal gains. Economic analysis can illuminate the Congress's search for that balance, but it cannot provide unambiguous conclusions about the best weighting of the interests of copyright holders and consumers. The &quot;best&quot; policy implies a distribution of returns based as much on what is fair as on what is efficient. Economics does not provide answers to questions of fairness. 

Although economic analysis may not be able to determine the best copyright regime in terms of fairness or other norms of society--it cannot, for example, identify which group(s) should gain and which should lose as a result of any revision in copyright law--it can provide insights into how private incentives and social benefits in markets for creative works might be structured. To make outcomes in markets for copyrighted goods as efficient as possible--that is, to enable society to obtain the most from the creative efforts of its members--economic reasoning can offer several general principles for legislative deliberations about revisions to copyright law in response to technological change: 

Property rights and other elements of a regulatory regime for creative works should be regarded as instruments for allocating creative resources. Hence, existing copyright law should not be viewed as an absolute, inviolable set of rights to which either creators or consumers are entitled.

Revisions to copyright law should be made without regard to the vested interests of particular business and consumer groups. Instead, they should be assessed with regard to their consequences for efficiency in markets for creative works and other products.

Property rights are not free. For a system of property rights to be accepted and upheld, the costs of establishing and enforcing that regime must not exceed the eventual benefits from it. 
The usefulness of those general principles is not diminished by several additional factors that may constrain the specific contributions that economic analysis eventually makes to the digital copyright debate. The economically efficient level of copyright protection is difficult to determine, for example, because copyright applies to diverse creative works that incorporate varying degrees of creative and artistic expression--from journalism to literature, music, and movies--and to works of a more technical nature, such as software. A single property rights regime, therefore, may not produce efficiency in markets for all of those products. 

Furthermore, not all aspects of markets for creative works lend themselves to economic analysis. In particular, while economists may confidently expect that abolishing copyright protection altogether will reduce the level and quality of creative output, they cannot easily predict how a less dramatic change in compensating copyright owners will affect the number or quality of creative works being produced.

Because the advances in digital technology that currently challenge copyright law are part of a broader trend in the development of information technologies, moreover, actions motivated by other concerns may have an effect on the feasibility and desirability of revisions to copyright law. For example, regulation of the peer-to-peer networks that enable file-sharing among personal computer users--the primary source of copyright infringement worries today--may eventually be justified not to protect intellectual property but rather to address concerns about other activities carried out on those networks, such as the dissemination of computer viruses and software packages that surreptitiously monitor an individual's computer use.

==Creative Commons==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_License  ''See Creative Commons'']


The Creative Commons License refers to the name of several copyright licenses released on December 16, 2002 by Creative Commons, a U.S. non-profit corporation founded in 2001.

These licenses all grant certain baseline rights, such as the right to distribute the copyrighted work on file sharing networks. The rest of the license depends on the version, and is comprised of a selection of four conditions:

'''Attribution (by)''': Permit others to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and derivative works based upon it only if they give you credit.

'''Noncommercial or NonCommercial (nc)''': Permit others to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and derivative works based upon it only for noncommercial purposes.

'''No Derivative Works or NoDerivs (nd)''': Permit others to copy, distribute, display and perform only verbatim copies of the work, not derivative works based upon it.

'''ShareAlike (sa)''': Permit others to distribute derivative works only under a license identical to the license that governs your work. (See also copyleft.)

Mixing and matching these conditions produces sixteen possible combinations, of which eleven are valid Creative Commons licenses. Of the five invalid combinations, four include both the &quot;nd&quot; and &quot;sa&quot; clauses, which are mutually exclusive; and one includes none of the clauses, which is equivalent to releasing one's work into the public domain. The five of the eleven valid licenses thats that lack the Attribution element have been phased out because 98% of licensors requested Attribution, but are still available for viewing on the website [1]. There are thus six regularly used licenses:

   1. Attribution alone (by)
   2. Attribution + Noncommercial (by-nc)
   3. Attribution + NoDerivs (by-nd)
   4. Attribution + ShareAlike (by-sa)
   5. Attribution + Noncommercial + NoDerivs (by-nc-nd)
   6. Attribution + Noncommercial + ShareAlike (by-nc-sa)

None of the Creative Commons licenses have been certified by the Open Source Initiative. The Debian GNU/Linux distribution does not believe that any of the licenses adheres to the Debian Free Software Guidelines. The Free Software Foundation recommends the licenses for creative works other than software and software documentation, provided the &quot;nc&quot; and &quot;nd&quot; options are not used. [2]

Creative Commons licenses are currently available under 31 different jurisdictions worldwide, with nine others under development. [3]</text>

=== &lt;tt&gt;record&lt;/tt&gt; makes new stuff old ===

The '''record''' command takes the changes which only exist in your working directory (or the pending patch) and updates the pristine tree.  The result of a record operation is a new patch.

[[Image:Darcs-record-before.png|center|The darcs record command]]

=== &lt;tt&gt;replace&lt;/tt&gt; for renaming tokens ===

The '''replace''' command is useful for explictly telling darcs to replace one word with another (for example, a variable name, if you are a programmer).  

Note that because of the underlying patch theory, replace only works if the new word doesn't already exist in the file.  Darcs will helpfully let you know if you try to replace something you cannot.  Also, there is a switch for forcing the replacement, but the resulting patch is not a clean darcs-replace patch, but a combination of that, and what you would have gotten if you had edited the file in a text editor.  In short, forcing darcs to replace when it really doesn't want to can lead to counter-intuitive results.

== Playing with files ==

We saw '''add''' in the last chapter.  What about the other file-related commands?

=== &lt;tt&gt;add&lt;/tt&gt; tells darcs to pay attention ===

'''add''', unsuprisingly, adds a file or directory to the list of files that darcs is paying attention to.

[[Image:Darcs-repo-add-before.png|center|The darcs add command]]

=== &lt;tt&gt;mv&lt;/tt&gt; for moving or renaming ===

'''mv''' lets you rename a file or put it in a different directory.  This command updates the pending patch with a move command.

=== you don't need &lt;tt&gt;remove&lt;/tt&gt; ===

You might think that '''remove''' gets rid of a file, but actually all it does is to remove it from the list of files that darcs is paying attention to.  You probably just want to delete the file instead (eg: with &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt;).  Darcs will notice and record the change next time you &lt;tt&gt;darcs record&lt;/tt&gt; that file.  So what's the remove command good for?  It might be handy if you want to just remove the file from darcs, without actually getting rid of your physical copy.  This is most useful when you've accidentally used '''darcs add''' on a file you don't want darcs to pay attention to.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The commands ==

=== get ===

&lt;code&gt;darcs get&lt;/code&gt; makes a copy of an entire darcs repository.  Note that we only get the recorded patches (and pristine tree), not any of the pending stuff.

[[Image:Darcs-repo-get-before.png|center|during darcs get]]

=== pull/push ===

&lt;code&gt;darcs pull&lt;/code&gt; copies from some other repository patches that you do not have.  The patches are applied to your pristine tree and working directory.  This may cause changes to be merged.  Note that &lt;code&gt;darcs push&lt;/code&gt; does the same thing, but in the other direction.

[[Image:Darcs-pull-before.png|center|during darcs pull]]

=== &lt;tt&gt;send&lt;/tt&gt; ===

Darcs &lt;tt&gt;send&lt;/tt&gt; is sort of like &lt;tt&gt;push&lt;/tt&gt;, only it doesn't actually apply the patches anywhere.  Instead it generates a handy email to the person or people who own the repository.  If it can't figure out who owns the repository, it will let you send to any email address you want.  Note that you can also pass the &lt;tt&gt;-o&lt;/tt&gt; command to &quot;send&quot; into a file, rather than a mail.

=== &lt;tt&gt;apply&lt;/tt&gt; ===

&lt;tt&gt;Apply&lt;/tt&gt; is what you do to a patch that somebody darcs &lt;tt&gt;send&lt;/tt&gt;s to you.  You can also use it for the files you generated via &lt;tt&gt;send -o&lt;/tt&gt;.  Note: &lt;tt&gt;push&lt;/tt&gt; is actually just &lt;tt&gt;apply&lt;/tt&gt; in disguise, but with all the boring work of copying files over being done for you.

=== &lt;tt&gt;put&lt;/tt&gt; ===
&lt;tt&gt;Put&lt;/tt&gt; enables to copy a local repository to remote location (for instance, via ssh). Think of &lt;tt&gt;put&lt;/tt&gt; as the opposite of &lt;tt&gt;get&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Dealing with conflicts ==

So you pulled a patch and you got a conflict.  What do you do?  See the chapter [[../Dealing with conflicts/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Conditional Statements|Input and output}}

== While loops ==

This is our first control structure.  Ordinarily the computer starts with the first line and then goes down from there.  Control structures change the order that statements are executed or decide if a certain statement will be run.  As a side note, decision statements (e.g., if statements) also influence whether or not a certain statement will run. Here's the source for a program that uses the while control structure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 0
while a &lt; 5:
    a += 1 # Same as a = a + 1
    print (a)
&lt;/source&gt;
 
And here is the output:
&lt;pre&gt;
1
2
3
4
5
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
So what does the program do?  First it sees the line &lt;tt&gt; a = 0&lt;/tt&gt; and makes a zero.  Then it sees &lt;tt&gt; while a &lt; 5:&lt;/tt&gt; and so the computer checks to see if &lt;tt&gt; a &lt; 5&lt;/tt&gt;.  The first time the computer sees this statement, a is zero, and zero is less than 5.  In other words, while a is less than five, the computer will run the indented statements.  

Here is another example of the use of &lt;tt&gt; while&lt;/tt&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
s = 0
print ('Enter Numbers to add to the sum.')
print ('Enter 0 to quit.')
while a != 0:
    print ('Current Sum: ', s)
    a = raw_input('Number? ')
    a = float(a)
    s += a
print ('Total Sum = ',s)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Enter Numbers to add to the sum.
Enter 0 to quit.
Current Sum: 0
Number? 200
Current Sum: 200
Number? -15.25
Current Sum: 184.75
Number? -151.85
Current Sum: 32.9
Number? 10.00
Current Sum: 42.9
Number? 0
Total Sum = 42.9
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice how &lt;tt&gt; print 'Total Sum =',s&lt;/tt&gt; is only run at the end.  The &lt;tt&gt; while&lt;/tt&gt; statement only affects the lines that are tabbed in (a.k.a. indented).  The &lt;tt&gt; !=&lt;/tt&gt; means does not equal so &lt;tt&gt; while a != 0 :&lt;/tt&gt;  means until a is zero run the tabbed in statements that are afterwards.  

Now that we have while loops, it is possible to have programs that run forever.  An easy way to do this is to write a program like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
while 1 == 1:
    print (&quot;Help, I'm stuck in a loop.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

This program will output &lt;tt&gt; Help, I'm stuck in a loop.&lt;/tt&gt; until the heat death of the universe or you stop it.  The way to stop it is to hit the Control (or Ctrl) button and `c' (the letter) at the same time.  This will kill the program.  (Note: sometimes you will have to hit enter after the Control C.)

=== Examples ===

Fibonacci.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence
a = 0
b = 1
count = 0
max_count = 20
while count &lt; max_count:
    count = count + 1
    #we need to keep track of a since we change it
    old_a = a
    old_b = b
    a = old_b
    b = old_a + old_b
    #Notice that the , at the end of a print statement keeps it
    # from switching to a new line
    print (old_a),
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
&lt;pre&gt;
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181
&lt;/pre&gt;

Password.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Waits until a password has been entered.  Use control-C to break out without
# the password.

# Note that this must not be the password so that the 
# while loop runs at least once.
password = &quot;foobar&quot;

#note that != means not equal
while password != &quot;unicorn&quot;:
    password = raw_input(&quot;Password: &quot;)
print (&quot;Welcome in&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample run:
&lt;pre&gt;Password:auo
Password:y22
Password:password
Password:open sesame
Password:unicorn
Welcome in
&lt;/pre&gt;

== For Loops ==
This is another way of using loops:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
onetoten = range(1,11)
for count in onetoten:
    print (count)
&lt;/source&gt;
The output:
&lt;pre&gt;
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
&lt;/pre&gt;
The output looks very familiar, but the program code looks different.  The first line uses the &lt;tt&gt; range&lt;/tt&gt; function.  The &lt;tt&gt; range&lt;/tt&gt; function uses two arguments like this &lt;tt&gt; range(start,finish)&lt;/tt&gt;.  &lt;tt&gt; start&lt;/tt&gt; is the first number that is produced.  &lt;tt&gt; finish&lt;/tt&gt; is one larger than the last number.  Note that this program could have been done in a shorter way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for count in range(1,11):
    print (count)
&lt;/source&gt;
Here are some examples to show what happens with the &lt;tt&gt; range&lt;/tt&gt; function:
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; range(1,10)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; range(-32, -20)
[-32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21]
&gt;&gt;&gt; range(5,21)
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
&gt;&gt;&gt; range(21,5)
[]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another way to use the &lt;tt&gt;range()&lt;/tt&gt; function in a &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loop is to supply only one argument:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for a in range(10):
    print (a)
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code acts exactly the same as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for a in range(0, 10):
    print (a)
&lt;/source&gt;

with 0 implied as the starting point. The output is 
&lt;pre&gt;
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
&lt;/pre&gt;

The code would cycle through the &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loop 10 times as expected, but starting with 0 instead of 1.

The next line &lt;tt&gt;for count in onetoten:&lt;/tt&gt; uses the &lt;tt&gt; for&lt;/tt&gt; control structure.  A &lt;tt&gt; for&lt;/tt&gt; control structure looks like &lt;tt&gt; for variable in list:&lt;/tt&gt;.  &lt;tt&gt; list&lt;/tt&gt; is gone through starting with the first element of the list and going to the last.  As &lt;tt&gt; for&lt;/tt&gt; goes through each element in a list it puts each into &lt;tt&gt; variable&lt;/tt&gt;.  That allows &lt;tt&gt; variable&lt;/tt&gt; to be used in each successive time the for loop is run through.  Here is another example to demonstrate:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
demolist = ['life',42, 'the universe', 6,'and',7,'everything']
for item in demolist:
    print (&quot;The Current item is: %s&quot; % item)
&lt;/source&gt;
The output is:
&lt;pre&gt;
The Current item is: life
The Current item is: 42
The Current item is: the universe
The Current item is: 6
The Current item is: and
The Current item is: 7
The Current item is: everything
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice how the for loop goes through and sets item to each element in the list.  (Notice how if you don't want &lt;tt&gt; print&lt;/tt&gt; to go to the next line add a comma at the end of the statement (i.e. if you want to print something else on that line). )  So, what is &lt;tt&gt; for&lt;/tt&gt; good for? The first use is to go through all the elements of a list and do something with each of them.  Here a quick way to add up all the elements:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [2,4,6,8]
sum = 0
for num in list:
    sum = sum + num
print (&quot;The sum is: %d&quot; % sum)
&lt;/source&gt;
with the output simply being:
&lt;pre&gt;
The sum is:  20
&lt;/pre&gt;
Or you could write a program to find out if there are any duplicates in a list like this program does:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1,0,7,10]
list.sort()
prev = list[0]
del list[0]
for item in list:
    if prev == item:
        print (&quot;Duplicate of &quot;,prev,&quot; Found&quot;)
    prev = item
&lt;/source&gt;
and for good measure:
&lt;pre&gt;
Duplicate of  7  Found
&lt;/pre&gt;
How does it work?  Here is a special debugging version:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1,0,7,10]
print (&quot;l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1,0,7,10]&quot;,&quot;\tl:&quot;,l)
l.sort()
print (&quot;l.sort()&quot;,&quot;\tl:&quot;,l)
prev = l[0]
print (&quot;prev = l[0]&quot;,&quot;\tprev:&quot;,prev)
del l[0]
print (&quot;del l[0]&quot;,&quot;\tl:&quot;,l)
for item in l:
    if prev == item:
        print (&quot;Duplicate of &quot;,prev,&quot; Found&quot;)
    print (&quot;if prev == item:&quot;,&quot;\tprev:&quot;,prev,&quot;\titem:&quot;,item)
    prev = item
    print (&quot;prev = item&quot;,&quot;\t\tprev:&quot;,prev,&quot;\titem:&quot;,item)
&lt;/source&gt;
with the output being:
&lt;pre&gt;
l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1,0,7,10]   l: [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]
l.sort()        l: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10]
prev = l[0]     prev: 0
del l[0]        l: [1, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10]
if prev == item:        prev: 0         item: 1
prev = item             prev: 1         item: 1
if prev == item:        prev: 1         item: 4
prev = item             prev: 4         item: 4
if prev == item:        prev: 4         item: 5
prev = item             prev: 5         item: 5
if prev == item:        prev: 5         item: 7
prev = item             prev: 7         item: 7
if prev == item:        prev: 7         item: 7
Duplicate of  7  Found
prev = item             prev: 7         item: 7
if prev == item:        prev: 7         item: 8
prev = item             prev: 8         item: 8
if prev == item:        prev: 8         item: 9
prev = item             prev: 9         item: 9
if prev == item:        prev: 9         item: 10
prev = item             prev: 10        item: 10
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note: The reason there are so many &lt;tt&gt; print&lt;/tt&gt; statements is because print statements can show the value of each variable at different times, and help debug the program.
First the program starts with a old list.  Next the program sorts the list.  This is so that any duplicates get put next to each other.  The program then initializes a prev(ious) variable.  Next the first element of the list is deleted so that the first item is not incorrectly thought to be a duplicate.  Next a for loop is gone into.  Each item of the list is checked to see if it is the same as the previous.  If it is a duplicate was found.  The value of prev is then changed so that the next time the for loop is run through prev is the previous item to the current.  Sure enough, the 7 is found to be a duplicate.

The other way to use for loops is to do something a certain number of times.  Here is some code to print out the first 9 numbers of the Fibonacci series:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
b = 1
for c in range(1,10):
    print (a)
    n = a + b
    a = b
    b = n
print (&quot;&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
with the surprising output:
&lt;pre&gt;
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34

&lt;/pre&gt;

Everything that can be done with &lt;tt&gt; for&lt;/tt&gt; loops can also be done with &lt;tt&gt; while&lt;/tt&gt; loops but &lt;tt&gt; for&lt;/tt&gt; loops give an easy way to go through all the elements in a list or to do something a certain number of times.

&lt;!-- TODO: add another example --&gt;

== range Versus xrange ==
Above, you were introduced to the &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; function, which returns a list of all the integers in a specified range. Supposing you were to write an expression like &lt;code&gt;range(0, 1000000)&lt;/code&gt;: that would construct a list consisting of a million integers! That can take up a lot of memory.

Often, you do indeed need to process all the numbers over a very wide range. But you might only need to do so one at a time; as each number is processed, it can be discarded from memory before the next one is obtained.

To do this, you can use the &lt;code&gt;xrange&lt;/code&gt; function instead of &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the following simple loop

&lt;pre&gt;
for i in xrange(0, 1000000) :
    print(i)
#end for
&lt;/pre&gt;

will print the million integers from 0 to 999999, but it will get them one at a time from the &lt;code&gt;xrange&lt;/code&gt; call, instead of getting them all at once as a single list and going through that.

This is an example of an ''iterator'', which yields values one at a time as they are needed, rather than all at once. As you learn more about Python, you will see a lot more examples of iterators in use, and you will learn how to write your own.

{{Python Programming/Note|'''Python 3 Note:''' In Python 3.''x'', there is no function named &lt;code&gt;xrange&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, the &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; function has the behaviour described above for &lt;code&gt;xrange&lt;/code&gt;.}}

== The &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; Statement ==
A &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;-loop checks its termination condition before each entry into the loop body, and terminates if the condition has gone &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, the loop body will normally iterate zero, one or more ''complete'' times.

A &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;-loop iterates its body once for each value returned from the iterator expression. Again, each iteration is normally of the ''complete'' loop body.

Sometimes you want to conditionally stop the loop in the ''middle'' of the loop body. An example situation might look like this:
# Obtain the next value to check
# Is there in fact another value to check? If not, exit the loop with failure.
# Is the value what I’m looking for? If so, exit the loop with success.
# Otherwise, go back to step 1.

As you can see, there are two possible exits from this loop. You can exit from the middle of a Python &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;- or &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;-loop with the &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;-statement. Here is one way to write such a loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
found = False # initial assumption
for value in values_to_check() :
    if is_what_im_looking_for(value) :
        found = True
        break
    #end if
#end for
# ... found is True on success, False on failure
&lt;/source&gt;

The trouble with this is the asymmetry between the two ways out of the loop: one through normal &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;-loop termination, the other through the &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;. As a stylistic matter, it would be more consistent to follow this principle:
: If one exit from a loop is represented by a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;, then ''all'' exits from the loop should be represented by &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;s.
In particular, this means that the loop construct itself becomes a “loop-forever” loop; the only out of it is via a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement.

We can do this by explicitly dealing with an iterator yielding the values to be checked. Perhaps the &lt;code&gt;values_to_check()&lt;/code&gt; call above already yields an iterator; if not, it can be converted to one by wrapping it in a call to the &lt;code&gt;iter()&lt;/code&gt; built-in function, and then using the &lt;code&gt;next()&lt;/code&gt; built-in function to obtain successive values from this iterator. Then the loop becomes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
values = iter(values_to_check())
while True :
    value = next(values, None)
    if value == None :
        found = False
        break
    #end if
    if is_what_im_looking_for(value) :
        found = True
        break
    #end if
#end while
# ... found is True on success, False on failure
&lt;/source&gt;
This uses the special Python value &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that the iterator has reached its end. This is a common Python convention. But if you need to use &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; as a valid item in your sequence of values, then it is easy enough to define some other unique value (e.g. a custom dummy class) to represent the end of the list.

== Exercises ==
# Create a program to count by prime numbers.  Ask the user to input a number, then print each prime number up to that number.
# Instruct the user to pick an arbitrary number from 1 to 100 and proceed to guess it correctly within seven tries.  After each guess, the user must tell whether their number is higher than, lower than, or equal to your guess.

== Definition ==

The Hilbert transform is used to generate a complex signal from a real signal. The Hilbert transform is characterized by the impulse response:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t)= {1 \over (\pi t)}&lt;/math&gt;

The Hilbert Transform of a function x(t) is the convolution of x(t) with the function h(t), above. The Hilbert Transform is defined as such:

{{eqn|Hilbert Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat x(t) = \mathcal{H}\{x\}(t) = (h*x)(t) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{x(\tau)}{t-\tau}\, d\tau.\, &lt;/math&gt;

We use the notation &lt;math&gt;\widehat x(t)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the hilbert transformation of x(t).</text>

=Reading and Writing from a file: Command Line=

==Reading and Writing data from/to a .mat file==
The quickest means of saving and retrieving data is through the binary .mat file format MATLAB provides.  This is the native format for MATLAB.

*Note: This author has had some problems with certain classes not being saved correctly when saving data using version 7 for use in version 6.  Most data items will work just fine.  Of particular interest was an issue with State-Space objects that were saved using version 7 to a version 6 compatible file.  When the file was opend in MATLAB version 6+ the State-Space objects did not load.[[User:Spradlig|Spradlig]] ([[User talk:Spradlig|talk]]) 04:52, 31 March 2008 (UTC).

===Saving Data===
The save command is used to save workspace data to a file.
:*Save all workspace data to the file mySave.mat in the current directory.
  &gt;&gt; save('mySave.mat')
  &gt;&gt; save(fullfile(pwd, 'mySave.mat'))
:*Save just the variables myData1 and myData2 to mySave.mat.
  &gt;&gt; save('mySave.mat', 'myData1', 'myData2')
:*Save all myData variables to mySave.mat.
  &gt;&gt; save('mySave.mat', 'myData*')
:*Save all myData variables to a mySave.mat file compatible with version 6 of MATLAB.
  &gt;&gt; save('mySave.mat', 'myData*', '-v6')
:*Save all myData variables to an ASCII file.
  &gt;&gt; save('mySave.txt', 'myData*', '-ASCII')
:*Append new variables to the data file.
  &gt;&gt; save('mySave.mat', 'newData*', '-append')

===Loading Data===
The load command is used to load data from a file into the current workspace.
:*Load all variables from the file mySave.mat into the current workspace.
  &gt;&gt; load('mySave.mat')
  &gt;&gt; load(fullfile(pwd, 'mySave.mat'))
:*Load just the variables myData1 and myData2.
  &gt;&gt; load('mySave.mat', 'myData1', 'myData2')
:*Load all myData variables.
  &gt;&gt; load('mySave.mat', 'myData*')
:*Get a cell array of variables in saved file.
  &gt;&gt; whos('-file', 'mySave.mat')

==Reading and Writing from an Excel spreadsheet==
Since analyzing data is one of the more common motivations for using input output I will start with reading and writing from a spreadsheet. I cover the command line first since it is often necessary to import the data while an m-function is being evaluated.

MATLAB makes it easy to read from an Excel spreadsheet. It has the built in command &quot;xlsread&quot;. To use the ''xlsread'' function use the syntax:

 &gt;&gt;g=xlsread('filename');

This line of code reads ''filename.xls'' (from the current directory) and places it in an identical array inside MATLAB called g. You can then manipulate the array g any way you want. Make sure that the file you choose is in the same directory were you save your M-files (usually the work directory) otherwise you get an error. You can specify the path to a file but, this can get messy. 

To write data to an .xls the procedure is very similar. The ''xlswrite'' command below creates a spreadsheet called ''filename.xls'' in the current directory from the variable g:

 &gt;&gt; xlswrite('filename',g);

NOTE: if you are using MATLAB 6.5 there is no &quot;xlswrite&quot; command (that I'm aware of). There are several ways to write to a file. The simplest way I have found is

 fid=fopen('newFile.xls', 'w');
 fprintf(fid,'%6.3f %6.3f %10.3f\n', g);           
 fclose(fid);

You can substitute newFile.xls with .txt. Also, there might be some issues with formatting in Excel. The formatting issues can usually be handled inside Excel but if they can't you might have to play around with the fopen command parameters.  
This is pretty similar (if not the same) way you would write to a file in C.

==Reading and Writing from and to other text files==

If a file is not an excel spreadsheet, it can still be read using &quot;load&quot; function:

 &gt;&gt; load newfile.txt

This works only if the text is entirely numerical, without special formatting. Otherwise you get an 'unrecognized character' error.

The easiest way to write to a non-excel file, or using MATLAB 6.5 or less, is to use the same code as that for writing excel files but change the extension. Usually there are no formatting difficulties with plain text files.

For reading more general text files, MATLAB does not have a function to do it easily (unless you have excel), but you can read very general text files (with different delimiters for both cells and text within cells) using the &quot;textread.m&quot; function in the MATLAB file exchange (do a google search to find it). You can also try to use fscanf if the formatting is consistent enough (i.e. consistent numbers of spaces, no mixing of strings and numbers in columns, and so on).

==Reading and Writing from a data file: GUI==

MATLAB contains a nice GUI application that will guide you through importing data from any recognized data file (usually .mat, .txt, or .xls on a Windows system). To use it, go to 
file &gt; import data, and select the file you want. Then, choose what column separators are present (by selecting the appropriate radio button). Finally, click &quot;next&quot;.

MATLAB saves the variable under a name similar to that of the file, but with modifications to make it conform with MATLAB syntax. Spaces are omitted, plusses and minuses are turned into other characters. To see the name MATLAB generated (and probably change it) type &quot;who&quot; in the command prompt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that we've covered basic file input output (I'll get into more detailed file manipulation later) we can move on to the next step. 

In the section Basic Reading and Writing data we already had the data in the form of a spreadsheet. How did it get to that spreadsheet and how do we send it some where else?
This question will attempt to be answered in the following section. There are many ways to transmit and recieve data. I've even heard of this newfangled thing called the easternet or internet or whatever, but for now we will assume we are in a University lab with no internet connection (don't laugh I've been in this situation more times than I like to remember). In this case, we will use the computer's serial port, which implements the RS-232 physical layer protocol. Although this protocol is very slow (usually no more than 9600 bits/s), it's very simple to implement and thus it's used widely on embedded devices.

MATLAB provides us with there style of reading and writing to the serial port.
#You must create a serial port object.

 object=serial(''port,'Property name',propertyValue'');
 
Example:
I will now create a serial object called serialOne

 serialOne=serial('COM1', 'BaudRate', 9600);

(for those of you more familiar with C this should look very similar to creating a handle: In fact it is the MATLAB way of making handles)

Most computers call the serial ports COM and then some number usually 1-4 (depending on how many there are). This also includes DB-9, DB-25 and other various DB type connectors. 


2. Now that the computer knows there is a serial port object you have to tell it to open &lt;br&gt;
:the object. Use the fopen command&lt;br&gt;
3. Write to the port&lt;br&gt;
4. Close object.

Example:

 serialOne=serial('COM1', 'BaudRate', 9600);
 fopen(serialOne);
 fprintf(serialOne,'textFile.txt');
 fclose(serialOne);

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
== Introduction to Arrays ==

Arrays are the fundamental data type of MATLAB. Indeed, the former data types presented here, strings and number, are particular cases of arrays. As in many traditional languages, arrays in MATLAB are a collection of several values of the same type (by default, the type is equivalent to the C type double on the same architecture. On x86 and powerpc, it is a floating point value of 64 bits). They are indexed through the use of a single integer or, to get more than one value, an array of integers..

== Declaring Arrays ==

=== Row and Column Arrays ===

A simple way to create a row array is to give a comma separated list of values inside brackets:

 &gt;&gt; array = [0, 1, 4, 5]
 array =
     0     1     4     5

The commas can be omitted for a row array because MATLAB will assume you want a row array if you don't give it any separators. However, the commas make it easier to read and can help with larger arrays. The commas indicate that the array will be a horizontal array. 

To make a column array you can use semicolons to separate the values.

 &gt;&gt; column = [1; 2; 3] 
 column =
     1
     2
     3

All elements of an array must be the same data type, so for example you cannot put a function handle and a double in the same array.

=== Declaring multi-dimensional arrays ===

Arrays can be multi-dimensional. To create a 2 dimensional array (a matrix in Linear Algebra terms), we have to give
a list of comma separated values, and each row should be separated by a semi colon:

 &gt;&gt; matrix = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
 matrix =
     1     2     3
     4     5     6

In MATLAB the term array is synonymous with matrix and will more often than not be referred to as a matrix. It should be noted that a matrix, as its mathematical equivalent, requires all its rows and all its columns to be the same size:

 &gt;&gt; matrix = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5]
 ??? Error using ==&gt; vertcat
 All rows in the bracketed expression must have the same
 number of columns.

== Properties of MATLAB arrays and matrices ==

Contrary to low level languages such as C, an array in MATLAB is a more high level type of data: it contains various information about its size, its data type, and so on.

 &gt;&gt; array = [0,1,4,5];
 &gt;&gt; length(array)
 ans = 4
 &gt;&gt; class(array)
 ans = double

The number of rows and columns of the matrix can be known through the built-in size function. Following the standard mathematical convention, the first number is the number of rows and the second is the number of columns:

 &gt;&gt; matrix = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];
 &gt;&gt; size(matrix) 
 ans =
     2     3

The goal of MATLAB arrays is to have a type similar to mathematical vectors and matrices. As such, row and column arrays are not equivalent. Mono-dimensional arrays are actually a special case of multi-dimensional arrays, and the 'size' function can be used for them as well.

 &gt;&gt; size(array)
 ans =
     1     4

Row and column do not have the same size, so they are not equivalent:

 &gt;&gt; size(column)
 ans = 
     3     1
 &gt;&gt; size(row) 
 ans = 
     1     3

== Why Use Arrays? ==

A major advantage of using arrays and matrices is that it lets you avoid using loops to perform the same operation on multiple elements of the array. For example, suppose you wanted to add 3 to each element of the array [1,2,3]. If MATLAB didn't use arrays you would have to do this using a FOR loop:

 &gt;&gt; array = [1,2,3];
 &gt;&gt; for ii = 1:3
 array(ii) = array(ii) + 3;
 &gt;&gt; end
 &gt;&gt; array
 array = [4,5,6]

Doing this is ''not efficient'' in MATLAB, and it will make your programs run very slowly. Instead, you can create another array of 3s and add the two arrays directly. MATLAB automatically separates the elements:
    
 &gt;&gt; array = [1,2,3];
 &gt;&gt; arrayofthrees = [3,3,3];
 &gt;&gt; array = array + arrayofthrees
 array = [4,5,6];

If all you are doing is adding a constant, you can also omit the declaration of 'arrayofthrees', as MATLAB will assume that the constant will be added to all elements of the array. This is very useful, for example if you use an array with variable size:

 &gt;&gt; array = [1,2,3];
 &gt;&gt; array + 3
 ans = [4,5,6]

The same rule applies to scalar multiplication.

See Introduction to array operations for more information on the operations MATLAB can perform on arrays.

Arrays are a fundamental principle of MATLAB, and almost everything in MATLAB is done through a massive use of arrays. To have a deeper explanation of  arrays and their operations, see Arrays and matrices.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
=== The Current Directory and Defined Path ===

It is necessary to declare a current directory before saving a file, loading a file, or running an M-file. By default, unless you edit the MATLAB shortcut, the current directory will be .../MATLAB/work. After you start MATLAB, change the current directory by either using the toolbar at the left-hand side of the screen, or entering the path in the bar at the top.

The current directory is the directory MATLAB will look in first for a function you try to call. Therefore if you have multiple folders and each of them has an M-file of the same name, there will not be a discrepancy if you set the current directory beforehand. The current directory is also the directory in which MATLAB will first look for a data file.

If you still want to call a function but it is not part of the current directory, you must define it using MATLAB's 'set path' utility. To access this utility, follow the path:

file &gt; set path... &gt; add folder... 

You could also go to &quot;add folder with subfolders...&quot;, if you're adding an entire group, as you would if you were installing a toolbox. Then look for and select the folder you want. If you forget to do this and attempt to access a file that is not part of your defined path list, you will get an 'undefined function' error.

=== Saving Files ===

There are many ways to save to files in MATLAB.  

*save - saves data to files, *.mat by default
*uisave - includes user interface
*hgsave - saves figures to files, *.fig by default
*diary [filename] - saves all the text input in the command window to a text file.

All of them use the syntax:

 save filename.ext

or similar for the other functions. The files are saved in your current directory, as seen on the top of the window. By default the current directory is .../MATLAB/work.

=== Loading Files ===

Likewise, there are many ways to load files into the workspace. One way is to use the &quot;file&quot; menu. To open a .m file click &quot;open&quot;, whereas to import data from a data file select &quot;import data...&quot; and follow the wizard's instructions.

An alternative way to load a saved .mat file (within a function, for example) is to type:
 &gt;&gt; load filename.ext
The file must be in a recognized directory (usually your current directory, but at least one for which the path has been set).

The data in the .mat file is stored with the same name as the variable originally had when it was saved. To get the name of this and all other environment variables, type &quot;who&quot;.

To open an .m file, you can use file -&gt; open, or type
 &gt;&gt;open filename.ext

=== File Naming Constraints ===

You can name files whatever you want (usually simpler is better though), with a few exceptions:

*MATLAB for [[w:Microsoft Windows|Windows]] retains the file naming constraints set by [[w:Disk Operating System|DOS]].  The following characters cannot be used in filenames:  
  ''' &quot;  / : * &lt; &gt; | ? '''

*You're not allowed to use the name of a reserved word as the name of a file. For example, ''while.m'' is not a valid file name because ''while'' is one of MATLAB's reserved words.

*When you declare an m-file function, the m-file must be the same name as the function or MATLAB will not be able to run it. For example, if you declare a function called 'factorial':

 function Y = factorial(X)

:You must save it as &quot;factorial.m&quot; in order to use it. MATLAB will name it for you if you save it after typing the function declaration, but if you change the name of the function you must change the name of the file manually, and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The USB port is a type of serial port. It is, after all, the Universal SERIAL Bus. I wrote that twice because all of the books I have read on USB seem to muddle that quite a bit. There are some minor and major differences to how you use the USB ports but the idea is very much the same. I did this a while back and have to reread some stuff. (I also plan to either start a wiki book about USB or join one that is already started- I have to look into this more).

== Declaring Strings ==

Besides numbers, MATLAB can also manipulate strings. They should be enclosed in single quotes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; fstring = 'hello'
 fstring =
 hello
&lt;/source&gt;
If you would like to include a single quote this is one way to do it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; fstring = ''''
 fstring = 
 '
&gt;&gt; fstring = 'you''re'
 fstring =
 you're
&lt;/source&gt;
An important thing to remember about strings is that MATLAB treats them as array of characters. To see this, try executing the following code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; fstring = 'hello';
 &gt;&gt; class(fstring)
 ans = char
&lt;/source&gt;
Therefore, many of the array manipulation functions will work the same with these arrays as any other, such as the 'size' function, transpose, and so on. You can also access specific parts of it by using standard indexing syntax.

Attempting to perform arithmetic operations on character arrays converts them into doubles.
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; fstring2 = 'world';
 &gt;&gt; fstring + fstring2
 ans = 223   212   222   216   211
&lt;/source&gt;
These numbers come from the standard numbers for each character in the array. These values are obtained by using the 'double' function to turn the array into an array of doubles.
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; double(fstring)
 ans = 104   101   108   108   111
&lt;/source&gt;
The 'char' function can turn an array of integer-valued doubles back into characters. Attempting to turn a decimal into a character causes MATLAB to round down:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; char(104)
 ans = h
 &gt;&gt; char(104.6)
 ans = h
&lt;/source&gt;
Since the MATLAB strings are treated as character arrays, they have some special functions if you wish to compare the entire string at once rather than just its components:

: findstr(bigstring, smallstring) looks to see if a small string is contained in a bigger string, and if it is returns the index of where the smaller string starts. Otherwise it returns [].

: strrep(string1, replaced, replacement) replaces all instances of ''replaced'' in ''string1'' with ''replacement''

== Displaying values of string variables ==

If all you want to do is display the value of a string, you can omit the semicolon as is standard in MATLAB.

If you want to display a string in the command window in combination with other text, one way is to use array notation combined with either the 'display' or the 'disp' function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; fstring = 'hello';
 &gt;&gt; display( [ fstring 'world'] )
 helloworld
&lt;/source&gt;

MATLAB doesn't put the space in between the two strings. If you want one there you must put it in yourself.

This syntax is also used to concatenate two or more strings into one variable, which allows insertion of unusual characters into strings:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; fstring = ['you' char(39) 're']
 fstring = you're
&lt;/source&gt;
Any other function that returns a string can also be used in the array.

You can also use the &quot;strcat&quot; function to concatenate strings, which does the same thing as above when you use two strings, but it is especially useful if you are using a cell array of strings because it lets you concatenate the same thing to all of the strings at once. Unfortunately you can't use it to add white space (strcat discards what MATLAB considers extraneous whitespace). Here's the syntax for this use.

&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; strCell = {'A', 'B'};
 &gt;&gt; strcat(strCell, '_');
 ans =
 A_
 B_
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, although MATLAB doesn't have a printf function you can do essentially the same thing by using ''1'' as your file identifier in the '''fprintf''' function. The format identifiers are essentially the same as they are in C.

&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; X = 9.2
 &gt;&gt; fprintf(1, '%1.3f\n', X);
 9.200
&lt;/source&gt;

The &quot;9.200&quot; is printed to the screen. fprintf is nice compared to display because you don't have to call num2str on all of the numbers in a string - just use the appropriate format identifer in the place you want it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; X = 9.2
 &gt;&gt; fprintf(1, 'The value of X is %1.3f meters per second \n', X);
 The value of X is 9.200 meters per second
&lt;/source&gt;

== Cell arrays of strings ==

In many applications (particularly those where you are parsing text files, reading excel sheets with text, etc.) you will encounter cell arrays of strings.

You can use the function &quot;iscellstr&quot; to tell if all of the elements in a given cell array are strings or not. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; notStrCell = {'AA', []};
 &gt;&gt; iscellstr(notStrCell)
 ans = 0
&lt;/source&gt;

This is useful since functions that work with cell arrays of strings will fail if provided with something that's not a cell array of strings. In particular, they all fail if any elements of the provided cell array are the empty array ( [] ) which is somewhat frustrating if the provided text file contains empty cells. You must catch this exception before calling cellstr manipulation functions.

Searching a cell array of strings can be done with the &quot;strmatch&quot;, &quot;strfind&quot;, and &quot;regexp&quot; functions. Strmatch looks for a string within a cell array of strings whose first characters exactly match the string you pass to it, and returns the index of all strings in the array for which it found a match. If you give it the 'exact' option, it will only return the indexes of elements that are exactly the same as what you passed. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; strCell = {'Aa', 'AA'};
 &gt;&gt; strmatch('A', strCell);
 ans = 1, 2
 &gt;&gt; strmatch('A', strCell, 'exact');
 ans = []
 &gt;&gt; strmatch('Aa', strCell, 'exact');
 ans = 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Strfind looks for a specific string within a cell array of strings, but it tries to find it in any part of each string. For each element x of the given cell array of strings, it will return an empty array if there is no match found in x and the starting index (remember, strings are arrays of characters) of all matches in x if a match to the query is found.

&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; strCell = {'Aa', 'AA'};
 &gt;&gt; strfind(strCell, 'A');
 ans = % answer is a cell array with two elements (same size as strCell): 
   1         % Index of the beginning of string &quot;A&quot; in the first cell
   1  2      % Index of each instance of the beginning of string &quot;A&quot; in the second cell
 &gt;&gt; strfind(strCell, 'a');
 ans =
   2
   [] % 'a' is not found
&lt;/source&gt;

The &quot;cellfun&quot; / &quot;isempty&quot; combination is very useful for identifying cases where the string was or was not found. You can use the find function in combination with these two functions to return the index of all the cells in which the query string was found.

&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; strCell = {'Aa', 'AA'};
 &gt;&gt; idxCell = strfind(strCell, 'a');
 &gt;&gt; isFound = ~cellfun('isempty', idxCell); % Returns &quot;0&quot; if idxCell is empty and a &quot;1&quot; otherwise
 &gt;&gt; foundIdx = find(isFound)
 foundIdx = 2
&lt;/source&gt;

The strfind function also has some other options, such as the option to only return the index of the first or last match. See the documentation for details.

The regexp function works the same way as strfind but instead of looking for strings literally, it tries to find matches within the cell array of strings using regular expressions. Regular expressions are a powerful way to match patterns within strings (not just specific strings within strings). Entire books have been written about regular expressions, so they cannot be covered in as much detail here. However, some good resources online include [http://www.regular-expressions.info/ regular-expresions.info] and the MATLAB documentation for the matlab-specific syntax. Note that MATLAB implements some, but not all, of the extended regular expressions available in other languages such as Perl.

Unfortunately, MATLAB does not innately have functions to do common string operations in some other languages such as string splitting. However, it is quite possible to find many of these functions in a google search.

== Comparing strings ==

Unlike with rational arrays, strings will not be compared correctly with the relational operator, because this will treat the string as an array of characters. To get the comparison you probably intended, use the ''strcmp'' function as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; string1 = 'a';
 &gt;&gt; strcmp(string1, 'a')
 ans = 1
 &gt;&gt; strcmp(string1, 'A')
 ans = 0
 &lt;/source&gt;
Note that MATLAB strings are case sensitive so that 'a' and 'A' are not the same. In addition the strcmp function does ''not'' discard whitespace:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; strcmp(string1, ' a')
 ans = 0
&lt;/source&gt;
The strings must be exactly the same in every respect.

If the inputs are numeric arrays then the strcmp function will return 0 even if the values are the same. Thus it's only useful for strings. Use the == operator for numeric values.
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; strcmp(1,1)
 ans = 0.
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Outdated|Maple is no longer used for the symbolic toolbox. In 2008 Mathworks bought MuPAD which was is now used in the Matlab symbolic toolbox.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuPAD&lt;/ref&gt; The synthax should be the same but someone has to check every example.}}


&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Introduction to the Symbolic Math Toolbox ==

The symbolic toolbox is a bit difficult to use but it is of great utility in applications in which symbolic expressions are necessary for reasons of accuracy in calculations. The toolbox simply calls the MAPLE kernel with whatever symbolic expressions you have declared, and then returns a (usually symbolic) expression back to MATLAB. It is important to remember that MAPLE is ''not'' a numeric engine, which means that there are certain things it doesn't let you do that MATLAB can do. Rather, it is useful as a supplement to provide functions which MATLAB, as a numerical engine, has difficulty with.

The symbolic math toolbox takes some time to initialize, so if nothing happens for a few seconds after you declare your first symbolic variable of the session, it doesn't mean you did anything wrong.

The MATLAB student version comes with a copy of the symbolic math toolbox.

== Symbolic Variables ==

You can declare a single symbolic variable using the 'sym' function as follows.

 &gt;&gt; a = sym('a1')
 a = a1

You can create arrays of symbolic expressions like everything else:


 &gt;&gt; a1 = sym('a1');
 &gt;&gt; a2 = sym('a2');
 &gt;&gt; a  = [a1, a2]
 a = [ a1,  a2]


Symbolic variables can also be declared many at a time using the 'syms' function. By default, the symbolic variables created have the same names as the arguments of the 'syms' function. The following creates three symbolic variables, a b and c.

 &gt;&gt; syms a b c
 &gt;&gt; a
 a = a

== Symbolic Numbers ==

Symbolic numbers allow exact representations of fractions, intended to help avoid rounding errors and representation errors. This section helps explain how to declare them.

If you try to add a number into a symbolic array it will automatically turn it into a ''symbolic'' number.

 &gt;&gt; syms a1, a2;
 &gt;&gt; a = [a1, a2];
 &gt;&gt; a(3) = 1; %would normally be class 'double'
 &gt;&gt; class(a(3))
 ans = sym

Symbolic numbers can also be declared using the syntax a(3) = sym('number'). The difference between symbolic numbers and normal MATLAB numbers is that, if possible, MAPLE will keep the symbolic number as a fraction, which is an exact representation of the answer. For example, to represent the number 0.5 as a fraction, you can use:

 &gt;&gt; sym(0.5)
 ans = 1/2

Here, of course, MATLAB would normally return 0.5. To make MATLAB change this back into a 'double', type:

 &gt;&gt; double(ans)
 ans = 0.5000

Other class conversions are possible as well; for instance, to change it into a ''string'' use the 'char' function. There is no function to directly change a symbolic variable into a function handle, unfortunately.

A caveat: Making a symbolic variable of negative exponentials can create problems if you don't use the correct syntax. You cannot do this:

 &gt;&gt;  sym('2^-5')
 ??? Error using ==&gt; sym.sym&gt;char2sym
 Not a valid symbolic expression.

Instead, you must do this:

 &gt;&gt;  sym('2^(-5)')
 ans = 2^(-5)

MAPLE is thus more picky about what operators you can use than MATLAB.

== Symbolic Functions ==

You can create functions of symbolic variables, not just the variables themselves. This is probably the most intuitive way to do it:

 &gt;&gt; syms a b c %declare variables
 &gt;&gt; f = a + b + c
 ans = a + b + c

If you do it this way, you can then subsequently perform substitutions, differentiations, and so on with respect to any one of these variables. 

=== Substituting Values into Symbolic Variables ===

Substitutions can be made into functions of symbolic variables. Suppose you defined the function f = a + b + c and wish to substitute a = 3 into f. You can do this with the following syntax:

 &gt;&gt; syms a b c  %declare variables
 &gt;&gt; f = a + b + c;
 &gt;&gt; subs(f, a, 3)
 ans = 3+b+c

Notice the form of this function call. The first argument is the name of the ''function'' you wish to substitute into. The second can be either the name of the symbolic variable you want to plug in for ''or''  its present value, but if you want to avoid confusion they should be the same anyway. The third argument is the value you want to plug in for that variable.

The value you're plugging in need not be a number. You can also plug in other variables (including those already present in the function) by using strings. Using the same f:

 &gt;&gt; subs(f, a, 'x')
 ans = x+b+c
 &gt;&gt; subs(f, a, 'b')
 ans = 2*b + c

If x is already a symbolic variable you can omit the quotes (but if it's not you'll get an undefined variable error):

 &gt;&gt; syms x
 &gt;&gt; subs(f,a,x)
 ans = x+b+c

Multiple substitutions are allowed; to do it, just declare each of them as an array. For example, to plug in 1 for a and 2 for b use:

 &gt;&gt; subs(f, [a,b], [1,2])
 ans = 3+c

Finally, if you substitute for ''all'' of the symbolic values in a function MATLAB automatically changes the value back into a double so that you can manipulate it in the MATLAB workspace.

 &gt;&gt; subs(f, [a,b,c], [1,2,3])
 ans = 6
 &gt;&gt; class(ans)
 ans = double

=== Algebraic Function Manipulations ===

The symbolic math toolbox allows you several different ways to manipulate functions. First off you can factor a function using 'factor' and multiply it out using 'expand':

 &gt;&gt; syms a b
 &gt;&gt; f = a^2 - 2*a*b + b^2;
 &gt;&gt; factor(f);
 ans =  (a - b)^2
 &gt;&gt; expand(ans)
 ans =  a^2 - 2*a*b + b^2

The 'collect' function does the same thing as the 'expand' function but only affects polynomial terms. 'Expand' can also be used to expand trigonometric and logarithmic/exponential functions with the appropriate identities.

The Horner (nested) representation for a function is given by 'horner':

 &gt;&gt; horner(f)
 ans = b^2+(-2*b+a)*a

This representation has a relatively low number of operations required for its evaluation compared to the expanded version and is therefore helpful in making calculations more efficient.

A common problem with symbolic calculations is that the answer returned is often not in its simplest form. MATLAB's function 'simple' will perform all of the possible function manipulations and then return the one that is the ''shortest''. To do this do something like:

 &gt;&gt; Y = simple(f)
 Y =  (a - b)^2

== Algebraic Equations ==

The symbolic math toolbox is able to solve an algebraic expression for any variable, provided that it is mathematically possible to do so. It can also solve both single equations and algebraic systems.

=== Solving Algebraic Equations With a Single Variable ===

MATLAB uses the 'solve' function to solve an algebraic equation. The syntax is solve(f, var) where f is the function you wish to solve and var is the variable to solve for. If f is a function of a single variable you will get a ''number'', while if it is multiple variables you will get a symbolic expression.

First, let us say we want to solve the quadratic equation x^2 = 16 for x. The solutions are x = -4 and x = 4. To do this, you can put the function into 'solve' directly, or you can define a function in terms of x to solve and pass that into the 'solve' function. The first method is rather intuitive:

 &gt;&gt; solve('x^2 = 16', x)
 ans = -4
        4
 &gt;&gt; solve(x^2 - 16, x)
 ans = -4
        4

Either of these two syntax works. The first must be in quotes or you get an 'invalid assignment' error. In the second, x must be defined as a symbolic variable beforehand or you get an 'undefined variable' error.

For the second method you assign a dummy variable to the equation you want to solve like this:

 &gt;&gt; syms x
 &gt;&gt; y = x^2 - 16;
 &gt;&gt; solve(y, x);

Note that since MATLAB assumes that y = 0 when you're solving the equation, you must subtract 16 from both sides to put the equation into normal form.

=== Solving Symbolic Functions for Particular Variables ===

The format for doing this is similar to that for solving for a single variable, but you will get a symbolic function rather than a number as output. There are a couple of things to look out for though.

As an example, suppose that you want to solve the equation y = 2x + 4 for x. The expected solution is x = (y-4)/2. Lets see how we can get MATLAB to do this. First let's look at how NOT to do it:

 &gt;&gt; syms x
 &gt;&gt; y = 2*x + 4;
 &gt;&gt; solve(y, x)
 ans = -2

What has happened here? The MATLAB toolbox assumes that the 'y' you declared is 0 for the purposes of solving the equation! So it solved the equation 2x + 4 = 0 for x. In order to do what you intended to do you have to put your original equation, y = 2x + 4, into ''normal form'', which is 2x + 4 - y = 0. Once this is done, you need to assign a 'dummy' variable like this:

 &gt;&gt; syms x y
 &gt;&gt; S = 2*x + 4 - y; %S is the 'dummy'
 &gt;&gt; solve(S, x)
 ans = -2 + 1/2*y

This is, of course, the same thing as what we expected. You could also just pass the function into the 'solve' function like this, as done with functions of a single variable:

 &gt;&gt; solve('y = 2*x + 4', x);

The first method is preferable, because once it is set up it is much more flexible to changes in the function. In the second method you would have to change every call to 'solve' if you changed the function at all, whereas in the first you only need to change the original definition of S.

=== Solving Algebraic Systems ===

The 'solve' command also allows you to solve systems of algebraic equations, and will attempt to return ''all'' solutions to these systems. As a first example, let us consider the linear system 

 a + b = 3
 a + 2*b = 6,

which has the solution (a,b) = (0,3). You can tell MATLAB to solve it as follows:

 &gt;&gt; syms a b
 &gt;&gt; f(1) = a + b - 3;
 &gt;&gt; f(2) = a + 2*b - 6;
 &gt;&gt; [A,B] = solve(f(1), f(2))
 A = 0
 B = 3

If only one output variable is specified but there are multiple equations, MATLAB will return the solutions in a struct array:

 &gt;&gt; SOLUTION = solve(f(1), f(2))
 SOLUTION =
 a: [1x1 sym]
 b: [1x1 sym]
 &gt;&gt; SOLUTION.a
 a = 0
 &gt;&gt; SOLUTION.b
 b = 3

The good thing about this is that the fields have the same names as the original variables, whereas in the other form it is easy to get confused which variable is going into which spot in the array. In addition, the struct array is more convenient for large systems.

Now let us look at a slightly more complex example:

 a^2 + b^2 = 1
 a + b = 1

This has solutions (a,b) = (0,1) and (a,b) = (1,0). Now putting this into MATLAB gives:

 &gt;&gt; f = [a^2 + b^2 - 1, a + b - 1]; SOLUTION = solve(f(1), f(2));
 &gt;&gt; SOLUTION.a
 ans = 1
       0
 &gt;&gt; SOLUTION.b
 ans = 0
       1

Here both solutions are given, a(1) corresponds to b(1) and a(2) corresponds to b(2). To get one of the solutions into a single array together you can use normal array indexing, as in:

 &gt;&gt; Solution1 = [SOLUTION.a(1), SOLUTION.b(1)]
 Solution1 = [1, 0]

== Analytic Calculus ==

MATLAB's symbolic toolbox, in addition to its algebraic capabilities, can also perform many common calculus tasks, including analytical integration, differentiation, partial differentiation, integral transforms, and solving ordinary differential equations, provided the given tasks are mathematically possible.

=== Differentiation and Integration with One Variable===

Differentiation of functions with one or more variables is achieved using the 'diff' function. As usual, you can either define the function before the differentiation (recommended for M files) or you can manually write it in as an argument (recommended for command-line work). If there is only one symbolic variable in the expression, MATLAB assumes that is the variable you are differentiating with respect to. The syntax is simply:

 &gt;&gt; syms x
 &gt;&gt; f = x^2 - 3*x + 4;
 &gt;&gt; diff(f) % or diff('x^2 - 3*x + 4')
 ans =  2*x - 3

Integration, similarly, is achieved using the 'int' function. Only specifying the function results in an ''indefinite'' integral, or the antiderivative of the function.

 &gt;&gt; int(f)
 ans =  x^3/3 - (3*x^2)/2 + 4*x

Note that if you only specify one output argument (or none at all), the 'int' function ''omits the integration constant''. You just have to know it's there.

To do a ''definite'' integral on a one-variable function, simply specify the beginning and end points.

 &gt;&gt; int(f, 0,1)
 ans = 17/6

=== Differentiation and Integration of Multivariable Functions ===

A convenient way of representing the derivatives of multivariate functions (partial derivatives) is with the '''Jacobian''', which is performed by the 'jacobian' function. To use it, you should define an array of symbolic functions and then just pass it to the function (note the difference between the use of this function, which requires all equations to be in the same array, and the use of 'solve', which requires you to separately pass each equation):

 &gt;&gt; syms a b
 &gt;&gt; f = [a^2 + b^2 - 1, a + b - 1];
 &gt;&gt; Jac = jacobian(f)
 Jac = [ 2*a, 2*b]
       [   1,   1]

Note that the first row is the gradient of f(1) and the second the gradient of f(2).

If you only want a specific partial derivative, not the entire Jacobian, you can call the 'diff' function with the function you want to differentiate and the variable you wish to differentiate with respect to. If none is specified, differentiation occurs with respect to the variable closest to 'x' in the alphabet.

 &gt;&gt; diff(f(1), a)
 ans = 2*a

It is worth noting that to complete an '''implicit''' differentiation, one can explicitly state the implicit assumption by multiplying the differentiated function by &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx_i}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ith variable in a multivariable equation. 

{{todo|Put in an example of this for a simple implicit function (like &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2 = 4 &lt;/math&gt;or something)}}

Indefinite integration of multivariate functions works the same as for single functions; pass the function and MATLAB will return the indefinite integral with respect to the variable closest to x:

 &gt;&gt; int(f(1))
 ans = a^2*b+1/3*b^3-b

This is the integral with respect to b. To avoid confusion, you can specify the variable of integration with a second argument, as with differentiation.

 &gt;&gt; int(f(1), a)
 ans = 1/3*a^3+b^2*a-a

Definite integration (as far as I can tell) can only be done with respect to one variable at a time, and this is done by specifying the variable, then the bounds:

 &gt;&gt; int(f(1), a, 1, 2) %integrate a from 1 to 2, holding b constant
 ans = 4/3 + b^2

=== Analytic Solutions to ODEs ===

MATLAB can solve some simple forms of ODEs. Unlike with the integration and algebraic solving techniques, the syntax for the differential equation solver requires that you put the function in manually in a specific manner. The derivatives must be specified using the symbol 'DNV', where N is the order of the derivative and V is the variable that is changing. For example, suppose you seek the solution to the equation &lt;math&gt; \frac{{d}^2}{{dt^2}}x = -x&lt;/math&gt; , the solutions to which are of the form  x(t) = A*cos(t) + B*sin(t). You would put this equation into the 'dsolve' function as follows:

 &gt;&gt; syms x
 &gt;&gt; dsolve('D2x = -x')
 ans = C1*sin(t)+C2*cos(t)

Unlike the 'int' function, dsolve includes the integration constants. To specify initial conditions, just pass extra arguments to the 'dsolve' function as strings. If x'(0) = 2 and x(0) = 4 these are inserted as follows:

 &gt;&gt; dsolve('D2x = -x', 'Dx(0) = 2', 'x(0) = 4')
 ans = 2*sin(t)+4*cos(t)

Note that the initial conditions must also be passed as strings.

MATLAB can also solve systems of differential equations. An acceptable syntax is to pass each equation as a separate string, and then pass each initial condition as a separate string:

 &gt;&gt; SOLUTION = dsolve('Df=3*f+4*g', 'Dg =-4*f+3*g', 'f(0) = 0', 'g(0) = 1')
 SOLUTION  = f: [1x1 sym]
             g: [1x1 sym]
 &gt;&gt; SOLUTION.f
 SOLUTION.f = exp(3*t)*sin(4*t)
 &gt;&gt; SOLUTION.g
 SOLUTION.g = exp(3*t)*cos(4*t)

The 'dsolve' function, like 'solve', thus returns the solution as a structure array, with field names the same as the variables you used. Also like 'solve', you can place the variables in separate arrays by specifying more than one output variable.

=== Integral Transforms ===

MATLAB's symbolic math toolbox lets you find integral transforms (in particular, the Laplace, Fourier, and Z-transform) and their inverses when they exist. The syntax is similar to the other symbolic math functions: declare a function and pass it to the appropriate functions to obtain the transform (or inverse).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[/cell|Cell arrays]] are the easiest way to generate new lines when using the functions [[/xlabel | xlabel]], [[/ylabel | ylabel]], [[/zlabel | zlabel]], [[/text | text]], [[/title | title]], and [[/gtext | gtext]].  However, cell arrays do not always work (see next section).  

When displaying text on plots, &quot;\n&quot; is typically interpreted as '\' followed by 'n' instead of the [[w:Newline | newline]] character.  To generate multiple lines, use cell arrays.  This is done by separating each [[/string | string]] line of text with a comma and enclosing all comma-separated strings in curly braces as follows.
 &gt;&gt; title({'First line','Second line'})

Sometimes it is nice to put the value of a variable and a newline into the plot title.
You can do this like so:

 n = 4;
 x = -n:1:n;
 y = x.^2;
 plot(x,y)
 title( [ 'plot of x squared', 10, 'from x = ', num2str(-n), ' to x = ', num2str(n) ] )

The 10 outside the single quotes is the ascii value for a newline.  You don't have to use the char() function, just the number will work.

The output should look like this:

 plot of x squared
 from x = -4 to x = 4

==1. Explain and demonstrate how to prepare and finish new or old woodwork in the following ways:&lt;br&gt; a. Staining&lt;br&gt; b. Varnishing&lt;br&gt; c. Painting==
The key to a good finish is surface preparation.  Whether you are staining, varnishing, or painting, the surface must be clean.  How it is cleaned depends more on the suface being finished than on the method used to finish it.

Do not paint over dirt, cobwebs, or loose paint.  For drywall, start by vacuuming all the cobwebs and dust.  Then use a household cleaner and wash the walls down.  Allow them to dry.  Scrape off any loose paint. If it does not all come off, sand the zone between where it did come off and where it would not to eliminate any ridges (these ridges will become much more apparent after painting).

In kitchens, the cleaning is especially important, as surfaces will have been coated with grease.  This must be removed, or the lifetime of the paint job will be severely curtailed.

In bathrooms, check for mildew.  If any is found, it must be killed with a solution consisting of one part bleach, three parts water.  Mildew is a living thing.  If you simply wash it off and paint over it, it is sure to come back.  Be careful to not get any bleach on your clothing, as it will cause it to discolor.  Once you have wiped the bleach solution on the wall (or sprayed it on), allow it to sit for 15 minutes to do its work.  Then rinse it off with clean water.

The next thing to do is address any defects in the walls.  Do not assume that the paint will cover them.  Paint is more likely to amplify imperfections than it is to cover them.  Cover any holes with spackling compound, using a putty knife or a taping knife.  Reseat any nail pops, setting them below the surface (one final blow with the hammer will put a small dent in the wall - this is actually desired).  Then fill the hole with joint compound and wipe it off with a taping knife.

Larger imperfections should be re-enforced and covered with drywall tape and a layer of joint compound.  Work the joint compound with a taping knife until it is as smooth as you can make it.  Allow it to dry, then sand it.  If necessary, add a second layer of joint compound. Allow it to dry and sand it.

For bare wood, sand out any imperfections and glue down any splits or nail pops.  Sand over any glued areas once the glue dries (stain and varnish will show you exactly where there is glue instead of wood, and you do not want this to happen).  Wipe the wood down with a cloth dampened with whatever solvent is used for cleaning the finish (that is, if the finish is cleaned out of the brushes with turpentine, wipe the wood down with turpentine).  Consult the product information on the can of finish to determine the proper solvent.

Wood that has already been stained can be prepared by rubbing down with steel wool, followed by a cloth dampened with the proper solvent (see above).

==2. Give two methods of stippling.==
When you stipple, a glaze coat of one color is applied and then textured, revealing the undercoat of a base color.
In both cases, a glaze is mixed with latex paint at a 5:1 ratio (five parts glaze, one part paint).  Stippling should be done in small sections moving from the top of the wall to the bottom so that if there are drips or runs, it will not ruin the work already completed.

With either method begin as follows:
*Prepare the surface as you would for any interior painting project, repairing cracks, taping baseboards, removing outlet and light switch covers, etc.
*Paint the surface a light color for the undercoating.  
*Allow the base color to dry completely.
*Mix the paint and glaze.

===Brush Stippling===
*Using a sponge, wet a small section of the wall.  This will allow the glaze to go on fluidly.
*Paint the glaze onto the dampened surface with a regular paint brush.  Work the brush top to bottom, then side to side, then top to bottom again, making criss-crosses.
*Stipple the wet glaze by jabbing the bottom of a stippling brush's bristles onto the surface head-on.  The brush should be perpendicular to the wall.  Continually alter the pattern.  
*Go over the surface once quickly, and then go back over it again to refine the pattern.

===Sponge Stippling===
*Select a natural sea sponge and cut it in half to form a flat surface.
*Prepare the wall and paint the base color as with brush stippling (described above).
*Dip the sponge in a bucket of water and then wring it dry.
*Press the sponge lightly into a tray full of paint.  
*Blot the sponge on a paper towel to remove excess paint.
*Lightly dab the sponge on the wall, making J or X patterns.
*Overlap the patterns as you move from side to side and top to bottom.
*Dip the sponge in water and wring it out again occasionally.

==3. When should a paint spray gun be used?==
A paint spray gun should be used when painting highly textured surfaces.  Examples of textured surfaces include stucco, cinder blocks, and rough-hewn lumber. These are very difficult (but not impossible) to paint with a roller or a brush.

Paint sprayers are much faster than rollers and brushes, and they are not limited to textured surfaces.  If you can protect areas that are ''not'' to be painted, a sprayer can be used in almost any area.  Avoid using near furnaces, ovens, and water heaters though unless you are able to extinguish (or prevent) open flames.  Gas water heaters, gas ovens, gas furnaces, propane furnaces, and oil furnaces all have open flames.  Remember that if the paint is flammable, so are the fumes.

==4. Describe the proper methods for cleaning and care of paint and varnish brushes.==
Proper cleaning starts ''before'' you begin to paint.  If using a water-soluble paint, dip the brush in water.  If using a paint (or varnish) that is not water-soluble, dip the brush in whatever solvent is called for.  Then shake the brush to remove excess water (or solvent).  Once this is done, you are ready to dip the brush in the paint for the first time.

When you are finished painting, run water over the outside of the brush, letting it flow away from the brush's ferrule and off the tip of the bristles.  Then fill an empty, clean paint can (or bucket) halfway with water and add a couple tablespoons of dish washing liquid.  Swirl the brush around in the soapy water, but do not jab the bristles into the bottom of the can.  This will cause the bristles to develop permanent bends.

Rinse the brush in a second can (or bucket) of clear water.  If the rinse water clouds up, return to the soapy water, and then rinse again.  Repeat until the rinse water does not cloud up.  Hang the brush to dry by the hole drilled in the tip of its handle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askthebuilder.com/686_Cleaning_Paint_Brushes.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==5. Show how to use putty properly.==
Putty is used to fill nail holes an blemishes in door and wind facings, baseboards, and crown moldings.  It should have the consistency of paste.  Tear off a small ball of putty and push it into the hole with your finger.  Then, still using your finger, wipe it away, so that some is left in the hole, but the top is even with the surface of the wood.  Allow the putty to dry before painting.

==6. Explain the difference between exterior and interior paints.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/ExteriorInteriorPaint}}

==7. Make a list of ten proper color schemes for interior house painting using color swatches from a paint shop. Why are bright/loud colors not preferred?==
Bright colors make it difficult to relax in a room, so they should be avoided in most interior spaces.

{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Color Schemes}}

==8. Explain the composition of and when you use the following paints:==
===a. Oil based===
Oil paint is a type of slow-drying paint that consists of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried film.

Oil-based paints are the better choice for high-traffic areas, for metal surfaces, or for surfaces that will be exposed to low temperatures.  Oil-based paints also resist staining better than water-based paints.

===b. Water based===
Latex paint is a water-borne dispersion of sub-micrometre polymer particles. The term &quot;latex&quot; in the context of paint simply means an aqueous dispersion; latex rubber (the sap of the rubber tree that has historically been called latex) is not an ingredient. These dispersions are prepared by emulsion polymerization. Latex paints cure by a process called coalescence where first the water, and then the trace, or coalescing, solvent, evaporate and draw together and soften the latex binder particles and fuse them together into irreversibly bound networked structures, so that the paint will not redissolve in the solvent/water that originally carried it.

Water-based paints are best for any areas not suited to oil-based paints.  They resist fading better and are easier to apply.  Clean up is also much easier, and the odor during application is far lower than with oil-based paints.

==9. Paint the woodwork of at least four rooms.==
The woodwork includes the baseboards, door frames, window frames, and crown molding.  This requirement suggests that the woodwork be painted a different color than the walls.  It could also have a natural finish (such as varnish).

==10. Paint at least one room, showing skill in keeping paint where it belongs.==
Paint belongs on the walls and ceilings.  It does not belong on the floor, windows, outlet and switch covers, door knobs, latches, or hinges.  Nor does it belong on light fixtures, smoke detectors, sprinklers, art work, mirrors, telephones, appliances, or furniture. 

If the woodwork is to have a finish distinct from the walls, paint does not belong there either.

How do we keep paint where it belongs?  
*Lay down a drop cloth.
*Tape the baseboards, windows, hinges.  
*Remove door knobs and switch and outlet covers.
*Move furniture out of the room, or cover it with a drop cloth.
*Remove or tape light fixtures.
*'''Do not paint over smoke detectors''' - tape them off, and remove the tape when you are finished.

Rather than taping, professional painters usually use a technique called &quot;cutting in.&quot;  With this technique, an angled brush is used, and it is kept mostly dry.  It doesn't take much paint to cover trim.  Put no more than an inch or two of paint in a bucket that has no lip.  Grip the brush by the bristles as if you were holding a pencil.  Treat the handle as if it were there only to hold the bristles together, not as something you hold the brush by.

Dip the brush no more than half in inch into the paint, then drag it dry along the wall of the bucket to remove the excess paint.  Then paint a line.  The outer bristles form the sharp edge of the line.  Practice on the wall before you move in to the critical areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://homerenovations.about.com/od/wallsandtrim/a/artcutinpaint.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

But sometimes in spite of our best efforts, paint ''does'' go where it does not belong.  When that happens don't panic - just clean off the unwanted paint.

==11. Tell and show how to properly store unused paint.==
The key to storing unused paint is to prevent air from reaching it.  This is done by properly sealing the can. Store paint where is will not freeze.

Proper storage begins before you open the can.  Open the can with a ''key'' - a special tool made just for opening paint cans.  Most paint stores will give you one when you buy paint.  If not, you can buy one - they're not expensive (or stores wouldn't be giving them away).  Prying the lid off with a screwdriver will distort the lip making it impossible to achieve a tight seal.

Once the can is open, do not wipe a wet brush on the lip of the paint can.  This forms a ''chime'' which makes it difficult to seal the can properly.  Use a plastic pouring cap to pour the paint into a tray or into a small bucket.  If you do get paint on the can's lip, wipe it off with a cloth before sealing it.

Place the lid on the can and tap it closed with a rubber mallet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The functions [[/warning | warning]], [[/error | error]], [[/sprintf | sprintf]]  and [[/fprintf | fprintf]] will interpret '\n' as a newline character.   
For example

 &gt;&gt; error('This error\nhas a newline.')
 ??? This error
 has a newline.

Though previous versions of this wiki claimed this functionality was introduced in MATLAB 6.5 (R13), it doesn't work in 7.4.0 (2007a).  The explanation that this change happened when formatted error strings were introduced in the [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/rn/matlab14.html#53611 Release Notes] for that release was unhelpful.  

To add a newline character in versions where the above example doesn't work, use SPRINTF or CHAR(10):

 &gt;&gt; error(sprintf('This error\nhas a newline.'))
 ??? This error
 has a newline.

 disp(['abcd' char(10) 'efgh'])
 abcd
 efgh

This works as well:
 disp(['abcd', 10,  'efgh'])
 abcd
 efgh

The input() function lets your scripts process data entered at the command line. All input is converted into a numerical value or array. The argument for the input() function is the message or prompt you want it to display. Inputting strings require an additional 's' argument. Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 %test.m
 %let's ask a user for x
 x = input('Please enter a value for x:')
&lt;/source&gt;
Then running the script would produce the output:
 Please enter a value for x:3
 &lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 x = 3
 
 &gt;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==M-files==

There are 2 types of m-file
:*Scripts
:*Functions
Scripts are a type of m-file that runs in the current workspace.  So if you call a script from the command line (base workspace) the script will use and manipulate the variables of the base workspace.  This can get very messy and lead to all sorts of strange errors when loops are involved and the coder is lazy about about naming their loop variables (i.e. for i = 1:10, if every loop uses i, j, or k then it's likely that any script called from a loop will alter the loop variable).

Functions are wholly contained in themselves.  They possess their own workspace keeping workspaces separate.  This means that all variables necessary for a particular function must be passed or defined in some way.  This can get tedious for complex algorithms requiring lots of variables.  However, any manipulations of variables are discarded when the function is exited.  Only those output arguments provided by the function are available to the calling workspace.  This means that loops can use i, j, or k all they want because the function's workspace and the calling workspace do not mix.

Any command valid at the command line is valid in any m-file so long as the necessary variables are present in the m-files operating workspace.

Using functions properly any change can be affected to any algorithm or plotting tool.  This allows for automation of repetitive tasks.

It is optional to end the M-file with 'end'; doing so, however, can lead to complications if you have conditionals or loops in your code, or if you're planning on using multiple functions in the same file (see nested functions for details on this).

===Requirements for a function===

Custom functions follow this syntax in their most basic form:

 function [output1, output2, ...]= ''function_name''(input_arg1,input_arg2)
         ''statements''
 return;

In current versions of MATLAB the ''return;'' line is not required.  The ''function_name'' can be anything you like but it is best if the m-file name is ''function_name''.m.  Calling the function from the command line or another m-file is done by invoking the m-file name of the function with the necessary input and output arguments.

Within the function itself, there must be a statement that defines each of the output arguments (output1, output2, etc.).  Without some declaration the variable for the output argument doesn't exist in the function's workspace.  This will cause an error about &quot;one or more output arguments&quot;.  It is good practice to initialize the output arguments at the beginning of the function.

Typically output arguments are initialized to empty ([]) or 0 or -1 or something equivalent for other data types.  The reason is that if the function encounters an error you've anticipated then the function can return (via the ''return'' command) with those default values.  If the initialization value is an invalid value then it can easily be checked by the calling function for any errors which may not throw a MATLAB error.

====Path====

In order to invoke a function that function's m-file must be in the current path.  There is a default path that can be setup through the File menu or the ''addpath'' command.  The order of the path is important as MATLAB searches the path in order and stops searching after it finds the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; instance of that m-file name.

The current path is
:*the current directory (which can be seen at the top of the MATLAB window or by typing ''pwd'' at the command prompt
:*the default path
Note that MATLAB will always search the current directory before searching any of the rest of the path.

===nargin &amp; nargout===

The ''nargin'' and ''nargout'' commands are only valid inside functions since scripts are not passed any arguments.  The ''nargin'' command returns the number of passed input arguments.  This is useful in conjunction with nargchk
  nargchk(min, max, nargin)
where min is the minimum number of arguments necessary for the function to operate and max is the maximum number of valid input arguments.

The ''nargout'' command is useful for determining which output arguments to return.  Typically, the outputs are the end results of some algorithm and they are easily calculated.  However, in some instances secondary output arguments can be time consuming to calculate or require more input arguments than the primary output arguments do.  So the function can check the number of output arguments being requested through the ''nargout'' command.  If the caller isn't saving the secondary output arguments then they do not need to be calculated.

===varargin &amp; varargout===

When using MATLAB objects and functions they often allow the user to set properties.  The functions and objects come with default values for these properties but the user is allowed to override these defaults.  This is accomplished through the use of ''varargin''.  ''varargin'' is a cell array that is usually parsed where ''varargin{i}'' is a property and ''varargin{i+1}'' is the value the user wishes for that property.  The parsing is done with a ''for'' or ''while'' loop and a ''switch'' statement.
  function [out] = myFunc(in, varargin)

The ''varargout'' output argument option allows for a variable number of output arguments just as ''varargin'' allows for a variable number of input arguments.  From the [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/varargout.html&amp;http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GFRD_enUS257US258&amp;q=varargout+MATLAB MATLAB site]

  function [s,varargout] = mysize(x)
  nout = max(nargout,1)-1;
  s = size(x);
  for k=1:nout, varargout(k) = {s(k)}; end

returns the size vector and, optionally, individual sizes. So

  [s,rows,cols] = mysize(rand(4,5));

returns s = [4 5], rows = 4, cols = 5.

==Useful syntax guidelines==

Placing the semicolon symbol after every line tells the compiler not to place that line of code in the command prompt and then execute. This can make your programs run a lot faster. Also, placing a semicolon after every line helps with the debugging process.

 syms x y z;
 w=[x y z];
 e=[1 2 3];
 t=jacobian(e,w);

Placing comments in your code can help other people (and yourself) understand your code as it gets more complex. 

 syms x y z;                 %syms command makes x y and z symbolic
 w=[x y z];
 e=[1 2 3];
 t=jacobian(e,w);

Comments can also Identify who wrote the code and when they wrote it.

 %Some code writer
 %mm/dd/yyyy 

See the 'comments' section for more details on this.

{{MatlabNav}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Placing comments ==

Comment lines begin with the character '%', and anything after a '%' character is ignored by the interpreter. The % character itself only tells the interpreter to ignore the remainder of the same line.

In the MATLAB Editor, commented areas are printed in green by default, so they should be easy to identify. There are two useful keyboard shortcuts for adding and removing chunks of comments. Select the code you wish to comment or uncomment, and then press Ctrl-R ({{unicode|&amp;#x2318;}}-/ for Mac) to place one '%' symbol at the beginning of each line and Ctrl-T ({{unicode|&amp;#x2318;}}-T for Mac) to do the opposite.

MATLAB also supports multi-line comments, akin to &lt;code&gt;/* ... */&lt;/code&gt; in languages like C or C++, via the &lt;code&gt;%{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%}&lt;/code&gt; delimiters. But there is a small and important difference. In MATLAB it is not allowed that the lines starting with &lt;code&gt;%{&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;%}&lt;/code&gt; contains any other text (execpt white spaces). Otherwise it would not work. E.g.

&lt;pre&gt;
%{ for i = 1:10
  disp(i)
end %}
&lt;/pre&gt;
gives an error, but
&lt;pre&gt;
%{
for i = 1:10
  disp(i)
end
%}
&lt;/pre&gt;
works just fine.

== Common uses ==

Comments are useful for explaining what function a certain piece of code performs especially if the code relies on implicit or subtle assumptions or otherwise perform subtle actions. Doing this is a good idea both for yourself and for others who try to read your code. For example,

 % Calculate average velocity, assuming acceleration is constant
 % and a frictionless environment.
 force = mass * acceleration

It is common and highly recommended to include as the first lines of text a block of comments explaining what an M file does and how to use it. MATLAB will output the comments leading up to the function definition or the first block of comments inside a function definition when you type:

 &gt;&gt; help ''functionname''

All of MATLAB's own functions written in MATLAB are documented this way as well.

Comments can also be used to identify authors, references, licenses, and so on. Such text is often found at the end of an M file though also can be found at the beginning. Finally, comments can be used to aid in debugging, as explained in [[MATLAB Programming/Debugging M Files|Debugging M Files]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{merge to | Cryptography/Hashes}}

A ''hash function'' is the implementation of the algorithm that given some data as input will generate an [[Cryptography/Hashes|hash]]. 

For Ex: If our hash function is 'X' and we have 'wiki' as our input... then X('wiki')= a5g78 i.e. some hash value.

Qualities of a  good hash function are

1. Produces a fixed length key for variable input&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;s&gt;
2. Has got infinite key space, implies the next point&lt;br/&gt;
3. No collisions (i.e. no two different pieces of input give the same key value)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/s&gt;

== Applications of hash functions ==

Non-cryptographic hash functions have many applications,&lt;ref&gt;
applications of non-cryptographic hash functions are described in [[Data Structures/Hash Tables]] and [[Algorithm Implementation/Hashing]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
but in this book we focus on applications that require cryptographic hash functions:

A typical use of a cryptographic hash would be as follows: Alice poses to Bob a tough math problem and claims she has solved it. Bob would like to try it himself, but would yet like to be sure that Alice is not bluffing. Therefore, Alice writes down her solution, appends a random nonce, computes its hash and tells Bob the hash value (whilst keeping the solution secret). This way, when Bob comes up with the solution himself a few days later, Alice can verify his solution but still be able to prove that she had the solution earlier.

In actual practice, Alice and Bob will often be computer programs, and the secret would be something less easily spoofed than a claimed puzzle solution. The above application is called a commitment scheme. Another important application of secure hashes is verification of message integrity. Determination of whether or not any changes have been made to a message (or a file), for example, can be accomplished by comparing message digests calculated before, and after, transmission (or any other event) (see Tripwire, a system using this property as a defense against malware and malfeasance). A message digest can also serve as a means of reliably identifying a file.

A related application is password verification. Passwords are usually not stored in cleartext, for obvious reasons, but instead in digest form.
We discuss password handling -- in particular, why hashing the password once is inadequate -- in more detail in a later chapter, [[../Secure Passwords#Password handling|Password handling]].

A hash function is a key part of [[../message authentication/]] (HMAC).

For both security and performance reasons, most digital signature algorithms specify that only the digest of the message be &quot;signed&quot;, not the entire message. Hash functions can also be used in the generation of pseudo-random bits.

[[../SHA-1/]], [[../MD5/]], and RIPEMD-160 are among the most commonly-used message digest algorithms as of 2004. In August 2004, researchers found weaknesses in a number of hash functions, including MD5, SHA-0 and RIPEMD. This has called into question the long-term security of later algorithms which are derived from these hash functions. In particular, SHA-1 (a strengthened version of SHA-0), RIPEMD-128 and RIPEMD-160 (strengthened versions of RIPEMD). Neither SHA-0 nor RIPEMD are widely used since they were replaced by their strengthened versions.

Other common cryptographic hashes include [[../SHA-2/]] and [[../Tiger/]].


Later we will discuss the &quot;birthday attack&quot; and other techniques people use for [[../Breaking Hash Algorithms/]].

[[Image:Willamette meteorite.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Willamette meteorite, the largest ever found in the United States]]
A meteorite is an extraterrestrial body that survives its impact with the Earth's surface without being destroyed. While in space it is called a meteoroid. When it enters the atmosphere, air resistance causes the body to heat up and emit light, thus forming a fireball, also known as a meteor or shooting star.

More generally, a meteorite on a celestial body is an object that has come from elsewhere in space.

Most meteoroids disintegrate when entering the Earth's atmosphere, however an estimated 500 meteorites ranging in size from marbles to basketballs or larger do reach the surface each year; only 5 or 6 of these are typically recovered and made known to scientists. Few meteorites are large enough to create impact craters. Instead, they typically arrive at the surface at their terminal velocity (free-fall) and, at most, create a small pit. Even so, falling meteorites have caused damage to property, livestock, and even people in historic times.

==10. Name five constellations that are visible between sunset and midnight in your hemisphere during:==
===a. The summer months.===
'''Northern Hemisphere:'''
In the east you should be able to find '''Cygnus''' (the Northern Cross) and '''Aquila'''.  Directly overhead you should see '''Lyra'''.  To the west you should be able to find '''Virgo''', '''Leo''', and '''Bootes'''.

'''Southern Hemisphere:'''
In the east you should be able to find '''Aquila''', '''Capricorn''', and '''Sagitarius'''.  Directly overhead you should see '''Scorpius'''.  To the southwest you should be able to find '''Crux''' (the Southern Cross) and '''Centaurus'''.

===b. The winter months.===

'''Northern Hemisphere:'''
To the south you should be able to see '''Orion''', '''Canis Major''', '''Canis Minor''', '''Gemini''', and '''Auriga.'''

'''Southern Hemisphere:'''
In the east you should be able to find '''Canis Major''', and '''Canis Minor'''.  In the north you should see '''Orion'''.  To the west you should be able to find '''Cetus''' and '''Fornax'''.

==11. At what time of year is the constellation Orion best seen? Locate and identify in the sky the three brightest stars of this constellation.==
Orion is best seen in the '''winter''' because it is then visible just after sunset, and throughout most of the night.  In the Northern Hemisphere the winter sky is generally clearer than the summer sky.  The three brightest stars in Orion are '''Rigel''' (right foot), '''Betelguese''' (left shoulder), and '''Bellatrix''' (right shoulder).

==12. How are the letters of the Greek alphabet used to name stars in a constellation? Give five illustrations of the use of the letters of the Greek alphabet in naming the stars of a constellation.==
The brightest star in a constellation is called ''alpha'' plus the constellation name.  The second brightest is named ''beta'', the third brightest is named ''gamma'', and so forth.  The best known example of this is ''Alpha Centauri'' which is the brightest star in the constellation Centaur.  However, Alpha Centauri is actually a binary star, so the first two stars in our list can be '''Alpha Centauri A''', and '''Alpha Centauri B'''.  '''Acrux''', '''Becrux''', and '''Gacrux''' are the three brightest stars in ''Crux'', the Southern Cross, and are so named as an abbreviation of Alpha-Crux, Beta-Crux, and Gamma-Crux.

==13. Locate the 15 first-magnitude stars as they appear throughout the year.==

{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problematic requirement
|This requirement cannot be met as it is written unless the Pathfinder is lucky enough to be able to travel to both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres or into the tropics.  Many Southern Hemisphere stars are visible south of the Tropic of Cancer, so if you happen to be planning a vacation (or a mission trip) to the Virgin Islands, look for the five first magnitude stars in the Southern Hemisphere.  
|Locate the 15 first-magnitude stars on a star chart and observe all of them that appear between sunset and midnight during a three month period in your area.
}}

===First-magnitude stars in the Northern Hemisphere===
====Sirius====
[[Image:Finding_sirius.png|thumb|right|300px|Position of Sirius]]
Sirius is the brightest star in the night-time sky, with a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46. It is located in the constellation Canis Major.  As the major star of the &quot;Big Dog&quot; constellation, it is often called the &quot;Dog Star&quot;.  Sirius can be seen from every inhabited region of the Earth's surface.  At a distance of 2.6 pc or 8.57 light years, Sirius is also one of the nearest stars to Earth. The best time of year to view it is around January 1, when it reaches the meridian at midnight.  Sirius can be found by following Orion's belt from the viewer's right to left.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Arcturus====
[[image:Finding arcturus.png|thumb|right|400px|Position of Arcturus]]
Arcturus is the brightest star in the constellation Boötes, and the third brightest star in the night sky, with a visual magnitude of −0.05, after Sirius and Canopus.  Arcturus can be found by following the arc made by handle of the Big Dipper (away from the dipper's bowl).
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Vega and Altair====
[[Image:Summer_triangle.png|thumb|250px|right|The Summer Triangle]]
Vega is the brightest star in Lyra, and the fifth brightest star in the sky. It is the third brightest star in the Northern night sky, after Sirius and Arcturus, and can often be seen near the zenith in the mid-northern latitudes during the Northern Hemisphere summer.

Vega is a vertex of the Summer Triangle, which consists of Vega (in Lyra), Deneb (in Cygnus) and Altair (in Aquila). If one is to consider this asterism a right triangle, then Vega would correspond to its right angle. This triangle is very recognisable in the northern skies for there are few bright stars in its vicinity.

Altair is the brightest star in the constellation Aquila and the twelfth brightest star in the nighttime sky, at visual magnitude 0.77.  Like Vega, it is a member of the Summer Triangle.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Capella====
[[Image:Finding_capella.png|thumb|400px|right|Locating Capella]]
Capella is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga and sixth brightest star in the sky. Although it appears as a single point to the naked eye, Capella is actually a bright close binary pair of stars along side a second, fainter binary.  Capella can be found by following the line made by the two stars in the Big Dipper's handle and extending it across the Dipper's bowl.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Rigel and Betelguese====
[[Image:Orionin tähdistö.png|thumb|400px|left|The positions of Rigel and Betelguese within Orion]]
'''Rigel''' is the brightest star in the constellation Orion and the seventh brightest star in the sky, with visual magnitude 0.12. Rigel is Orion's left foot.

'''Betelguese''' is the second brightest star in the constellation Orion, and the tenth brightest star in the night sky.  Betelguese is Orion's right shoulder.  Betelgeuse is a red supergiant, one of the physically largest stars known. If it were placed at the center of our solar system, its outer surface would possibly extend to the orbit of Mars.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Procyon====
[[image:Finding_procyon.png|thumb|400px|left|Position of Procyon]]
'''Procyon''' is the brightest star in the constellation Canis Minor and the eighth brightest star in the nighttime sky.  It can be found using stars in Orion in two different ways:
* By following Orion's left foot (Rigel) through the tip of his sword.
* By following Bellatrix (his left shoulder) through Betelguese (his right shoulder).

Procyon, Sirius, and Betelguese also form an equilateral triangle.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Aldebaran====
[[Image:Wintersky.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The Winter Circle]]
Once you can find Rigel, Sirius, Procyon, and Capella, finding Aldebaran is easy, for these five stars, plus Pollux make up the Winter Circle.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Spica====
[[Image:Finding_spica.png|thumb|left|300px|Location of Spica]]
Spica is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo, and the 15th brightest star in the sky.  It can be found by following a line starting at the star ρ Boötis, and continuing  through Arcturus to Spica.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

===First-magnitude stars in the Southern Hemisphere===
====Canopus====
'''Canopus''' is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Carina, and the second brightest star in the sky, with a visual magnitude of −0.62, second only to Sirius.  Canopus is a yellowish-white supergiant star. It is located well into the southern hemisphere, at a declination of −52° 42' (2000) and a right ascension of 06h24.0m, and is visible on the southern horizon of even the southern US States as far north as Virginia or Kentucky.  That far north, it can only be seen on a very clear night during the last two weeks of February directly south very low on the horizon just after sunset.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Alpha Centauri A and Hadar====
'''Alpha Centauri A''' is located in the Southern Hemisphere, and can only be seen in the United States from points south of Daytona Beach, Florida or San Antonio, Texas.  Even then, it barely rises above the horizon directly to the South for a few days around July 8.

'''Hadar''' is also known as Beta Centauri, for it is the second brightest star in the constellation Centaurus.  It is just to the West of Alpha Centauri A, so if you can see the one, you can probably see the other.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Achernar====
'''Achernar''' is located in the Southern Hemisphere, and therefore is never visible in most of North America.  It can be seen from Dallas Texas and points south in mid to late November due South, and ''very'' low on the horizon.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

====Acrux====
[[image:Acrux_kstars.png|thumb|200px|right|Position of Acrux]] 
'''Acrux''' is the brightest star in constellation Crux (the Southern Cross) and the thirteenth brightest star in the nighttime sky, at visual magnitude 0.77.  Acrux is represented in the flag of Australia as one of the 5 stars that comprise the Southern Cross. Since Acrux is at roughly −60° declination, it is generally only visible south of the Tropic of Cancer and therefore didn't receive an ancient traditional name; &quot;Acrux&quot; is simply a combination of the A in Alpha plus Crux (meaning &quot;cross&quot;). Acrux is the southernmost first magnitude star, just a bit more southerly than Alpha Centauri.  Acrux ''can'' be seen as far north as Miami, Florida, but it only ''barely'' rises above the horizon.  You might be able to see it due south around May 8 (any year) at about 9:00 pm.  If you wait around until midnight, Alpha Centauri and Hadar will also be visible around that date as well (also directly to the south and just over the horizon). 
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==14. With the use of a diagram, show the relative positions of the earth and moon during high and low tides.==
[[Image:Tide_diagram.png]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
Since the Earth's crust is solid, it moves, along with everything inside it, as one whole, as defined by the average force on it. For the Earth's shape this average force is equal to the force on its center. The water at the surface is free to move following forces on its particles.  One of the forces that affects tides is the gravity of the Moon.  The force of gravity gets weaker as the distance between two bodies increases, and since the center of the Earth is farther away than the surface nearest the Moon, the Moon's gravity pulls on the surface water stronger than it pulls on the whole of the Earth.  This causes the water level to rise and causes a high tide.

Meanwhile, on the side of the Earth opposite the Moon, the surface is ''farther'' from the moon than the Earth's center, so the Moon pulls more strongly on the Earth as a whole than it does on the water.  This causes the water move away from the Moon, but since this is on the other side of the Earth, the water level ''still'' rises, causing a high tide.

Low tides occur at the points on the Earth where the Moon is just rising or just setting - that is, where the surface is at a 90° angle from the moon.

The Sun also has a tidal effect, but since it is much farther away, the difference between the pull of gravity at the surface of the Earth and the pull of gravity at the center is much smaller as compared to the Moon.  When the tidal action caused by the Sun and Moon reinforce one another we have a spring tide (which is higher than normal).  When they oppose one another, we have a neap tide (which is also a high tide, but lower than normal).

==15. Describe the peculiar individual characteristics of the planets in our solar system. Which ones cannot be seen without the aid of a telescope? Which two planets are seen only near the hours of sunrise or sunset?==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Stars/Planet characteristics}}

==16. Where and in what way does the Bible refer to Orion, the Pleiades, and Arcturus?==
;&lt;nowiki&gt;Job 9:9 (21st Century King James Version)&lt;/nowiki&gt;: ''&quot;Who maketh Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south;&quot;''

;&lt;nowiki&gt;Job 38:31,32 (21st Century King James Version)&lt;/nowiki&gt;: ''&quot;Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?&quot;''

;&lt;nowiki&gt;Amos 5:8 (NIV)&lt;/nowiki&gt;: ''&quot;He who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns blackness into dawn and darkens day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land— the LORD is his name.&quot;''

Most English versions of the Bible translate ''Arcturus'' as ''The Bear''.

{{AY Master|Naturalist}}
==1==


===a) Name the closest star beyond the solar system.===
Alpha Centuri the brightest of the Pointers in the Southern Cross. This star is actually comprised of three stars. Two are bright blue stars that move around each other. The third is a red dwarf that revolves around the other two. The red stars name is Proxima Centuri and at present is the closest.

===b) Compare the distance from the earth of this star with the distance of the moon to the earth.===
Closest Star: 4.243 light years

Moon: 386,000 km

===c)  What governs the tide?===
The tides are governed by the Moon, and to a lesser extent, by the Sun. Spring tides are when the pull of the moon and sun is greatest and neap tides is when the pull is least.

===d)  What causes an eclipse?===
An eclipse is caused when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are in a direct line with one another. When the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, we see a lunar eclipse, which is the Earth's shadow falling on the moon. When the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth, we see a solar eclipse, which is when the Moon's shadow falls on the Earth (blocking the Sun).

===e)  What is a shooting star?===
A shooting star is not a star at all, but rather a meteor. A meteor is any celestial body (usually quite small) that falls to the Earth. Most burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the surface, leaving a bright, short-lived streak in the sky. A meteorite is the fragment that reaches earths surface sometimes creating a crater..

===f)  How fast does light travel?===
300,000 km per second. So the distance in a year is called a light year.

==2==

=== Make a diagram showing relative positions and movements of the earth, sun, and moon. Show positions and movements for eclipses of the sun and moon.===
One may demonstrate by using an orange, walnut, and marble, or similar objects, to show positions and movements of the earth, sun, and moon when there is an eclipse of the sun and when there is an eclipse of the moon. Then draw simplw diagrammes.

Place the &quot;sun&quot; model in the center.  Place the &quot;earth&quot; some distance from the sun, and show how it travels in a near circle around the sun.  The moon travels around the earth, but it always shows the same face to the earth (it's rotation on its axis takes the same amount of time as its orbit around the earth.)

|}

==3==
=== Make a diagram of our solar system and be able to name the planets in order from the sun===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Stars/Planets}}

==4==
===  What is the difference between planets and fixed stars? Identify in the sky eight fixed stars.===
The word ''planet'' means ''wanderer'' because the planets appear to wander about the sky relative to the stars.  The fixed stars do not move in relation to one another (although they all appear to move together because of the Earth's rotation on its axis).

Which eight stars you choose to teach your Pathfinders to identify will depend on the season (spring, summer, winter, or autumn), although some stars are visible year-round.

Alpha Centauri, Beta Centauri (pointers in Southern cross), Canopus (Argo), Sirius (Canus Major), Aldebaran (Taurus), Castor, Pollux (Gemini), Rigel, Betelguse (Orion), Antares (Scorpio).

==5== 
=== What is a constellation? Name and point out six. Name two constellations visible throughout the year.===
A constellation is a pattern of stars that look grouped together. The ancient Greeks gave them names and made up myths about them. By naming constellations they made a map of the sky.



Southern Cross or Crux Australus, Orion, Virgo, Centaur, Scorpio, False Cross, Canis Major, Leo. Different constellations are visible in different seasons.

Part of the Southern Cross are on the following countries flags: Australia, Brazil,  New Zealand , Niue ,  Papua New Guinea ,  Samoa , Tokelau

What two constellations are visible throughout the year? Southern Cirumpolar Constellations.


Southern Cross, False Cross, Triangulum Australe, Apus, Centaurus, Musca, Diamond Cross, Carina.

==6==
=== For the Northern Hemisphere: draw a chart of the Big Dipper, Cassiopeia, and the North Star.  For the Southern Hemisphere: draw a chart of the Southern Cross, Orion and Scorpio.===
A series of charts is needed because the constellations are sometimes far apart.

Note 1. The Southern Cross constellation is a mix of a complete constellation Crux (cross) and the pointers from the constellation Centauri.

Note 2. Orion the hunter. In the Northern Hemisphere this is an upright hunter but in the Southern Hemisphere the hunter is up side down so is commonly referred to as ''The Pot'' or in some parts of Australasia ''The Saucepan''

Note 3. Scorpio is also upside down in the Southern Hemisphere. Most times it is viewed perpendicular to the horizon.

[[File:Crux Chart.jpeg|thumb|200px|center|Crux chart part of the Southern Cross]]
[[File:Scorpio Constellation drawing.jpeg|thumb|200px|center|Scorpio constellation]]


For the Northern Hemisphere constellations refer to the GC version of the Star Honour.

==7==  
=== What is the Milky Way? Observe the Milky Way in the night sky.===
The Milky Way is the name of our galaxy.  A galaxy is a disc of stars, and since the Earth and the rest of our Solar System are in that disc, the Milky Way appears as a faint strip in the sky.  To view it properly, you will need a very dark sky.

==8== 
=== What is the morning and evening star? Why does it carry both names?===

The morning star and evening star are one and the same body - the planet Venus.


Because it is nearer to the Sun than the Earth is, it always appears in the sky near the Sun.  This means it can only be seen either in the morning within a few hours of sunrise, or in the evening within a few hours of sunset.  Venus is the third brightest object in the sky, after the Sun and the Moon, so it is fairly easy to spot.  When it appears in the evening, it will always be in the West.  When it appears in the morning, it will always be in the East.  You may need to consult an almanac to know whether it will appear in the morning or in the evening.

==9==
===  Explain zenith and nadir===

Zenith is the point directly above a location.

Nadir is the oppisite to Zenith. It is the direction that gravity pulls from a location.



==10== 
=== What is the Aurora Australis? What causes it?===
An Aurora is a beautiful natural phenomenon that often occurs near the polar regions of Earth.

The immediate causes of aurora are precipitating energetic particles from the Sun. These particles are electrons and protons that are energized in the near geospace environment. This energization process draws its energy from the interaction of the Earth's magnetosphere with the solar wind.

==Notes==
The requirements for this honour were updated by the South Pacific Division in 2013, and those changes are reflected here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Advanced Placement Exams}}

Advanced Placement exams are created and administered by the College Board, The same organization that does SATs. The AP exam tests your knowledge of a specific subject at the college level. It is scored from 1 to 5, with 3 usually being the minimum to get college credit. The tests are taken in May, and the scores usually arrive by July.

It is not necessary to take an AP class to take that exam, and vice versa. However, it is a good idea to do so.

Unlike the SAT, AP exams contain open-ended questions in conjunction with multiple choice questions. Like the SAT, points are taken off for incorrect multiple choice answers.

== About Computer Science ==

You're thinking of getting a college degree in Computer Science, or you like computers and want to bend them to your will. Maybe you want to test out of a first-year college-level computer science course. This book can help you achieve that goal.

Before getting started, it's important to know what to expect. Computer science requires advanced logical and mathematical skills. If you have had trouble in a secondary school math class in the past, then computer science may be more difficult for you. If, on the other hand, you did extremely well in high school or college math, then you'll probably excel in computer science.

While computer science is not strictly based on programming, you will program quite a bit. You will have to know or learn how to program well, but skilled programming is not necessarily the ultimate end. Think of the first people to get a computer to play chess as the archetypal computer scientists. They did what nobody before had done on a computer, and they had to invent many of the concepts required to make it happen. At the same time, they could not have done it without a solid understanding of all that had gone before them.

== What will we learn? ==

What does it mean to program? What can I communicate to a computer? How do I tell it what I mean? Why isn't it doing what it should? And how do I stop repeating myself all the time?

You will learn:
# to build and create computer programs.
# to think carefully and logically about programs.
# to express programs in code.
# to read code and understand the program that it expresses.

The programming language we will be using throughout this book will be Java 5.0, the same language used on the current AP Computer Science exam.

It is important to pay particular attention to the parts about reading and writing code. It is the most important skill you may have as either a computer scientist or software engineer. Furthermore, there are more test questions involving reading code and understanding what it means, and how to fix problems with it, than there are of applying that understanding to predict the actions of a computer.

== Why Java? ==

Short answer: it's what's on the test.

This book will strive to isolate the essential concepts from their incarnation in any particular programming language, so expect lots of diagrams, English explanations of algorithms or designs, and '''pseudocode''', or any false code used for demonstration. Actual coding will be treated as a special case of the careful and logical thought processes which students will develop and use as computer scientists.

== Overview ==

'''''Ghosts''''' are the disembodied souls of wizards and witches who have died (as described by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], a ghost &quot;is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth&quot;). There are a large number of them in Hogwarts; they are able to speak with the living, but being incorporeal are unable to have any effect on matter.

Six ghosts are specifically named in the books: the four House ghosts ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] of Gryffindor House, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Friar|the Fat Friar]] of Hufflepuff House, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Grey Lady|the Grey Lady]] of Ravenclaw House,  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|the Bloody Baron]] of Slytherin House); [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]], the History of Magic teacher; and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves the poltergeist]] is not a ghost, but a Spirit of Chaos, who has never been alive, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=67 according to the author].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 38|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Harry, distraught over his godfather [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black']] death, corners ghost [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]], hoping to learn what happened to Sirius after he died. Nick tells him, &quot;Wizards can leave their imprint on the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod,&quot; but it takes special preparation, and it is a half existence, neither living nor dead. Nick chose that route because he feared death, but he believes that Sirius would not have done so.

== Analysis ==

Throughout the books, ghosts are rather an aloof presence, intimating that death is not final; as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] says in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], to one who has lived a full life, &quot;death is but the next great adventure.&quot;

Ghosts are unusual magical creatures. In some ways, they are not creatures at all, but rather characters just like all the other living people in the books. But they are not quite the same, of course. Physically, they are semi-transparent, non-corporeal beings. Mentally, they enter a state somewhere between living and dead. 

Ghosts can pass through solid objects: for instance, Professor Binns passes through the blackboard to enter his classroom. Ghosts interact with the living as well, just as Professor Binns interacts with his students. It seems that a ghost's sensibilities are somewhat altered after death, such as their perception of music — an orchestra of thirty musical saws would probably be bizarre and dreadful to the living. Professor Binns never seems able to sense his students' presence or emotions. Also, ghosts seem to remain tied to a place, some more than others. Professor Binns may be tied to the classroom where he taught while living, as Myrtle seems tied to the girls' bathroom she was killed in. 

While ghosts as a rule have no affect on the physical world — people walk right through them, for example — there are some exceptions. Professor Binns can use materials in his classroom to teach, and Moaning Myrtle seems able to turn on all the bathroom faucets when she is particularly upset. 

Of all the ghosts at Hogwarts, by far the largest role is played by Moaning Myrtle. She is instrumental in Harry discovering the Chamber of Secrets in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], and assists Harry with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|second task]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. She also becomes a confidante to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], when he seeks solace over having to perform a deadly task.

Nearly Headless Nick's role is largely instructional, explaining many aspects about the school and its history to Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]. He spends some time discussing the nature of death with Harry, as mentioned above. The author has said in an interview that the series became rather more centered around the mystery of death after her mother passed away; it is possible that some of Nick's speech here may echo the author's internal thoughts on the subject.

The Grey Lady assists Harry in locating the final [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

=== Shades ===

In several books, these &quot;spirits&quot; are conjured forth by one means or another. As these have no permanent existence, reverting when the spell recalling them is ended, they are not properly ghosts at all. It is perplexing that there is no term for these appearances. It is certainly true that their appearance is always due to extremely rare magic: the [[Muggles' Guide to  Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]] effect, at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 34|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], which shows us the shades belonging to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], the muggle [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]], and Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|father]] that were retained within Voldemort's wand; and, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]], which summons the shades of James and Lily Potter, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. In the ''Muggles' Guide'', as the author has not suggested a term for them, we use &quot;shades&quot; to refer to these recalled essences or souls of the departed.

=== Horcrux ===

A &quot;ghostly&quot; figure appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. Again, this is not properly a ghost, as the associated human, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], is nominally still alive. This Tom Riddle, however, explains that he is a &quot;memory&quot; which has been given being and life by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], whose life force is being fatally drained to resurrect the memory into a living form. More detail is learned about this appearance later in the series, first when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], in his memories, is seen to describe [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] to Riddle, and later when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] tells Harry what she has learned about Horcruxes from the books she extracted from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s study.

=== Waystation ===

A third place where those who have died are seen, this one appearing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], appears to Harry as a waystation that is a surprisingly clean and empty simulacrum of King's Cross Station. Here, he meets what might be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] shade, who tells Harry many things that were previously unknown to us and to Harry. Dumbledore closes this meeting by saying how it had all happened in Harry's mind, but that did not make it any the less real. We have reason to believe that this is Dumbledore's true spirit, as it reveals information that only the living Dumbledore would have known; it also knows about events occurring since Dumbledore's death. We have learned that people can leave fragments of themselves behind, as in the Wizarding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Paintings|Portraits]], which continue to react as their models had, and are apparently able to have original thoughts; and of course, ghosts are similarly constituted though without needing a portrait behind them. While it was possible that Dumbledore left a fragment of himself behind to educate Harry, given his dislike for breaking souls apart, it is more likely that he simply chose to have his soul remain in the waystation and await Harry's arrival. The series remains mute on how Dumbledore was able to divine these aspects of life after death; perhaps his having studied the Elder Wand gave him some insight.

Unlike ghosts, people in the Waystation are apparently solid; for instance, Harry finds that he can touch Dumbledore.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One concern with ghosts and similar manifestations actually involves something [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] mentions in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. Hermione asserts that the soul, by its nature, is very nearly unbreakable; it takes an extreme bit of psychic damage to shear some of it off. However, it appears that the artifacts left behind, portraits, ghosts, shades retained by the wands used to kill people, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s presence [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|in the Waystation]], all seem to be somehow imbued with that essence of personality we call a soul. Hermione says that dying does not damage the soul; how do these personality bits get separated? Or do the souls never proceed to their final reward until every last photograph and portrait of them is destroyed? It seems improbable that a connection remains; why would someone who has gone On care at all about what is still happening here? Additionally, none of the ten or so shades that we speak to seem to be able to say anything about what has happened to them since their deaths.

We can speculate that Dumbledore's comment after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|the duel in the Cemetery]], &quot;not ghosts, but a kind of spirit echo,&quot; is also what powers the portraits, photos, and the Waystation. We would speculate that this &quot;spirit echo,&quot; rather than being in any way part of the soul, is more a magically-enhanced visualization of the effects that the person has had on the world, amplified by means of the portrait, or by local events and surroundings. Quite possibly, the Waystation simply provided a theatre for the spirit echo contained partially in Dumbledore's portrait and largely within [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to speak directly to Harry. It is interesting that the echo of Dumbledore's spirit seems to have also retained some of his intellect... As for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]], the situation there is cloudy as well. Can it actually call back the spirits of the dead? Or does it retrieve the spirit echoes out of the memories of the wielder? We suspect that the latter is more likely, as none of the four retrieved by the Stone evinced any real knowledge of anything that Harry didn't already know.

This actually also sheds some light on Nearly Headless Nick's comments regarding how ghosts are created. Hermione comments that it takes something akin to the act of murdering another to tear the soul, whereupon the separated (or nearly separated) soul fragment can be encased in an object outside the body. It is possible that the necessary precondition to create a ghost is some form of spell like the one that creates a Horcrux, one that makes the soul more fragile and easy to break, such that a piece of it shears off at the person's death and remains on earth, loosely bound to a place, perhaps. This of course explains neither the situation of Professor Binns nor of Moaning Myrtle; Binns by repute simply didn't notice that he had died, and Myrtle was presumably too young and inexperienced to have performed the necessary preparations. It is possible that their becoming ghosts was due to some unfinished business that they had on Earth, which had the necessary effect of making their souls brittle enough to fracture at their deaths, but this is never explained in the series.

&quot;The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is required for their real happiness.&quot; Karl Marx.

&quot;....mankind will overcome this neurotic phase [religion], just as many children grow out of their similar neurosis.&quot; Sigmund Freud.

&quot;Gods and Ideas are potent reminders of man's dissatisfaction with all that is given in this world - spurs to reach out beyond. But when gods and Ideas become facts or objects of belief, when the dimension reason requires is peopled with them, reason rebels.&quot; Walter Kaufmann.

&quot;God is dead. God remains dead! We have killed him.&quot; Fiedrich Nietzsche.

&quot;In one hundred years this book [the Bible] will be forgotten and eliminated....&quot; Francois-Marie Arouet (Voltaire).

The above graphic shows the major world religions by percentage adherence with the least eleven broken out. The data was taken from Adherents.com, July 31,2006. Obviously, many religions are left out.

Evidently, despite the predictions of many philosophers, religion is still alive and well in the world.

World religion is a vast and varigated thing. It runs the gamut from atheistic and agnostic philosophies to ancestor worship to ethical monotheism. Individual religions are held by particular people or span the globe. Some religions welcome the thoughts of all other religions, some reject all thoughts but their own. There are religions with billions of adherents and there are religions with only a few hundred. Religion is a theme with many variations and we will be able to look at only a very few of those variations here. But we will look at the most common ones.

As technology has changed at an ever faster pace in the last two centuries, so many changes have occurred in religion. Many of these will be discussed in the companion volumes to this book. Many will be discussed as we look at the individual religions here.

To begin, let us look at some statistics.

According to the &lt;i&gt;World Christian Encyclopedia: A comparative survey of churches and religions - AD 30 to 2200&lt;/i&gt; (David Barnett et al., editors, Oxford University Press, 2001) there are 19 major world religions subdivided into 270 large religious groups. 34,000 smaller religions have been identified. Over half of them are independent and not interested  in connecting with the larger groups.

According to the Religious Tolerance website, the two largest religious groups in the world are Christianity and Islam. Christianity represents about 32% of the world population and Islam makes up about 19% but the growth rate of Christianity is dropping and that of Islam is rising so that, given the current statistics, Islam is expected to overtake Christianity as the world's dominant religion sometime in the 21st century. Christianity is growing at about 2.3% annually and Islam is growing at about 2.9%.

Descriptive Religion is a dynamic disciple. Technology, population dynamics, changing societal issues, and many other factors affect the characteristics of world religions. Each religious group, indeed, each religious individual has to constantly make decisions about whether to &quot;keep up&quot; with their changing environment or to hold to centuries old traditions. Many feel that their religious beliefs and traditions are timeless and appropriate for any age. So religions continue to divide and change.

Undoubtedly, by the time this book is finished, there will have been more changes in the nature of world religious groups, some of those changes very significant. For that reason, the very interested person would do well to supplement their study by referring constantly to changing data in websites such as those given below and other statistical references.

      <comment>/* The Eight Labour */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Labours of Heracles''' (also '''Labours of Hercules''') was given to Heracles as his penance for unintentionally killing his wife and children because of his great anger. In order to purge his sin from doing that crime, he voluntarily became the servant of his cousin who is also the king of Mycenae, Eurystheus. It was said that the labours were actually urged by Hera to Eurystheus and she devised the difficult tasks.

==The First Labour==
'''Slay the Nemean Lion'''

:The Nemean lion was a fierce creature which could not be hurt by any mortal weapon. Heracles finished it by beating it with his club and strangling it. Upon killing the animal, Hercules used the lion's own claw to remove the weapon-proof skin, providing an impenetrable cloak seen in many paintings and sculptures of the hero.

==The Second Labour==
'''Slay the Hydra'''

: The Hydra was a huge serpent which lived in a swamp in Lerna. The Hydra had 9 heads, with very long necks. It had a poisonous bite which was fatal. Its central head was immortal. When one of the mortal heads was cut, two additional heads would grow immediately to replace it. Heracles finished them off by burning the eight mortal heads, and then with the help of his nephew, Iolaus, he buried the only immortal head under a huge rock.

==The Third Labour==
'''Bring back a Stag with Golden Horns and Bronze Hoofs alive'''

:The stag had to be brought back alive, when Heracles could have easily killed it. Thus, for him bringing it back was not an easy task. The stag, which lived in the forests of Cerynitia, was scared easily and fled to Artemis. Heracles hunted the stag for a whole year before he succeeded. He then captures the animal, puts it in a net and carries it back to king Eurystheus.

==The Fourth Labour==
'''Captured A Great Boar in Mount Erymanthus'''

:Heracles chased the boar from one place to another for a long time, until he was exhausted of running and having to chase the boar. He finally succeeded when he drove the boar into deep snow and trapped it there.

==The Fifth Labour==
'''Clean the Augean Stables in One Day'''

:Cleaning the Augean Stables would take thirty days because it held thousands of cattle. The stalls had not been cleared out for a year. Heracles accomplished the fifth labour by diverting the flow of two rivers through the stables, creating a great flood which instantly washed out the stables, cleaning them. Hercules finished this labour quickly enough to have a little extra free time, with which he started the early Olympic Games to honour Zeus who granted Hercules a wish because of it.

==The Sixth Labour==
'''Drive Away the Stymphalian Birds'''

:The Stymphalian birds are plaguing the people of Stymphalus of its number. They are man-eating birds with bronze beaks, claws, and wings. Heracles accomplished this labour with the help of Athena. Together they drive the birds out and while flying away he shot them.

==The Seventh Labour==
'''Caught the Savage Bull'''

:The savage bull was sent by Poseidon to Minos to terrorise Crete. Hercules released the bull into the countryside of Tyrins, where it caused damage and wreaked havoc until it arrived in Marathon where Theseus caught it and sacrificed it.

==The Eighth Labour==
'''Bring Back the Mares of Diomedes'''

:Heracles killed Diomedes, King of Thrace. He fed the king to the horses, which cured them of their man-eating ways, then he drove away the no longer man-eating mares, to Mycenae. Mycenae dedicated to give them to Hera. The goddess chose to turn them loose on Mount Olympus where they were eventually eaten by wild beasts.

==The Ninth Labour==
'''Bring Back the Girdle of Hippolyta'''

:Hippolyta was the Queen of the Amazons. When Heracles met her, she was willing to give her girdle. But Hera intervened and convinced the Amazons that Heracles had come to abduct their queen. Heracles killed Hippolyta thinking she was the responsible for the attack and was able to fight off others and take the girdle away. Eurystheus wanted the girdle of Hippolyta as gift for his daughter.

==The Tenth Labour==
'''Bring Back the Cattle of Geryon'''

:Geryon was a three-bodied monster living in Erythia. As a memorial of his journey, Heracles built up two great rocks, called the Pillars of Hercules. He got the cattle and took them to Mycenae in a golden cup, loaned to him by Helios (the Sun).

==The Eleventh Labour==
'''Bring Back the Golden Apples of Hesperides'''

:The eleventh labour was the most difficult so far. Heracles did not know where to find the golden apples. Hesperides was the daughter of [[Greek Mythology/Titans/Atlas|Atlas]] and she guarded a tree which was said to have golden leaves and golden apples, guarded by a dragon. Heracles asked Atlas where to find the golden apples. He offered to support the world, which Atlas always supported, while Atlas retrieved it for him. Atlas, who saw a chance to relieve the heavy burden of carrying the world, gladly agreed to the offer. When Atlas came back with the golden apples, he did not give it to Heracles but Heracles was to  continue carrying the world while Atlas would be the one to bring them back to Eurystheus. But Heracles tricked Atlas, Heracles said to Atlas that he will give all his strength and power for carrying the world if Atlas would carry it for a moment so that he could put a pad on his shoulder to ease the burden of the pressure from the weight of the world. Because of Atlas' stupidity, he agreed and Heracles picked up the apples and went off to Mycenae.

==The Twelfth Labour==
'''Bring Cerberus Up From the Underworld''' of course

:This is the most difficult task of all. Heracles went off to the underworld to take the three-headed dog, the Cerberus, up from the underworld. Hades gave him permission if Heracles would not use any weapons. Heracles managed it and captured Cerberus, went to Mycenae, and later brought Cerberus back to the underworld.


After finishing the twelve labours Heracles felt peace and tranquility with his life because he had repented from killing his wife and children. But Heracles never was peaceful after the labours.

remember one thing becoming another... --&gt;

==Peg lists==
google &quot;Mega memory&quot;

Peg lists are good for anything in a sequence (e.g. for lyrics, lines in a play, each peg can remind you of a key idea) or 
* any list of things (shopping list)
* anything to do with numbers (e.g. learning to count in another language... though you wouldn't develop a peg list just for this) 
* remembering the key points of a book, article or lecture, without taking notes. (You can then more easily recall and digest the information... but it's wise to write down anything you need to soon after the lecture.)
* remembering questions you plan to ask (or look up) at the end of a lecture. (You may want a second peg list for this, if you're already using one for remembering the lecture.)

===Shape list===
This doesn't use rhyming, so the one system works regardless of language - useful if teaching non-English speakers.

===Loci (house list)===
The common method is to memorise a few items (say 4) in each room, for several rooms. Use a house or building you know very well. I used to live in a 5 bedroom house, so I'm using that. 

I'm confident in my memory, and I like to push myself, so I'm making it 10 pegs in each room, and using the front of the house, back garden, hallway and the cafe next door to bring it up to 10 rooms, making a 100 peg list. I'm adding things that weren't actually there, as long as they're vivid, distinctive images - and especially if they're associated with the person whose room it was. 

I follow consistent rules, starting at the entrance point and moving clockwise; starting at the front of the house and moving back, then up;starting with the object on the furniture, then the furniture.

Note, this reflects my eccentric mind, and this approach may not suit you. The specifics definitely won't suit you if you did't live in this house.

Nothing special here - I just like remembering things. Having the facts available can make it easier to understand history &amp; stuff.

==Music==
I'd like to learn a guitar one day - to prove that old dogs ''can'' learn new tricks. I did a couple of years of piano as a kid, then one more at 18. Knowing the intervals is useful...

''These are ascending intervals (there's another set of descending ones), for those of us who can recognize them quickly on written music but are still terrible sight-singers. In order, the intervals (the part outside the parentheses above) are:'' Not clear on the meaning of this... check with a musician.

Ones in bold are tunes I recognise:

If you're creating a language then there's a good chance that you'll want to learn to speak it with relative fluency once it's complete. In general, the keys to learning to speak your conlang are the same as when you're trying to learn a natural language. We'll take you through some simple techniques in this section.

== Example sentences ==

A good way to learn any language is to use example sentences that show the grammar you're learning, in addition to a list of words and explanation of the grammar.  You can review these sentences — hopefully a sequence of sentences that gradually increase in complexity and build on one another in the vocabulary used — over and over again until you are reading them directly in the language rather than mentally translating each one as you read it.

So, a good way to learn your conlang is to create such example sentences in your own conlang, and then review them regularly.  This can be quite easy or rather a pain in the glutes, depending on the type of language. If your conlang barely inflects its words, this task will probably be quite straightforward. If your conlang inflects for every minute difference in meaning, especially if your native language does not, this will be a painstaking task, though still useful in the end.

Here we want to give you some tips on how to create the example sentences, and point you to some sources for test sentences to translate which may challenge you and make sure you have covered all the grammatical and semantic bases.

== Interfacing yourself ==
 
Example sentences are a good way to learn a language, but then again, you have to use even more techniques. These techniques include ways that language learners typically use to memorize words and phrases, and match them against the ones in their own language. There are a few ways to do this:

=== Flashcards ===

Probably the best and most effective way to memorize any word or phrase.  For example, if you wanted to learn what the word &quot;dog&quot; meant, and remember what it is, you might link it to a picture, or a key word from your native language.  Another good idea (if your conlang is somewhat regular) would be to include on the flashcard the grammar needed to form that word or phrase.  For example, &quot;the cat jumps over the dog, article + noun + verb (conjugated) + article + noun&quot;.  This is an easy way to do things, because you can include as many facets of grammar as you want, if you happen to have different cases, more complex conjugations, etc.

===Record yourself!===
If you have a sound-recording device, write down a few simple sentences in your conlang and then speak them aloud.  Once they're recorded, you can load these sentences into your mp3 player and have samples of your conlang on the go.

In the beginning, you can offer glosses after each sentence in order to remind yourself of what's being said.  As you progress, however, try to leave these glosses out.

A fun project to try is to write a short story in your conlang.  Stories like {{sec link auto|s|The North Wind and the Sun|The North Wind and the Sun|padlock=no}} and portions of the {{sec link auto|s|Bible (King James)/Genesis|anchor=Chapter 11|Babel Text|padlock=no}} are short enough to be do-able, but long enough and complex enough to be a real challenge.

=== Curriculum ===

If you're going to teach a language to yourself, why not get some others involved too?  It is a lot easier to learn when you are immersed into the language, and if other people speak it too, your language skills will improve.  Also, teaching the language helps internalize it in the teacher, because they have to know the information in order to teach it.  Devise a curriculum guide, verb charts, vocabulary charts, flashcard, worksheets, or anything else that might be required to learn your language in the classroom.  Who knows, somebody might come along one day and decide to learn it for themselves.

It is easier to learn a language with a partner than alone.  To that end some conlangers have formed partnerships to use and learn each other's languages by, e.g., email correspondence.

== Regular use of the language ==

To become fluent in a language you must use it regularly.  Once you have worked out enough of the basic phonology and grammar, it is a good idea to write at least one new sentence in your language every day (more on some days than others, probably), coining some new words as necessary, and also re-read some sentences you've previously written in the language every day.  Once you've familiarized yourself with the basics using example sentences, it is a good idea to start doing some more extensive writing in the language, perhaps not every day, but one or more times per week; for instance, keeping a journal in the language, and sometimes re-reading your old journal entries.  Or you can respond to the various translation challenges that are regularly posted in places like the CONLANG mailing list and the Zompist Bulletin Board.

===Program Flow===

The idea of program flow is simple. However, implementing and using flow techniques effectivly takes practice. MATLAB flow control is almost identical to flow control in C. There is a tremendous amount of text on the subject of flow in C. If you do a little homework in about an hour you can know all you need to from one of numerous C tutorials. To be good at flow control all you have to do is practice. 

Here are a few concepts that you can practice using flow control to implement:
*Calculate compounding interest using a while loop (don't cheat by using the algebraic form).
*Create a moving average filter using a for loop
*Make a counter that keeps track of keystrokes:How many times a typist hits a certain letter.

&lt;big&gt;'''NSCLC Palliation in Advanced Disease'''&lt;/big&gt;
*Median survival 5–7 months; 20% can survive &gt;1 year
 

==RT vs. Supportive Care==
*PMID 4170866 -- &quot;The survival of patients with inoperable lung cancer: a large-scale randomized study of radiation therapy versus placebo.&quot; (Roswit B, Radiology. 1968 Apr;90(4):688-97.)
**Modest prolongation (few weeks) in OS

==RT==
*Lot of randomized trials comparing various doses and fractionations
*RT dose does not appear to impact median survival, but higher dose results in higher 1-year OS
*Good ECOG status: longer schedules (30/10 up to 45/18) for better 1-year OS and longer palliation effects
*Poor ECOG status: shorter schedules (16/2, 20/5) reasonable
*Cochrane review: short schedules (1 or 2 fractions) should be used for most patients

*'''Australia''' 1984-1990 PMID 16432830 -- &quot;Unexpected long-term survival after low-dose palliative radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.&quot; (MacManus MP, Cancer. 2006 Mar 1;106(5):1110-6.)
**Retrospective. 2337 patients, palliative RT to &lt;=36 Gy
**Median survival of cohort 4.6 months; 1.1% survived progression-free &gt;5 years.
**RT dose not a factor. Caution to consider doses to critical structures, since some patients do survive long-term

*'''Holland''' 1999-2002 PMID 15860852 -- &quot;Results of the Dutch National study of the palliative effect of irradiation using two different treatment schemes for non-small-cell lung cancer.&quot; (Kramer GW, J Clin Oncol. 2005 May 1;23(13):2962-70.)
**Multicenter randomized. 297 patients with IIIA/B, ECOG 3-4, substantial weight loss. RT 30/10 or 16/2. Outcome at 39 weeks
**Both arms equally effective over initial 39 weeks
**30/10 schedule more prolonged palliation, with less worsening of symptoms
**1-year OS: 30/10 20% vs. 16/2 11% (SS)
**Conclusion: 30/10 schedule preferred due to longer survival and longer duration of palliation

*'''Poland''' PMID 15770205 -- &quot; prospective, randomised study to compare two palliative radiotherapy schedules for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&quot; (Senkus-Konefka E, Br J Cancer. 2005 Mar 28;92(6):1038-45.)

**Randomized. 421 patients with Stage III/IV, chest symptoms or tumor threatening airway. RT A) 17/2 vs. B) 42/15 vs. C) 50/25
**QOL and symptom relief comparable. Median OS: comparable
**Conclusion: Long course RT no improvement over short-term RT

*'''NCIC CTG SC.15''' (Canada) PMID 12377323 -- &quot;Randomized phase III trial of single versus fractionated thoracic radiation in the palliation of patients with lung cancer (NCIC CTG SC.15).&quot; (Bezjak A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Nov 1;54(3):719-28.)
**Randomized. RT 10/1 vs. 20/5
**No difference in symptom control at 1 month; 20/5 better for overall symptoms, pain, normal activities, and QOL. Comparable toxicity
**Median survival: 2 months longer with 20/5 (SS)
**Conclusion: no difference in palliation, but better QOL and survival with 20/5

'''Review'''
*'''Cochrane, 2006''' PMID 17054152 -- &quot;Palliative radiotherapy regimens for non-small cell lung cancer.&quot; (Lester JF, Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2006 Oct 18;(4):CD002143.)
**14 randomized trials reviewed.
**Results: No strong evidence that any regimen gives greater palliation
**Modest survival benefit (5% at 1 year, 3% at 2 years) with higher dose in patients with better KPS
**Toxicity: Some regimens associated with radiation myelitis
**Conclusion: Majority of patients should be treated with short palliation (1 or 2 fractions)

*'''2004''' PMID 15552805 -- &quot;Palliative percutaneous radiotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer.&quot; (Budach W, Lung Cancer. 2004 Aug;45 Suppl 2:S239-45.)
**Review of 11 randomized trials (10 with survival data).
**Increase in total dose does not substantially prolong median survival, but results in significantly better 1-year survival
**ECOG &gt;=3 do not benefit from higher doses, better ECOG patients do
**Poor ECOG or large distant tumor burden: 17/2 or 20/4 are appropriate
**Good performance status: total dose 30-45 Gy in 2.5-3.0 Gy/fx

*'''2003''' PMID 12714878 -- &quot;Palliative thoracic radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer: a systematic review.&quot; (Toy E, Am J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr;26(2):112-20.)
**Review of 12 randomized trials. RT used with palliative intent in ~25% of patients
**RT effective in controlling symptoms
**No strong evidence about doses, but higher doses lead to greater toxicity. Modest survival benefit with higher doses with good performance
**Recommend short course (1-2 fxs) unless good performance

==Timing of RT==
*For patients with minimal thoracic symptoms initially, can delay treatment until symptoms develop
*In one study, only 42% of delayed RT actually required RT prior to death

*'''Norway''' PMID 16094739 -- &quot;Immediate or delayed radiotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)? Data from a prospective randomised study.&quot; (Sundstrom S, Radiother Oncol. 2005 May;75(2):141-8.)
**Data from randomised fractionation trial. 407 patients. Symptomatic (S) and non-symptomatic patients retrospectively compared
**Non-symptomatic: better baseline characteristics, better survival (11.8 months vs. 6 months)
**Timing: baseline NS better, up to week 14 NS developed symptoms while S had symptom relief, after week 14 no difference
**Conclusion: immediate RT in patients with no symptoms does not prevent development of symptoms. Wait-and-see policy acceptable

*'''MRC''' (UK) 1992-1999 PMID 12202326 -- &quot;Immediate versus delayed palliative thoracic radiotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer and minimal thoracic symptoms: randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Falk SJ, BMJ. 2002 Aug 31;325(7362):465.)
**Randomized, multicenter. 230 patient with untreated NSCLC, minimal thoracic symptoms.
**RT immediately vs. when symptomatic. 17/2 or 10/1. In delayed group, 42% received RT prior to death. Median time to start 15 days vs. 125 days
**Primary outcome (alive, without symptoms at 6 months after randomization): 28% vs. 26% (NS). No difference in survival, activity, anxiety, depression. Adverse events more common in immediate group
**Conclusion: If minimally symptomatic, can delay until symptoms require treatment

Epub 2008 Aug 4.)
**Data from 2714 patients from 16 RCTs.
**Outcome: 1-year OS chemotherapy 29% vs. supportive care 20% (HR 0.77, SS). No clear effect on drugs used, or whether single or combination. No clear difference in benefit across subgroups
**Conclusion: Chemotherapy improves OS in all patients with advanced NSCLC

'''Paclitaxel'''

*'''National University Hospital, Singapore; 2008''' PMID 19032397 -- &quot;Patients' preference for radiotherapy fractionation schedule in the palliation of symptomatic unresectable lung cancer.&quot; (Tang JI, J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol. 2008 Oct;52(5):497-502.)
**Prospective. 92 patients. Choice of palliative treatment schedule 17/2 vs 39/13. Radiation oncologist made final decision
**Outcome: Short schedule chosen by 45% vs long schedule 55%. Longer schedule chosen for longer survival (90%) and better tumor control (12%). Shorter schedule chosen for shorter duration (80%), cost (61%), and better symptom control (20%). Change of schedule, 56% of short course and 4% of long course had their treatment altered by the radiation oncologist. Nevertheless, 100% patients satisfied with their involvement
**Conclusion: Both schedules useful, nearly half patients felt longer survival not as important as shorter duration and lower cost</text>

== Example: Number of Parameters == 
{{TextBox|1=
{{x86 Disassembly/Syntax|MASM}}
Given the following disassembled function (in MASM syntax), how many 4-byte parameters does this function receive? How many variables are created on the stack? What does this function do?
{{-}}
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
_Question1:
  push ebp
  mov ebp, esp
  sub esp, 4
  mov eax, [ebp + 8]
  mul 2
  mov [esp + 0], eax
  mov eax, [ebp + 12]
  mov edx, [esp + 0]
  add eax, edx
  mov esp, ebp
  pop ebp
  ret
&lt;/source&gt;

The function above takes 2 4-byte parameters, accessed by offsets +8 and +12 from ebp. The function also has 1 variable created on the stack, accessed by offset +0 from esp. The function is nearly identical to this C code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int Question1(int x, int y)
 {
    int z;
    z = x * 2;
    return y + z;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

== Example: Standard Entry Sequences == 

{{TextBox|1=
{{x86 Disassembly/Syntax|MASM}}
Does the following function follow the Standard Entry and Exit Sequences? if not, where does it differ?
{{-}}
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
_Question2:
  call _SubQuestion2
  mul 2
  ret
&lt;/source&gt;

The function does not follow the standard entry sequence, because it doesn't set up a proper stack frame with ebp and esp. The function basically performs the following C instructions:
  
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int Question2()
 {
    return SubQuestion2() * 2;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Although an optimizing compiler has chosen to take a few shortcuts.

{{details|Number Theory}}

[[w:en:Real number|Real numbers]] come in several varieties and forms;

* [[w:en:Integer|Integers]] are whole numbers used for counting indivisible objects, together with negative equivalents and zero, ''e.g.'' 42, -7, 0
* [[w:en:Rational_number|Rational numbers]] can always be expressed as fractions, ''e.g.'' 4.673 = 4673/1000.
* [[w:en:Irrational_number|Irrational numbers]], unlike rational numbers, cannot be expressed as a fraction or as a definite decimal, ''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;
* [[w:en:Natural_number|Natural numbers]] are integers that are greater than or equal to zero.

It is also worth noting that the [[w:en:Imaginary_unit|imaginary unit]] and therefore [[w:en:Complex number|complex numbers]] are used in chemistry, especially when dealing with equations concerning waves.

===Surds===

The origin of [[w:en:Nth_root#Working_with_surds|surds]] goes back to the Greek philosophers. It is relatively simple to prove that the square root of 2 cannot be a ratio of two integers, no matter how large the integers may become. In a rather [[w:en:Monty_Python|Pythonesque]] incident the inventor of this proof was put to death for heresy by the other philosophers because they could not believe such a pure number as the root of 2 could have this ''impure'' property.

(The original use of quadratic equations is very old, Babylon many centuries BC.) This was to allocate land to farmers in the same quantity as traditionally held after the great floods on the Tigris and Euphrates  had reshaped the fields. The mathematical technology became used for the  same purpose in the Nile delta.

When you do trigonometry later you will see that surds are in the trigonometric functions of the important symmetrical angles, ''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt; \sin 60 = \frac {\sqrt{3} } {2} &lt;/math&gt; and so they appear frequently in mathematical expressions regarding 3 dimensional space.

===Notation===

The notation used for recording numbers in chemistry is the same as for other scientific disciplines, and appropriately called [[w:en:Scientific_notation|scientific notation]], or ''standard form''. It is a way of writing both very large and very small numbers in a shortened form compared to [[w:en:Decimal#Decimal_notation|decimal notation]]. An example of a number written in scientific notation is

&lt;math&gt;4.65 \times 10^6&lt;/math&gt;

with 4.65 being a coefficient termed the [[w:en:Significand|significand]] or the ''mantissa'', and 6 being an integer [[w:en:Exponentiation|exponent]]. When written in decimal notation, the number becomes

&lt;math&gt;4650000&lt;/math&gt;.

Numbers written in scientific notation are usually normalised, such that only one digit precedes the decimal point. This is to make [[w:en:Order_of_magnitude|order of magnitude]] comparisons easier, by simply comparing the exponents of two numbers written in scientific notation, but also to minimise transcription errors, as the decimal point has an assumed position after the first digit. In computing and on calculators, it is common for the &lt;math&gt;\times 10&lt;/math&gt; (&quot;times ten to the power of&quot;) to be replaced with &quot;E&quot; (capital e). It is important not to confuse this &quot;E&quot; with the [[w:en:E_(mathematical_constant)|mathematical constant ''e'']].

Engineering notation is a special restriction of scientific notation where the exponent must be divisible by three. Therefore, engineering notation is not normalised, but can easily use [[w:en:SI_prefix|SI prefixes]] for magnitude.

Remember that in [[w:en:International_System_of_Units|SI]], numbers do not have commas between the thousands, instead there are spaces, ''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;18~617~132&lt;/math&gt;, (an integer) or &lt;math&gt;1.861~713~2 {\rm x}  10^{7}&lt;/math&gt;. Commas are used as decimal points in many countries.

===Exponents===

{{sectstub}}

{{wikipedia|Exponentiation}}

Consider a number &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:en:Base_(mathematics)|base]] and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:en:Exponentiation|exponent]]. This is generally read as “&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;” or “&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the power of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;”. If &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; then it is common to say “&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; squared”, and if &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt; then “&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; cubed”. Comparing powers (exponentiation) to multiplication for positive integer values of n &lt;math&gt;(n = 1, 2, 3\dots)&lt;/math&gt;, it can be demonstrated that

&lt;math&gt;4x = x+x+x+x&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'' four lots of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; added together

&lt;math&gt;x^4 = x \times x \times x \times x&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by itself four times.

For &lt;math&gt;x^1&lt;/math&gt;, the result is simply &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt; the result is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Order of operations===

When an expression contains different operations, they must be evaluated in a certain order.  Exponents are evaluated first.  Then, multiplication and division are evaluated from left to right.  Last, addition and subtraction are evaluated left to right.  Parentheses or brackets take precedence over all operations.  Anything within parentheses must be calculated first.  A common acronym used to remember the order of operations is '''PEMDAS''', for &quot;Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction&quot;. Another way to remember this acronym is &quot;Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally&quot;.

Keep in mind that negation is usually considered multiplication.  So in the case of &lt;math&gt;-x^2&lt;/math&gt;, the exponent would be evaluated first, then negated, resulting in a negative number.

Take note of this example:

&lt;math&gt;3 + x \times 2&lt;/math&gt;, let x=5.

If evaluated incorrectly (left-to-right, with no order of operations), the result would be 16.  Three plus five gives eight, times two is 16.  The correct answer should be 13.  Five times two gives ten, plus three gives 13.  This is because multiplication is solved before addition.

{{wikipedia|Order of operations}}

==Partial fractions==

{{wikipedia|Partial fractions}}

Partial fractions are used in a few derivations in thermodynamics and they are good for practicing algebra and factorisation.
 
It is possible to express quotients in more than one way. Of practical use is that they can be collected into one term or generated as several terms by the method of partial fractions. Integration of a complex single term quotient is often difficult, whereas by splitting it up into a sum, a sum of standard integrals is obtained. This is the principal chemical application of partial fractions.

An example is

&lt;math&gt; \frac {x-2} {(x+1) (x-1) } = \frac { A (x-1) + B (x+1) } {(x+1) (x-1) } = \frac {A} {(x+1) } + \frac {B} {(x-1) } &lt;/math&gt;

In the above &lt;math&gt; x-2 &lt;/math&gt; must equal &lt;math&gt; A (x-1) + B (x+1) &lt;/math&gt; since the denominators are equal. So we set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; first to +1 giving &lt;math&gt; -1 = 2B&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore B = -1/2. If we set &lt;math&gt;x = -1&lt;/math&gt; instead &lt;math&gt;-3 = -2A&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;A = 3/2&lt;/math&gt;. So

&lt;math&gt; \frac {x-2} {(x+1) (x-1) }  =  \frac {3} {2(x+1) } - \frac {1} {2(x-1) } &lt;/math&gt;

We can reverse this process by use of a ''common denominator''.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {3} {2(x+1) } - \frac {1} {2(x-1) } = \frac {3 (x-1) - (x+1)} {2(x+1)(x-1) } &lt;/math&gt;

The numerator is &lt;math&gt;2x -4&lt;/math&gt;, so it becomes

&lt;math&gt; \frac {(x-2) } {(x+1)(x-1) } &lt;/math&gt;

which  is what we started from.

So we can generate a single term by multiplying by the denominators to create a common denominator and then add up the numerator to simplify. A typical application might be to convert a term to partial fractions, do some calculus on the terms, and then regather into one quotient for display purposes. In a factorised single quotient it will be easier to see where numerators go to zero, giving solutions to &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and where denominators go to zero giving infinities.

A typical example of a meaningful infinity in chemistry might be an expression such as

&lt;math&gt; \frac A {{(E-E_a)}^2} &lt;/math&gt;

The variable is the energy E, so this function is small everywhere, except near &lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt;. Near &lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt; a ''resonance '' occurs and the expression becomes infinite when the two energies are precisely the same. A molecule which can be electronically excited by light has several of these resonances.

Here is another example. If we had to integrate the following expression we would first convert to partial fractions:

&lt;math&gt; \frac {3x} {2x^2 - 2x -4} = \frac {3x} {2 (x+1) (x-2)} = \frac A {x+1} + \frac B {x-2} &lt;/math&gt;

so

&lt;math&gt; \frac 3 2 x = A (x-2) + B (x-1) &lt;/math&gt;

let &lt;math&gt;x = 2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;3 = B&lt;/math&gt;

let &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2} = -A&lt;/math&gt;

therefore the expression becomes

&lt;math&gt; \frac 3 {x-2} - \frac 3 {2(x+1)} &lt;/math&gt;

Later you will learn that these expressions integrate to give simple &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; expressions.

This is related to partial fractions in that its principal use is to facilitate integration.

Divide out

&lt;math&gt;\frac { 3x^2 -4 x -6} { 1 + x}&lt;/math&gt;

like this


                3x  - 7
              -----------------
       x + 1  ) 3x2  -4x   -6
                3x2  +3x
                ---------
                 0   -7x   -6
                     -7x   -7
                     --------
                            1

So our equation becomes
&lt;math&gt;3 x - 7 + \frac {1}{1+x}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be easily differentiated, and integrated. If this is differentiated with the quotient formula it is considerably harder to reduce to the the same form. The same procedure can be applied to partial fractions.

==Substitutions and expansions==

You can see the value of changing the variable by simplifying

&lt;math&gt;\frac {{\left(\frac { J (J+1)} {\epsilon} \right) }^3 + 2 {\left(\frac { J (J+1)} {\epsilon} \right) } +1 } {{\left(\frac { J (J+1)} {\epsilon} \right) }^2 -9} - \frac {{\left(\frac { J (J+1)} {\epsilon} \right) }^2 - 2 {\left(\frac { J (J+1)} {\epsilon} \right) } +1 } {{\left(\frac { J (J+1)} {\epsilon} \right) }^2 + 9}&lt;/math&gt;

to

&lt;math&gt;\frac {x^3 + 2x + 1 } {x^2 - 9} - \frac {x^2 - 2x + 1 } {x^2 + 9}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac { J (J+1)} {\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

This is an example of simplification. It would actually be possible to differentiate this with respect to either &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; using only the techniques you have been shown. The algebraic manipulation involves ''differentiation of a quotient'' and the ''chain rule''.

Evaluating &lt;math&gt;\frac { {\rm d} y} { {\rm d} x}&lt;/math&gt; gives

&lt;math&gt; \frac{3x^2 + 2}{x^2 - 9} -2 \frac{(x^3 + 2x + 1)x}{(x^2 - 9)^2} - \frac{2x - 2}{x^2 + 9} +2 \frac{(x^2 - 2x + 1)x}{(x^2 + 9)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Expanding this out to the &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;s  and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;s would look ridiculous.

Substitutions like this are continually made for the purpose of having new, simpler expressions, to which the rules of calculus or identities are applied.

==''Venturo'' or ''veturo''?==
It says here: &lt;br&gt;
ŝip- (ship) + ventur (travel) = ŝip(o)veturo (a journey by ship) &lt;br&gt;
This doesn't look correct. What is there correct translation of 'a journey' in Esperanto?&lt;br&gt;
--[[User:JorisvS|JorisvS]] 15:05, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

The noun form of &quot;journey&quot; is actually ''voyaĝo''; &quot;journey by ship&quot; should be ''ŝipovoyaĝo''. But I'm still an early Esperantist, so my opinion is worth mud. --[[Special:Contributions/74.130.244.188|74.130.244.188]] ([[User talk:74.130.244.188|talk]]) 02:16, 28 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Example: Floating Point Arithmetic == 

{{TextBox|1=
Here is the C source code, and the GCC assembly listing of a simple C language function that performs simple floating-point arithmetic. Can you determine what the numerical values of LC5 and LC6 are?

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 __fastcall double MyFunction2(double x, double y, float z)
 {
 	return (x + 1.0) * (y + 2.0) * (z + 3.0);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 	.align 8
 LC5:
 	.long	0
 	.long	1073741824
 	.align 8
 LC6:
 	.long	0
 	.long	1074266112
 .globl @MyFunction2@20
 	.def	@MyFunction2@20;	.scl	2;	.type	32;	.endef
 @MyFunction2@20:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	subl	$16, %esp
 	fldl	8(%ebp)
 	fstpl	-8(%ebp)
 	fldl	16(%ebp)
 	fstpl	-16(%ebp)
 	fldl	-8(%ebp)
 	fld1
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fldl	-16(%ebp)
 	fldl	LC5
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fmulp	%st, %st(1)
 	flds	24(%ebp)
 	fldl	LC6
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fmulp	%st, %st(1)
 	leave
 	ret	$20
&lt;/source&gt;

For this, we don't even need a floating-point number calculator, although you are free to use one if you wish (and if you can find a good one). LC5 is added to [ebp - 16], which we know to be y, and LC6 is added to [ebp - 24], which we know to be z. Therefore, LC5 is the number &quot;2.0&quot;, and LC6 is the number &quot;3.0&quot;. Notice that the '''fld1''' instruction automatically loads the top of the floating-point stack with the constant value &quot;1.0&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Units, multipliers and prefixes==
It is usually necessary in chemistry to be familiar with at least three systems of units, [[w:en:International_System_of_Units|Le Système International d'Unités (SI)]], [[w:en:Atomic_units|atomic units]] as used in theoretical calculations and the unit system used by the experimentalists. Thus if we are dealing with the ionization energy, the units involved will be the [[w:en:Joule|Joule]] (J), the [[w:en:Hartree|Hartree]] (E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, the atomic unit of energy), and the [[w:en:Electron_volt|electron volt]] (eV).

These units all have their own advantages;

* The SI unit should be understood by all scientists regardless of their field.
* The atomic unit system is the natural unit for theory as most of the fundamental constants are unity and equations can be cast in dimensionless forms.
* The electron volt comes from the operation of the ionization apparatus where individual electrons are accelerated between plates which have a potential difference in Volts.

An advantage of the SI system is that the dimensionality of each term is made clear as the fundamental constants have structure. This is a complicated way of saying that if you know the dimensionality of all the things you are working with you know an awful lot about the mathematics and properties such as scaling with size of your system. Also, the same system of units can describe both the output of a large power station (gigaJoules), or the interaction of two inert gas atoms, (a few kJ per mole or a very small number of Joules per molecule when it has been divided by Avogadro's number).

In SI the symbols for units are lower case unless derived from a person's name, ''e.g.'' ampere is A and kelvin is K.

Note the use of capitals and lower case and the increment on the exponent being factors of 3. Notice also centi and deci are supposed to disappear with time leaving only the powers of 1000.

==Conversion factors==

The &lt;math&gt;\hat { } &lt;/math&gt;, (sometimes call caret or hat), sign is  another notation for ''to the power of''. E means ''times 10 to the power of'', and is used a great deal in computer program output.

===Energy===

An approximation of how much of a chemical bond each energy corresponds to is placed next to each one. This indicates that light of energy 4 eV can break chemical bonds and possibly be dangerous to life, whereas infrared radiation of a few cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is harmless.

* 1 eV = 96.48530891 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (Near infrared), approximately 0.26 chemical bonds
* 1 kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.184000000 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (Near infrared), approximately 0.01 chemical bonds
* 1 MHz = 0.399031E-06 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (Radio waves), approximately 0.00 chemical bonds
* 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.01196265819 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (Far infrared), approximately 0.00 chemical bonds

Wavelength, generally measure in nanometres and used in UV spectroscopy is defined as an inverse and so has a reciprocal relationship.

===Length===
There is the metre, the Angstrom (10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; m), the micron (10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; m), the astronomical unit (AU)and many old units such as feet, inches and light years.

===Angles===
The radian to degree conversion is 57.2957795130824, (i.e. a little bit less than 60, remember your equilateral triangle and radian sector).

===Dipole moment===
1 Debye = 3.335640035 Cm x 10&lt;sup&gt;-30&lt;/sup&gt;      (coulomb metre)

===Magnetic Susceptibility===
1 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 16.60540984 JT&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; x 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;    (joule tesla&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

===Old units===

Occasionally, knowledge of older units may be required. Imperial units, or convert energies from BTUs  in a thermodynamics project, etc.

In university laboratory classes you would  probably be given material on the ''Quantity Calculus''
notation and methodology which is to be highly recommended for scientific work.

A good reference for units, quantity calculus and SI is: I. Mills, T. Cuitas, K. Homann, N. Kallay, K. Kuchitsu, ''Quantities, units and symbols in physical chemistry, 2nd edition'', (Oxford:Blackwell Scientific Publications,1993).

==Greek alphabet==

{{sectstub}}

==Unit labels==

The labelling of tables and axes of graphs  should be done so that the numbers are dimensionless, ''e.g. '' temperature is &lt;math&gt;T / K&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\ln (k/k_0)&lt;/math&gt; and energy mol / kJ ''etc''.

This can look a little strange at first. Examine good text books like Atkins Physical Chemistry which follow SI carefully to see this in action.

The hardest thing with conversion factors is to get them the right way round. A common error is to divide when you should be multiplying, also another common error is to fail to raise a conversion factor to a power.

&lt;math&gt; \text{Conversion factor} = \frac {\text{Units required}} {\text{Units given}}&lt;/math&gt;

1 eV = 96.48530891 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

1 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.01196265819 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

To convert eV to cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, first convert to kJ per mole by multiplying by  96.48530891 / 1. Then convert to cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; by multiplying by 1 / 0.01196265819 giving 8065.540901. If we tried to go directly to the conversion factor in 1 step it is easy to get it upside down. However, common sense tell us that there are a lot of cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s in an eV so it should be obviously wrong.

1 inch = 2.54 centimetres. If there is a surface of nickel electrode of 2 * 1.5 square inches it must be 2 * 1.5 * 2.54&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; square centimetres.

To convert to square metres, the SI unit we must divide this by 100 * 100 not just 100.

===Dimensional analysis===

{{sectstub}}

The technique of adding unit labels to numbers is especially useful, in that analysis of the units in an equation can be used to double-check the answer.

==An aside on scaling==
One of the reasons powers of variables are so important is because they relate to the way quantities scale. Physicists in particular are interested in the way variables scale in the limit of very large values. Take cooking the turkey for Christmas dinner. The amount of turkey you can afford is linear, (power 1), in your income. The size of an individual serving is quadratic, (power 2), in the radius of the plates
being used. The cooking time will be something like cubic in the diameter of the turkey as it can be presumed to be linear in the mass.

(In the limit of a very large turkey, say one the diameter of the earth being heated up by a nearby star, the internal conductivity of the turkey would limit the cooking time and the time taken would be exponential. No power can go faster / steeper than exponential in the limit. The series expansion of &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; goes on forever even though &lt;math&gt;1 / n!&lt;/math&gt; gets very small.)

Another example of this is why dinosaurs had fatter legs than modern lizards. If dinosaurs had legs in proportion to small lizards the mass to be supported rises as length to the power 3 but the strength of the legs only rises as the area of the cross section, power 2. Therefore the bigger the animal the more enormous the legs must become, which is why a rhino is a very chunky looking version of a pig.

There is a very good article on this in Cooper, Necia Grant; West, Geoffrey B., ''Particle Physics: A Los Alamos Primer'', ISBN 0521347807

Well, actually, not all molecules are resonating, just the ones of water. Otherwise you could not really cook with the thing; it would blow all food apart.

== Heating Food ==

Microwaves DO NOT cook food from the inside out.  Microwaves absorb (and thus heat) from the outside in.  Microwaves are generated by the magnetron, so they initially exist outside of the food.  The microwaves are absorbed by the food, and the deeper (thicker) the food is, the less the microwaves penetrate to the inside.  The absorption decays exponentially, thus they initially are absorbed most on the outside.  But the microwaves may not be totally absorbed by the outer layers, so may penetrate all the way to the center of the food, thus the food is completely heated.  The &quot;heated from the inside&quot; is a complete myth, and upon even the most rudimentary questioning fails the common sense test.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Free web-based material from HEFCE==

There is a DVD on differentiation at [http://www.mathtutor.ac.uk/viewdisksinfo.php?disk=6 Math Tutor].

==The basic polynomial==

The most basic kind of differentiation is:

&lt;math&gt;f (x) = x^n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^{'} (x) = n x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

There are two simple rules:

# The derivative of a function times a constant is just the same constant times the derivative.
# The derivative of a sum of functions is just the sum of the two derivatives.

To get higher derivatives such as the ''second derivative'' keep applying the same rules.

One of the big uses of differentiation is to find the stationary points of functions, the maxima and minima. If the function is smooth, (unlike a saw-tooth), these are easily located by solving equations where the first derivative is zero.

==The chain rule==

&lt;math&gt;\frac {dy} {dx}  = \frac {dy} {dw} . \frac {dw} {dx}&lt;/math&gt;

This is best illustrated by example: find &lt;math&gt;\frac {dy} {dx}&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;y = { (x^4 + 1)}^9&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;y = u^9&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u = x^4 + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Now &lt;math&gt;\frac {dy} {du} = 9 u^8&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac {du} {dx} = 4 x^3&lt;/math&gt;

So using the chain rule we have &lt;math&gt;9 { (x^4 + 1)}^8 .4 x^3 = 36 x^3 { (x^4 + 1)}^8&lt;/math&gt;


==Differentiating a product==

&lt;math&gt;\frac {d(u.v)} {dx}  = v \frac {du} {dx} + u \frac {dv} {dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice when differentiating a product one generates two ''terms''. (Terms are mathematical expression connected by a plus or minus.) An important point is that terms which represent physical quantities must have the same units and dimensions or must be pure dimensionless numbers. You cannot add 3 oranges to 2 pears to get 5 orangopears. Integration by parts also generates an extra term each time it is applied.

==Differentiating a quotient==

You use this to differentiate &lt;math&gt;\tan&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {d} {dx}  \left( \frac {u} {v}  \right) = \frac {  v \frac {du} {dx}  - u \frac {dv} {dx} } {v^2} &lt;/math&gt;

===Problems===

Differentiate with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 3 x^2 - x ( 1 + x) (1-x) &lt;/math&gt;

Notice we have &lt;math&gt;(a^2-b^2)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt; 4 x^7 -3 x^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; {( 3 x + 2 )}2 + e^x &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 8 x^6 - 12 {\sqrt x} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x {( x + 3)}2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x^2 ( 3 x - ( 2 + x ) (2 - x) ) &lt;/math&gt;

Evaluate the inner brackets first.

Evaluate

&lt;math&gt;\frac {\rm d} { {\rm d} z} \left( e^{z} - \frac {z^9} {18} - \frac 3 {z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\rm d} { {\rm d} c} \left(  \sqrt { c^5} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\rm d} { {\rm d} \omega} \left( \frac 1 {\omega } - \frac 1 {\omega ^2} - \frac 1 {\omega ^3} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\rm d} { {\rm d} \phi} \left( e^\phi - \left(  \frac 1 {\phi^2} + \frac 3 2  \phi ^ 2 \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\rm d} { {\rm d} r} \left( e^{5 r} - \left( \frac a {r^3} + \frac b {r^6} + \frac c {r^9} \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

a, b and c are constants.
Differentiate with respect to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; 3 r e^{-3r} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\rm d} { {\rm d} x} \left(  x ^6 e^{x} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

===Answers===

&lt;math&gt; 3x^2 + 6x -1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 28x^6 -6x &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; e^x + 18x + 12 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 48x^5 - \frac 6 {\sqrt x} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 3x^2 + 12x + 9 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 4x^3 + 9x^2 - 8x &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; e^z + \frac{z^8}{2} + \frac{6}{z^3} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac 5 2 c ^{3/2} {\rm or} \frac 5 2 {\sqrt {c^3}} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; - \frac{1}{\omega ^2} + \frac 2 {\omega ^3} + \frac 3 {\omega ^4}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^\phi + \frac 2 {\phi^3} - 3 \phi&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;5 e^{5 r} + \frac {3 a} {r^4} + \frac {6 b} {r^7} + \frac {9 c} {r^{10}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{-3r} ( 3 - 9 r)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^5 e^x (x+6)&lt;/math&gt;

===Harder differentiation problems===

Differentiate with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;x^4 {( x+9)}^5&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;5 x^2 {( x^2 -7x +9)}^5&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiate with respect to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{( r^2 + 3r -1)}^3 e^{-4r}&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiate with respect to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} { {\omega}^4} \left( { {\omega}^2 -3 \omega -19} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {e^{\omega}} { {\omega}^4}&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluate

&lt;math&gt;\frac { {\rm d} } { {\rm d} z} \left( e^{-4z} \left( {z-1}^2 \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac { {\rm d} } { {\rm d} \phi} \left( \phi ^2 e^{-2\phi} \left( 1 - \frac 1 {{\phi}^2}  \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Using differentiation to check turning points==

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is the tangent or gradient. At a minimum &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is zero. This is also true at a maximum or an [[w:en:Inflection_point|inflection point]]. The ''second gradient'' gives us the nature of the point. If &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt; is positive the turning point is a minimum and if it is negative a maximum. Most of the time we are interested in minima except in ''transition state theory''.

If the equation of &lt;math&gt; y = x^3&lt;/math&gt; is plotted, is is possible to see that at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; there is a third kind of point, an inflection point, where both &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2y} {dx^2}&lt;/math&gt; are zero.

&lt;math&gt; y = f(x) \frac{dy}{dx} = f^{'}(x) \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = f^{''}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Plot &lt;math&gt;x^3+x^2-6x&lt;/math&gt; between -4 and +3, in units of 1. (It will speed things up if you factorise it first. Then you will see there are 3 places where &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; so you only need calculate 5 points.) By factorising you can see that this equation has 3 roots. Find the 2 turning points. (Differentiate once and find the roots of the quadratic equation using &lt;math&gt;x=-b\dots&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the position of the 2 turning points either side of zero. As the equation is only in &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; it has 3 roots and 2 maxima / minima at the most therefore we have solved everything. Differentiate your quadratic again to get &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the turning point to the left of zero is a maximum ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -ve&lt;/math&gt; and the other is a minimum ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = +ve&lt;/math&gt;.

What is the solution and the turning point of &lt;math&gt;y=x^3&lt;/math&gt;.

Solve &lt;math&gt;x^3-x =  0&lt;/math&gt;, by factorisation.

(The 3 roots are -3,0 and +2. &lt;math&gt;\frac {{\rm d}y} { {\rm d} x} = f^{'}(x) = 3x^2 + 2x-6&lt;/math&gt;

Solutions are &lt;math&gt;1/3(\sqrt {19} -1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1/3(\sqrt {19} +1)&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'' -1.7863 and 1.1196.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = f^{''}(x)= 6x+2&lt;/math&gt;

There are 3 coincident solutions at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, at 0 so this is an ''inflection point''.

The roots are 0, 1  and -1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
This Appendix contains the top 30 mistakes people ask when using Mac hardware and software. It's a good idea to read through this section before you use your Mac, as it will clarify some of the things you are likely to run into at first.

=The Mistakes=

==Windows switcher mistakes==

* Closing the Red Dot on the top left and thinking the program has quit like it might have in ''Windows''.

* People using the ''control'' button on the keyboard like they would on a ''Windows'' operating system instead of Apple's alternative control button which is marked by the apple logo and is often referred to as the ''command'' button.

==Hardware Mistakes==

*In Macintosh computers, the &quot;Motherboard&quot; is referred to as the &quot;Logic Board&quot;

==Software Mistakes==

* Running programs directly from disk images without dragging them to the Applications folder. The disk image is just a virtual disk created by the .dmg, the program inside should be copied to your computer so you can eject the disk image and trash the .dmg file.

* The Dock only has links to files (with the exception of Trash), the actual Applications are located in your Applications folder

==Changes from Previous Versions==

*Spotlight isn't just good for finding lost files, it is often a quicker way to open Applications and documents when compared to using Finder to find the item.

==Academic units on Doom and other computer games==

I searched for [http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=doom+%22computer+games%22+course&amp;meta= doom &quot;computer games&quot; course] and found that Doom is implicated in numerous academic courses. There can be no doubt that game guides would be useful subsidiary textbooks for such courses. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:30, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:We have discussed above that a textbook on Doom is within the scope of Wikibooks, but a game guide for Doom is not. No doubt a game guide would be useful if studying Doom academically, in the same way that a copy of a Shakespeare play would be useful (essential) when studying it in English Literature. But just as the Shakespeare play is not a textbook, neither is the game guide. Neither fall, or should fall, within Wikibooks' scope. Shakespeare plays have a home on Wikisource. Game guides on StrategyWiki (and other wikis). Links through to these sites, where relevant, should be included in textbooks, but their content does not belong here, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:48, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

::Please point to the discussion where a consensus on this point has been reached. I cannot find any consensus, indeed opinion seems to be split 50:50. In previous discussions [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] has been adamant that consensus is needed, not a 50:50 split. 

::Shakespeare's plays are not manuals but game guides are indeed manuals and fall right on the boundary of what constitutes a textbook. This really is a simple issue, game guides are usually manuals without a course, they cost little to host, are not outside Wikibooks' charitable status or charter and can be tucked away in the library. The move to ban them is unnecessary. I suggest that with an issue such as this, where there is no down side for hosting, we should just let it ride. Why worry? Leave the game guides in place and any other guide that is awaiting a course. 

::Jguk, are you sure that you are not simply running with a single statement by Mr Wales? He is a member of a board of trustees and can only give guidance. The board would need to pronounce on this issue for it to be irrevocable policy. But it is an issue that only has a down side if we ban game guides. There is no down side in keeping them tucked away in the back of the library. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:33, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

There are possibly even more in the UK:

Notes on gameplay would seem to be as important for game design as annotated notes in english literature for writing skills. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:52, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[m:User:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker|CommonsTicker]]! ==

Hello! I am happy to advertise a new tool created by [[m:User:Duesentrieb]] to aid better integration between the [[Commons:]] and local projects.

At the moment if an image at the Commons is nominated for deletion or even deleted, local projects that might be using the image get no notification. Thus there can be some nasty surprises when a much-loved image is deleted seemingly &quot;without warning&quot;. 

CommonsTicker involves setting up a special page on local projects (that choose to take part) where a bot posts updates about these critical events (image replacement, image nominated for deletion and image deletion), but only for images that your project is currently using. 

You can see it in action here: [[wikt:Wiktionary:CommonsTicker]]

It can also be translated (if you provide a translation): see [[:de:w:Wikipedia:CommonsTicker]] for an example.

To set one up, Duesentrieb just needs a local admin to volunteer to oversee the tool (at least initially, hopefully it will catch on and more people will watch it once implemented) and set up the page. See the headline link for details about how to do that.

So, what does wikibooks think? I am a Commons editor primarily and I think it's a fantastic development. But it's up to the community here.

== Nav Bar ==

Why has the navigation bar changed? The one we had was pretty good, I think. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 22:17, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

==Manuals without courses==

A textbook is defined as a manual for a course of study. It seems that this definition would prevent someone from writing a manual for a new course of study and mounting it at Wikibooks until they have run and advertised the course. It would also prevent old textbooks for now-defunct courses of study from being mounted (ie: super-8 cinematography, Servicing the Triumph Bonneville etc.).

We seem to have a choice of whether to exclude manuals that have no courses (such as some video game guides and cutting edge guides and manuals), to allow them to be shown like any other textbook or to put them in a bookshelf called '''&quot;Manuals without courses of study&quot;'''.  Of the three options exclusion seems the worst. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:53, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:Don't be too quick to declare that certain topics don't have a course that is set up.  And Wikibooks is not just oriented toward college textbooks either.  Can you cite a specific book (on Wikibooks right now) that is not going to be covered?  I see merit in a Wikibook about servicing a Model-T Ford, as it is something that would be both facinating from an historical perspective as well as being something current and up-to-date by noting modern machining methods and parts sources for trying to rebuild or recreate one of these historical automobiles.  Otherwise, Wikibooks is simply too new of a project to have very old content that needs to be archived or depreciated (aka moved to Wikisource or something like that) simply because it has become obsoleted.  Come back in 10 years and that may be a different issue altogether here on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:48, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

I agree with Rob here. A textbook does not need to be related to a particular course of study. It does need to adopt a textbook style (and I deliberately mean ''a'' rather than ''the'' here, as there is a multitude of textbook styles), and it has to have content worthy of study. Our scope is textbooks. (Indeed, Robin, you continue to use ''manuals'' as well, that is wrong. We should not have manuals unless.....they also fit the definition of a textbook.) ''Textbook'' should be given its ordinary English meaning (the one you think it means even though it's not written down in the dictionary and it's difficult to express exactly what it is). It should be given a wide, but not strained meaning. And that does not require the book to be geared up to a course of study, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:15, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

:In which case are we all agreed that video game guides are appropriate for Wikibooks? They are often manuals without courses of study. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:34, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

: The fact of the matter is; Wikibooks right now has not defined Textbooks, yet so many books have been deleted because they are &quot;Not textbooks&quot;. Those books did fit the criteria for [[WB:WIW]]. If you think there is a solid definition to be set here, then I think [[WB:WIW]] should be clarified before any further deletions take place. 

: Second; what the heck is a &quot;textbook style&quot; book? English 3200 consists of '''nothing''' but questions and exersizes. There are no explanations for the answers, no &quot;text&quot; to be read except exersize after exersize. Yet, it is used as a book for some college courses. Is &quot;useable&quot; for a college course good enough to be named a &quot;textbook&quot;? And if not, then why not?

: JGuk, all your responces on [[WB:VFD]] consist of a single line: &quot;Not a textbook&quot;. There is an issue here, and quite a big one too. There is no metric to decide what is and what isn't a textbook. All I have to do is say &quot;Yes, it is a textbook&quot; to any of those [[WB:VFD]] and you can imagine exactly how lively a debate on this will be.

: I can label [[German]] as &quot;not a textbook&quot;, and there is no contradiction to that. In fact, perhaps I should to just show exactly how bad this situation is on Wikibooks, and how freakishly bad the argument of &quot;not a textbook&quot; is. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 16:54, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

I would define a textbook as a '''manual or guide to an existing and recognised body of knowledge'''. It would include high school physics, a guide to the streets of London and motorcycle maintenance manuals. If we adopt this definition we will not be in danger of rejecting obvious textbooks such as &quot;A guide to the mollusca of the New Jersey shore&quot; but we will be in danger of accepting slightly dubious textbooks such as a guides to video games and small villages in Serbia. But disk space is cheap and &quot;Wikibooks is not paper&quot; so does it really matter if we go too wide in our scope? It will certainly matter if we go too narrow and reject important new fields of study or rule out books that would be excellent study companions or resources for courses. 

The definition also includes blue collar books. If I was running a motorcycle garage and someone brought in an old bike I would be over the moon to find a &quot;Maintaining the BSA Bantam&quot; in Wikibooks. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:31, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

== Request for comments about a deletion ==

I'd like to ask for comments about the deletion of [[Transwiki:List of tongue-twisters]]. It was a Wikipedia article which was proposed for moving to Wikibooks, and the result of the debate was Transwiki (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_tongue-twisters]), which happened on 18:52, 29 May 2006 (UTC) ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transwiki]), but [[User:Jguk]] deleted it on the same day (18:29, 29 May 2006, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=500&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=]). I'm afraid it would be unfair to act against community consensus since nobody proposed, supported or agreed on deletion on the discussion page. I asked him for reversion on his user page and I'm currently waiting for his response but in the meantime I'd be happy to hear your comments. This list was a considerable collection made by several people during years, something that is certainly of interest by illustrating the differences of languages in terms of [[:w:phonology|phonology]], [[:w:morphonology|morphonology]] and [[:w:morphophonemic|morphophonemic]], and I really doubt how it could be &quot;not suitable for wikibooks&quot;, as Jguk argued at the deletion. [[User:Adam78|Adam78]] 15:42, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:I have emailed Adam a copy of the deleted text and noted why it is unsuitable for wikibooks and should not have been sent here by wikipedia in the first instance. I am willing to extend this courtesy to others (provided they are not too many), but really an admin on wikipedia should undelete the content from there to allow the page to be transwikied to a suitable location. Unfortunately, this is an example of wikipedians not appreciating that wikibooks' scope is textbooks and not books more generally. 

:This will need to be sorted sometime. I think my Wikibooks mission for July might be to go back to Wikipedia to educate them about us, and encourage some of the WikiProject participants in particular, to come here and write good quality textbooks (particularly some directed at school syllabuses), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:27, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

::I think this should be done sooner than later.  One of the things I did on Wikipedia was fix up the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{movetowikibooks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' template on Wikipedia to explictly note that if the content fails to meet the [[WB:WIW]] criteria for accpetable content, that performing a transwiki to Wikibooks is essentially deleting it from all Wikimedia projects.  I think this message needs to be hammered home more perhaps, and the warning issued formally on the [[w:Wikipedia:Village Pump|Wikipedia Village Pump]].&lt;p&gt;As far as having WikiProjects becoming involved with individual Wikibooks, this is already happening in a number of instances.  The Harry Potter Wikiproject, for example, dealt with the Muggles' Guide quite effectively, and the Astronomy Wikiproject has also added some substance to the [[Astronomy]] Wikibook as well.  This is something that should be happening more, and it would be appreciated if there are some people on Wikipedia who are experts on a topic to come to Wikibooks and help flesh out some of the Wikibooks as well.  I've had some drive-by (minor proofreading and technical review) of the book I've written, [[Serial Programming]], which has several links on Wikipedia as well (most that have been put in by others than myself).  In this case it would be useful for specific Wikiprojects that might be able to help out a particular Wikibook to come in and join with the effort.  A general appeal to Wikipedia WikiProjects, letting them know that Wikibooks is something that can help out with their efforts, is something that might also have some merit as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:41, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

Why so keen to delete? Surely this list can be classified suitably along with similar lists such as reviews of cliches etc and merged into a single book about the peculiarities of English by someone at some time in the future. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:38, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

:I agree. Pages should stay in the transwiki pseudo-namespace until needed by a book. &quot;[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Transwiki%3AGlurch Glurch]&quot;, for example, could have been added to [[Wikijunior Big Book of Fun Science Experiments]]. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 16:53, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

I started my Accounting Interactions fragment specifically *because* it ran opposite to common courses currently running, but yet felt more useful because it was based on working world corporate practices. As one of the most stolid subjects, Accounting shouldn't be close to deletion, but I would be unhappy if my particular volume were marked to delete &quot;because no course&quot; yet runs the subject. Shouldn't we encourage innovative texts, and *then* inspire professors to try the subject? --TaoPhoenix

:This is rather amusing.  Wikiversity is currently in danger of activating with a mandate for &quot;no courses&quot;.  Meanwhile some people are rather insistent that &quot;textbooks&quot; created at Wikiversity must absolutely be transferred to Wikibooks when ready.   So under currently proposed Board mandated/approved policies at the two Wikimedia sites, Wikibooks and Wikiversity, a popular learning trail at the impending Wikiversity could be running a few months or years have the &quot;textbook&quot; transwikied to Wikibooks and then the active studiers at Wikiversity be shocked to find their locally created textbook deleted from Wikibooks because no &quot;course&quot; is using it.   I hope  you guys have been around long enough for Roberth to vouch for your handles or the special committee and/or the Wikimedia Foundation Board is likely to suspect I made this up to back up a point I have been pounding on regarding local autonomy and policy making.  I go now to stash an electronic copy of all pertinent text and provide the link to the powers that be appointed.  Hopefully they will enjoy presenting it too Board Members at an appropriate times. 8) [[user:lazyquasar]]

== Citing Sources ==

Hi, I'm new from Wikipedia - so I'm not sure if you guys work the same way.  I recently added this [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Professor_Vector&amp;curid=55015&amp;diff=476140&amp;oldid=382030 addition] to an article.  Is it appropriate to add a source in Wikibooks like it is in Wikipedia?  Is footnotes appropriate, because I can't really do anything else in an infobox.  Thanks, --[[User:DanielBC|DanielBC]] 04:00, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

== Please remove bookshelf protection ==

This is really not working. Genuine contributors are being forced to work around bookshelf edit protection, which [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2006/March#Semi_Protect_Programming_languages_bookshelf_and_it.27s_template.|was instituted]] due to there being no objections. Several contributors have added books that they started to [[Wikibooks:Requested books]] and others have added &amp;#123;{[[Template:cleanup-link|cleanup-link]]}} to their own books. I'm sure many other users think they either can't create new books or have to go through some requests process (no one reads help pages). I have every bookshelf watched and usually check my watchlist once a day, so I'll be able to revert any requests or vandalism fairly quickly. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 03:21, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

: Any comments? As protection was instituted due to no objections being raised, could it be removed until some discussion occurs on the issue (as I am now objecting to the policy). Protection seems trivial and insignificant, but I believe that the growth of Wikibooks is being stunted severly due to the policy. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:23, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

::As a future Wikiversitium Alumi I favor as many Wikibooks as possible so in my ignorance I think it should be removed as per request until at least two votes can be found for retention. [[user:lazyquasar]

One other idea I would like to throw out is to add preselected red links to books on core, foundational topics to the bookshelves, like I have done on [[Wikibooks:Biology bookshelf]]. Many of the requests on [[Wikibooks:Requested books]] aren't about traditional textbook subjects taught in universities, and I think a greater focus is needed (though other books should also be encouraged). One way this could be done is by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;small&gt; Key uncreated books: [[Book 1]] - [[Book 2]] - [[Book 3]] - etc. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the end of each section instead of lists with comment tags explaining that requests should not be added there. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 03:21, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

:I will weigh in on the issue, for what little my opinion is worth. I do agree with the initial presumption that the bookshelves are especially prone to anonymous users adding in junk. Even if those additions are in good faith, they are contributions that either need to be rolled back (which is hard to justify if the edit was in good faith), or will to sit around as a red link forever. On a broader note, I do assert that high-traffic and &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; pages especially should be blocked from being edited by anonymous users. Pages that are highly visible, such as the policy pages, bookshelves, main pages, etc are as much of an advertisement for us as a community as they are functional navigation pages. Allowing people, even in good faith, to post any garbage they see fit to one of these pages makes the pages look bad, and makes the community look bad by extension. The {{tl|cleanup-link}} was instituted just for this purpose, and anonymous book authors are encouraged to use it when possible. Creating a new book here, as we all have discovered, is a large task, and I have to question whether an anonymous user--who can't even be troubled to register a free username--would have enough dedication and motivation to properly start and nurture a book here. If they don't have long-term intentions to contribute and nurture a book that they are starting, those books are essentially doomed to become eternal stubs, which then becomes a cleanup problem later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:19, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

::Garbage will simply be reverted. If a new user goes to a bookshelf, see the page locked (''even after registering''), and only sees a &quot;suggest book&quot; link, what is he supposed to think? I have seen quality books created by both newly registered and IP users. Wikibooks certainly never would have grown at this rate if protection had been instituted on day one. [[n:|Wikinews]] has a &quot;start a new article&quot; form right on the main page, and while we shouldn't go that far, I do think full protection is not conducive to the growth of Wikibooks and does more harm than good. I think stating in either comment tags or small text that red links and stubs should not be added would discourage most users from posting garbage, which would solve the situations you described. Once Wikibooks has the level of &quot;completeness&quot; in textbook topics that Wikipedia has in encyclopedia articles, I agree that protection should certainly be instituted again. And please correct me if I'm wrong, but the {{tl|cleanup-link}} tag was instituted in order to aid in cleanup. Users will never know about the tag unless they perform general cleanup tasks, which is unlikely for a new user to do. One alternative I would support would be the system I described above, which would &quot;guide&quot; new users into creating books on traditional textbook topics. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 13:39, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[User:Jguk]] administrator abuse. ==

I would appreciate some assistance with a dispute I have having with [[User:Jguk]]. He has begun changing the Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations module from the original BCE/CE notation to his preferred BC/AD notation, and when I changed it back he threatened to, then, blocked me (ip: 65.115.220.89). The BCE/CE notation is more appropriate for textbooks and academic texts, and is preferred when dealing with non-Christian subjects.

:He also tried to hide this message. All in all very disappointing behavior.

::Appaling behavior if this is the whole story... input from admins please! [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 00:20, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:::Actually, it's beyond appalling. I would ask all concerned folks to please look at the history of this page. [[User:Jguk]] is way out of line! [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 00:26, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:To be fair, BC/AD year convention may be more appropriate for textbooks and academic texts, but it adds in an extra dimension of confusion for younger readers. Children, oblivious to the nuances of the politico-religious impetus behind the change, are more commonly exposed to the BC/AD scheme. That said, [[User:Jguk]] may be out of line here (i don't know from the evidence), but entering into an edit war, especially if you are contributing from an anonymous IP account, is highly suspect. The correct response to this situation would be to raise the matter on the appropriate talk page, and attempt to reach community concensus on the matter. I will look over the records and see if the block on IP:65.115.220.89 is appropriate and warranted. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:39, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

::After looking at things more closely, I feel that [[User:Jguk]] acted correctly, although perhaps too quickly. First off, an anonymous user from an open proxy entered into an editwar, without ever once explaining the reasoning for repeatedly changing [[User:Jguk]]'s edits. Also, this IP has been known as a vandal on Wikipedia. Entering into an edit war without explanation, especially from an IP address with a vandalism history, was a bad move on your part, and hence the proxy was blocked. For future reference however, such a case should not be labeled as vandalism so quickly, at least not without some sort of confirmation from a second user. I will start a discussion on the talk page concerning the use of the BC/AD or BCE/CE naming conventions. Community concensus on the matter will determine the way the dates are written in that module, in the future. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:47, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

::I will apologize if I've done something wrong, but I don't believe I have. It does take two to engage in an edit war after all, and if certain standards of behavior are expected from anonymous users, then surely admins should be held to the same standards (or maybe even higher). I hope that you can agree that labeling edits you don't agree with as &quot;vandalism&quot;, and issuing threats are definitely not appropriate behavior. Attempting to hide complaints about your behavior is even worse, as well as using admin tools to win in a dispute. I have been editing here for many months without problems until now, and when I saw that something that I had previously contributed to had been changed for the worse (without explanation), I changed it back. [[User:Jguk]] then proceeded to change it back (without explanation), and then proceeded to threaten me.

:As to BC/AD vs. BCE/CE, I feel that it would be a disservice to children to insist on using archaic terminology, and the are likely to be even more confused when they encounter the appropriate terminology used in other textbooks (as the majority of textbooks and academic papers use BCE/CE).

This is an example of a user who has previously vandalised wikipedia coming over here with a series of open proxies to make disruptive, trolling edits (as easily shown by the complete lack of discussion by the user prior to my blocking, and then using open proxies to post the old wikipedia complaints of &quot;administrator abuse&quot; as soon as the disruptive account is posted. Wikimedia also has a policy of blocking open proxies on sight. Please don't feed the trolls, and please someone block this &quot;Julie&quot;, who is clearly the same person as before. Meanwhile, I will block all the open proxies on the list I posted to WB:VIP (which may have the same effect) [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:Wikibookians may be interested in my response to a query Whiteknight asked me which can be found [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWhiteknight&amp;diff=478531&amp;oldid=471787 here]. Some may be unfamiliar with the concept of open proxies, which this user was using. An open proxy essentially allows someone on the internet to be entirely anonymous, with no easy trace back to themselves. They are also used to circumvent censorship. Although internet users may use open proxies for entirely ''bona fide'' reasons, Wikimedia has found that in practice the overwhelming majority of edits made by users using open proxies are disruptive - being vandalism, trolling or spamming. Accordingly (and see [[m:WM:NOP]]) editors to Wikimedia projects are not allowed to use them.

:Here we had an instance of a user using open proxies in order to try to disrupt wikibooks by introducing an issue that has proven very controversial on wikipedia. Once warned to stop, the user continued, resulting in a ban. That user then, instead of following the instructions on [[MediaWiki:Blockedtext]] which they would have seen, chose to use another open proxy to come straight to the staff lounge complaining of the usual things trolls complain about. I accept that I could have been slower and more definite that this user was up to no good before banning them, and will be slower in the future, but my initial suspicions have certainly been proven correct.

:I would add that none of this has anything whatsoever to do with the underlying content/style issue this user is now mentioning - the blocks are for using open proxies and trolling. (This has nothing to do with vandalism, I only added it to WB:VIP as I was unaware of [[Wikibooks:Problem users]], where this user would more properly belong.) There can, of course, be no problem with ''bona fide'' Wikibookians discussing any content issue they see fit - but that discussion must be between those acting in good faith with the aim of improving Wikibooks, with those who seek only to disrupt excluded, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:13, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

Contrary to what Jguk says this was his first message to me before he decided to block me:

:Please stop coming to Wikijunior, a project that is there for children, and making edits that will only serve to confuse them. There is no need at all, as far as I can see, to swap one very common system of notation for one used only a fraction of the time and which has proven controversial almost everywhere where it has been introduced to the general public. If you do this again, you will be blocked. On the other hand, if you would like to assist in improving the book, bearing in mind its target audience of 8 to 12 year olds, that would be welcome. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:48, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

Notice that there is nothing about proxies, but more along the lines of &quot;agree with me or be blocked&quot;. When I did disagree, he blocked me. I will also note that in each case it was user Jguk who unilaterally changed from the original notation to his preferred format, without discussion or explanation.

As for the proxy, I have to use one to edit from work. I did not know this was against the rules and will stop editing from work from now on.

This Jguk fellow also appears to be banned from en.wikipedia for this same type of behavior and for harassing other editors (particularly Jewish and Muslim ones). Should he be allowed to continue the same type of behavior here? What effect should the ban on en.wikipedia have here, especially when he continues in the same pattern of abuse?

It is most troubling that people of his character are put in positions of authority. He has also, again, threatened to block me for no reason whatsoever.

:First off, we are not wikipedia, and what happens over there has very little bearing on what happens over here. Second, there is a standing policy against the use of open proxies for accessing wikimedia projects: this is a safeguard against spam and vandalism and is a valuable safeguard at that. [[User:Jguk]] has stated his reasons for blocking your proxy very clearly on [[WB:VIP]]. Also, you never disagreed. According to the page history, you didn't engage in any kind of discussion on the topic whatsoever. What [[User:Jguk]] saw was an anonymous user from an open proxy engaging in an edit war without discussion. It is a shame that you no longer want to contribute from work. This problem could have been avoided if you had a valid account, or if you gave us some kind of indication that your intentions were good. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:09, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

== Idea to use Commons pronunciation files to assist language learning ==

Hello,

Mastering pronuncation is obviously one of the vital first steps in learning any language. There are quite a lot of pronunciation files stored at the Commons (for example, over 800 files just for [[commons:Category:German pronunciation|German]]), but I have a bit of a feeling they are not widely utilised here.

I had an idea that we could create a &quot;flash cards&quot; style program/tool for language learners to use, based on picking random files from the corresponding Commons category. (Either that - or the textbook writers here could supply lists for appropriate levels, eg. first level just basic alphabetic sounds, vocab lists for each week.) The program could display the word on the screen and after a short display/hitting a button, play the sound. 

What do you think? The interface could probably be translated pretty easily. Then the same tool could be used by people learning language X no matter what their native language was (assuming someone supplied a translation for the interface). For example, there are over 1000 English files. It just seems like a great potential resource for language learners.

What do you guys think? A useful idea, or not really? If there are some people here who think it might be useful, I'll follow it up and try to find some techy-types who might be able to write such a tool. :)

--[[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 13:16, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

== Does the wiki background image consume server bandwidth? ==

The nice wiki sunflower-resembling background image which is a part of the default 'mono-book' skin is quite a lot larger than what is actually displayed on any wiki page I have seen.

Since probably the wast majority of wikis users use the default skin, and wikis bandwidth seems limited, I wonder how much it would improve the load on the wiki servers if the image was reduced in size and cut to only fill the visible region of the wiki pages. I at least often see that image load somewhat slowly filling about 1/3 of the page height, for then to be covered by the page content and wonder if it could be consuming a major part of the wiki bandwidth. (I've chosen another skin now where this doesnt happen).

(I'm not even sure this is the forum for this question since its more general than wikibooks - but couldnt find a obviously suitable place to put it. [[User:KristianMolhave|KristianMolhave]] 19:56, 5 June 2006 (UTC))

:I think you're referring to the image at http://en.wikibooks.org/skins-1.5/monobook/headbg.jpg, which is a closeup of the binding of a book that's open on a flat surface.  It's 7881 bytes long.  I think there are two reasons it's not a burden on the Wikibooks servers:

:# It's not a very large file.  It probably takes only four or five IP packets to send the file to a user's browser.
:# Every browser caches images, so it is very rarely downloaded more than once every few days or weeks for the typical user. In fact, a user that visits Wikibooks frequently, may never reload the image, since it will always be fresh in his or her cache.

You can type in &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Special:Prefixindex/Booktitle}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, assuming the book complies with the naming convention and is not really, really large.

== Banned WP editor Primetime ==

An editor, called &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Primetime Primetime]&quot; on en.Wikipedia, has been revealed as a serial plagiarizer and liar. He was banned by Jimbo Wales himself and has also been banned from Wiktionary, and perhaps other projects too. His first contribution to Wikipedia was &quot;[[Letter writing]]&quot;, which was eventually transwikied here. After he was banned several admins begain checking his contributions and we found that all substantive contributions were plagiarized. &quot;Letter writing&quot; was copied from World Book Encyclopedia, available online by subscription or free through libraries. I marked it as a copyvio but [[user:Trgj56]] has been reverting it. He is undoubtedly a sock puppet of Primetime. 

Here is a list of his known sock puppets on various projects. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Long_term_abuse/Primetime Wikipedia:Long term abuse/Primetime]. The WP:AN/I page is still here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard#Update] for the moment. And there's some on his user page and plenty on his talk page, for anyone wanting more information.

== We need graphics ==

Wikibooks has three years and we still do not have decent promotional media like web banners and buttons. I am convinced that there are people on Wikibooks who know how to prepare such graphics and I hope we can cope with it. We should make Wikibooks more recognised, start writing about it in the Internet, promote at school or university. Having banners and buttons which users can put on their websites and blogs would be really useful.

It would also be great to have our own &quot;favicon&quot; - a small image displayed on the web browser's list of bookmarks or on tabs in browsers using tabbed browsing. Now we are using Wikipedia icon, but I think we should distinguish ourselves from Wikipedia and prepare our own icon. The problem is that current SVG logo of Wikibooks does not look well when scaled down to 16x16 pixels: [[image:Wikibooks-logo.svg|16px]]. We need to find somebody who will do it better. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:49, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

== Page Move Vandalism ==

There was another wave of Willy-on-wheels style page move vandalism today. This causes me to raise the question, why do we allow all users to move pages? Moving pages, like deletion, is an action that can fundamentally alter the structure of wikibooks. Page move vandalism also, is more difficult to undo then other types of spam or vandalism. Not only do we need to move a page back to it's original location, but we also need to delete the new page, which usually has a very obscene title. I can't think of a possible reason why move operations shouldnt be restricted to sysops, especially in this place where we have plenty of sysops to handle move requests. In a similar manner to the deletion process, regular users could request page moves through use of a {{tl|moveto}} template, or something similar. Because a deletion operation is required to fix page-move vandalism, ordinary users can't even clean it up! they have to request that a sysop clean the vandalism, so a sysop always has to be involved anyway. And i know people are going to say things like &quot;Oh but it isn't a big problem here now&quot; or &quot;but it just doesnt happen enough to warrant a restriction&quot;. What do other people here think? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:48, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
: I think that there should be both time and edit number restriction for new users; they should not be able to move pages immediately after registering. I have heard from people fighting vandalism at English Wikipedia that new users aren't able to make page moves there (as far as I know, an user is considered &quot;new&quot; by the software for some time, I don't know how long it is). I hope we can quickly gain consensus here and ask developers from #wikimedia-tech to introduce such restriction here too. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, I'm all about the whole &quot;freedom of editing&quot; thing, but i can't think of a reason why a new user would ''need'' to be able to move pages, and I can't think of any way to justify giving all new users that kind of power. If new users were prohibited from moving pages, that would cut down on the number of willy-on-wheels sockpuppets (and workalikes). If people don't need to log in to vandalize, they will more likely do it anonymously, and we can easily block the IP addresses. It just makes more sense to me. Maybe we should start a new proposed policy page or something? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:41, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

::: I am curious.  I am not a Wikibookean.  I intend to work primarily at Wikiversity when it activates.  Obviously occasionally our notes will turn into a product worthy of Wikibooks.  More often we will have groups and lesson plans and learning trails pointing at Wikibooks.   Has it ever been considered at Wikibooks to add a group tag to the user accounts such that the existing authors of specific books can acknowledge each other as contributors to that book and be given editing priveleges?  It would seem to me that most people probably work on a few books at a time and this might be a useful characteristic to add to the site.   Might hamper free ranging editors and typesetters types if you have such.   Just a thought I will check back for reactions.  Thanks. user:lazyquasar

::: For most established wikibooks, it's probably not useful to allow brand new users to move things. For more loosely-organized books, like the [[Cookbook]], moving pages isn't such a big deal and doesn't need to be restricted (though it wouldn't hurt either). Also, for new books, reorganization is more likely and probably okay even for new users. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:04, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

I was under the assumption that brand-new users couldn't do page move immediately.  This seems to be something that is inconsistant and apparently buggy with the MediaWiki software, and a reason why these sort of page move attacks have been cut down quite a bit from the past: a vandal can't waste the time necessary to build up a reputation of good edits on an account in order to kill the account with such nonsense.  If this is something that needs to be &quot;turned back on&quot; for Wikibooks by developers, I strongly support that decision and would like to add my name to a petition to put that restriction back in for Wikibooks.  Or make that something tweakable by admins &amp; bureaucrats.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:13, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

:To me this seems categorized incorrectly.  If I were a new author making great progress on a text or had just uploaded a draft used in my college classes that needed final polishing I would find it disconcerting for someone new to the material or text to be able to shuffle it and then find I could not fix the damage but must consult an administrator.  Are the regular contributors to wikibooks really routinely so friendly and reasonable with newcomers that such an expert could easily talk to the shuffler and have the damage reversed easily?   Has wikibooks evolved a configuration management and change process to protect known excellent material or is that still for the future as it is in Wikipedia?   &lt;s&gt;[[user:lazyquasar]]&lt;/s&gt; &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:70.110.43.185|70.110.43.185]] ([[User talk:70.110.43.185|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/70.110.43.185|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

I looked at my own contributions, [[Special:Contributions/Kernigh]]. Now I am one of those users who read wiki much before editing it, and my edit at 1 October 2005 was my very first edit to ''any'' wiki - logged in or not - except for one wiki running [[UseMod:UseModWiki|UseModWiki]] which I edited in 2004. Yet at 2 and 3 October 2005, I was already moving pages! I think that ''new users should be able to move pages'' because page moves are common on Wikibooks. In particular, a user that wants to move pages to satisfy the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] should be able to register an account and immediately start moving. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:50, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
:I just thought this was already built into MediaWiki software and an unofficial &quot;policy&quot;.  While I can see some value into &quot;allowing&quot; a user to move pages, it was felt (and I agree with this idea) that reverting page moves is somewhat more difficult of a task than simply reverting a page edit.  It can also cause a huge amount of confusion when it is done like the WoW attacks.  By requiring a minimum number of days and edits (not necessarily something like being added to a special user group like being a sysop), it would help in cutting down the blatant forms of abuse.  Generally speaking, what we are encouraging is that people help us out with adding and editing content.  Doing a page move should require at least a little knowledge of site policies and standardized naming conventions.
:BTW, the same arguments are being offered for even allowing page creation (adding the first edit on a new page) for new users.  I for one support that same argument here, but that is something that we, as a Wikibooks community, should debate and shouldn't be up to just one person.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:53, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

== Administrator Inactivity Decision ==

With all the arguing over inactive administrators over at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#Requests_for_de-adminship]], I thought it would be a good idea to add some guidelines to the role of an administrator. The general concensus from the discussions was that a period of twelve months of inactivity could be used in order to be sufficiently inactive for de-adminship. This inactivity would also include spare random edits. For example, if an admin made three edits (administrative or non-administrative) six months ago but was inactive for two years, the &quot;period of inactivity&quot; would still hold as two years. The only solid opposition towards blocking the current de-adminships was in reference to there not being any set guideline for inactivity. I'd like for a discussion to develop here and get someone to add the decision to the [[WB:ADMIN]] page. Discussing how often de-adminships could be listed is another important thing I hope can be decided here. Once a decision is rendered I'd like to clear the old de-adminship listings and re-vote within the appropriate time period using the established guidelines. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 21:54, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

:This is a good point, and it's something that we definately do need to nail down in policy. I think that 1 year of inactivity, or 1 year of sparce activity without using any admin actions (page deletion, user blocking, page protecting, etc) should be ground to start de-adminship proceedings. I would say that &quot;sparce activity&quot; would entail less then 5-10 edits per month, especially if all 5 edits happened on only a single day each month. 1 year of active contributions without using any admin actions should probably raise some kind of flag, and perhaps we could request the user to voluntarily relinquish adminship in that case, but we wouldn't put it to a vote. Once de-adminship votes are called, the admin in question should be notified by email, if available, and on their user talk page as well. If, during the vote, the admin in question comes in to defend themselves (hopefully with a good excuse, and a promise to be more active in the future), the vote can be terminated. That's my solution to the problem, although it might not be the best. suggestions? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:13, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

:: I see this as good reasoning. At the rate of which this place changes policy, anyone inactive for an extended period of time would be behind in policy. :-/ Overall, that sounds about right. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:17, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

::I like all of that but think a little clarification on returning admins is in order. If an admin comes back to defend his/her adminship, appropriate evidence towards becoming active should be provided. I don't like that if an admin simply comes back to argue the de-adminship that everything will go away. The admin will be listed there for a reason and shouldn't get a ticket out just because they came to comment. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 00:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

I would like to point out that several admins have been de-sysoped as a result of the various requests.  Those that were more or less unanimous in the support to remove sysop status have been dealt with by the stewards.  At this point we are dealing with the other admins whose support for deadminship was mixed.

On the whole, I think somebody who has not been participated at all for a very long period of time should not have admin privileges, or should have to &quot;reapply&quot; to get them back.  We are not talking about blocking these users, just that they need to spend some time getting reaquainted with Wikibooks before making decisions like deletion of content or other potentially controvercial actions.  In addition, if somebody was inactive for two or more years but came back and asked for adminship again in this situation, I would ask why and what they plan to do with the privileges, but being an admin previously would go a long way in terms of proving responsibility.  They should definitely have a lower bar to pass to become admin again than somebody who has never been an admin before.

As far as what the formal standard should be for deadminship, that is up to interpretation.  I recommended the 1 year of inactivity as a reasonable term, but this is certainly something that should be discussed further.  There were people with much more experience than I have which argued that admins should never be desysoped, and that it was silly to even try.  See the archives of the Staff Lounge for details, but there were some strong reasons given to not do the deadminship ever, at least for inactivity reasons.  Certainly deadminship is something that shouldn't be rushed except on a temporary basis if there has been some blatent wheel warring, and that to help calm down the situation.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

:What the previous de-admining discussions showed was that for some inactive users, there was clear support for de-admining where there was inactivity - but some required a clear rule. May I suggest that for all admins inactive for 12 months (inactivity to be defined as 20 or fewer edits in the year, 5 or fewer of which are in the month of the nomination), that they would be de-admined on nomination of one Wikibookian unless within 1 month they gave a good reason to keep it (which was then agreed to be a good reason by the community). For others with similar levels of inactivity but not meeting those requirements exactly, they can be nominated but without an automatic bias (ie there has to be a separately shown consensus for them to be de-admined for that to happen). All those nominated for de-admining to be notified on their usertalk pages and by email (if activated). Users de-admined in this way may then apply to be an admin again at a later stage without prejudice. The other case where we should have de-admining automatically are where a user requests it, or agrees to it - last time round we had a user so agreeing, but he remained an admin because (really as part of some wider issues) others opposed the de-admining (possibly without being aware of that user's assent), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:21, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

I have added the concensus of this discussion to the [[WB:ADMIN#What.27s_the_deal.3F|administrators page]]. We now have a clear standard for activity requirements now. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 16:31, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

I personally think that how-to should stay under the idea that they are stubs and can be easily integrated into a future textbook. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:27, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
:I don't think that there ever was a gigantic issue about it. There did happen to be alot of garbage on the How-To bookshelf, just like there is on every other bookshelf. However, the How-To bookshelf doesnt really have a &quot;patron saint&quot; to look over it and clean out the bad parts. The ones that were garbage got removed, and general concensus is that the rest are fit to stay at wikibooks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:04, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

As far as I'm concerned, this is a silly topic to even discuss in terms of a wholesale removal of content.  Any How-to books that are being removed without a VfD (or removed for other policies unrelated to being a how-to book) is a violation of trust by the Wikibooks community and admins doing that are abusing their power.  This should not be happening, and I don't see why these books should be removed.  Period.  Certainly not without an extensive discussion about the topic, and perhaps the creation of a whole new Wikimedia sister project.  The experience that I've had with Wikiversity would make me not want to go that course anyway, at least for a very long period of time.  Besides, how-to books seem like instruction books to me, and fit within the defintion (perhaps loosly) of what could be considered a textbook.  It is a topic book that covers instruction about how to perform a task.

I would agree that there are some How-to books that are incredibly poor in terms of quality, however.  Many of these started out as Wikipedia articles, and never really fit on Wikipedia, which is exactly why they are here on Wikibooks.    Admins on Wikipedia &quot;felt good&quot; that content was moved to Wikibooks and that they didn't have to completely piss off the How-to guide contributors, considering that at one time How-to guides were a major Wikiproject on Wikipedia.  This is yet another reason to not move them again without a very good cause, but I do believe that standards can be improved.

To help with raising standards for how-to content, I propose that we establish some guidelines that would go into depth and help us cull the very poor quality How-to guides, but provide consistant policies that would encourage new how-to books to be created that would be of higher standards.  To do this, I have created the following project page:

[[Wikibooks:How-to book guidelines]]

I would encourage participation in developing these guidelines, and I hope that we as a community can come up with what sorts of how-to books would be considered acceptable here on Wikibooks.  There is trash here, unfortunately, and I say that we get rid of that junk.  Let's be consistant, however, and give a positive message that how-to books can be on Wikibooks provided that you meet reasonable quality standards and are not using Wikibooks as a vanity press.  A one-page book on how-to build a bomb is not going to be acceptable.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:59, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

== Images can now be undeleted! ==

Brion in a mailing list [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2006-June/036289.html post] announced that deleted images can now be undeleted. This only applies to images that were deleted after he added this feature. According to one of his later posts, &quot;Undeletion links are provided on the description page if the page is altogether missing, and on the history tab if it has any deleted history.&quot; In addition to being really cool, it also means that all admin actions can now be undone. We should probably also update the various policy pages that mention the inability to undelete images, to reflect this change.--[[User:Cspurrier|Cspurrier]] 23:58, 16 June 2006 (UTC)


== Could an Admin Please Help ==

I posted the following on the discussion page of the main page of Wikiversity.  I have since calmed down and tracked down the person who made the change, apologised for strong language and reaction and asked them to change it back or to compromise phrasing while we discuss our differences.  I have no way to tell who protected the main page and why and it really does not matter as we should have a resolution of Wikiversity's status as an independent project within a few months.  The point is an admin is necessary to back this large error out of the Wikiversity front page as soon as possible because I do not wish to lose &lt;b&gt;ANY&lt;/b&gt; student activity or participation from random browsers.  Thank you.  &lt;s&gt;[[user:lazyquasar]]&lt;/s&gt; &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:70.110.43.185|70.110.43.185]] ([[User talk:70.110.43.185|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/70.110.43.185|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

Administrator Needed to Correct Horseshit or Large Error on Front Page

* Publish your course notes (note that we're talking to instructors here, not their students), lesson plans, topical essays, or reference works for others to review, modify or fork.

Either above or under the above I attempted to add a bullet and found the page protected, any admin is requested to add the bullet while any interested can debate with me here why we want &quot;students&quot; to become &quot;participants&quot; at Wikiversity by &quot;participating&quot; in any way they please. Modifying electronic bytes to improve the product is cheap and easy way to help people learn something and is what Wikiversity is all about.

* Publish your course notes (note that we're talking to students here, not their instructors), lesson plans, topical essays, or reference works for others to review, modify or fork.

and

* Publish your course notes (note that we're talking to participant here, not their parasites or naysayers), lesson plans, topical essays, or reference works for others to review, modify or fork.

or simplify the entire bullet list by changing the damaging sabotage in the original bullet to:

* Publish your course notes, lesson plans, topical essays, or reference works for others to review, modify or fork.

The entire point of Wikiversity is to start with whatever participation we get and evolve towards effective materials and participants. Participants means however someone wants to use the site. Students, mentors, professors, teachers, cub scout leaders, self improvement clubs, entrepreneurial cliques, whatever. Discouraging student participation is a very bad idea on the front page.

== Is Wikiversity Cleanup Appropriate at this Time? ==

This tag is appearing at various places in the Wikiversity pages:

{{cleanup|Distuinguish Wiikibooks content from Wikiversity courses}}

Is it really appropriate to be shuffling Wikiversity pages now when it is about to be approved as an active project?  Many of the newcomers returning upon receipt of the good news it is a go might be irritated to find their content or materials or structures familiar to them have been shuffled a few weeks prior to receipt of authority to proceed after a couple of years of negotiation with opponents of the project.  [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 04:38, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

: Do you disagree with the message? If anything, clearly separating Wiikibooks content from Wikiversity courses will facilitate Wikiversity's transition. And as Wikiversity has effectively been dead for the past few months, I doubt contributors will remember anything they wrote. With the exception of a few courses, no great deal of work has been put into Wikiversity, so I doubt contributors will cherrish any of their content (which is all still there, so I don't see what your complaint is). --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 04:57, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::I do not disagree with the message.  My concern is that Wikiversity materials should remain accessible from the existing link mazes.  Certainly it is useful to identify them explicitly.  Particularly if strays have gotten disassociated.  What will not be useful is if material which should move to the new Wikiversity domain is delinked from the Wikiversity main page and shuffled off to another virtual organization.  Fairly empty looking pages that serve an organizational placeholding function get deleted leaving a bunch of empty links. Material on Wikiversity is already spread out between meta and Wikibooks as a result of the chaotic stretched out project evaulation with impacts evolving new project procedures.  Many of the people who spent time setting the current links and initial outlines of courses were essentially newbies like myself without a clear understanding of how meta or Wikibooks was organized.  It is just an another potential obstacle which should not be tossed at a fragile overdue project.   Might also want to consider that the initial activists at Wikiversity will set much of the initial tone towards Wikibooks.  Do you wish to risk initial alienation of your natural customer base and source of proof reading and comments regarding your textbook products and even new text authors?  Certainly there is nothing (with a few exceptions, a couple of schools are currently active) that cannot be easily recreated with participants.  The interface between two emerging communities might be harder to repair.  Perhaps my concern is overblown.  I do not use Wikibooks with the exception of a couple of books linked to from elsewhere so I am not really familar with your organization or implications of this &quot;tidying up&quot;.  It sounds a bit ominous given some of the serious opposition I have seen towards a successful Wikiversity over the past year and a half. [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 09:40, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::: If I have done something that has hurt Wikiversity, I sincerely appoligize. But what ''is'' it that have I done that &quot;risked initial alienation&quot; of Wikiversity participants? I certainly have not been adding extra obstacles for Wikiversity, nor have I deleted any Wikiversity content. And as far as I can tell, you agree with me on that. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 18:46, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::::My apologies Hagindaz.  My absolutely did not mean to imply that you were personally by intent damaging Wikiversity or its material that Wikibooks has hosted.  I was trying to raise awareness of how the total activity of the Wikibooks community members mixed with the currently confused state of the initial Wikiversity implementation could have large future impacts on both community projects.  My biggest specific concern would be Wikibookeans finding fairly empty pages with a few links (there are a huge number of them) and decide to &quot;tidy up&quot; by deleting them.  People returning to the Wikiversity project after waiting for a year for it to get a serous start could receive a negative impression.   Much of what is there is &quot;trash/building scaffolding&quot; and will be modified and updated by the Wikiversity community rather rapidly as long as it does not get sidetracked.  Roberth has proposed a brilliant plan on the textbook-l mailing list to simply duplicate the Wikibooks initially on the new Wikiversity wiki and allow each community to delete or modify material it does not want in the database.  I think your tags will be useful no matter what approach is used.  Thanks for your assistance.  [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 09:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

I think it is important to Wikibooks to regularise its content and tidy these things up. As Hagindaz notes, if anything this should also aid the set up of Wikiversity. I am concerned, however, at the eagerness to say that anything with &quot;course&quot; in it is Wikiversity. It is not - we have textbooks, and should have textbooks, linked into particular courses (GCSEs, A-levels, SATs, etc). Also, every textbook has its own scope, and &quot;course&quot; could be synonymous with textbook. Wikibooks wishes to be left with whole textbooks - not extracts of them because elements are duplicated by a new Wikiversity project.

The other question is what Wikibooks should call its (future) bookshelf for university-level books. &quot;Wikiversity&quot; would be confusing - maybe &quot;Wikiuniversity&quot;? Any other ideas? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:26, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:I agree.  The material should be duplicated at both sites where it is not easily left in one and the content managed in a way that works for both.  Regarding the name perhaps &quot;Undergrad Library&quot;, &quot;Graduate Library&quot;, &quot;Research Library&quot;, or &quot;Undergrad Electromagnetism&quot;, &quot;Leading Edge Supercollider Reports&quot;,  &quot;Peer Reviewed Advances in Chaos Mathmatics&quot;, etc.  Personally I picture Wikibooks as eventually larger than the Library at Alexandria or the U.S. Library of Congress. Indeed, if Wikiversity and Wikibooks work together effectively it is certainly possible the Library of Congress will insist on mirroring Wikibooks so as to be complete in their mission.  [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 09:40, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

: You misunderstand, Jguk. I agree with your comment about courses. Indeed, I have called my [[French]] Wikibook a &quot;French Language Course.&quot; Wikibooks regularising its content and tidying these things up is not a concern or an issue for Wikiversity. Anything with the &quot;Wikiversity:&quot; prefix belongs to Wikiversity. '''But some Wikiversity schools have had links to Wikibooks mixed in with links to Wikiversity courses on their &quot;Courses available from this Wikiversity school&quot; lists'''. (As an example, imagine if [[Wikiversity:School of History]] had its &quot;references&quot; section mixed with the &quot;course listings&quot; section, with no clear distinction on what was what.). Solving that problem would help Wikiversity become an autonomous project.

: On the subject of what to call the bookshelf for university-level books, I think that Wikibooks should have one &quot;books by audience&quot; (or possibly &quot;books by age level&quot;) link in the sidebar, right below &quot;books by subject.&quot; On that page, there should links to pages entitled for example &quot;Wikibooks:University-level bookshelf.&quot; I don't think we should be wikiprefixing everything. That will only lead to unnecessary confusion (and our existing bookshelves would then have to be renamed for consistency, such as a &quot;Wikihistory&quot; page). --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 18:46, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::I disagree that everything with a Wikiversity: prefix belongs to the Wikiversity project - many of these are textbook pages. See, for example, [[Wikiversity:High School Physics/Motion - Kinematics]]. Is that not a page in a textbook which therefore belongs on Wikibooks? There are Wikiversity project pages with a Wikiversity: prefix, of course there are - but not everything with the prefix is a Wikiversity project page.

::As far as how the reorganisation of Wikibooks (including what is in the sidebar) goes, you may well be right. As we reorganise, classify and categorise, we can expect to change our look to highlight the various ways of searching for things, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:17, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::: I think its up to Wikiversity to decide what to do with its own content. If Wikiversity does not want the content or the content violates policy, then Wikiversity should tag it for either {{tl|transwiki}} to a sister project (namely, Wikibooks) or deletion. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 21:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::::I don't disagree with the point that Wikiversity can decide what to do with its own content - it's more the point that Wikibooks can decide what to do with its content - and we should keep textbook pages currently prefixed with Wikiversity:.

:::::How is Wikibooks able to decide what to do with the content of a sister project? If content was created for Wikiversity, by Wikiversity, then Wikiversity has control of it, rather than Wikibooks. If a page is not suitable for Wikiversity, then Wikiversity contributors (''including you and me'') should either delete it or transwiki it to a sister project (which in this case would be Wikibooks). --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:20, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::::Hagindaz has summarized my position on Wikiversity nicely.  However, there have been vocal participants in the proposal/scope definition who are adamant about no duplication of materials.  Whether they have a significant prescence in the soon to be active Wikiversity community remains to be seen.   Regarding the page as per Jguk's query.   This is precisely a &lt;b&gt;page of notes&lt;/b&gt; not &lt;b&gt;a page in a textbook&lt;/b&gt; unless someone does some work preparing to insert it.  It has three links only, all of them to defining articles at Wikipedia regarding fundamental concepts.  Since it is FDL'ed material there is no problem forking it into a page in a textbook with appropriate credit back to its originator at Wikiversity.   There is a severe problem from someone grabbing this unilaterally (editing boldly) and moving over to the middle of a Wikibook in the middle of a small group of students trying to study asynchronously over the internet and leave a valuable learning trail behind.  It would not take much disruption from activities like this for student/participants to decide the overhead is too high, Wikiversity is non viable concept, that they should study in private elsewhere.

== Help please on new book project: &quot;Basic Book Design&quot; ==

In 2002 I wrote a book about designing books on a computer. At the time there were no such books. There were a few old, pre-computer-era books about book design. There were a few newer books showing examples of radical, cutting edge book designs. But there was nothing showing you how to take the manuscript you wrote in MS Word and turn it into a professional-looking book.

Many, if not most, books I see that are designed by pro book designers are badly designed (e.g., a bibliography instead of referencing sources, or type too small for an average person to read without eye strain). Self-published books often look really awful. I saw a statistic that something like 12,000 new publishers registered with R.R.Bowker last year. The self-published/small press market is exploding. There's a real need for a book about designing books.

But I'm not a pro book designer. For example, under &quot;choosing fonts&quot; I more or less said to use serif fonts for text and san-sarif for headings. An expert would have far more to say on that subject.

Also I showed how to use MS Word. Pro book designers were shocked&amp;#151;SHOCKED!&amp;#151;when I said that MS Word can do everything, and more, and easier, than LaTEX, PageMaker, etc. It was like I'd gone to a Harley rally on my Kawasaki. The book could really use some LaTEX and InDesign experts expanding sections to say, &quot;Here's how you do this in MS Word, and here's how you do it in LaTEX, and here's how you do it in InDesign&quot; etc.

I shopped the manuscript around to several publishers, and they said &quot;good idea, but it's not the kind of book we publish.&quot; Yes, I knew that. That's why I write books different from they publish. If I wrote books the same as what they publish, I wouldn't be writing new books. Speaking of which, I'll post another topic with some ideas for books that no one has written.

IMHO this is a perfect project for a Wikibook. If anyone has way too much time on their hands, please download the manuscript from [http://www.casafuturatech.com/Personal/BasicBookDesign.doc my website]. If you like what you see, feel free to reformat it and start a WikiBook. Is there a form I should sign to release my rights?

In the next few days I'll post a similar request regarding a relationships book I wrote that no one bought.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 18:51, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:It would be great if you are willing to donate this book (essentially by releasing it under GFDL. All I think we need to do is ask you to confirm a few things:

:#Do you own all the rights? For example, if your company has exclusive publishing rights, it would also have to waive these.
:#Are you willing to release the book under GFDL? (This could severely restrict your ability to make money out of the text in the future)
:#Are you willing for the text, once on Wikibooks, to be edited mercilessly by others (potentially in ways with which you may disagree)?

:If you can answer all three of those questions in the affirmative, then just say here that you are releasing the book under GFDL (in view of your existing history here at WB, I think we have enough to go on to confirm your identity! :) ). It would also be useful to know what sort of review has been done on the text - is it just you, or has it been peer reviewed (and if so, details of this review would be helpful)?, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:11, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

Yes, yes, and yes. Except that the chapter on fonts must say that Times Roman is the greatest font ever. Just kidding. :-)

I read the GFDL but I can't say that I understand all of it. What happens with parallel books? Let's say that I hand over &quot;Basic Book Design&quot; to Wikibooks and a cadre of geeks rewrites it recommending LaTEX. Then I buy a bunch of Adobe stock, rewrite the book ro recommend InDesign, and sell a zillion copies to get more people to buy Adobe products. Meanwhile, the original version, which recommends MS Word, develops a cult following and is passed hand to hand, as a cherished object, among devotees who find hidden messages in MS Word. They annotate my manuscript with these hidden messages. Three versions are then developing and circulating in parallel. Is anyone violating any license?

For reviews, I posted on a Usenet newsgroup for desktop publishing how to download the book from my website and send me comments. One woman was very helpful. Someone else was extremely offended that I recommended Times Roman and MS Word. The usual response from the Usenet.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 03:36, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

:I've started importing this on [[Basic Book Design]]. It would be useful, if you've got the time, to go through it and make sure that it looks out to you in wikitext format. I'm also (through incompetence, I think) to mimic some of the formatting you use in your examples. Where this is happening, I'm placing the books in [[:Category:Formatting help required]]. If anyone knows how to sort this out - please do so! :) [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:54, 20 June 2006 (UTC)


: &quot;I read the GFDL but ...&quot;. If you mean 'can I stop that happening?' then the answer is yes but only as long as you don't publish it here.  The 'solution',if it is one, would be to use invariant sections to fix certain parts of the book.  But the rule here is 'No invariant sections, no front or back cover texts', see [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]].  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:28, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

::The GFDL uses copyright law to assure that anyone else who modifies your material and publishes must also use the GFDL.  However, you are the original copyright holder and you can put it out under parallel licenses.   If you do this the book will essentially fork and begin evolving in different directions.   The GFDL'ed version here at Wikibooks could be downloaded and forked to a new version using the GFDL with new materials added but only you can put out a fork using a different license on the original material.

== Some ideas for books no one has written ==

As a small publisher I notice subjects about which no books exist. Some of these may be good Wikibook projects. I haven't checked if there are good Wikipedia articles on these subjects.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birth control. There are zillion fertility books, for women who want to get pregnant. There are no books for women who &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want to get pregnant. The closest is an excellent chapter in &quot;Our Bodies, Our Selves.&quot; My guess is that publishers are afraid of getting boycotted by Catholics or something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scientific research into astrological phenomenon. There's been excellent research in this field, disproving some astrological claims (e.g., that newspaper Zodiac columns are non-fiction), yet proving other astrological claims beyond the shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a doubt (e.g., that champion athletes tend to be born after Mars rises or passes overhead).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A book (or website) about videos children can make. E.g., how to make your own horror movie. Or simple special effects, such as climbing along a fallen tree with cross-fades of a standing tree making it look like the kid is climbing high in a tree.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 19:31, 18 June 2006 (UTC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

:All of these are interesting topics.  I would urge caution with the astrology book as it would skirt very close to the original research prohibition on [[WB:WIW]], and I have extreme skepticism that there is anything at all to astrological research.  Newspaper Zodiac columns, from my viewpoint, are fiction.  While some famous astronomers also were published astrologers, that was more than 400 years ago when it was widespread.  If you (or anybody) could show a published research paper on astrological phenomena that was published in A) the last 50 years or so and B) was in a major respected scientific journal such as the '''New England Journal of Medicine''', '''Nature''', or even '''Sky and Telescope''', I would be very much interested in reading that research.  It doesn't have to be these exact journals, but certainly something that is widely recognized within the scientific community as a respected publication.  The Russian Science Academy may have some articles on the topic now that I think about it.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:23, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
:Do you have any children?  Do you remember how you thought when you were one?  Not sure encouraging them to make horror movies would be a good idea just think how realistic they could get :-)) .  On astrology and the Mars effect etc, you could start by going through the weekly New Scientist magazine for pointers, I think that the Mars effect has actually been discredited or at least it is certainly not proven beyond a shadow of a doubt (not even one shadow let alone three), take a look at http://www.skepsis.nl/mars.html for a discussion of the various experiments that have been performed in this field.  As the effect is still very much disputed it would hardly be a suitable topic for an astrology text book but it would be very suitable as a case study for an advanced statistics text.  I can't see any ''wikibooks policy'' reason why a textbook of astrology as such should not appear on Wikibooks.  After all there are astrologers who do the various arcane calculations and presumably they don't all invent them for themselves so there must be texts that treat the subject, that is textbooks.  &quot;astrology classes&quot; gets 19k hits on Google so there are classes and presumably textbooks too.  Is there a rule that says that the claims made for an activity must be true before a textbook in that field can be created on Wikibooks?  This could be an interesting dicsussion.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
::Actually, yes, I do have children.  Six of them to be exact.  And yeah, I guess there is some reverse psycology that could be at play here.  Still, my arguments that we should avoid cranks and unproven research still should apply to such a book.  As has been pointed out, the gravitational pull of the doctor (or nurse midwife) was greater at your birth than that of Mars.  I have extreme skepticism on this particular topic being anything other than pure fiction, and I would consider it such if a bunch of horoscopes appeared on Wikibooks proporting to be anything else.  As far as a solid book to discuss astrology as a Wikibook topic, I have no problem for such a book to exist.  I might not contribute, but it would be interesting to see a book on the history of Astrology.  It would be very difficult, from my viewpoint, to maintain NPOV or no original research standards.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:43, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
:::The 'do you have children' question was really addressed to [[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]]; I often fail to make it clear to which of the participants of the conversation I am addressing a remark, sorry.  How do you have time to do any Wikibooks stuff with six, I only have three and that's plenty.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 18:10, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

I wasn't intending to start a flame-war about astrology. What I've read is the Gauqulin book on the Mars Effect, the article in the Skeptical Enquirer (winter 1991-92) by Suitbert Ertel about the Mars Effect (the quote I remember from the editor was &quot;astrology is the only field of the paranormal that, when scientifically investigated, is vindicated&quot;), plus the Center for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOPS, founded by Carl Sagen) study of the Mars Effect.

Regarding children and horror movies, I was thinking of fun cheesy horror movies. E.g., how to make a coffin out of cardboard boxes, how to make a vampire costume and fake blood, what lines Dracula always says (&quot;I vant to drink your blood!&quot;). But introducing play therpy is also possible, i.e., making a horror movie about what really does scare kids. E.g., your grandpa who always wants to show you his heart surgery scar, show you how he takes his insulin shots, show you his false teeth, etc. could be a zombie who wants to show you his heart surgery scar, etc. Or a kid is scared about moving to a new town and starting in a new school. What if his fears are justified -- the kids at the new school really are vampires and werewolves? :-)--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 20:48, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

==Refashioning Conic Sections==
I would like to transform [[Conic Sections]] into a more organized, complete module. I would like, at least, to dedicate myself to it until it's done enough. With the approval of any who read this, I propose to do the following:

#Send the current page to Conic Sections/Old Page by copying the Wiki source code
#Set up another main page, with the following basic contents (in any order):

I know a fair amount about Conic Sections, mostly from individual work.

Also, I have much experience with WikiFormatting, so this shouldn't be a problem. I've read several of the WikiBook editing and content guidelines. Unfortunately, I'm not that good at LaTeX, Although I'm proficient at a half-similar language (Open Office Math). I've picked LaTeX up easily before, and then forgotten it, so why shouldn't I learn it easily again?

So that's my situation and proposal. Any good?

== copyvio ==

Can someone delete [[Study Guide for CFA Exam Level III]] and &quot;Study Sessions&quot; section of [[Study Guide for CFA Exam Level 1]]? These modules were mentioned as copyright violation by a CFA lawyer writing to Wikipedia's OTRS, which was reported to me at IRC by [[n:User:Amgine|Amgine]]. At the moment I don't have time to do it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:32, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
:Done. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 20:46, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

::Can somebody explain why this wasn't done through the normal copyvio process on Wikibooks?  While I understand that lawyers and others want to make official cease and desist letters and threaten the WMF, it should still be something that is investigated and the user who added the content allowed to defend why the content was added.  At the very least, and something that [[n:User:Amgine|Amgine]] could have done was to simply add the {{tl|copyvio}} tag to the page.  Is this an unusual process for other Wikimedia projects?
::I can understand, however, that the OTRS didn't want to make a big deal out of this on the Staff Lounge.  I also don't want to do a knee jerk deletion of all content simply because somebody has asked for it to be deleted.  It is at least possible that some content on Wikibooks is being copied onto other websites or places first, or that it may be &quot;politically incorrect&quot; to have some Wikibooks content that the contributors here are just fine with.  In addition, I would question all of the edits of known copyvio users.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:07, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] ==

At present, there's no single list of completed books or books usable in a classroom in use. I have attempted to combine {{tl|Highlighted}} and  [[Wikibooks:Book of the month bookshelf]] / [[Wikibooks:Book of the month]] on [[Wikibooks:Featured books]], which I modeled after [[w:Wikipedia:Featured articles]]. The page has forty-two books listed (fifteen books of the month and twenty-seven other books), about the number of one bookshelf. The inclusion criteria I chose is that a listed book should be:
# Usable in its current state to effectively teach the subject in a classroom
# Near completion (few red-linked chapters or stubs)
# Organized effectively by chapters, following Wikibooks style rules and naming convention, and containing no confusing pages, encyclopaedia articles, or orphans
# Accompanied by a PDF version of at least 100 pages
Voting on a book would be needed in order to bold a book. As the number of quality books grows, I see the featured status criteria becoming more strict, and books that haven't improved to meet the new criteria being removed. I have also included a list of good Wikibooks that should become featured in the near future. I would like the page to replace the {{tl|Highlighted}} template and to be listed on the sidebar, like the Wikipedia version. So what does everyone think? --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 00:33, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
:Some of those requirements (like having a 100+ page PDF) are pretty steep, but it seems like it could be done over time. I just don't think too many books will become featured as of now if we stick to those requirements. A good goal for books perhaps. I'm positive some of the listed books don't meet all the requirements, but maybe you listed them as future possibilities. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 01:44, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

::I plan to create PDFs for books already listed that don't already have them sometime soon. If a book doesn't meet any other requirement, then please remove it or move it down to &quot;Good Wikibooks.&quot; As for the criteria, if anything, I thought that there would be comments on them being too lenient. But my view is that they should start at &quot;barely passable as a textbook&quot; and slowly improve, so please lower them if you like. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:23, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

This is very useful and will help readers. It is a shame there are not more high school books in the list. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 17:03, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

== Link to wikibooks ==

Can someone help me? How do I link to wikibooks when editing a page? If I use [[w:pt:whatever|Whatever]], it links only to pt.wikipedia. How do I link to that page in wikibooks?

[[User:Jorgebonafe|Bonafé]] 22:59, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

:Well, from Wikibooks in a different language, you can do it like this [[:en:Wikijunior|Wikijunior]]. This will provide an interwiki link to the English wikibooks, but not on the sidebar. For the one above (from a different language Wikibooks to the Portuguese Wikibooks), you could do [[:pt:whatever|whatever]]. Or did you mean from a different language Wikipedia to English Wikibooks? Clarification? --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 01:37, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

== Would it be alright to add a manual on... ==

Improvised munitions? I don't want to turn this into WikiAnarchistCookbook, but I would like to write a guide or two on various improvised explosive devices.

:A book on fireworks would be amusing but be careful of modern anti-terrorist legislation. In many countries you could be jailed just for having a book on how to make munitions. (What has the world come to?) [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:07, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
::The jails will be full of physicists (one of the standard exercises for undergraduate physics sudents is to determine the necessary quanties of plutonium or uranium required to make a small nuclear bomb)  and chemical and automotive engineers (details of explosive mixtures are rather important if you want to make sure that an internal combustion engine goes or want to make sure that an oil refinery stays).  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:03, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

Cyclonite synthesis, and thermite synthesis, as well as another explosive synthesis are on wikibooks, under chemical synthesis(I have still not got the hang of linking on wikibooks).  They were controversial, but are now accepted.  Try to avoid stuff looking at it from the point of view of the wrongdoer.  Expressions such as 'enough to blow your hand off' are probaly ok as a safety warning, 'enough to blow up a car' probably not ok.  I have taken an interest in what ssort of stuff like this has been allowed.

== Voting on Wikijunior ==

Hi, I'm new.  I'd like to add my vote to a proposed wikijunior book about the alphabet but the page for current voting on this (3rd) quarter seems to be locked?? and no one can edit? to add their vote.

:It was meant to be protected to prevent unregistered users from editing. However, I tested this with a new account, and it was preventing that from editing too. I have therefore unprotected the page - so you should be able to edit it now.

== Automotive Books ==

There are a number of books in the [[Wikibooks:Engineering bookshelf#Automotive|Automotive Engineering bookshelf]] that don't actually have anything to do with engineering. Some of these books can certainly stay, but alot of them are simply shelved in the wrong place. I have considered moving some of them to the How-To bookshelf, but not all of them can go there. I would like to keep the entire body of automotive materials together, but I need a good home for them. Should I move them to the Miscellaneous bookshelf? Here is a list of books that I am talking about:

*[[Automobile repair]] 
*[[Car maintenance]]
*[[Choosing a Car]]
*[[Engine repair]]
*[[Ford Escape Hybrid]]
*[[Nissan 240SX Performance Modification]]
*[[Suzuki UC125]]
*[[Toyota Prius]]

:&quot;Automotive books&quot; in the edit summary made me think that these should be lively books. Methinks a &quot;transport&quot; category is necessary at least (we also have books on bicycles that could go in that category too). I'll start one. Anyone who wants to help me turn [[:Category:Transport]] into a bookshelf is welcome, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:04, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

::That makes good sense to me, Wikipedia does have a &quot;transport&quot; portal for topics like this. I am thinking perhaps that this solution is short-sighted. Howabout the creation of a &quot;technology&quot; bookshelf, for things that are technological in nature, but that dont fit the definition of &quot;science&quot; or &quot;engineering&quot;? We could certainly include a Transport section on that bookshelf. I'll snoop around a bit and see if there are enough technology-related books on other shelves that could be moved to a new technology bookshelf. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

== Blanking copyvio images ==

I am trying to fond out if it is permitted to blank image pages that are allegedly copyvio.  I found some who blanked an (alleged) copyvio, and do not know if this is allowed.  the page is [[Image:Servalcat.jpg]][[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 18:45, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

I now see that it has not been blanked, and that I have made a complete idiot of myself.[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 18:47, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

: I don't know the answer to your query, but well done. Oh and you can simply link to the image by putting a colon in front of it, like so: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Image:Servalcat.jpg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Which looks like [[:Image:Servalcat.jpg]] [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

== Upper level category organization ==

The current version is at [[:Category:Main page]]. I think it needs some tidying up (or is the current organization acceptable?), so here's my attempt, based on [[w::Category:Categories]].

* Categories
*# Bookshelves and departments
*#: A simple listing of all bookshelves and departments
*# Books by topic (or subject)
*#: (Possibly list bookshelves here)
*#: All immediate subcategories would be named only after bookshelves
*#* Arts
*#*: All immediate subcategories would be named after level two headings of the bookshelf
*#**Visual Arts
*#**: All pages in this category would only be books listed in the bookshelf section (under the L2 heading)
*#**: (Possibly: All subcategories would only be named after books and contain book pages for books that wish to use categories)
*#**Perfoming Arts, etc
*#*Biology, etc
*# Book categories
*#: All subcategories would only be named after books and contain book pages for books that wish to use categories
*# Books by other organization schemes
*#: Includes alphabetical classification, books with print version, books by reading level, Wikistudy, and Wikiprofessional
*# Wikibooks administration
*# Wikibooks maintenance
*# Wikiversity (temporary)
*# Wikijunior
Numbers 1, 2, and 3 could possibly be combined. Comments? --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 01:27, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

:I like the way it is now, to tell you the truth, although maybe it can stand a little tidying up. I guess it doesn't make sense to have some subjects listed up there at the top level, however. Here is my suggestion:

#Wikibooks
#*Bookshelves
#*Books with Print Version
#*Books with PDF Version
#*etc...
#Wikijunior
#Wikiversity
#*Schools, Courses, etc
#Users
#Subjects
#*Art
#*Science
#*Computing
#*Games
#*etc...

:After this rearrangement, we could essentially keep all the lower-level categories the same. Categories for individual books (as far as i am concerned) can just stay inside their respective categories. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:59, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

== New [[Relationships|Relationships]] book ==

Thanks to Jguk for working on my [[Basic_Book_Design|Basic Book Design]]. As I said last week, I'd also appreciate help putting my book &quot;Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships&quot; up as a [[Relationships|Relationships]] wikibook. I put up the table of contants and the first chapter up. 

You can download the book in [http://www.casafuturatech.com/Personal/Hearts%20and%20Minds MS Word] format or in [http://www.casafuturatech.com/Personal/Hearts%20and%20Minds.txt text] format. Don't upload the photos. Most are public domain but some I had to pay for. I'll upload the public domain photos.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 22:50, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

== Rewrite of [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]] ==

I have a draft rewrite of [[WB:WIW]] at [[Wikibooks:Inclusion criteria/Proposal]]. I have already exposed it on the WIW talk page and on the mailing list, and some amendments have been made in response to comments offered in response.

I'd now like to highlight it here. It is not intended to change Wikibooks' scope at all in practice. Instead, it is meant to define what Wikibooks is for in positive terms - and make it easier for new readers to understand what content is and is not suitable for this wiki.

All constructive comments are welcome. I'd like to see all of those dealt with and then make the page live, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:53, 29 June 2006 (UTC)


== vfd making an island ==

So now my book is going through it's second vfd (which according to the policy and votes it would seem to have been long enough to take it off the vfd list. There doesn't seem to be any solid policy on that anymore though.) unless someone actually tries to do it that book wont make much advancements into a textbook. All that can be done for that is simply to wait untill someone does it. If it's deleted some one that actually does it could come back and have to rewrite the wikibook from scratch. I have to ask why the user Jguk has posted 11 vfds on that page, many of them resonable, but still that is a lot, it seems like someone looking for stuff to delete.--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 19:05, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

: I think an overall deletion run is okay (but not optimal) for Wikibooks, especially when there were a couple of changes in policy (Jimbo did mandate for video games to leave, so they are in the process of going by now). So I guess Making an Island was just part of that. I'm kinda in &quot;waiting&quot; to see what happens with that book and policy in general right now, to see if the concensus changes. Either way, I think that book is a boarderline case, and arguments can be made for both sides. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 20:46, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

::I would like to point out that what Jimbo asked to be removed was video game walkthroughs, not simply just video game books.  And the video game guidelines that were being developed before Jimbo stirred up the pot had discussed and even recommended that books which concentrated on just a walkthrough were not really acceptable on Wikibooks.  As for this specific Wikibook, that is a discussion better left for the VfD page itself.  As a general rule, I beleive that a book which has survived a VfD had better have a very good reason such as a policy change that has achieved project-wide concensus.  The narrow textbook-only policy certainly didn't do that or even what that meant had achieved concensus.  And if you are going to cite an ambiguous policy such as not being a textbook, it helps if you can prove the content violates other policies as well in order to remove the content, such as being a soapbox or containing copyright violations.  There are many reasons to remove content from Wikibooks, and not being a textbook is way down the list of priorities.  Content that has serious NPOV problems is something that I think deserves much more attention before you remove it for non-textbook reasons.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:37, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

V2os, I do a lot of adminny, tidying up type things. During the course of this I come across a lot of content which is or may be unsuitable for wikibooks. That explains why I have nominated much to VfD - to allow a discussion as to whether some of the material where I am not sure whether it is suitable or not should remain, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:54, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

== New books go to the top of WHAT list? ==

[[Template:New]] says: &quot;When you create a new book, you should add a new entry to the TOP of the list.&quot; 

Uh, what list? The page doesn't have a link or anything to indicate what list is refered to.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 00:51, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

== Overview ==

The '''''OWL (Ordinary Wizarding Level) exams''''' are taken at the end of a student's fifth year at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].

OWLs are offered in most subjects a student takes in their first five years, and many consist of both written (theory) and practical tests. Courses in which OWLS are offered are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ancient Runes|Ancient Runes]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Arithmancy|Arithmancy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle Studies|Muggle Studies]], all of which have written sections only; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Astronomy|Astronomy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]], all of which have theory and practice exams; and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]], which seems to have only a Practice section. Thus for twelve available subjects, nineteen examination slots are required.

== Event Details ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Apparently, OWLs extend over two weeks, with exams morning and afternoon; generally theory in the morning, practice in the afternoon. Special anti-cheating quills and parchment are used for the written parts of the exam. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] fifth year, when he takes OWLs, Harry sits Charms on the first day, then Transfiguration, Herbology, and Defence Against the Dark Arts. On the Friday, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] sits Ancient Runes, while Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] have the day off. The following week is Potions on Monday, then Care of Magical Creatures on Tuesday. Wednesday we see Astronomy theory in the morning, Divination in the afternoon, then the Astronomy practical exam was that night at midnight. Thursday afternoon was the History of Magic exam. Hermione also had to sit her Arithmancy exam Wednesday afternoon, when Harry and Ron had Divination. None of the Trio are taking Muggle Studies, so we do not know when that exam occurs; but as it, like Divination, Ancient Runes, and History of Magic, likely only has a theory part, the exam could take place on the Thursday afternoon, following History of Magic, or on the Friday following Ancient Runes. 

OWLs are graded using the following system:

'''Passing Grades'''
* O - Outstanding
* E - Exceeds Expectations
* A - Acceptable

'''Failing Grades'''
* P - Poor
* D - Dreadful
* T - Troll

The examiners are not Hogwarts professors, but a group of independent examiners referred to as Wizarding Examinations Authority, apparently somehow under the aegis of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].  They are described as “a small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards”.

In the first few classes at the start of the term, a number of teachers announce that they will be grading to OWL standards. Harry, Ron, and Hermione discuss between themselves what OWL standards mean. In their discussion, they are joined by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], who sat their OWLs two years earlier. It is the Twins who describe the various grade levels, saying that they should have received E in every course, as their just showing up for the exam had exceeded the expectations of the Hogwarts teachers.

In the same book, Harry, viewing one of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape's]] memories, sees the Marauders ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|his own father]]) at the end of their Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL.

== Notable Consequences ==

The grades achieved in OWLs are very important for the next stages of a young wizard or witch's education. Each teacher demands a minimum grade for further study of his or her subject at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT level]]. Most teachers seem to demand at least an E, while some demand an O and others allow students with an A, the lowest passing grade, to proceed. In particular, Professor Snape requires that students who wish to proceed to NEWT-level study of Potions must achieve Outstanding, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] require at least Exceeds Expectations.

As the results of the OWL exams determine which courses can be taken at the NEWT level, the OWL exams affect the witch or wizard's career choices. It is for this reason that Harry's meeting with Professor McGonagall concerning choice of careers occurs before the OWL exams. In particular, Harry, asked to consider a career, is most intrigued by the idea of being an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]], a career for which he must achieve NEWT grades of Exceeds Expectations in at least five subjects. Professor McGonagall suggests Harry's subjects should include [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]], Potions, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]]. While Harry does achieve Exceeds Expectations in Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]], as well as Outstanding in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Professor Snape's requirement that he achieve Outstanding for NEWT-level Potions studies seems to prevent his becoming an Auror.

It is while Harry, tired after endlessly re-hashing the arrest of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] that had occurred during the Astronomy final, is trying to write his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]] exam that he falls asleep and has the dream of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] being tortured in the Ministry by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. It is this dream that sends him to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]].

== Analysis ==

The fact that the Wizarding world has an equivalent to the English GCSE is only to be expected; its sharing a name, largely, with the older O-level exams is likely an artifact of the author's age. The standardized testing in the Muggle world that so pervades the school system must have a parallel. The stress and fatigue surrounding the GCSEs no doubt has made many young Muggles imagine things that just are not so. Similarly, the mental tension and exhaustion caused in Harry by these exams obviously will increase Harry's sensitivity to the images that Voldemort is sending Harry to lure him to the Ministry. Given that we have seen earlier that Harry is able to pick up mental impressions at times Voldemort is experiencing extreme emotions, it is safe to speculate that the author arranged events to heighten Harry's tension in this book, culminating with the critically-important OWL exams, specifically to make the transfer of thoughts more likely.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#Is Troll a real exam grade? Why did the Weasley twins have trouble remembering it?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is mentioned that Harry believes his hopes of becoming an Auror to be futile, when he receives his OWL grades at the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. In fact, this is not quite true; the requirement is that Harry achieve Exceeds Expectations in at least five NEWTs, and he has received five Exceeds Expectations and one Outstanding at OWL level. It appears that he would be able to proceed in five NEWT-level courses even if Snape was still teaching Potions and would not accept him in that course; that he take Potions at NEWT level was a recommendation by Professor McGonagall, rather than a requirement. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 9|Once he arrives at Hogwarts]], he will find that a new Potions instructor has been appointed. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] will accept an OWL grade of Exceeds Expectations for NEWT-level studies, so Harry's hopes of becoming an Auror will be restored.

Harry's belief that Professor Slughorn has been brought in to be the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and his associated belief that he will not be allowed to study NEWT-level Potions, is a necessary plot point. It is because of this that Harry does not purchase the necessary textbook for NEWT-level potions, instead receiving the textbook previously owned by the Half-Blood Prince. This textbook is instrumental in Harry's success in Potions in his sixth year, and teaches him spells that he will use during the rest of the story.

==Background==
Lobster Thermidor is a lobster tail preparation that originated in Europe but was popularized in the US in the mid-20th century.  Perhaps the most prominent reference to Lobster Thermidor is in the movie Citizen Kane&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/citizenkane.html|title=Citizen Kane|accessdate=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;; while never shown is it used as an example of early 20th century Northeastern haute cuisine.  

While present in older American cookbooks the Lobster Thermidor preparation is no longer widely known.  The preparation is related to Lobster Newberg, another recipe involving the preparation of lobster tail commonly presented in older Northeastern themed cookbooks.


==Preparation==
Lobster Therimdor is a dish created by  stuffing an empty lobster tail with sautéed lobster meat that is cooked with butter a light wine (often sherry) and cream.  The resulting sauce is stuffed into a lobster shell then topped with either a cheese, mushrooms or combination of vegetables before being placed under an open flame or broiled.

==Ingredients==
* 1/2 lb [[Cookbook:lobster|lobster]] (225g) meat, preferably from the tail.
* 1 cleaned [[Cookbook:lobster|lobster]] tail shell
* 3 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoons]] of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] (240ml) of heavy [[Cookbook:cream|cream]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:egg|eggs]] yolks separated
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] (120ml) of [[Cookbook:sherry|sherry]] or [[Cookbook:brandy|brandy]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] (120g) of grated gruyere or [[Cookbook:mozzarella|mozzarella]] [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] and freshly ground black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

Note: Cooking and shelling a fresh lobster can be a time consuming process, hence frozen or pre-shelled tail meat is often used as a substitute.

==Optional: Preparing a fresh lobster==
Note: Lobsters are live animals that can be commonly purchased in most large American grocery stores.

#Bring 12 [[Cookbook:cup|cups]] of water to a boil in a pan that is large enough to accommodate the entire lobster.
#Stick a sharp knife in the head of the lobster from the top down, and make a quick 'lever' movement downwards with the knife until it is completely through. This kills the lobster almost instantly.
#Add the lobster to the boiling water and cook until it turns a bright red.
#Remove and Let Cool,
#Carefully Slice the Tail along the midsection and remove the cooked tail meat, do not discard the shell.

Additional Notes: There are other parts of the lobster that can also be eaten, but tail meat is particularly prized for its unique texture.

==Preparing the Filling==
#In a serving bowl, mix together egg yolks and cream then set aside for later use.
#In a pan large enough to accommodate the lobster meat and cream, warm the butter or margarine at a low temperature until it melts.
#Add the cooked lobster meat and wine to the sauce then sauté at a medium high heat for about 2-3 minutes, or until the meat is warmed through and the wine has been mostly absorbed.
#Slowly add the cream and egg mixture, stirring all the time to insure that the sauce is evenly mixed.
#When the sauce has thickened remove from heat.

==Final Steps==
#Set oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|broil]] or prepare an open flame.
#Carefully stuff the empty Lobster Tail with the filling.
#Top with the grated cheese, salt and pepper.
#Place the Shell underneath the open flame and broil for 3-8 minutes, or until the cheese melts and turns a golden brown.
#Remove the lobster Thermidor from the oven and serve on a warmed plate with garnish and appropriate accompaniments.

While the base preparation of Lobster Thermidor often remains the same, the type of wine or cheese used, or the way that the lobster is cooked differs.

Some preparations include utilizing the broth generated from cooking to the lobster with carrots, celery, tarragon and wine as an additional ingredient to thicken the sauce of cream and sherry.

==Correlatives==
The most simple words in Esperanto follow an independent system from other words to make them easier to memorize. Not memorizing the table below is perhaps the most common mistake students of Esperanto make, and given how frequently they are used, it is important that you memorize them.

Note that correlative words ending in a vowel can take the accusative ending '''-n'''. However, they ''cannot'' be made plural, even if it is understood that you are talking about more than one thing.

Make special note of the column marked &quot;Interrogative and Relative&quot;. These words serve a double-purpose, before an interrogative (question-asking) clause, and a relative (descriptive) clause.
;Interrogative Clause:This is a sentence which asks a question requiring a more descriptive answer than &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. For example, &quot;What's wrong with that?&quot; or &quot;How are you?&quot;, but ''not'' &quot;Is that a cake?&quot;. These sentences must begin with a word starting with &quot;ki&quot;.
;Relative Clause:A sentence (usually within a sentence) that describes something. For example, &quot;That is the boy '''''who''' goes to school''.&quot; or &quot;I see a car '''''which''' is going very fast''.&quot; Likewise, these sentences must start with one of the &quot;ki&quot; words. You can (almost always) distinguish between interrogative and relative clauses by whether or not they end in a question mark.

===Ĉi and Ajn===
These two words are used in addition to correlatives to create a few additional, very common words.

'''&quot;Ĉi&quot;'''Expresses closeness and is used with the '''ti-''' and '''ĉi-''' words, either before or after them.
*Ĉi tie - Here
*Ĉi tio - This
*Ĉi ĉio - All of this

The word '''&quot;Ajn'''&quot; means &quot;ever&quot;. Like &quot;Ĉi&quot;, it can be used before or after '''ti-''' and '''ĉi-''' words.
*Kiam ajn - Whenever 
*Kiu ajn - Whoever

==Words Changing Part of Speech==
===Verbs and Adjectives to Nouns===
In lesson one, we learned that nouns end in '''-o''', adjectives end in '''-a''', adverbs end in '''-e''', and that verbs (by default) end in '''-i'''. The reason for this is to make it easy to change one type of word, its '''part of speech''', to another type. For example, &quot;viro&quot; means &quot;man&quot;, and &quot;vira&quot; means &quot;manly&quot;. At the same time, an adjective such as &quot;happy&quot; (&quot;feliĉa&quot;) can be changed to &quot;happily&quot; (&quot;feliĉe&quot;) by doing nothing more than changing the final -a to an -e.

It is also possible to change both adjectives and verbs into nouns.

;Verb to Noun:This, of course, is accomplished by replacing the final '''-i''' with an '''-o'''. The meaning of the noun now refers to an event. For example, if &quot;kuri&quot; means &quot;to run&quot; and &quot;kuro&quot; means &quot;a run&quot;, then &quot;kuro&quot; can be used in the sentence &quot;that was a good run.&quot;
;Adjectives to Noun:As you can assume, adjectives become nouns by changing '''-a''' to '''-o'''. A noun formed from an adjective refers to someone or something which the original adjective could refer to. For example, if there is a person who is &quot;feliĉa&quot; (&quot;happy&quot;), that person could be refered to as a &quot;feliĉ'''o'''&quot;. This might be helpful in a sentence such as this: &quot;I saw a '''happy boy''' and a sad boy, and '''the happy [one]''' was standing.&quot; Translated, &quot;Mi vidis '''feliĉan knabon''' kaj malfeliĉan knabon, kaj '''la feliĉo''' staris.&quot;

===Participles to Nouns and Adverbs===
Furthermore, participles are not limited to only be adjectives. They can also be used as nouns and adverbs by replacing the final '''-a''' with '''-o''' or '''-e''', respectively.
;Adjective to Noun:Nouns formed from adjective participles refer to somebody who does the action of the respective verb, or has it done to them. In English, these words typically end in &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;-ed&quot;. Like adjective participles, English only has two direct translations of these words, those ending in &quot;-anto&quot; and those ending in &quot;-ito&quot;.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! !! Present !! Past !! Future
|-
|Active ||style=&quot;background-color:#FFFF99&quot;| -anto&lt;br/&gt;(verb'er) || -into&lt;br/&gt;(was-verb'er) || -onto&lt;br/&gt;(will-be-verb'er)
|-
|Passive || -ato&lt;br/&gt;(being-verb'ed) ||style=&quot;background-color:#FFFF99&quot;| -ito&lt;br/&gt;(verb'ed) || -oto&lt;br/&gt;(will-be-being-verb'ed)
|}

Examples include &quot;kuranto&quot;, for &quot;runner&quot;, and &quot;haketito&quot; for &quot;[the] chopped [thing]&quot;. Because the other four forms have imperfect translations, they will have to be rephrased when translated into English.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Esperanto !! Rough English !! Rephrased English
|-
| Kuronto falos. || The ''will-be-runner'' will fall. || The ''person who will be running'' will fall.
|-
| Arbo haketata alta estas. || The ''being-chopped'' tree is tall. || The tree ''which is being chopped'' is tall.
|}

;Adjective to Adverb:Adverbs formed from adjective participles describe an event taking place during, before, or after the main verb of a sentence. They tell when or why the main verb took, is taking, or will take place. This is best explained by examples.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Esperanto !! English
|-
| Al la vendejo kurinte, mi aĉetis ion. || Having run to the store, I bought something.
|-
| Pordon malfermonte, li la lumon elŝaltis. || Before opening the door, he turned off the light.
|-
| Mortigite, soldato entombigas estis. || Having been killed, the soldier was buried.
|-
| En Eŭropo alvenante, ŝi pretiĝas eliri el la aeroplano. || Because she is about to arrive at Europe, she is getting ready to exit the plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A laser is a device that can produce a bright beam of colored light that is focused on a spot. Normally a light bulb glows white because it gives off light in every color we can see. It does so by heating up a strand of wire until it glows. The laser works very differently, so it can make a very narrow beam with only a single color. Laser is an '''acronym''' for &lt;u&gt;Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation&lt;/u&gt;

==Who invented it?==
The ideas that led to the invention of the laser were discovered by Albert Einstein in 1916. But it was not until 1953 that these ideas were put into use. The first laser was actually called a maser, because it used microwaves. (This is the same type of energy that is used in a microwave oven). Charles Townes and two of his students made the first maser, but it would only work for short amounts of time. Two scientists from the Soviet Union (Russia) named Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov figured out how to make the maser stay on. These three men won a Nobel Prize in 1964 for their discovery.

The first idea for a laser came from Charles Townes and Arthur Schawlow. Gordon Gould worked on the idea and wrote them down in a paper in 1959. This paper was the first time the word laser was used.

The first working laser was invented by Theodore Maiman and demonstrated on May 16, 1960.

==How does it get power? ==
A laser is powered by electricity. The electric current gives it the energy it needs to emit light.

==How does it work?==

The name of the laser is an acronym that comes from first letters of the name, &quot;Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation&quot;. This is just a way of saying that a bright beam of light is created by pumping energy into a material. The energy radiation goes into the material from an outside source and pumps up or excites the material. The atoms in the material go into an excited/fast-moving state by absorbing this energy.

A single packet of light is called a ''photon''. This word comes from the Greek name for light. When photon of a certain color passes an excited atom, it causes that atom to release a photon of the same color. So the total light becomes slightly brighter and the photons keep moving through the material. As it does so, it passes other excited atoms. These also emit photons of the same color. As a result the light is amplified/brightened, creating a bright laser beam of a single color.

The beam of light causes all the excited atoms to give off their energy as photons. Normally all the light would travel away until they are absorbed by a barrier. However if more energy is pumped into the material, it will keep the laser beam turned on.

A laser is made with a mirror at each end of the material. The light photons will bounce back and forth between these mirrors, causing more photons to be emitted.

===Ruby Lasers===
(see discussion page about additions below)
====The Parts====
Some lasers only have diodes.It is cut in half so you can see its parts. The picture below shows a  laser diode,similar to light emitting diode.
  
[[File:LED, 5mm, green (en).png|left|thumb|200px|Cut-away view of a  laser diode.]]

 The picture below shows a ruby laser..  The first working laser was a ruby laser, and it was invented in 1960.

It is cut in half so you can see its parts.  The shiny red tube at the centre is a ruby crystal.  That's where the laser beam will come from when the laser is switched on.

[[File:Ruby laser main.png|left|thumb|345px|Cut-away view of a ruby laser.]]

If you look closely at the picture, you will see that there are two round mirrors, one attached to each end of the ruby crystal.  The mirror at the far end is called a &quot;fully reflecting mirror&quot;.  All the light reaching this type of mirror bounces back off it again.

The mirror at the near end of the crystal is called a &quot;partially reflecting mirror&quot;.  This type of mirror reflects most of the light, but some of the light can pass through it.

A tube made of quartz is coiled around the ruby crystal.  It is called a &quot;quartz flash tube&quot;, and each end of it is connected to a power supply, forming an electric circuit.  In the picture above, we made the quartz flash tube see-through, so you can get a better view of the crystal.

All of these parts are inside an aluminium cylinder.  The cylinder is highly polished, like a curved mirror.

====Switching it on====
When the electric power supply is switched on, a current flows through the quartz flash tube, and it gives off a very bright burst of light.  The reflecting cylinder around the flash tube helps to focus all that light onto the ruby crystal.

[[File:Ruby laser quartz light.png|thumb|500px|Quartz flash tube lights up.]]

====What happens inside the crystal?====
Like everything else, the ruby crystal is made of atoms. A real atom is so tiny, you can't see it, even with a very powerful microscope.  They are much bigger in this picture so you can see them:

[[File:Ruby laser atoms.png|thumb|376px|Atoms in the ruby crystal]]

The light from the quartz flash tube hits the atoms in the crystal.  Some of the atoms absorb the light, giving them more energy.  They are said to be in a &quot;higher energy level&quot;.  To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they got from the light.  They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a &quot;photon&quot;.  Scientists call this process &quot;stimulated emission of radiation&quot; because the atoms are '''stimulated''' by the bright light, causing the '''emission''' of a photon of light, and light is a type of '''radiation'''.  The next picture shows the atoms emitting photons.

[[File:Ruby laser photons.png|thumb|376px|Ruby atoms emitting photons]]

Of course, in reality photons are a lot smaller than those in the picture.  Photons are even smaller than the stuff that makes up atoms!

====Where do the photons go?====
When they are emitted from the atoms, the photons of light shoot off in all directions.
[[File:Ruby laser photons all dirs.png|left|thumb|177px|Photons shooting off]]
Sometimes they pass close to another atom, and when that happens, the other atom might emit a photon too.

[[File:Ruby laser photons pass.png|thumb|177px|Photons causing emission of more photons]]

And if the photon from the other atom passes yet another atom, that atom might also emit a photon.  So the number of photons increases very quickly, and the inside of the laser becomes very bright and hot. A water cooling system keeps it from overheating.

[[File:Ruby laser photons many.png|thumb|376px|Lots of photons]]

====How is the laser beam formed?====
When the photons of light hit the mirrors, they are reflected back off them.  Many of the photons will bounce back and forth between the mirrors, passing atoms on the way, and causing yet more photons to be emitted.  Scientists call this &quot;light amplification&quot;, because the '''light''' (made of photons) is '''amplified''' (made brighter).

With so many photons whizzing back and forth between the mirrors, many of them escape from the crystal through the partially reflective mirror at the front.  We have shown some of these photons in the picture below.

[[File:Ruby laser photons escape.png|thumb|376px|Photons escaping through the front mirror]]

The laser beam is made of many millions of these photons, escaping from the crystal through the front mirror.

[[File:Ruby laser beam.png|thumb|400px|The laser beam]]

The whole process, from flicking the switch to the laser beam appearing, happens in the blink of an eye.

==How dangerous is it?==
The light from a laser beam can become very bright. If it has enough energy, this beam can cause damage to the eyes. You should not look directly into a laser beam. When scientists work with very powerful lasers, they must wear safety goggles over their eyes to avoid injury. Even a weak laser beam can damage the eyes when it is seen directly for a long time.

==What does it do?==
A photon of light moves through space like a wave. Just like a wave moving across water, oscillating up and down, a light wave has a rate at which it vibrates. This rate is called the ''frequency'', and it is the rate of vibration that determines the color we see.

A normal light bulb will emit many photons of light at various frequencies. As a result, we see the light from the bulb as white. A laser, however, only emits photons with a single frequency. Such light is called ''monochromatic'', a word that means ''single color''.

Much as a company of soldiers on parade all step at the same time, the photons from a laser are also moving in lock-step with each other. This is called ''coherence''. It is a very useful property of a laser because of the way that waves interact with each other. It is this property of coherence, for example, that allows lasers to make ''holograms'', which are pictures that can make a three-dimensional image.

Finally the light from a laser is all moving in the same direction. The light from a flashlight (British English: ''torch'') comes out in a cone shape, and the brightness of the beam decreases the further away you get. But the tight beam from a laser will stay bright over much longer distances.

These three properties of a laser: monochromatic, coherence and a tight beam, are useful in many applications. Lasers are now being used in a great variety of devices. (See &quot;How has it changed the world?&quot; below for a list of examples.)

==How does it vary?==
Lasers can differ from one another in the frequency of light they emit. The frequency depends on the types of materials used to make the laser. This is caused by differences in the properties of the atoms.

Lasers can also vary in the brightness, or ''intensity'', of the beam of light they emit. The weakest lasers are fairly harmless and can be used in a classroom to point to locations on a projector screen. Some of the most powerful lasers can quickly cut through solid rock or metal sheets.

There are several different types of lasers. The material used to create the beam can be a solid, such as a piece of ruby. Some liquids and gasses can also be used to make a laser. Lasers can also be made out of similar materials as those used to make computer chips. Those are called ''semiconductor'' materials because of their electrical properties.

==How has it changed the world?==
[[File:Starfire Optical Range - three lasers into space.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Astronomers use lasers to fix blur from the Earth's thick atmosphere.]]
Lasers are very useful devices and they have been included in many devices. A material called optical fiber can be used to guide the light from a laser, and it is used to let computers talk to each other. Lasers are also used in CD and DVD drives to read the small pits on a disk.

Laser light travels in a very straight line. Straight beams of light can be used for measuring long distances and for keeping things lined up when building bridges and buildings. Soldiers use lasers to guide a rocket to a target.

Stronger lasers can be used to cut through hard metals. They are used for very fine surgery, such as fixing an eye that can not see well. They can be used to remove a tattoo or a birthmark.

==What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created?==
In order to create the laser, scientists had to explain how the atom worked. They had to come up with the theory called &quot;quantum mechanics&quot;, which says that light and other very small particles all come in packets called ''quanta''. This word comes from the Latin &quot;quantum&quot;, which means how much.

The theory of quantum mechanics says that an atom can only store energy of certain amounts. Inside an atom are tiny negative particles called electrons that can absorb energy. When an electron receives just the right amount of energy, it can jump up to a higher level. By doing so it enters an excited state, which means it has more energy. Later the electron can release this energy, dropping back down to a lower, less excited state.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Integral=

What we introduced last time:

&lt;math&gt;L(f) = sup_P L(P,f)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;U(f) = inf_P U(P,f)&lt;/math&gt;

Are actually known as the lower and upper integrals respectively.  Both are simultaneously the integral provided that the function that they are built from satisfy the following condition, the definition of integrability (but not the integrability criterion).

''A bounded function f on [a,b] is integrable if L(f)=U(f)''.

And that's all the integral really is!

==Yet ANOTHER return of that summing exercise==

This is just a quick little question, probably trivial.  What does this mean for f(x)=x?

=Integrability=

As previously defined we can prove the integrability of a function by noting that U(f)=L(f)

However, there is a much more useful way to prove that a function, or an entire class of functions, is integrable.  This is the theorem called the Integrability Criterion:

''A bounded function &lt;math&gt;f:  [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is integrable on [a,b] iff for all &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0 there exists a partition P of [a,b] such that U(P,f) - L(P,f) &lt; &amp;epsilon;''

You'll notice that it has properties similar to the definition of the limit.

Since this is a proof of necessity assume that f is integrable on [a,b].  Let &amp;epsilon; &gt;0 be given and say &lt;math&gt;I= \int_a^b f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;.  Also &lt;math&gt;I = inf_Q U(Q,f) = sup_R L(R,f)&lt;/math&gt;.  Now by the approximation property there exists a partition Q such that U(Q,f) &lt; I + &amp;epsilon;/2 and a partition R such that L(R,f) &gt; I - &amp;epsilon;/2.  If we take the refinement &lt;math&gt;P = Q \sup R&lt;/math&gt; and apply the properties of refinement that we proved before:

U(P,f) &lt; I + &amp;epsilon;/2

and

L(P,f) &gt; I - &amp;epsilon;/2

We can manipulate this to:

U(P,f) - L(P,f) &lt; &amp;epsilon;

Now for the proof to finish up the biconditional.....

==Integrability criterion proof==

You do it.  If for all &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0 there exists a partition P of [a,b] such that U(P,f) - L(P,f) &lt; &amp;epsilon; then f is integrable on [a,b].  Some hints:  show that it implies U(f) - L(f) &lt; &amp;epsilon; for all &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0 then show this is so only if U(f)=L(f).

==1. Give the order, and the scientific name of the family, to which the antelope belong.==

|-
!style=&quot;background:#d0d080&quot;|Family
!style=&quot;background:#d0d080&quot;|Bovidae
|}
The '''artiodactyla''' are the even-toed ungulates (that is, animals with hooves and an even number of toes).  

A '''bovid''' is any of almost 140 species of cloven-hoofed mammals belonging to the family Bovidae. The family is widespread, being native to all continents except Australia and Antarctica, and diverse: members include buffalo, bison, antelopes, gazelles, and both wild and domesticated cattle, sheep, goats, and water buffalo.

==2. Give the distinguishing characteristics of the different sub-families, with examples of each.==
===Bovinae===
{{Antelope sub-family
|latin_name = Bovinae
|common_name = cattle and spiral-horned antelopes
|image = Water buffalo bathing.jpg
| num_genera = 9
| num_species = 24
| characteristics = General characteristics include a cloven hoof and usually at least one of the sexes of a species having a true horn.
}}
===Cephalophinae===
{{Antelope sub-family
|latin_name = Cephalophinae
|common_name = Duiker
|image = Common Duiker1.jpg
| num_genera = 2
| num_species = 19
| characteristics =
With a slightly arched body and the front legs a little shorter than the hind legs, they are well-shaped to penetrate thickets. They are primarily browsers rather than grazers, eating leaves, shoots, seeds, fruit, buds and bark, and often follow flocks of birds or troops of monkeys to take advantage of the fruit they drop. They supplement their diet with meat: duikers take insects and carrion from time to time, and even stalk and capture rodents or small birds.
}}
===Hippotraginae===
{{Antelope sub-family
|latin_name = Hippotraginae
|common_name = grazing antelopes
|image = Sable bull.jpg
| num_genera = 5
| num_species = 6
| characteristics = These grass-eaters form small groups of both males and females.
}}

===Antilopinae===
{{Antelope sub-family
|latin_name = Antilopinae
|common_name = Gazelles, dwarf antelopes and the saiga
|image = Hirschziegenantilope2.JPG
| num_genera = 14
| num_species = 38
| characteristics =See requirement 8 for distinguishing characteristics.
}}

===Caprinae===
{{Antelope sub-family
|latin_name = Caprinae
|common_name = Sheep and goats
|image = Sheep and goats.jpg
| num_genera = 12
| num_species = 26
| characteristics =In lifestyle, the caprids fall into two broad classes, resource-defenders which are territorial and defend a small, food-rich area against other members of the same species, and grazers, which gather together into herds and roam freely over a larger, usually relatively infertile area.

The resource-defenders are the more primitive group: they tend to be smaller in size, dark in color, males and females fairly alike, have long, tassellated ears, a long mane, and dagger-shaped horns. The grazers tend to be larger, highly social, and rather than mark territory with scent glands, they have exhibit dominance behaviors. There is no sharp dividing line between the groups, but a continuum between the serows at one end of the spectrum and sheep, true goats, and musk oxen at the other.
}}

===Reduncinae===
{{Antelope sub-family
|latin_name = Reduncinae
|common_name = Reedbucks, lechwe
|image = Uganda-Kob.jpg
| num_genera = 2
| num_species = 8
| characteristics = The reduncinae dwell in marshes, floodplains or other well-watered areas.
}}

===Aepycerotinae===
{{Antelope sub-family
|latin_name = Aepycerotinae
|common_name = Impala
|image = Black-faced impala.jpg
| num_genera = 1
| num_species = 1
| characteristics =They are reddish-brown in color with lighter flanks, have white underbellies and a characteristic &quot;M&quot; marking on its rear.  They can adapt to different environment by being grazers in some areas and browsers in others. They graze when the grass is green and growing and browse at other times. They will browse on formcsgaybs, shoots, seedpods and foliage.
}}

===Peleinae===
{{Antelope sub-family
|latin_name = Peleinae
|common_name = Grey Rhebok
|image = Vaal Rhebok.jpg
| num_genera = 1
| num_species = 1
| characteristics =They prefer grassy, montane habitat, and carry a woolly grey coat to insulate them from the cold of their habitat. Only the males carry the straight horns. Males become extremely aggressive during the breeding season.
}}

===Panthalopinae===
{{Antelope sub-family
|latin_name = Panthalopinae
|common_name = Tibetan antelope
|image = 
| num_genera = 1
| num_species = 1
| characteristics =Tibetan antelope are gregarious, sometimes congregating in herds hundreds strong. The females migrate up to 300 km yearly to calving grounds in the summer where they usually give birth to a single calf, and rejoin the males at the wintering grounds in late autumn
}}

===Alcelaphinae===
{{Antelope sub-family
|latin_name = Alcelaphinae
|common_name = Wildbeest, Hartebeest, Bonteboks
|image = Damaliscus lunatus.jpg
| num_genera = 4
| num_species = 7
| characteristics = These diurnal antelopes inhabit the plains and open woodlands of Africa, especially the Serengeti.  The seasonal nature of the African grasslands forces wildebeest to make annual migrations. The main migration is in May, when around 1.5 million animals move from the plains to the woods; they return in November as summer rains water the plains.
}}

==3. Which large antelope differs from most of the others in appearance? What are some of its peculiar habits?==
[[Image:Gnou Thoiry 19803.jpg|thumb|450px|The ''wildebeest'', also known as the ''gnu''.]]
The wildebeest is the most unique looking antelope.  It has a beefy muscular front-heavy appearance with a distinctive robust muzzle, it strides with relatively slender legs and moves gracefully and quietly most of the time, belying the reputation for stampeding in herds; however the stampeding characteristic may sometimes be observed.  Probably the most conspicuous feature of the Blue Wildebeest are the large horns shaped like parentheses, extending outward to the side and then curving up and inward.  The manes appear long, stiff, thick and jet black, a color assumed by the tail and face as well.

Blue Wildebeests can tolerate arid regions, as long as a potable water supply is available. Since all Wildebeests require a long drink every day or two, they must have water within about 15 or 25 kilometers distance. Their blunt muzzles are best equipped for biting short green grasses, since a wide incisor row prevents more selective feeding. Short grasses of these type are usually only found on alkaline or volcanic soils.

The Serengeti herds are purely migratory and abandon the usual plains after the rainy season has ended, in order to seek higher grasses in wetter areas. Grasslands bordering alkaline lakes or pans are particularly choice dry season (winter) habitats. Herds may be mixed gender with a dominant male, female only or bachelor only. Blue Wildebeest often graze together with other species such as Plains zebras for purposes of mutual protection. Zebras in particular are beneficial to co-exist with since they mow down highly vegetated areas leaving the wildebeests to eat the newly exposed and more nutritional short grasses, which is what they prefer. A Blue Wildebeest can attain a speed of up to 65 kilometers per hour.

==4. What is the function of musk glands in the antelopes? Where are these glands situated on the gregarious types? On the solitary types?==
Musk glands secrete a substance with a penetrating odor called (what else?) ''musk''.  The purpose of musk is to attract a mate.  On the gregarious types of anteloope, the musk glands are located on the face beneath the eyes.  On the solitary types, it is within a sac located between the genitals and the umbilicus (belly button).

==5. Which species could you expect to find in:==
===a. Bush, or reed beds, near water?===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Southafrica-capegrysbok.jpg|Grysbok
Image:Redunca fulvorufula.jpg|Mountain Reedbuck
Image:Topi rwanda.jpg|Topi
Image:Kobus ellipsiprymnus.JPG|Waterbuck
&lt;/gallery&gt;
;Grysbok: The Cape Grysbok's native habitat is the &quot;Fynbos biome&quot; (Cape Floristic Region), and it inhabits thick shrubland. It can sometimes be found browsing orchards and vineyards. It may also be found in reed beds and along the riverbed of the southern Karoo.
;Reedbuck: Three species of Reedbuck are native to central Africa, mostly living in grassland areas near water. 
;Topi: The Topi is a savannah and floodplain antelope.
;Waterbuck: Waterbuck are found in scrub and savanna areas near water where they eat grass. Despite its name, the waterbuck does not spend much time in the water, but will take refuge there to escape predators.

===b. Arid regions?===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Amnh fg02.jpg|Oryx
Image:Addax.jpg|Addax
Image:Springbok.JPG|Springbok
&lt;/gallery&gt;
;Oryx: All oryx species prefer near-desert conditions and can survive without water for long periods.
;Addax: The Addax (''Addax nasomaculatus'') is a critically endangered desert antelope that lives in several isolated regions in the Sahara desert.
;Springbok: In South Africa springbok inhabit the vast grasslands of the Freestate and the open shrublands of the greater and smaller Karoo. In Namibia they live in the grasslands of the south, the kalahari desert to the east and the dry riverbeds of the northern bushveld of the Windhoek region. In Botswana they mostly live in the Kalahari Desert in the southwestern and central parts of the country.

===c. Open plains?===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Blackbuck male female.jpg|Blackbuck
Image:Springbok.JPG|Springbok
Image:Thomsons-gazelle.jpg|Thompson's Gazelle
Image:Dik-dik.jpg|Dik-dik
&lt;/gallery&gt;
;Blackbuck: On the open plain, the Blackbuck is one of the fastest animals and can outrun most predators over long distances.
;Springbok: Springbok live in many habitats.
;Gazelles: Gazelles are mostly found in the grasslands and savannas of Africa
;Dik-dik: Dik-diks live in open plains amongst other grass-eaters such as giraffes, zebras, and other antelopes. Dik-diks may live in places as varied as dense forest or open plain, but they must have good cover and not too much tall grass or plants.

===d. Scrub and forest areas?===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Common Duiker1.jpg|Common Duiker
Image:Sable bull.jpg|Sable Antelope
Image:Dik-dik.jpg|Dik-dik
&lt;/gallery&gt;
;Duikers: Duikers are shy and elusive creatures with a fondness for dense cover; most are forest dwellers and even the species living in more open areas are quick to disappear into thickets.
;Sable Antelope: Sable Antelope live in wooded savannah where they eat mid-length grass and leaves.
;Dik-dik: See above under &quot;open plains&quot;.

===e. The vicinity of rocky kopjes, or on hillsides?===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Oreotragus oreotragus (2).jpg|Klipspringer
&lt;/gallery&gt;
;Chiru: Chirus live on the high mountain steppes and semi-desert areas of the Tibetan plateau such as Kekexili.
;Klipspringer: With a thick and dense speckled &quot;salt and pepper&quot; patterned coat of an almost olive shade, Klipspringers blend in well with the koppies (rock outcrops, pronounced &quot;copies&quot;) on which they can usually be found.

==6. Describe the horns, in both sexes of each species, of 15 different antelopes. What is the structure of these horns? Are there any deer in South Africa? What is the structure of their horns?==
&lt;gallery caption=&quot;Antelope Horns&quot; numcol=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Image:Oryx Gazella Namibia horns.JPG|'''Oryx:''' Narrow, and straight except in the scimitar oryx, where they curve backwards like a scimitar.  Similar in males and in females.
Image:Aepyceros melampus petersi horns.jpg|'''Impala:''' Males have lyre-shaped horns which can reach up to 90 centimeters in length.
Image:Kobus_ellipsiprymnus_horns.jpg|'''Waterbuck:''' The long spiral structured horns, found only in males, sweep back and up.
Image:Sable bull horns.jpg|'''Sable Antelope:''' Have ringed horns which arch backward, in females these can reach a meter, but in males they can reach over one and a half meters.
Image:Thomsons-gazelle horns.jpg|'''Thompsons Gazelle:''' Long and pointed with slight curvature.
Image:Topi rwanda horns.jpg|'''Tsessebe:''' The horns are lyre-shaped and are conspicuously ringed and can reach 70 centimetres in both sexes. 
Image:Hippotragus equinus cottoni horns.jpg|'''Roan antelope:'''ringed and can reach a metre long in males, slightly shorter in females. They arch backwards slightly.
Image:Addax horns.jpg|'''Addax:''' Found on both males and females, the horns have two twists and can reach 80 centimeters in females and 120 centimeters in males.
Image:Common Duiker1 horns.jpg|'''Common duiker:''' The male bears horns which can grow to 4.25 inches (11 cm) long.
Image:Dik-dik horns.jpg|'''Dik-dik:''' The males have horns, which are small (about 3 in or 7.5 cm), slanted backwards.  The females do not have horns.
Image:Klipspringer horns.jpg|'''Klipspringer:''' Only the males have horns that are usually about 20-25cm (4-6 inches) long. 
Image:Kob_horns.jpg|'''Kob:''' The short ringed horns, found only in males, are around 50 centimetres in length and arch out slightly so that they are somewhat 'S' shaped in profile.
Image:BlackbuckAntelope2 horns.jpg|'''Blackbuck:''' The horns of the Blackbuck are ringed with 3 to 4 turns and can be as long as 28 inches. The female is usually hornless.
Image:Gnu horns.jpg|'''Wildebeest:''' Shaped like parentheses, extending outward to the side and then curving up and inward. In the male the horns can attain a total span of almost 90 centimeters, while the female's horn width is about half the size of the male. These cow-like horns of both sexes are somewhat broad at the base and are without ridges. The male horns have a boss-like structure joining the two horns.
Image:Springbok horns.jpg|'''Springbok:''' Rams have thick horns, the ewes tend to have more frail horns. Average horn length for both genders is 35 cm.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Image:Dama dama8.JPG|thumb|Male fallow deer with antlers]]
Though there are no native deer in South Africa, the Europeans imported the fallow deer during colonial times.  Deer have antlers rather than horns.  While an antler is growing it is covered with highly vascular skin called velvet, which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing bone; once the antler has achieved its proper size, the velvet is lost and the antler's bone dies. This dead bone structure is the mature antler. Antlers shed after each mating season.  Horns are not shed, but are permanent fixtures on the animal's head.  Rather than a velvet covering, horns are covered with keratin (the same thing fingernails are made of).

==7. Name at least 20 species of antelope that you have observed and can identify out-of-doors, not more than 5 of which are in captivity.==
Now you know why this honor is specific to the East-Africa Division.  Bovids are most plentiful in Africa, but there are at least five wild species in North America:
#Mountain Goat (''Oreamnos americanus'')
#Bighorn Sheep (''Ovis canadensis'')
#Dall Sheep (''Ovis dalli'') including the two sub-species
##Dall Sheep (''Ovis dalli dalli'')
##Stone's Sheep (''Ovis dalli stonei'')
#Muskox (''Ovibos moschatus'')
#American Bison (''Bison bison'')
*'''The pronghorn antelope (''Antilocapra americana'') is not a member of the bovid family!'''

Of course, domestic bovids are plentiful in North America, as they include goats, sheep, and cattle.  Though none of the animals we have listed in this requirement so far are antelopes, keep in mind that there is no scientific distinction between antelopes and other bovids.  Basically, if a bovid is not an ox, goat, or sheep, then it is considered an antelope.  

For those outside Africa trying to earn this honor, it might be appropriate to ignore this distinction (it is, after all, quite arbitrary and unscientific).  Even with the expanded definition, those living in the NAD are still left with a major problem - the wild North American bovids are relatively rare, and pretty much limited to the West.  Some of them are quite elusive.  Spotting all of them in the wild would be quite a feat indeed.  Spotting 20 antelopes in captivity can be easily accomplished by visiting a large zoo (or by visiting multiple, smaller zoos).  

A possible alternative for those living outside Africa is to study the antelopes prior to a zoo visit.  Then keep track of how many antelopes you can correctly identify by observing the animal (rather than the placard outside its enclosure).  As the instructor of this honor, if you cannot find a way to meet this requirement, you should substitute something else that would require an ''equivalent effort'' if you lived in Africa.  Please do not just waive the requirement.

==8. What is a gazelle? Where would you find this animal?==
A [[W:gazelle|gazelle]] is an antelope of the genus ''Gazella'', but there are also three members of the genus ''Procapra'' that are also referred to as gazelles. Gazelles are known as swift animals; they are able to reach high speeds (about {{units|56 km/hour|35 miles/hour}}) for long periods (15 minutes) of time. Gazelles are mostly found in the grasslands and savannas of Africa, but they are also found in southwest Asia. They tend to live in herds and will eat less coarse, easily digestible plants and leaves.

==9. Name some diseases associated with wild bovies. How are they transmitted? Of what economic importance are they to man?==
;Foot-and-mouth disease: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD, Latin binomial ''Aphtae epizooticae''), sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease, is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cattle and pigs. It can also infect deer, goats, sheep, and other bovids with cloven hooves, as well as elephants, rats, and hedgehogs. Humans are very rarely affected.

:Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease have resulted in the slaughter of millions of domestic animals, despite this being a frequently non-fatal disease for adult animals (2-5% mortality), though young animals can have a high mortality. The destruction of animals is primarily to halt further spread, as growth and milk production may be permanently affected, even in animals that have recovered.

;Sleeping Sickness: Sleeping sickness is a parasitic disease in people and animals, caused by protozoa of genus ''Trypanosoma'' and transmitted by the tsetse fly.  Bovids are susceptible to the disease, and serve as a reservoir for the parasite.  Even when the disease is eliminated from the human population, humans can be reinfected when the tsetse fly transfers the parasite from the bovids to people.

;Bovine malignant catarrhal fever: Bovine malignant catarrhal fever (BMCF) is a disease caused by alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1) of the family Herpesviridae. The disease is fatal in cattle and other ruminants such as deer, antelope, and buffalo.  In Africa, wildebeests carry AlHV-1 but are not affected by the disease. It is passed from mother to offspring and shed in the nasal secretions of wildebeest calves. Cattle are infected by contact with the secretions, but do not spread the disease to other cattle. Hartebeests and topi also may carry the disease.

==10. Know the game laws of your province.==
Remember that this honor is specific to the East Africa Division, so when this requirement asks you for the game laws of ''your'' province, it assumes an African province.  If you do not live in Africa, it should suffice to know the game laws of any African province where antelopes are common.

In South Africa foreigners are not allowed to hunt except when they have hired a licensed professional hunter as a guide.  The client and the guide must enter into a written contract prior to the commencement of the hunt, and the professional hunter must be licensed in every territory where the hunt takes place.

Hunting in South Africa is allowed year-round, but mostly it is done from June until August.  Foreigners may use a rifle provided by the guide, or they may bring their own.  If they opt to bring their own, they must declare it to customs when entering the country, and they must take it with them again when they leave.  The gun must be marked with a serial number, and the hunter must be able to prove that he owns the rifle.

==1. a. Name five different methods of Bible Marking.&lt;br&gt;b. Explain how each method would be used.&lt;br&gt;c. List advantages and disadvantages of each.==
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Bible Marking Method
|method = Chain Reference
|description=&lt;br&gt;
In this method, you first choose a topic and come up with a very short ''key'' for it.  For instance, &quot;Salvation by Grace&quot; might become &quot;SbG&quot; or even &quot;SG&quot;.  Then you find a blank page either near the front or near the back of your Bible and write the title, the key, and the first reference, such as ''Col 2:14''.  You then turn to that reference in the Bible, and in the margin near the first reference, you write the key plus the reference to the next verse.  Continue doing this until you annotate the final verse with the key and the letter &quot;F&quot; (for &quot;final&quot;).
|advantages=&lt;br&gt;
# You can give a quick Bible study &quot;on the spot.&quot;
# It's a good way to become familiar with the Bible.
# It's an effective way to become familiar with a topic.
# You can buy preprinted sheets of stickers for the references on certain topics.
|disadvantages=&lt;br&gt;
# You cannot change the order of study.
# If you lose your place, you have to start over from the beginning.
# Sometimes the pre-printed stickers can fall out.
}}

{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Bible Marking Method
|method =Color Code
|description=&lt;br&gt;
Choose a color for the topic.  As you read your Bible, when you come across a passage having to do with that topic, you mark a line down the margin starting where that topic begins, and ending where the topic ends.  If the passage has a subheading and the entire passage has to do with the topic, underline the subheading with that color.
|advantages=&lt;br&gt;
#Good for ongoing study of the Bible.
#Colors stand out.
#Gives a good overview of a topic.
|disadvantages=&lt;br&gt;
#The number of distinct colors will limit the number of topics you can mark.
#You have to have the right color marker with you when you come across a reference.
#Too many colors or an overmarked Bible will render the annotations useless.
#Not good for a sequential study - such as where a prophecy is made and where its fulfillment is recorded.
}}
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Bible Marking Method
|method =Cross Reference
|description =&lt;br&gt;
1. Where you have found two or more texts speaking about the same subject you can, alongside one of these texts, in the margin, write the reference to those other texts. Then go to those other texts and write the reference of the first text.
2. If it is to do with only a word or a phrase from the text that you wish to support from other texts, then place an &quot;R&quot; alongside that word or phrase.
|advantages=&lt;br&gt;
# Can be added to.
# Not limited by subjects.
# Quick support for a difficult text.
|disadvantages=&lt;br&gt;
# Limited by space in margin for reference.
# You need to know where to start.
# Hard to follow through a complete study.
|comments=&lt;br&gt;
Many Bible's have this type of reference in them when printed.
}}

{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Bible Marking Method
|method =Highlighting or Underlining
|description=&lt;br&gt;
# Emphasize just one word or phrase in the section. Just enough to make the thought that you want to stand out.
# This can be done in a number of ways:
## A neat line under the word - preferably in a color to suit your total marking system.
## Keep a pencil or fine biro - only one color just for underlining.
## If you are very neat and careful, a very effective way is to just write over the letters to thicken them a little BUT test the steadiness of your hand and the suitability of the pen on something first.
|advantages=&lt;br&gt;
# Reminds you of important part of the text.
# It makes that part stand out.
|disadvantages=&lt;br&gt;
# Too much, lessens the clarity of the text.
}}

{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Bible Marking Method
|method =Number Reference
|description =&lt;br&gt;
# When you have information about a word or passage that you cannot fit in the margin, highlight - underline or mark in an appropriate way to suit your system of marking.
# Then in the margin, place a number - that number will be the same as a number on a page in the back of your Bible.
# To know what that number should be, look at the last lot of information you put on that page and the number you put with it, the number is the next number. So if your last entry was 5, then this one would be 6.
# Put the reference for your text at the end of your information entry for cross reference.
|advantages=&lt;br&gt;
# Allows comment or explanation on a thought in greater detail.
# Helps to keep information about a word or passage from being forgotten.
|disadvantages=&lt;br&gt;
# Has a limited use.
}}

{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Bible Marking Method
|method =Subject Lists
|description =&lt;br&gt;
# On a page at the back of your Bible, make lists of texts under a subject heading.
# Leave plenty of room so you can keep adding extra texts you find as you read the Bible or listen to sermons.
# Add an extra page if you need to.
# A mark can be placed alongside the more suitable texts for the topic.
|advantages=&lt;br&gt;
# Good personal study.
# A quick source of references from which to pick for a study.
# Does not clutter the margin of your Bible.
|disadvantages=&lt;br&gt;
# It needs a reasonable amount of space in the back of your Bible.
}}

==2. List five guidelines you would consider before starting to mark your Bible.==
#Choose a Bible that suits your needs.  If you will need wide margins to write in the cross reference system OR if you need space to write notes for the number system, choose a Bible with wide margins.  
#Choose a method that suits your needs.It generally better to use only one method of marking in a Bible.  If you wish to try another method, use a different Bible.
#Choose a marker that will not bleed through the page.  If in doubt, make a small test mark before you begin, and make sure it does not show through on the other side of the page.
#Do not overmark your Bible.  Too many marks make it almost unreadable, so keep it simple.
#Do not use too many colors, but when using multiple colors, make sure they are distinct.
#Plan before you start, and have a definite aim in marking the Bible.
#Don't mark an heirloom Bible.  For instance, Gramma Tillie's Bible with her ancestry recorded within is not an appropriate choice for marking.  Get a new Bible if you need to.
#If there are not enough blank sheets at the end of your Bible, you can carefully add more by gluing them in.  Cut the paper to size, and use a ''little'' glue along its edge.  Then slide the glued edge as far back into the spine as you can get it.

==3. a. What method would you follow for giving a Bible study and why? &lt;br&gt;b. And mark your Bible for two topics/subjects using this method.==
These methods are good for sharing the Bible with another person:
*Chain Reference
*Subject Lists

==4. a. What methods would you use for ongoing devotional study and why? &lt;br&gt;b. And mark your Bible for two topics/subjects using one of these methods, and using a minimum of ten texts each.==
These methods are good for personal study
*Chain Reference
*Color Coding
*Cross Reference
*Subject Lists

The [[../Stewardship|Stewardship]] honor starts out with a nice Bible study.

'''Buttermilk''' is the liquid left over after producing [[cookbook:butter|butter]] from [[Cookbook:Milk|full-cream milk]] by the churning process. It has a slightly sour taste. Buttermilk may contain amounts of calcium from its dairy products, such as non-fat dry-milk powder.

'''Cultured buttermilk''' is buttermilk that has been [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] with [[w:Lactic acid bacteria|lactic acid bacteria]], much like [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]], giving it a tart (sour) taste. It is quite popular as a refreshment in India, made into a drink known as [[Cookbook:Lassi|lassi]].

Buttermilk is often used as an ingredient in [[Cookbook:Baking|baked goods]]. Some recipes using buttermilk are:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Skid Plates ==

The skids should be installed in the following order: transfer case skid, transmission skid, engine skid.  This rear to front ordering prevents the skid overlap from catching obstacles when driving forward.

=== Engine ===

The Jeep Liberty's OEM engine skid plate is strong but scrapes up a lot of dirt when off roading.  The Skid Row Front skid plate, constructed of 3/16&quot; steel, is a good replacement.  The Skid Row skid fits all 2002-present Libertys, including the CRD, and includes an engine oil filter drain hole.

=== Gas Tank ===

The Jeep Liberty's OEM gas tank skid plate is strong, but sometimes bends, causing the gas tank to crack.  The Skid Row Gas Tank skid plate, constructed of 3/16&quot; steel, is a good replacement.  The Skid Row skid is compatible with most hitch receivers and differential guards and includes a heat shield to protect the plastic gas tank from exhaust heat.  The Skid Row skid fits all 2002-present Libertys.  Rusty's Offroad also makes a gas tank skid for the Liberty.

=== Transfer Case ===

The Jeep Liberty's transfer case has an aluminum body and needs protection.  Fortunately, the OEM transfer case skid plate is plenty strong enough and probably won't need replacement.  The Skid Row Front Skid Plate and Rusty's Off Road Transfer Case Skid, both constructed of 3/16&quot; steel, are possible replacements.  The Skid Row skid fits all 2002-present Liberty's, including those with the NV242 transfer case, and includes a transfer case oil drain hole.

=== Transmission ===

The OEM transmission skid plate is the weakest of the Jeep Liberty's skids and should be replaced first.  The All J Products Super Skid, constructed of 1/4&quot; steel with formed sides, reinforcing ribs, and outriggers, is a very durable replacement.  Currently, the Super Skid comes in two different models: the Super Skid I fits 2002-2003 gas Libertys and all CRD Libertys, while the Super Skid II fits 2004-2006 Libertys.  The Skid Row Engine &amp; Transmission Skid Plate and Rusty's Offroad Engine Tranny Skid, both constructed of 3/16&quot; steel, are also good replacements.  The Skid Row skid fits all 2002-present Libertys, including the CRD, and includes an engine oil drain hole.

== Rock Rails ==

=== JCR Offroad Inc. ===

These sliders are designed for hardcore off-road abuse. The main tube is made with 3&quot;x2&quot; boxed tubing with a .188&quot; wall. Side tubes are 1.75&quot; x .125 wall (where applicable.) They bolt to the pinch seam with 5 bolts and the main legs off the sliders mount with 8 bolts to the uni-body. Giving you a total of 13 bolts PER SIDE!
Some drilling required, but easily installed. These sliders are created by professional fabricators; therefore the welds, fitment, and attention to detail are second to none.

=== All J Products Boulder Bars ===

=== Carolina Rock Shop Rock Rails ===

Carolina Rock Shop makes rock rails for the Jeep Liberty.  The CRS rock rails bolt to the unibody in three separate places, but do not bolt to the pinchweld.  For added strength and lower maintenance the rails can be welded rather than bolted directly to the unibody.  There is some concern as to whether these rails could be easily torn off as they don't have pinchweld bolts, but there is no evidence to confirm this.

=== Mopar Rock Rails ===

=== Rock Lizard Skink Sliders ===

Rock Lizard Fabrications produces the Standard Skink Slider and two different variations of it.  The Standard Skink Slider is the base rock rail without any extra features.  The Skink Step Slider extends three inches further from the body, thus allowing it to function as a step.  The Skink Super Slider has an added tube to protect the doors from trees and rocks.  The tube extends from the base rail to just past the plastic door trim.  All the Sliders bolt to the Liberty with two dual-arm three-bolt unibody mounts and one large seven-bolt pinch weld mount.  The arms extend from unibody mounts in a triangular fashion to reinforce the entire rail.  The rails are shipped bare and should be painted with a rust preventer before installation.  Powder coat is not recommended because it's more expensive and will only chip off when the rails come into contact with obstacles off road.

=== Rocky Road Outfitters Rock Rails ===

=== Rusty's Offroad - Rocker Panel Skids ===

== Bumpers ==

=== ARB Bull Bar ===

[[File:ARB Bullbar JeepLiberty 2005.JPG|thumb|right|ARB 2005-2007 Jeep Liberty Bullbar]]

ARB manufactures the most popular bull bar for the Jeep Liberty.  It features air bag approval, ventilation, recessed lamp and Hi-Lift provisions, tow points, and a grey powdercoat.  Inside, it supports a winch and factory foglights.  Outside, it supports lights, antennas, and off-road flags via four pre-drilled holes.  While the bull bar weighs less than 100 lbs, spacers or stiffer springs should be used in the front struts to counteract spring sag.  There are two versions, one for 2002-2004 Libertys and one for 2005-2007 Libertys.  The 2002-2004 model uses the factory turn signals, requires fender flare trimming, and supports the Warn HS9500, XD9000, M8000, and M6000 winches.  The 2005-2007 model uses new turn signals, doesn't require fender flare trimming, and supports the Warn XD9000, M8000, M6000, and 9.5XP winches.

Computer science is my highest degreed subject, my work was in image analysis, with a strong portion of machine learning, so I guess I'll be interested in helping with those topics.

From a general education standpoint, the teaching of math is an abiding interest of mine.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most televisions and other displays around today use cathode ray tubes (CRT) or liquid crystal diodes (LCD). The CRT television has three important parts. First is the cathode, which sends out a spray of electrons. Second are the focusing and deflecting coils, which shape that spray into a stream and then aim it at the third part, the screen, which has a phosphorus coating. The phosphorus lights up when it gets hit by electrons, and by lighting up different parts of the screen and leaving others dark, the CRT makes an image.

== Who invented it? ==

Several people contributed to the invention of television. Each person did a little at a time.

These three people seem to have been the major inventors:

Vladimir Kosma Zworykin developed a primitive television camera.

Philo Taylor Farnsworth was the first to successfully demonstrate the transmission of television signals.

John L Baird achieved the first transmissions of images of face shapes by means of television.

== How dangerous is it? ==

A very high voltage is needed to produce the energy needed to start and run a CRT and there is a risk of this high voltage causing severe electric shocks.

Televisions have many dangerous parts secured in a cabinet to prevent people from hurting themselves.

== What does it do? ==

A television is essentially a radio receiver with pictures. Signals similar to a radio's are received by the television antenna and sent to the receiver where they are sorted out.

Part of the signal is used to provide the sound you hear. Another part is used to create an image.

To get the image to appear like it is moving, thousands of still pictures are sent and displayed one right after another to give the impression that the image is actually moving. 

The first black and white televisions used a series of lines which were thick in some places and thin in others. If you looked very closely at a black and white television screen which was showing the letter &quot;A&quot;. It would appear like the image below.

     -----==-----
     ---==--==---
     --========--
     -==------==-
     ==--------==


Today, all color televisions display a series of dots which change color depending on the image being displayed. If you look very closely at this screen with a magnifying glass you will be able to see this.

== How does it vary? ==
There are many types of television sets. Some of them are explained below.

==== Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) ====
Cathode Ray Tube televisions have been around since the mid-1930s. The size of the screen is around 40 inches.

==== Rear Projection ====
Rear projection screens are usually quite large in comparison to other television sets. The video image is projected from inside the unit onto a mirror that reflects the image back to the screen. The size of the screen ranges from 50 inches to 73 inches. Rear projection television sets are also divided into many types of rear projection screens including CRT (three separate CRT projectors), DLP (Digital Light Processing), 3LCD (three LCD projectors), LCoS (Liquid Crystal over Silicon) and Laser televisions. 

==== Front Projection ====
In Front Projection television sets, the image is projected from an over-head projector. Due to this light needs to be minimized. The size of the screen ranges from 40 inches to over 100 inches. 

==== Plasma ====
Plasma televisions are generally mounted on a wall since they are only a few inches thick. Plasma televisions offer excellent color and black level performance like the CRT. However the Plasma TVs tend to heat up, are heavier and consume more power than LCD televisions of the same size. The size of the screen ranges from 42 inches to 56 inches.

==== Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) ====
LCD televisions do not have the same color and black level performance of plasma and CRT sets. They however have a low power consumption, cheap and glare-free visibility. The size of the screen ranges for 15 inches to 55 inches.

== How has it changed the world? ==
Communication has become so easy, masses are now accessible to the entertainment which was a privilege of the classes earlier. with the content only improving with time, we now get things unimaginable. News, Movies, Music, Education channels have all improved our standard of living and have made us informed. At the same time one must be cautious of the time to be invested in such things as this box is also blamed for wasting peoples time and making life miserable. T.V sets are therefore also called Idiot box, so be careful spend time wisely.

== What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? ==

There is a DVD on integration at [http://www.mathtutor.ac.uk/viewdisksinfo.php?disk=7 Math Tutor].

===The basic polynomial===

&lt;math&gt;f (x) = x^n&lt;/math&gt;
           
&lt;math&gt;\int { f(x) }dx  = \frac {x^{n+1}}{n+1} + c&lt;/math&gt;

This works fine for all powers except -1, for instance the integral of

&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {x^7}&lt;/math&gt;

is just

&lt;math&gt;- \frac {1} {6 x^6} + c&lt;/math&gt;

-1 is clearly going to be a special case because it involves an infinity when &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; and goes to a steep spike as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gets small. As you have learned earlier this integral is the [[w:en:Natural_logarithm|natural logarithm]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the infinity exists because the ''log'' of zero is minus infinity and that of negative numbers is undefined.

===The integration and differentiation of positive and  negative powers===


    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Differentiation
 
    1/3 x*x*x  x*x       2x        2         0        0       0       0
 
    1/3 x*x*x  x*x       2x        2         ?        ?       ?       ?
 
    Integration&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
    I(x)        H(x)     G(x)      F(x)      ln(x)   1/x    -1/(x*x)


Here I, H, G and F are more complicated functions involving &lt;math&gt;\ln x&lt;/math&gt;. 

You will be able to work them out easily when you have done more integration. The thing to notice is that the calculus of negative and positive powers is not symmetrical, essentially caused by the ''pole'' or ''singularity'' for &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {x^n}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Logarithms==

[[w:en:Logarithm|Logarithms]] were invented by Napier, a Scottish Laird, in the 17th-century. He made many inventions but his most enduring came from the necessity of doing the many long divisions and trigonometric calculations used in astronomy. The Royal Navy in later years devoted great time and expense to developing logarithm technology for the purposes of navigation, leading to the commissioning of the first mechanical stored program computer, which was theoretically sound but could not be made by [[w:en:Charles Babbage|Charles Babbage]] between 1833 and 1871.

The heart of the system is the observation of the properties of powers:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {e^a} {e^b} = e^{a-b}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that if we have the ''inverse'' function of &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; we can change a long division into a subtraction by looking up the exponents in a set of tables. Before the advent of calculators this was the way many calculations were done.

&lt;math&gt; y = e^x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ln y = x&lt;/math&gt;

Napier initially used logs to the base &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; for his calculations, but after a year or so he was visited by Briggs who suggested it would be more practical to use base 10. However base &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;  is necessary for the purposes of calculus and thermodynamics.

==Integrating 1/x==

&lt;math&gt;x = e^y~~~~~~~~~\frac {{\rm d} x}  { {\rm d} y} = e^y~~~~~ {\rm also} = x&lt;/math&gt;

This is true because &lt;math&gt;e^y&lt;/math&gt; is our function which reduces or grows at the rate of its own quantity.

&lt;math&gt;y = \ln x&lt;/math&gt;

This is our definition of a logarithm.

&lt;math&gt;\frac {{\rm d} x}  { {\rm d} y}  = \frac 1 { \frac {{\rm d} y}  { {\rm d} x}  } ~~~~~~ {\rm also} = x&lt;/math&gt;

therefore

&lt;math&gt;\frac {{\rm d} y}  { {\rm d} x}  = \frac 1 x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int {\frac{dy}{dx}} dx = y&lt;/math&gt;

therefore

&lt;math&gt;\int { \frac{1}{x}} dx = \ln x&lt;/math&gt;

==Integrating 1/x like things==

Just as

&lt;math&gt; \frac { \rm d}  {  {\rm d} x}  \ln x = \frac 1 x &lt;/math&gt;

so

&lt;math&gt;\frac { \rm d}  {  {\rm d} x}  \ln u = \frac 1 u \frac { { \rm d} u}  {  {\rm d} x}&lt;/math&gt;

therefore by the ''chain rule''

&lt;math&gt;\frac { { \rm d}}  {  {\rm d} x}  \ln f(x) =  \frac { f^{'} (x)}  {   f (x)}&lt;/math&gt;

therefore

&lt;math&gt;\int { \frac { f^{'} (x)}  {   f (x)} } {\rm d}x = \ln | f (x) | + c&lt;/math&gt;

Examples of this are:

&lt;math&gt;\int { \frac { \cos \phi}  {   1 + \sin \phi  } }  {\rm d}\phi = \ln (  1 + \sin \phi ) + c&lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt;\int { \frac { \sin \phi}  {   1 + \cos \phi  } }  {\rm d}\phi = - \ln (  1 + \cos \phi ) + c&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\int { \frac { e^y}  {   e^y + 2  } }  {\rm d}y = \ln (  e^y + 2 ) + c&lt;/math&gt;

As the integral of &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; so the differential of &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; so

&lt;math&gt;\frac { \rm d}  {  {\rm d} x} \ln 5 x^3 = \ln 5 + \ln x^3 = \ln 5 + 3 \ln x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ln 5 &lt;/math&gt; is just a constant so &lt;math&gt;\frac { \rm d}  {  {\rm d} x} = 0&lt;/math&gt; so

&lt;math&gt;\frac { \rm d}  {  {\rm d} x} \ln 5 x^3 = \frac 3 x&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be done by the chain rule

&lt;math&gt;\frac { \rm d}  {  {\rm d} x} \ln 5 x^3 = \frac 1 {5 x^3} .\frac { { \rm d}(5x^3) }  {  {\rm d} x}= \frac { 15x^2 }  {  5x^3 } = \frac 3 x&lt;/math&gt;

What is interesting here is that the 5 has disappeared completely. The gradient of the log function is unaffected by a multiplier! This is a fundamental property of logs.

==Some observations on infinity==

Obviously &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{0}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\frac 0 0&lt;/math&gt;nd &lt;math&gt;\frac \infty \infty&lt;/math&gt; are undefined  but sometimes a large number over a large number can have defined values. An example is the &lt;math&gt;\sin&lt;/math&gt; of 90 degrees, which you will remember has a large opposite over a large hypotenuse but in the limit of an infinitesimally thin triangle they become equal. Therefore the &lt;math&gt;\sin&lt;/math&gt; is 1.

==Definite integrals (limits)==

Remember how we do a definite integral

&lt;math&gt;\int_0^3 { ( f (x) )}  = {\left[ F (x)  \right] }_0^3 =  F (3)  -  F (0)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the indefinite integral of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

Here is an example where limits are used to calculate the 3 areas cut out by a quartic equation:

&lt;math&gt;x^4 -2x^3-x^2+2x&lt;/math&gt;.

We see that &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; is a solution so we can do a polynomial division:


         x3  -x2 -2x
       -------------------
  x-1  ) x4 -2x3 -x2 +2x
         x4  -x3
        --------
             -x3 -x2
             -x3 +x2
             -------
                 -2x2 +2x
                 -2x2 +2x
                 --------
                      0

So the equation is &lt;math&gt;x(x^2-x-2)(x-1)&lt;/math&gt; which factorises to

&lt;math&gt;x(x-2)(x+1)(x-1)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b { x^4 -2x^3-x^2+2x}  = {\left[ x^5/5 -x^4/2-x^3/3+ x^2\right] }_a^b&lt;/math&gt;

==Integration by substitution==

&lt;math&gt;\int \sin \theta \cos \theta  {\rm d} \theta =\int u \frac  { {\rm d}  u } { {\rm d}  \theta  } {\rm d} \theta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; u = \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\int \sin \theta \cos \theta  {\rm d} \theta =\frac  { \sin^2 \theta } { 2  } + c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \sin^9 \theta \cos \theta  {\rm d} \theta ~~~~~~~{\rm similarly}~~~~~~~~ =\frac  { \sin^{10} \theta } { 10  } + c&lt;/math&gt;

==Simple integration of trigonometric and exponential Functions==

&lt;math&gt;\int { 4e^{2x}} dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int { -9e^{-3x}} dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int { \sin 2 \theta } d \theta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int { \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta } d \theta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int {  -\cos \phi } d \phi&lt;/math&gt;

===Answers===

&lt;math&gt;2e^{2x} + c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;3e^{-3x} + c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;- \frac 1 2 \cos 2 \theta + c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\theta + c&lt;/math&gt;

''i.e.'' the integral of &lt;math&gt; 1 d \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\sin \phi + c&lt;/math&gt;

==Integration by parts==

This is done in many textbooks and Wikipedia. Their notation might be different to the one used here, which hopefully is the most clear. You derive the expression by taking the product rule and integrating it. You then make one of the &lt;math&gt;UV^{'}&lt;/math&gt; into a product itself to produce the expression.

&lt;math&gt;\int {UV} = U \int {V}  - \int {\left( U^{'} \int { V} \right) }&lt;/math&gt;

(all integration with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  Remember by

&lt;math&gt;\int {UV} = U [ {\rm int} ] - \int { [ {\rm diff} ] [ {\rm int} ]  }&lt;/math&gt;

(&lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; gets differentiated.)

The important thing is that you have to integrate one expression of the product and differentiate the other. In the basic scheme you integrate the most complicated expression and differentiate the simplest. Each time you do this you generate a new ''term'' but the function being differentiated goes to zero and the integral is solved. The expression which goes to zero is &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

The other common scheme is where the parts formula generates the expression you want on the right of the equals and there are no other integral signs. Then you can rearrange the equation and the integral is solved. This is obviously very useful for trig functions where &lt;math&gt;\sin &gt;&gt; \cos &gt;&gt; -\sin &gt;&gt; -\cos &gt;&gt; sin&lt;/math&gt; ''ad infinitum''. 

&lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; also generates itself and is susceptible to the same treatment.

&lt;math&gt;\int { e^{-x} \sin x }~ dx = ( -e^{-x} ) \sin x - \int { (-e^{-x}) \cos x} ~ dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; =  -e^{-x}  \sin x + \int { e^{-x} \cos x } ~ dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; =  -e^{-x}  (\sin x +  \cos x ) - \int { e^{-x} \sin x } ~ dx + c&lt;/math&gt;

We now have our required integral on both sides of the equation so

&lt;math&gt;= - \frac 1 2 e^{-x} ( \sin x + \cos x ) + c&lt;/math&gt;

==Integration Problems==

Integrate the following by parts with respect to&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;x e^x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 \sin x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x \cos x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2  e^x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2  \ln x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{x} \sin x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{2x} \cos x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x {( 1 + x )}^7&lt;/math&gt;

Actually this one can be done quite elegantly by parts, to give a two term expression. Work this one out. Expanding the original integrand by Pascal's Triangle gives:

          2       3       4       5       6      7    8
   x + 7 x  + 21 x  + 35 x  + 35 x  + 21 x  + 7 x  + x


The two term integral expands to

       2        3         4      5         6      7        8        9
  1/2 x  + 7/3 x  + 21/4 x  + 7 x  + 35/6 x  + 3 x  + 7/8 x  + 1/9 x  - 1/72

So one can see it is correct on a term by term basis.

&lt;math&gt;3 x \sin x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2 x^2  \cos 2 x&lt;/math&gt;

If you integrate &lt;math&gt;x^7 \sin x&lt;/math&gt; you will have to apply ''parts'' 7 times to get &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to become 1 thereby generating 8 terms:
&lt;pre&gt;


    7             6              5               4               3
  -x  cos(x) + 7 x  sin(x) + 42 x  cos(x) - 210 x  sin(x) - 840 x  cos(x) +

        2
  2520 x  sin(x) +  5040 x cos(x) - 5040 sin(x)  + c


(Output from Maple.) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Though it looks nasty there is quite a pattern to this, 7, 7x6,7x6x5 ------7! and sin, cos, -sin, -cos, sin, cos ''etc'' so it can easily be done by hand.

==Differential equations==

First order differential equations are covered in many textbooks. They are solved by integration. (First order equations have &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, second order equations have &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt;.)

The arbitrary constant means another piece of information is needed for complete solution, as with the Newton's Law of Cooling and Half Life examples.

Provided all the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;s can be got to one side and the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;s to another the equation is separable.

&lt;math&gt; 2 y \frac { {\rm d} y }  { {\rm d} x}  = 6x^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int 2 y  {\rm d} y  = \int 6x^2 {\rm d} x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y^2 = 2x^3 + c&lt;/math&gt;

This is the ''general solution''. 

Typical examples are:

&lt;math&gt;y = x  \frac { {\rm d} y }  { {\rm d} x} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\int \frac { {\rm d} y }  { y} = \int \frac { {\rm d} x }  { x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ln y = \ln x + \ln A ~~~~~~(constant)~~~~ i.e.~~~~~ y = A x&lt;/math&gt;

by definition of logs.

&lt;math&gt;\frac { {\rm d} y }  { {\rm d} x} = ky~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/math&gt;    (1)

&lt;math&gt;{\rm k} x y = \frac { {\rm d} y }  { {\rm d} x} &lt;/math&gt;
 
&lt;math&gt; \int {\frac  {{\rm d} y }  { y}  } = \int  kx {\rm d} x   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/math&gt;     (2)

&lt;math&gt;~~~~~~~~\ln y = \frac 1 2 kx^2 + A ~~~~~~~&lt;/math&gt;   (3)

This corresponds to:

&lt;math&gt;y = B e ^{\frac 1 2 kx^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

The  Schrödinger equation is a 2nd order differential equation ''e.g.'' for the particle in a box

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\hbar^2 } {2m} \frac {{\rm d}^2 \Psi } { {\rm d}x^2 }  + E \Psi = 0&lt;/math&gt;

It has taken many decades of work to produce computationally efficient solutions of this equation for polyatomic molecules. Essentially one expands in coefficients of the ''atomic orbitals''. Then integrates to make a differential equation a set of numbers, integrals, in a ''matrix''. Matrix algebra then finishes the job and finds a solution by solving the resultant simultaneous equations.

==The calculus of trigonometric functions==

There are many different ways of expressing the same thing in trig functions and very often successful integration depends on recognising a trig identity.

&lt;math&gt;\int { \sin 2x dx} = -\frac 1 2 \cos 2x + c&lt;/math&gt;

but could also be

&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 x ~~{\rm or} ~~ -\cos^2 x&lt;/math&gt;

(each with an integration constant!).

When applying calculus to these functions it is necessary to spot which is the simplest form for the current manipulation. For integration it often contains a product of a function with its derivative like &lt;math&gt;2 \sin x \cos x&lt;/math&gt; where integration by substitution is possible.

Where a derivative can be spotted on the numerator and its integral below we will get a &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; function. This is how we integrate &lt;math&gt;tan&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\int { \tan x dx} = \int { \frac {\sin x} { \cos x} } dx =- \ln~ ( \cos x ) + c&lt;/math&gt;

We can see this function goes to infinity at &lt;math&gt;\pi / 2&lt;/math&gt; as it should do.

==Integration by rearrangement==

Take for example:

&lt;math&gt;\int { \cos^2 x dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Here there is no &lt;math&gt;\sin&lt;/math&gt; function producted in with the &lt;math&gt;\cos&lt;/math&gt; powers so we cannot use substitution. However there are the two trig identities

&lt;math&gt;\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta = \cos 2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Using these we have

&lt;math&gt;\int { \cos^2 x dx}  = \int { \frac 1 2 { (1 + \cos 2 x ) } } dx&lt;/math&gt;

so we have two simple terms which we can integrate.

==The Maclaurin series==

We begin by making the assumption that a function can be approximated by an infinite power series in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4 + \dots&lt;/math&gt;

By differentiating and setting &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; one gets

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = f(0)  + f^{'}(0) x + \frac {f^{''}(0)} {2!} x^2 + \frac {f^{'''}(0)} {3!} x^3 + \frac {f^{''''}(0)} {4!} x^4 + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

Sin, cos and &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed by this series approximation

&lt;math&gt;\sin x = x - \frac {x^3} {3!} + \frac {x^5} {5!} - \frac {x^7} {7!} \dots&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cos x = 1 - \frac {x^2} {2!} + \frac {x^4} {4!} - \frac {x^6} {6!} \dots&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^x = 1 + x + \frac {x^2} {2!} + \frac {x^3} {3!} + \frac {x^4} {4!} \dots&lt;/math&gt;

Notice &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; also works for negative &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

When differentiated or integrated &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; generates itself!

When differentiated &lt;math&gt;\sin x&lt;/math&gt; generates &lt;math&gt;\cos x&lt;/math&gt;.

By using series we can convert a complex function into a polynomial, and can use &lt;math&gt;\sin x = x - x^3 / 6&lt;/math&gt; for small &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

In actual fact the kind of approximation used inside computer programs is more like:
&lt;math&gt;\frac {a x^2 + b x + c } {A x^2 + B x + C }&lt;/math&gt;

These have greater range but are much harder to develop and a bit fiddly on the calculator or to estimate by raw brain power. 

We cannot expand &lt;math&gt;\ln x&lt;/math&gt; this way because &lt;math&gt;\ln 0&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;- \infty&lt;/math&gt;. However &lt;math&gt;\ln (1 + x)&lt;/math&gt;   can be expanded.

Work out the series for &lt;math&gt;\ln (1 + x)&lt;/math&gt;. 

===Factorials===

The factorials you have seen in series come from repeated differentiation. &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; also has a statistical meaning as it is the number of unique ways you can arrange &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; objects.

&lt;math&gt;0!&lt;/math&gt; is 1 by definition, ''i.e.'' the number of different ways you can arrange 0 objects is 1.

In statistical thermodynamics you will come across many factorials in expressions such as:
&lt;math&gt;W = \frac {N!}{n_0! n_1! n_2!...}&lt;/math&gt;

Factorials rapidly get unreasonably large: 6! = 720, 8! = 40320 but 12! = 479001600 so we need to divide them out into reasonable numbers if possible, so for example &lt;math&gt;8! /6! = 7 {\rm x} 8&lt;/math&gt;.

===Stirling's approximation===

Also in statistical thermodynamics you will find ''Stirling's approximation'':

&lt;math&gt;\ln x! \approx x \ln x -x&lt;/math&gt;

This is proved and discussed in Atkins' ''Physical Chemistry''.

How can you use series to estimate &lt;math&gt;\ln 2&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the series for

&lt;math&gt;\ln (1+x)&lt;/math&gt; converges extremely slowly. &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; is much faster because the

&lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; denominator becomes large quickly.

===Trigonometric power series===

Remember that when you use &lt;math&gt;\sin x = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos x = 1 - x^2 / 2&lt;/math&gt;

that x must be in radians.....

# Integrate &lt;math&gt;\ln~ x&lt;/math&gt;. (Hint - use integration by parts and take the expression to be differentiated as 1.)

===Answers===

# It is just  &lt;math&gt;e^{-t} . -2 \sin 2t - e^{-t} \cos 2t&lt;/math&gt;. Bring a &lt;math&gt;-e^{-t}&lt;/math&gt; out of each term to simplify to &lt;math&gt;-a(b+c)&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;2x { ( 9x + 1) } { ( 3x + 1 ) } ^3&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\ln~ 7 + 4 \ln~ x&lt;/math&gt; - therefore it is 4 times the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\ln~ x&lt;/math&gt;.
# You should get  &lt;math&gt;x \ln~ x - x&lt;/math&gt; by 1 application of ''parts''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Phytoplankton|Phytoplankton]] convert energy from sunlight into food for  zooplankton. 
Zooplanton become food for larger animals. Phytoplankton need sunlight and nutrients to grow. In winter nutrients are abundant, but light is limited. In spring more light penetrates surface waters and phytoplankton grow rapidly. In the summer phytoplankton growth stops becauses the sun warms surface  waters and the cooler, denser depths are not stirred up and there is no mixing of the layers that could replenish nutrient.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The aim of this section is to lay down basic rules for the systematic and organised construction of this book.

==Diagrams==

===Image Formats===

All diagrams in this Wikibook should be in [[W:SVG|SVG]] format. PNGs are acceptable ''only'' if it is not practical to make an SVG image. If you do not have the software to make SVG diagrams, then get it. [[w:Inkscape|Inkscape]] is a small, effective program for making SVG diagrams and is easy to install and use. Not having the software is not an excuse to submit diagrams in inappropriate image formats.

Please see the page on [[/SVG|SVG Conventions]] for information about how to make SVG render correctly on Wikibook servers. See the page on [[/Pinouts|pinouts]] for information on creating pinout diagrams.

JPG images are almost never acceptable for diagrams, as they tend to make thin lines look untidy, and cannot be easily changed.

===Colours===

Image backgrounds should be white or preferably transparent (for PNG and SVG formats).

Most detail in diagrams should be black (such as lines and component outlines). Many images in this book use the &quot;Tango&quot; colour scheme, which is included with Inkscape. If you use this scheme, your images will match the other images on this book much better.

===Image Sizes and Scaling===

Images should be made in &quot;px&quot; as this is the standard used to set the sizes on Wikibooks. Always use a round number for the width, and aim for a multiple of 50 is possible. This makes it easier to specify the sizes of the picture.

For example, an image that is 143x212 px is not good, whereas an image that is 150x200 is good.

When drawing a diagram, draw it at the size you will put it at on the page. So, for a circuit diagram that you will make 500px wide, make the original file 500px wide. If an image is going to be used as a thumbnail, aim for a size of 200-300 px, as this is the normal size of a thumbnail.

Normally images are sized by width - you specify the width, and the image height is automatically calculated. Therefore, it is not so important that images are at round height, as this will not usually be specified by people using the image.

==Photographs==

Photographs should be in JPG format, with the quality set as high as is practical. Please do not submit low-res images or image that are blurred, suffering from compression artifacts, etc.

If you only have a blurred image of a common component or item, leave a message on the [[Commons:Graphic_Lab/Images_to_improve|Commons graphic lab]]. If you really want, upload your blurred image and ask someone to try to take a similar picture. 

==Uploading==

Photographs and diagrams should be uploaded to [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]], unless they are [[W:Fair use|fair use]], then they must be put on Wikibooks.

They should always be put into a category. Put the images in categories as deep as you can get them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Layout==

The chip should be vertical - that is, the pins run down the left and right sides. Pin 1 should be at the top left, along with the identifier dot.

The chip should be centred in the image, both horizontally and vertically.

The font used for the labels should be one that is supported by the MediaWiki rendering engine, and preferably DejaVu Sans, as that is used for most pinout diagrams, and will help maintain consistency.

==Pin Labels==

The can be inside or outside the IC. Generally with logic ICs, the gates are drawn on the inside along with the IC designation (eg 4008), and the labels are on the outside. With other ICs, the labels are on the outside and only the IC number is in the middle

The labels down the left hand side should all be left-aligned with each other, and those down the right hand side should be right-aligned.

==Uploading==

Pinout diagrams should be uploaded to [http://commons.wikimedia.org Commons] in the category &quot;IC Pinout Diagrams&quot; (case sensitive).

Please use the following file name format for pinouts:

 Pinouts:    [IC Number]_Pinout.svg

Replace the [IC Number] with the relevant number. In this manner, the pinout of a 4081 AND gate has the name &quot;4081_Pinout.svg&quot;.

If uploading a template, use the following name:

 Templates:  Pinout Template XX Pin.svg

Replace &quot;XX&quot; with the number of pins in the relevant package.

==Templates==

Use the following templates wherever possible. Please do not change them, unless you are absolutely certain it is an improvement, and you are willing to change every other pinout diagram in this wikibook.

Also consider modifying a similar pinout diagram as this is easier and will help to ensure consistency. Be careful not to overwrite the original when doing this as, although it can be reverted, it is a nuisance.

To use these, go to the image page, download the file and open in the SVG editor of your choice. Insert your pin labels, convert them to paths, save and upload.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Pinout Template 8 Pin.svg|8 Pins
Image:Pinout Template 14 Pin.svg|14 Pins
Image:Pinout Template 16 Pin.svg|16 Pins
Image:Pinout Template 18 Pin.svg|18 Pins
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Colour==

If you wish, you can colour-code the pins according to function:

*Input: Green
*Output: Blue
*Power: Red
*Bidirectional: Orange
*Other: None

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the '''Scottish Gaelic''' wikibook! The Scottish Gaelic language, which has been spoken in Scotland for several centuries, boasts a considerable body of literature, including poetry, plays, song and associated styles of music.  
The music of the bagpipes, the harp and the fiddle are closely associated with Gaelic as are many of the distinctive traditions of Scotland and Nova Scotia.  The Gaelic language and its literature give a unique insight into the nature of a people, their history and culture.
The Scottish Gaelic language is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Scots Gaelic&quot;, but this usage is a little ambiguous and can lead to it being confused with Lowland Scots.

In recent centuries the Gaelic language has been in general decline, both in terms of the number of people able to use the language proficiently and in the degree to which it is used.  It is only recently that voluntary groups and government bodies have made serious attempts to arrest and reverse this decline (although An Comunn Gaidhealach has been working on behalf of Gaelic for over a century).  The authors hope that this book can provide a useful insight for those who are interested in knowing more about Gaelic and assist those who wish to learn to speak, read or write Gaelic.  

It can be difficult to learn Gaelic to fluency without making frequent contact with other Gaelic speakers and learners of Gaelic, and it is recommended that the learner seek out people who are able and willing to help them with their efforts to learn Gaelic - and to persevere with their efforts.  Good connectivity with other Gaelic speakers and learners can be very helpful, provided they lead to opportunities to practice speaking (or writing) in Gaelic.  Social occasions and cultural events (as well as workshops and courses, parent-and-toddler groups, Gaelic fora and local drop-in centres) can also be helpful, provided they can give and maintain an atmosphere of encouragement to those who wish opportunities to practice speaking Gaelic.  In Scotland, many local authorities offer free evening classes in Scottish Gaelic through their Community Education programmes.  Above all, however, there is no substitute for perseverance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lines==

Most lines should be 1px thick. For emphasis or for things like the outline of an IC in a pinout diagram, use a 2px line.

==Arrowheads==

[[image:Arrowhead Comparison.svg|right|200px]]
Arrowheads tend not to render properly in the PNG generated by the server. To avoid this, don't use any kind of arrowhead (normal, square, circle, etc.) and draw them in by hand.

The image below shows what happen when arrowheads are used. There are three groups of two lines. The top one in each group has an automatic arrowhead, and the bottom one has a very similar hand drawn arrowhead (arrow, circle and diamond). &lt;s&gt;As you can see the automatic arrowhead renders as a tiny off-centre smear, while the hand drawn ones render just fine. To see the automatic arrowhead as was intended, you have to go the SVG on the image page, and even then it may not work properly.&lt;/s&gt;

The problem described above has now been corrected in the MediaWiki software.

== Introduction ==
&lt;!--
 Find image on commons.wikimedia.org and replace fish.jpg --&gt;

This document should be written with the student as the intended audience. 

Write a short paragraph here to introduce the activity or lesson to the students. If there is a role or scenario involved (e.g., &quot;''You are a detective trying to identify the mysterious poet.''&quot;) then here is where you'll set the stage. If there's no motivational intro like that, use this section to provide a short advance organizer or overview. Remember that the purpose of this section is to both prepare and hook the reader.

It is also in this section that you'll communicate the Big Question (Essential Question, Guiding Question) that the whole WebQuest is centered around.
&lt;!--
   Write your entry after this line, when you have finished then cut out everything but the heading  --&gt;

== The Task ==

Describe crisply and clearly what the end result of the learners' activities will be. &lt;br&gt;
The task could be a:
* problem or mystery to be solved;
* position to be formulated and defended;
* product to be designed;
* complexity to be analyzed;
* personal insight to be articulated;
* summary to be created;
* persuasive message or journalistic account to be crafted;
* a creative work, or anything that requires the learners to process and transform the information they've gathered.
If the final product involves using some tool mention it here.
&lt;br&gt;
Remember to link to all appropriate words in Wikipedia with the prefix w:
Example: [[w:plankton|plankton]]
&lt;!--
   Write your entry after this line, when you have finished then cut out everything but the heading  --&gt;

== The Process ==

To accomplish the task, what steps should the learners go through? 
Remember that this  is addressed to the student so describe the steps using the second person.
# First you'll be assigned to a team of 3 students...
# Once you've picked a role to play....
# ... and so on.
Learners will access the on-line resources that you've identified as they go through the Process. You may have a set of links that everyone looks at as a way of developing background information, or not. If you break learners into groups, embed the links that each group will look at within the description of that stage of the process. 

In the Process block, you might also provide some guidance on how to organize the information gathered. This advice could suggestions to use flowcharts, summary tables, concept maps, or other organizing structures. The advice could also take the form of a checklist of questions to analyze the information with, or things to notice or think about.
&lt;!--
   Write your entry after this line, when you have finished then cut out everything but the heading  --&gt;

== Evaluation ==

Describe to the learners how their performance will be evaluated. Specify whether there will be a common grade for group work vs. individual grades.
&lt;!--
   Write your entry after this line, when you have finished then cut out everything but the heading  --&gt;

== Conclusion ==

Put a couple of sentences here that summarize what they will have accomplished or learned by completing this activity or lesson. You might also include some rhetorical questions or additional links to encourage them to extend their thinking into other content beyond this lesson.
&lt;!--
   Write your entry after this line, when you have finished then cut out everything but the heading  --&gt;

== Credits &amp; References ==

List here the sources of any images, music or text that you're using. Provide links back to the original source. Say thanks to anyone who provided resources or help. 
List any books and other analog media that you used as information sources as well.
&lt;!--
   Write your entry after this line, when you have finished then cut out everything but the heading  --&gt;

== Authors ==

Put here name and other information about designers and authors of this webquest.

== Overview ==

The 422nd '''''Quidditch World Cup''''' Final takes place in August immediately before Harry's fourth school year, in the opening chapters of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. An international competition, this attracts wizards from all over the world to witness the match between Ireland and Bulgaria. At the end of the match, a riot breaks out, and there is indication that we are seeing a resurgence of Dark wizardry with the reappearance of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|the Dark Mark]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s signal, after a thirteen-year absence.

== Event Details ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In order to avoid having a huge number of wizards descend upon the scene at the same time, arrivals at the site of the Quidditch World Championships are staggered, with wizards in the cheap seats, some of them, having to arrive as much as a week ahead of time and camp in fields surrounding the game site both before and after the event. This is an attempt to prevent the surrounding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]] from getting suspicious, but it is almost completely ineffective; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] wizards are perpetually employing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|memory charms]] on the local Muggles to keep them unaware of the strange things going on.

The event itself is exciting, as sporting events always are; in this case, although Bulgaria's seeker, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]], catches the Snitch, Ireland still manages to win the match. However, it is the riot that occurs in the evening which is the core of the event relative to the story arc.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Weasley Family|the Weasleys]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] leave their tents to see what the commotion is, they see a group of wizards wearing masked robes, who are parading through the campsite, destroying tents, and suspending the Muggle owners of the campground in the air. Ministry wizards, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], plus [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], wade into the thick of things to try and rescue the Muggles, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] head for the safety of the forest. The twins and Ginny get separated from the Trio when Harry trips over a tree root. While the Trio are in the forest, they hear someone cast the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Morsmordre]] spell, and the Dark Mark appears in the sky. This prompts a number of Ministry wizards to appear and try to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] everyone in the vicinity, which in this case turns out to be Harry, Ron, and Hermione (who avoid being stunned by falling flat) and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]] the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house-elf]], part of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Barty Crouch Sr.]]'s household. Winky is found with Harry's wand, which is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prior Incantato|determined]] to be the one that had cast the Dark Mark spell. To the amazement of the gathered wizards, Barty Crouch tells Winky that &quot;this means ''clothes''!&quot; thus dismissing her from service. Hermione feels that this is very unjust treatment of the elf; everyone else there seems to feel that this is a very harsh punishment for a relatively minor infraction.

== Notable Consequences ==

* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], who is quite the sportsman, is taking bets on the outcome of the match. Unfortunately he is not much good at determining odds, and does not &quot;lay off&quot; his bets, so when Ireland wins, he ends up owing more money than he has. Much of what happens around him later in the book, and all of his interaction with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Weasley twins]], has to do with his trying to recover from that particular bad bet.
** After the match, Ludo seems quite scared and unaware of what is going on around him. It's entirely possible that this is because he is preoccupied with his own financial ruin and scheming to avoid it.
** The twins' bet with Ludo was entirely paid off with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Leprechaun|Leprechaun]] gold, with the result that the twins have lost their life savings. They are seen multiple times in the book composing letters to try and get their money out of Ludo, or figuring out ways to corner him.
** Ludo has short-changed the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblins]] that he bet with, possibly by slipping them some Leprechaun gold; in order to make good on that bet, Ludo makes another bet, this time betting on Harry to win the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]].
** To ensure that he is able to win this last bet, Ludo on multiple occasions attempts to assist Harry with preparation for the various tasks. Ultimately, Harry does not accept any of Ludo's assistance.
** When Ludo loses the bet he placed on Harry (by what could be considered a technicality), he goes into hiding; it seems that he again does not have money to pay his gambling debts.

* Ron is aghast that Harry buys [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Omnioculars|Omnioculars]] for him, as they are so much more expensive than anything he could afford himself. When the Leprechauns shower the stands in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]], Ron gathers up a handful and gives them to Harry as payment. As these are Leprechaun gold, they shortly vanish, and Ron is doubly dismayed when he discovers, first that the gold he had given Harry in good faith did not actually exist, and second that Harry did not even notice it vanishing.

* The events on the night after the Cup inform us that there are still active [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] in the Wizarding population, and suggest that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] is once again gaining strength. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s comments to Hermione in the forest reinforce our belief that Voldemort's exclusionary views are gaining strength, as well. We are also here introduced to the term &quot;Death Eaters.&quot;

* We are allowed our first glimpse of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]], whose actions will have such great repercussions throughout this book.

* We are also introduced properly to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]], and learn how much of his self-image is built on his son [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]].

* First mention is made here of Wizarding schools other than Hogwarts. Like Harry, we had not stopped to think that there might be Wizarding schools in other countries. The students that we meet while escaping the riots are apparently from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] in France.
 
* The news story describing this event that appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the Daily Prophet]] introduces us to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]'s writing style, and the Prophet's habit of shading the truth into whatever direction is the most sensational. Until this book, we have seen the Prophet as a straight newspaper; we here start to see, by direct comparison of events as we know they happened and how they were reported, that the Prophet is as sensationalist as many of the more lurid Muggle papers.

== Analysis ==

Quidditch, we are told, is the most important sport in the Wizarding world, so clearly there will be a periodic World Championship. The need for the wizards to conceal their existence from the Muggles will likely make it a less-than-annual occurrence, possibly either every four years like our Olympics, or every five years like the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. Arthur Weasley being able to receive tickets for this event is something of a coup for him; usually, someone as poorly-off financially as Arthur is would be doomed to the cheap seats and a week camping before and after the event, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] and her family apparently are. Yet, somehow Arthur has managed to get seats in the top box for ten: himself, his six sons and one daughter, Harry, and Hermione.

At the event, Harry sees professional Quidditch for the first time, and begins to understand the difference between the way he is playing, and the way it can be played. While no mention of this is made later, it is possible that Harry's eventual departure from the world of Quidditch is made less bitter by the belief that he cannot play to the standard he has seen. He does learn several Quidditch moves by watching the teams playing, including the Wronski feint, a particular way of convincing the opposing team's Seeker to fly at high speed into the ground.

In recent years, to the outside observer, it has seemed that a necessary part of any major Muggle sporting event is the riot at the end of it. The audience, having had their spirits whipped up by the match, end up rioting either in jubilation at their team's victory, or frustration at its defeat. It seems that England is the hotbed of this sort of behaviour, with many European countries taking steps to limit the visits of &quot;football yobs&quot;. Given this background, it is not surprising that a riot would break out among wizards at a World Cup match in England. It is a little odd that the main rioters are wearing the sort of robe and mask associated with Death Eaters, as that group will have been trying to remain out of sight for the past thirteen years, since the disappearance of Voldemort, but it is possible that this is the only form of concealment that they have. It is interesting to note that the Death Eaters apparently scatter when the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] appears in the sky, though as Arthur Weasley later comments, many of them will now be scared of meeting with Voldemort again, as over the past thirteen years they have so thoroughly repudiated all he stood for.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Over the course of the event we see a number of situations where the Crouch house-elf, Winky, is apparently being forced to do things against her will; at one point, she runs across Harry's path, having some sort of difficulty in doing so. In retrospect, we can see that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]], under an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], is actually pushing or pulling her. Winky, &quot;holding a seat&quot; for Mr. Crouch in the Top Box, is actually concealing the fact that Barty Crouch, in his Invisibility Cloak, is occupying that seat. It is of course while Harry is distracted by events on the pitch that Barty steals his wand out of his pocket.

This is the point at which it becomes obvious that Barty Crouch Jr. has completely slipped out of the bonds of magical control that his father has had on him for the past decade or more. Bartemius Crouch Sr. had tasked his house-elf, Winky, with the job of keeping Barty under control, as a safeguard on his use of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] (which was fading); and he knows immediately, when the Dark Mark appears and Winky is found Stunned at that location, that Barty has slipped the leash. This is why he dismisses Winky (&quot;This... means... ''clothes!''&quot;) for what seems to the gathered wizards to be a minor offence. Barty has not entirely escaped; knowing what he is looking for, Bartemius has managed to find Barty, Stunned and under his Invisibility Cloak, and has returned him to the Crouch home.

While we know that Voldemort is now re-embodied, and living in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Riddle Manor|ancestral home]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], it is uncertain how he learns of the events at the Quidditch World Cup. He has already learned of Barty Crouch Jr.'s freedom from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|the late Bertha Jorkins]], but while we can see that Winky's dismissal has made Pettigrew's task, of putting Bartemius Crouch under the Imperius curse, a great deal easier, we don't know if Voldemort knows this. We can guess that he did somehow find out, because if he had expected Pettigrew to face both Crouch and his house elf, his elation at having the job complete without Pettigrew having to defeat Winky would likely have triggered a response in Harry's scar, a response which does not seem to have happened. Of course, we already know that Voldemort dismisses House-elf magic as being insignificant, so he may simply have ignored Winky as a force to be concerned with.

Learning more of Amos Diggory's personality, as we do in the early part of this chapter, makes it easier for us to accept his reaction to Cedric Diggory's death in the final chapters of this book. While it seems counter-intuitive that Amos would refuse a share in the Triwizard winnings following Cedric's death, it is certainly true that no amount of money would compensate for the loss of Amos' son. But it is, on examination, the fact that Amos cannot care about Harry that prevents him accepting the funds. Harry sees the winnings as being associated with Cedric's death and is unwilling to keep them. Amos is unable to see that by offering the winnings, Harry is attempting to ease his conscience at least somewhat of the perceived responsibility for Cedric's death. Having a large amount of funds that he doesn't want, Harry gives them to the Twins to replace their losses from betting with Ludo; this sets the Twins up in their own joke shop, producing magical artifacts which will prove useful to the Trio in their adventures in the final books.

We note that the Omnioculars, so very valuable in deciphering the action of the game, never reappear in the book or the series, though the figurine of Krum that Ron buys at the same time does &amp;mdash; or at least its arm does: Harry finds an arm that looks like it was broken off the Krum figurine after an episode in which Ron gets jealous of Krum's attentions to Hermione. We can only surmise that the Omnioculars are too powerful, that their magic would make it possible for Harry to discover things too easily, so the author must carefully prevent the reader from remembering them and asking why they weren't used, for instance when Harry was being taken to Headquarters in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], to scan for potential attackers.

While the byplay with Ludo and his betting may seem minor at the time, it appears in later volumes that Ludo defaulting on (or more literally running out on) his gambling debt will greatly increase the friction between Wizards and Goblins. It seems that Ludo's bet was actually with the chief of the Goblins; because of this insult to their chief, the Goblins feel that Ludo's actions somehow reflect badly on all Wizardkind, and their charitable feelings towards Wizards have taken rather a large beating. This would be quite likely to have some effect on whether the Goblins join into the Wizarding War, and on which side they choose to join. It will turn out, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 15|in a later book]], that Voldemort squanders this potential advantage by meddling in the affairs of Gringotts Bank.

I cannot construct a triangle with lengths 1.5, 2 and 6. (Try it!)
I'd rather suggest to build a triangle with lengths 1.5, 2 and 2.5. Or, even better, 3, 4 and 5.

----

1. By stretching the rubber band, while holding the loose end to the nail, you can measure 4 cm. 
Draw a circle with radius 4cm around the nail.

2. Unstretch the rubber band and, while holding the loose end to the nail, draw a circle with radius 3 cm around the nail.

3. Stretch the rubber band. (It's 8 cm long now.) At the point, where it crosses the 3cm-line, fix it with your left-hand finger. The rest of the rubber band is 5 cm long. Turn the 5cm-part, so that the free end lies on the 4cm-line from step 1. Put your right-hand finger there.

The triangle &quot;left finger&quot; - &quot;nail&quot; - &quot;right finger&quot; has lengths 3, 4 and 5. Therefore it is a right-angled triangle.

I've just started a textbook:  [[Political Philosophy: Ancient to Renaissance]].  Comments are welcome.

It should be done in December.

== Philosophy Book ==

Hi. It seems like you already know what you're doing on WP. I'll offer a belated welcome nonetheless.

Anyway, Re:Your comment on [[User talk:Alex beta]], the philosophy department has moved from wikibooks's wikiversity (which was only ever intended as an incubator for wikiversity), to [[v:School:Department of Philosophy|Wikiversity proper]]. The new head of department there is [[User:Koavf|Koavf]]. If you message an admin on wikiversity, he will transfer the work you have done here on to wikiversity proper (preserving the history etc.).

Keep up the good work. --[[User:Cfp|Cfp]] 11:58, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Introduction ==

 &lt;!-- Find image on commons.wikimedia.org and replace fish.jpg --&gt;


&lt;!--   Write your entry after this line, when you have finished then cut out everything but the heading  --&gt;

This is an example sdsfdsdsdsfds

== The Task ==


Describe crisply and clearly what the end result of the learners' activities will be. &lt;br&gt;
The task could be a:
* problem or mystery to be solved;
* position to be formulated and defended;
* product to be designed;
* complexity to be analyzed;
* personal insight to be articulated;
* summary to be created;
* persuasive message or journalistic account to be crafted;
* a creative work, or anything that requires the learners to process and transform the information they've gathered.
If the final product involves using some tool mention it here.
&lt;br&gt;
Remember to link to all appropriate words in Wikipedia with the prefix w:
Example: [[w:plankton|plankton]]



&lt;!--   Write your entry after this line, when you have finished then cut out everything but the heading  --&gt;

== The Process ==


To accomplish the task, what steps should the learners go through? 
Remember that this  is addressed to the student so describe the steps using the second person.
# First you'll be assigned to a team of 3 students...
# Once you've picked a role to play....
# ... and so on.
Learners will access the on-line resources that you've identified as they go through the Process. You may have a set of links that everyone looks at as a way of developing background information, or not. If you break learners into groups, embed the links that each group will look at within the description of that stage of the process. 

In the Process block, you might also provide some guidance on how to organize the information gathered. This advice could suggestions to use flowcharts, summary tables, concept maps, or other organizing structures. The advice could also take the form of a checklist of questions to analyze the information with, or things to notice or think about.

&lt;!--   Write your entry after this line, when you have finished then cut out everything but the heading  --&gt;

== Evaluation ==


Describe to the learners how their performance will be evaluated. Specify whether there will be a common grade for group work vs. individual grades.

&lt;!--   Write your entry after this line, when you have finished then cut out everything but the heading  --&gt;

== Conclusion ==


Put a couple of sentences here that summarize what they will have accomplished or learned by completing this activity or lesson. You might also include some rhetorical questions or additional links to encourage them to extend their thinking into other content beyond this lesson.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Back to [[Nature]]

'''What is nature?''' =
Science wants to understand nature. Therefore it is important, how the word ''nature'' is defined:
'''Nature is everything that was not made by man'''. So the definition of nature excludes all things that where introduced by mankind. All those human developments are summarized as '''culture'''. 
The definition of nature summarizes '''natural objects''', e.g. 
*stones
*animals
*plants 
It also reflects on '''events in nature''' like 
*the wind 
*the rain 
*earthquakes 
*food
Nature can be divided in a living and a not living (abiotic) part. 
==Living nature==
The living part of nature consist of all life on earth. 
*plants 
*animals 
*mushrooms 
*bacteria
*humans

==Abiotic nature==
The abiotic part of nature consist of all things, that were not made by man and are not living. You can count to it:
*the outer space  
*not living objects on earth (stones, water, air etc)

=Natural philosophy= 

The so called natural philosophy of former centuries had a somewhat different meaning as science today. Sie beschäftigte sich mit dem Wesen aller Dinge und wie der Mensch Erkenntnis darüber gewinnt. Sie wurde teilweise von den Naturwissenschaften abgelöst.

=Citations=

*&quot;Adapt or perish, now as ever, is Nature's inexorable imperative.&quot; - H.G. Wells (1866-1946), ''Mind at the End of Its Tether'', 1945

*&quot;All nature wears one universal grin.&quot; - Henry Fielding (1707-1754), 'Tom Thumb the Great'', 1730.

* &quot;Climb the mountains and get their good tidings.  Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees.  The winds will blow their own freshness into you, and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like autumn leaves.&quot; –-[[John Muir]] (1838-1914)

*&quot;Come forth into the light of things, Let Nature be your teacher.&quot; - William Wordsworth (1770-1850), The Tables Turned, 1798

* &quot;Fortunately science, like that nature to which it belongs, is neither limited by time nor by space.  It belongs to the world, and is of no country and no age.  The more we know, the more we feel our ignorance; the more we feel how much remains unknown.&quot; –-[[Humphry Davy]] (1778-1829), 30.11.1825

*&quot;How Strange that Nature does not knock, and yet does not intrude!&quot; - Emily Dickinson, (1830-1886), ''Letter to Mrs. J.S. Cooper''.

* &quot;I am not insensible to natural beauty, but my emotional joys center on the improbable yet sometimes wondrous works of that tiny and accidental evolutionary twig called Homo sapiens.  And I find, among these works, nothing more noble than the history of our struggle to understand nature -– a majestic entity of such vast spatial and temporal scope that she cannot care much for a little mammalian afterthought with a curious evolutionary invention, even if that invention has, for the first time in some four billion years of life on earth, produced recursion as a creature reflects back upon its own production and evolution.  Thus, I love nature primarily for the puzzles and intellectual delights that she offers to the first organ capable of such curious contemplation.&quot; ~[[Stephen Jay Gould]] (1941-2002), Prologue (In: Bully for Brontosaurus), 1991

*&quot;In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous.&quot; - [[Aristotle]] (B.C. 384–322)  

* &quot;In the landscape of spring, there is neither better nor worse.  The flowering branches grow naturally, some long, some short.&quot; --[[Zen]] saying 

*&quot;It is in man's heart that the life of nature's spectacle exists; to see it, one must feel it.&quot; - Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), ''Emile'', 1762

*&quot;Laws Change; people die; the land remains.&quot; - Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865), quoted in Peter Blake's ''God's Own Junkyard'', 1964

* &quot;Look abroad through Nature's range, 
: Nature's mighty law is change.&quot; –-[[Robert Burns]] (1759-1796), ''Let not woman e'er complain'', 1794

*&quot;Mountains are earth's undecaying monuments.&quot; - Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864), ''The Notch of the White Mountains'', 1868.

* ''Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque revenit.'' 
** You can drive nature out with a pitchfork, she will nevertheless come back.
** [[Horace]] (65-8 BC), Epistles I.X.24

*&quot;Nature answers only when she is questioned.&quot; --[[Jacob Henle]] (1809-1885)

*&quot;Nature, even when she is scant and thin outwardly, satisfies us still by the assurance of a certain generosity at the roots.&quot; - Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) ''A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers'', 1849

*&quot;Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty.&quot; - John Ruskin, (1819-1900)

*&quot;Nature never did betray&lt;br&gt;
:The Heart that Loved her.&quot; 
::- William Wordsworth, (1770-1850), ''Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey'' 1798.

* &quot;Nature provides exceptions to every rule.&quot; - Margaret Fuller, ''The Dial'', July 1843.

* &quot;Nothing is rich but the inexhaustible wealth of nature.  She shows us only surfaces, but she is a million fathoms deep.&quot; –-[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803-1882)

*&quot;Nature provides a free lunch, but only if we control our appetites.&quot; - William Ruckelshaus, first EPA Adminstrator, (1970-1973 and 1983-1985), Business Week, June 18, 1990.

* &quot;Nature teaches more than she preaches.  There are no sermons in stones.  It is easier to get a spark out of a stone than a moral.&quot; –-[[John Burroughs]] (1837-1921)

* &quot;One Touch of nature makes the whole world kin.&quot; - William Shakespeare (1564-1616), Troilus and Cressida

* &quot;Perhaps I am just a hopeless rationalist, but isn't fascination as comforting as solace?  Isn't nature immeasurably more interesting for its complexities and its lack of conformity to our hopes?  Isn't curiosity as wondrously and fundamentally human as compassion?&quot; –-[[Stephen Jay Gould]] (1941-2002), Tires to sandals (In: Eight little piggies), 1993

* Calvin: &quot;That's the problem with nature.  Something's always stinging you or oozing mucus on you.  Let's go watch TV.&quot; –-[[Bill Watterson]], ''Something under the bed is drooling'', 1988

*&quot;The belief that we can manage the Earth and improve on Nature is probably the ultimate expression of human conceit, but it has deep roots in the past and is almost universal.&quot; - Rene J. Dubos, (1901-1982), ''The Wooing of the Earth'', 1980.

*&quot;The famous balance of nature is the most extraordinary of all cybernetic systems. Left to itself, it is always self-regulated.&quot; - Joseph Wood Krutch (1893-1970), Saturday Review, June 8, 1963

* &quot;The moment one give close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself.&quot; --[[Henry Miller]]

* &quot;The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way.  Some see nature all ridicule and deformity ... and some scarce see nature at all.  But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself.&quot; –-[[William Blake]] (1757-1827)

* &quot;The true beauty of nature is her amplitude; she exists neither for nor because of us, and possesses a staying power that all our nuclear arsenals cannot threaten (much as we can easily destroy our puny selves).&quot; –-[[Stephen Jay Gould]] (1941-2002), Prologue (In: Bully for Brontosaurus), 1991

* &quot;The Wilderness and the idea of wilderness is one of the permanent homes of the human spirit.&quot; - Joseph Wood Krutch (1893-1970), ''Today and All Its Yesterdays'', 1958.

*&quot;To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from.&quot; - Terry Tempest Williams, testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Forest &amp; Public Lands Management regarding the Utah Public Lands Management Act of 1995. Washington, D.C. July 13, 1995.

*&quot;Until man duplicates a blade of grass, nature can laugh at his so-called scientific knowledge.&quot; - [[Thomas Edison]]

* &quot;We cannot command nature except by obeying her.&quot; –-[[Francis Bacon]] (1561-1626)

* &quot;We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.&quot; --Navajo Proverb

* &quot;What is life?  It is the flash of a firefly in the night.  It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime.  It is the little shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset.&quot; --Crowfoot, Native American warrior and orator (1821-1890)

* &quot;When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world.&quot; –-[[John Muir]] (1838-1914) 

* &quot;Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination, calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -- over and over announcing your place in the family of things.&quot; ~[[Mary Oliver]]

*&quot;Wilderness is not a luxury but a necessity of the human spirit.&quot; - [[Edward Abbey]] (1927-1989)

* Diese Gurke ist bitter. Nun so wirf sie weg. Hier sind Dornengesträuche am Weg. Weiche ihnen aus. Das ist alles. Frage nicht noch: Wozu gibt es solche Dinge in der Welt? Sonst würde dich ein Naturkundiger auslachen, gleichwie der Tischler und der Schuster dich auslachen würde, wenn du's ihnen zum Vorwurf machen wolltest, daß du in ihren Werkstätten Hobelspäne und Lederreste wahrnimmst. Und doch haben diese Leute noch einen Ort, wo sie dergleichen hinwerfen können. Die Allnatur aber hat außerhalb ihres eigenen Kreises nichts. Das ist gerade das Bewundernswerte an ihrer Kunstfertigkeit, daß sie in ihrer Selbstbegrenzung alles, was in ihr zu verderben, zu veralten und unbrauchbar zu werden droht, in ihr eigenes Wesen umwandelt und eben daraus wieder andere neue Gegenstände bildet. Sie bedarf zu dem Ende ebensowenig eines außer ihr befindlichen Stoffes, als sie eine Stätte nötig hat, um das Morsche dorthin zu werfen. Sie hat vielmehr an ihrem eigenen Raum, ihrem eigenen Stoff und an ihrer eigenen Kunstfertigkeit genug.
:::Marc Aurel

* Natur, ''adjective (formaliter)'' genommen, bedeutet den Zusammenhang der Bestimmungen eines Dinges nach einem innern Princip der Causalität. Dagegen versteht man unter Natur ''substantive (materialiter)'' den Inbegriff der Erscheinungen, so fern diese vermöge eines innern Princips der Causalität durchgängig zusammenhängen. Im ersteren Verstande spricht man von der Natur der flüssigen Materie, des Feuers etc. und bedient sich dieses Worts nur ''adjective''; dagegen wenn man von den Dingen der Natur redet, so hat man ein bestehendes Ganzes in Gedanken.

      <comment>(Script) [[commons:COM:FR|File renamed]]: [[File:Full Adder.svg]] → [[File: Full-adder logic diagram.svg]] this is not a European Adder who has just swallowed prey</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An adder is a device that will add together two bits and give the result as the output. The bits being added together are called the &quot;addends&quot;. Adders can be [[/Practical Electronics/Terms/Concatenate|concatenated]] in order to add together two binary numbers of an arbitrary length.

There are two kinds of adders - half adders and full adders. A half adder just adds two bits together and gives a two-bit output. A full adder adds two inputs and a carried input from another adder, and also gives a two-bit output.

==Half Adders==

When adding two separate bits together there are four possible combinations. Each of these is shown the the left with its solution.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;width:220px;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Binary Addition.svg|centre|175px]]

[[Image:Half Adder.svg|centre|200px]]
&lt;/div&gt;

It can easily be seen that the bit in the right-hand column (the &quot;ones&quot; column) is a 1 only when the addends are different. XORing the addends together can therefore give us the right-hand bit. This bit is called the '''sum''' and is the [[w:Modular arithmetic|modulo-2]] sum of the addends (i.e. the solution if you loop round to zero again once you pass one).

The left-hand bit reads 1 only when both addends are 1, so an AND gate can be used to generate this bit, called the '''carried''' bit. As a summary:

::&lt;math&gt;S =A \oplus B \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;C=A B \,&lt;/math&gt;

The diagram to the left shows the complete half adder with the addends being represented by A and B, the sum represented by S and the carried bit represented by C.

The truth table is as follows (the number in the brackets are the weights of the bits - each addend is one, as is the sum - the carried bit is two)

{| class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; align=center
!A (1)!!B (1)!! !!S (1)!!C (2)
|-
||0||0|| ||0||0
|-
|0||1|| ||1||0
|-
|1||0|| ||1||0
|-
|1||1|| ||0||1
|}

==Full Adders==

The downfall of half adders is that while they can generate a carry out output, they cannot deal with a carry in signal. This means that they can only ever be stand-alone units, and cated to add multiple bit numbers.

A full adder solves this problem by adding three numbers together - the two addends as in the half adder, and a carry in input.

A full adder can be constructed from two half adders by connecting A and B to the input of one half adder, connecting the sum from that to an input to the second adder, connecting the carry in, C&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;, to the other input and ORing the two half adder carry outputs to give the final carry output, C&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[image:Full Adder Blocks.svg|600px|centre]]

The digram below shows a full adder at the gate level.

[[image: Full-adder logic diagram.svg|450px|centre]]

A version of this diagram showing the two half adder modules outlined is available [[:image:Full Adder Modules.svg|here]]. The output of the full adder is the two-bit arithmetic sum of three one-bit numbers.

The logic expressions for this full adder are:

::&lt;math&gt;S  = \left( A \oplus B\right) \oplus C_{in} \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;C_{out} = \left( AB \right) + \left( C_{in}\left( A \oplus B \right) \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

By applications of boolean algebra, the second statement simplifies to

::&lt;math&gt;C_{out} = \left( AB \right) + \left( BC_{in} \right) + \left( AC_{in} \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Giving the inputs a a three digit number where the first is the state of A, the second the state of B and the third the state of C&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;, below is a description of the function of this full adder:

*All combinations resultings in one (100, 010, 001) produce a high at the sum output, as the presence of only one high at the second XOR gate (the first gate gives a low when A and B are low and a high when either A or B is high) gives a high output at the sum output. The fact that only one input is ever high prevents either AND gate from going high and give a high C&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;.

*All combinations resulting in two (011, 101, 110) produce a high carry out and a low sum:

**011 sends the first XOR gate high as A and B are different. Combined with the high at C&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;, this sends the top AND gate high and therefore the carry output high as well. The presence of two highs at the second XOR gate hold the sum low.

**101 works in exactly the same way as 011, as A and B are interchangeable.

**110: The high A and B force the first XOR low; this low, combined with the low from C&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; gives a low at the sum. The highs at A and B send the lower AND gate high and therefore C&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is high.

* When the inputs are 111, the first XOR gate is low due to the two high inputs, and the second XOR gate goes high, as it has one low input (from the first XOR gate) and one high input (from the C&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; input). This gives a high sum output. The fact that both A and B are high triggers the lower AND gate, and the C&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; output goes high as well.

The truth table for a full adder is given below with the weights of the inputs and outputs:

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;width:220px;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! A (1)!! B (1)!! C&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; (1)!! !! S (1)!! C&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; (2)
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || || 0 || 0
|-
| 0 || 0 || 1 || || 1 || 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 0 || || 1 || 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 1 || || 0 || 1
|-
| 1 || 0 || 0 || || 1 || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1 || || 0 || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 0 || || 0 || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || || 1 || 1
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

If A and B are both high then the AND gate connected to them gives a high output, but the XOR gate gives a low, forcing the other AND gate low. If the &quot;sum&quot; output of the first half adder is high, then one of A or B must be low, meaning that the AND gate connected to them is force low. This means that two inputs to the OR gate combining the half adder carry outs can never both be high, this gate can be replaced with an XOR gate (OR and XOR differ only when both inputs are high). This means that only two kinds of gates are needed, and a full adder can be realised with only two ICs.

These can be run in stages, with the carry out of one stage driving the carry in of the next. This is discussed in the next section.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Multiple-bit Addition==

In the previous section we said how we could add two one-bit binary numbers, taking into account any carried digits from the previous binary order of magnitude (BOOM) and any digits carried to the next BOOM. By concatenating (stringing together) these one-bit adders, we can make an adder to add an arbitrary length binary number.

To do this, connect the carry in of the first stage to ground, as no bits are carried in from before the least significant bit. Then connect the carry out of the first stage to the carry in of the next, and so on for as many stages as you like.

Below is the layout for a 4-bit adder:

[[File:4-Bit_Ripple_Adder.svg|centre]]

Bear in mind that the result will only be complete when the carry output have registered in each of the stages in turn. This ripple effect is why this kind of adder is called a '''ripple carry adder'''. This takes a small amount of time, and for large (32-bit or more) adders it may take several hundred nanoseconds, which may be a problem if high speed is needed.

There are much faster adders that can be made that don't have a ripple effect, such as [[/Carry Lookahead Adders|carry lookahead adders]].

==IC Implementation==

The [[Practical Electronics/IC/4008|4008]] IC is a 4-bit full adder, which can in turn be concatenated with others to provide any length of number.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to complex numbers==

The equation:

&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 6 x + 13 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Does not factorise

&lt;math&gt;x = -3 \pm \sqrt {9-13}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt {-4}&lt;/math&gt; without [[w:en:Complex_number|complex numbers]] does not exist. However the number &lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; behaves exactly like any other number in algebra without any anomalies, allowing us to solve this problem.

The solutions are &lt;math&gt;-3\pm2i&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;2i&lt;/math&gt; is an ''imaginary'' number. &lt;math&gt;-3-2i&lt;/math&gt; is a ''complex'' number.

Two complex numbers &lt;math&gt;(a,b) = a + ib&lt;/math&gt; are added by &lt;math&gt;(a,b) + (c,d)                                              =

(a+c,b+d)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= a+c+i(b+d)&lt;/math&gt;.

Subtraction is obvious: &lt;math&gt;(a,b) - (c,d) = (a-c,b-d)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;(a,b) . (c,d) = ac + i ( ad + bc ) - bd&lt;/math&gt;

Division can be worked out as an exercise. It requires&lt;math&gt;(c+id) (c-id)&lt;/math&gt; as a common denominator. This is &lt;math&gt;c^2-(id)^2&lt;/math&gt;, (difference of two squares), and is &lt;math&gt;c^2 + d^2&lt;/math&gt;.

This means

&lt;math&gt;\frac {(a,b) } {(c,d)} = \frac {ac+bd+i(cb-ad)} {c^2+d^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In practice complex numbers allow one to simplify the mathematics of magnetism and angular momentum as well as completing the number system.

There is an apparent one to one correspondence between the Cartesian &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt; plane and the complex numbers, &lt;math&gt;x + iy&lt;/math&gt;. This is called an Argand diagram. The correspondence is illusory however, because say for example you raise the square root of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to a series of ascending powers. Rather than getting larger it goes round and round in circles around the origin. This is not a property of ordinary numbers and is one of the fundamental features of behaviour in the complex plane.

Plot on the same Argand diagram &lt;math&gt;2-i,~~~~3i-1,~~~~-2-2i&lt;/math&gt;

Solve

&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4x +29 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4x^2 - 12x +25 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2ix + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

(Answers -2 plus or minus 5i, 3/2 plus or minus 2i, i(-1 plus or minus root 2)

2 important equations to be familiar with, Euler's equation:

&lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

and de Moivre's theorem:

&lt;math&gt;{ ( \cos \theta + i \sin \theta ) }^n = \cos n \theta + i \sin n \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Euler's equation is obvious from looking at the Maclaurin expansion of &lt;math&gt;e^{ i\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.

To find the square root of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; we use de Moivre's theorem.

&lt;math&gt;e^{i\frac \pi 2} = 0 +1i&lt;/math&gt;

so de Moivre's theorem gives
&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{e^{i\frac \pi 2}}  = \cos \frac \pi {2.2} + i  \sin \frac \pi {2.2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} + \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} i&lt;/math&gt;

Check this by squaring up to give &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

The other root comes from:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {5 \pi} {4} + i  \sin \frac {5 \pi} {4} = -\frac 1 {\sqrt 2} - \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} i&lt;/math&gt;

de Moivre's theorem can be used to find the ''three'' cube roots of unity by

&lt;math&gt;1 = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; can be &lt;math&gt;0 \pm 2 \pi / n&lt;/math&gt;.

Put &lt;math&gt;n=1/3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = -1 / 2&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \pm \sqrt 3 / 2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\left( - \frac  1 2 + \frac {\sqrt 3} 2 i \right) }^3 = \left(\frac 1 4 - \frac 3 4 -\frac {\sqrt 3} 2 i  \right)\left( - \frac  1 2 + \frac {\sqrt 3} 2 i \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \left( - \frac  1 2 - \frac {\sqrt 3} 2 i \right)\left( - \frac  1 2 + \frac {\sqrt 3} 2 i \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is the difference of two squares so

&lt;math&gt;{  \left( \frac  1 2 \right) }^2 - \frac 3 4 i^2~~ = ~~~  \frac  1 4 +  \frac 3 4&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly any collection of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th roots of 1 can be obtained this way.

Another example is to get the expressions for &lt;math&gt;\cos 4 \theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin 4 \theta&lt;/math&gt; without expanding &lt;math&gt;\cos (2 \theta + 2 \theta)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\cos 4 \theta + i \sin 4 \theta = { ( \cos \theta + i \sin \theta ) }^4&lt;/math&gt;

Remember Pascal's Triangle


                           1
                       1   2   1
                     1   3   3   1
                   1   4   6   4   1
                 1   5   10  10  5   1
               1   6   15  20  15  6   1


&lt;math&gt;= \cos^4 \theta + 4 \cos^3\theta i \sin\theta +  6 \cos^2\theta i^2 \sin^2 \theta + 4 \cos\theta i^3 \sin^3 \theta + i^4 \sin^4 \theta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \cos^4 \theta -  6 \cos^2\theta  \sin^2 \theta +  \sin^4 \theta +i ( 4 \cos^3\theta \sin\theta - 4 \cos\theta  \sin^3 \theta)&lt;/math&gt;

''Separating the real and imaginary parts'' gives the two expressions. This is a lot easier than

&lt;math&gt;\cos (2 \theta + 2 \theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Use the same procedure to get

&lt;math&gt;\cos 6 \theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin 6 \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

== Very Short Intro ==

''You may have read a bunch of short articles with the same name on the web, but they were just snippets of information you needed. It's time to put it all together.''

You have a project in [http://www.mysql.com/ MySQL] and suddenly you find out that you need to switch to [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL]. Suddenly you see that there are many flavours of SQL and that your seemingly basic constructions throw a lot of errors. You don't have time to really rewrite your code from scratch, it may come later...

Actually, there may be some good reasons to switch...

* you can sell your product with total peace of mind ([http://www.postgresql.org/about/licence PostgreSQL is BSD licensed], [http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/licensing/ MySQL is more complicated])
* you can find articles &quot;Converting from MySQL to PostgreSQL&quot; on the web; you won't find any &quot;Converting from PostgreSQL to MySQL&quot;
* PostgreSQL may not be just another lousy database if [http://jobs.skype.com/2006/02/php_web_based_is_developer.html Skype], [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps4371/products_user_guide_chapter09186a00800c252c.html Cisco], Juniper, [http://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?jobatimdb IMDb], [http://blog.pandora.com/jobs/ Pandora] decided to rely on it and Sun Microsystems made it [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/systems/articles/switching-to-postgres-jsp-138978.html database of choice] (which is explicitly funny because Sun [http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/sun/ acquired MySQL]).

With PostgreSQL you may still feel a little like a second-class citizen, but not really the ignored one. There are some major projects like [http://www.asterisk.org/ Asterisk], [http://www.horde.org/ Horde] or [http://www.dbmail.org/ DBMail] that have recognized its qualities and although MySQL was their first choice database, they are showing effort to make things run here too.

== Check The Server Running ==

Most likely you don't need this chapter, but very briefly: after you've installed your package with PostgreSQL on your Linux machine (be it from a package or [http://scratchpad.wikia.com/wiki/Postgresql following these notes]), you need to do something like

 su -
 su - postgres
 createdb test
 psql test
 =# create user ''username'' password ' ''password'' ';
 -- To change a password:
 =# alter role ''username'' password ' ''password'' ';
 =# create database ''databasename'' with encoding 'utf8';
 =# grant all privileges on database ''databasename'' to ''username'';
 =# \l
 =# \c ''databasename''
 =# \q

vi /etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf

 host    all         all         0.0.0.0           0.0.0.0            password

'''be SURE to cover this security issue with iptables!'''

/etc/init.d/postgresql reload
or /usr/lib/postgresql/bin/pg_ctl reload

postmaster successfully signaled

psql -h ''server'' -d ''databasename'' -U ''username''

''databasename''=&gt;

== Convert and Import ==
=== Common way with SQL dump===
Dump your tables with

 mysqldump -u username -p --compatible=postgresql databasename &gt; outputfile.sql

but even then you will have to change escaped chars (replacing &lt;tt&gt;\t&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;^I&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;^M&lt;/tt&gt;, single quote (&lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt;) with doubled single quote and double (escaped) backslash (&lt;tt&gt;\\&lt;/tt&gt;) with a single backslash). This can't be trivially done with [[sed]] command, you may need to write a script for it ([[Ruby]], [[Perl]], etc).
It is much better and proven solution to prepend your dump with the following lines

 SET standard_conforming_strings = 'off';
 SET backslash_quote = 'on';

These options will force PostgreSQL parser to accept non-ANSI-SQL-compatible escape sequences (Postgre will still issue HINTs on it; you can safely ignore them). Do not set these options globally: this may compromise security of the server!

You also have to manually modify the data types etc. as discussed later.

After you convert your tables, import them the same way you were used to in MySQL, that is

 psql -h server -d databasename -U username -f data.sql

=== Export using CSV-files ===
When you have a large sql dump and a binary data inside, it will be uneasy to modify the data structure, so there is another way to export your data to PostgreSQL.
Mysql have an option to export each tables from database as separate .sql file with table structure and .txt file with table's data in CSV-format:

 mysqldump -u username -p -T/path/to/export databasename

Notice that /path/to/export should be writeable by user who runs mysqld, in most case it '''mysqld'''.
After that you should modify your table structure according PostgreSQL format: 
* convert [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/datatype.html data types]
* create separate keys definitions
* replace escape characters
When table structure will be ready, you should load it as it was shown above.
You should prepare data files: replace carriage return characters to &quot;\r&quot; and remove invalid characters for your data encoding. 
Here is an example bash script how you can do this and load all the data in your database:
 #!/bin/bash
 
 CHARSET=&quot;utf-8&quot; #your current database charset
 DATADIR=&quot;/path/to/export&quot;
 DBNAME=&quot;databasename&quot;
 
 for file in `ls -1 $DATADIR/*.txt`; do
   TMP=${file%.*}
   TABLE=${TMP##*/}
   echo &quot;preparing $TABLE&quot;
 
   #replace carriage return
   sed 's/\r/\\r/g' $file &gt; /tmp/$TABLE.export.tmp
 
   #cleanup non-printable and wrong sequences for current charset
   iconv -t $CHARSET -f $CHARSET -c &lt; /tmp/$TABLE.export.tmp &gt; /tmp/$TABLE.export.tmp.out
 
   echo &quot;loading $TABLE&quot;
   /usr/bin/psql $DBNAME -c &quot;copy $TABLE from '/tmp/$TABLE.export.tmp.out'&quot;
 
   #clean up
   rm /tmp/$TABLE.export.tmp /tmp/$TABLE.export.tmp.out
 done

== The Environment ==

=== Perl ===
You will need to install an appropriate DBD package. In Debian/Ubuntu run &lt;code&gt;apt-get install libdbd-pg-perl&lt;/code&gt;.

== Changing The Code Quick And Dirty ==

| comments
|-
| &lt;pre&gt;#&lt;/pre&gt;
| &lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;
| MySQL accepts nonstandard # to begin a comment line; PostgreSQL uses ANSI standard double dash; use the ANSI standard, both databases understand it. (However, MySQL requires a space after --, whilst it is not mandatory in PostgreSQL)
|-
| &lt;pre&gt;' &quot; vs. `&lt;/pre&gt;
| &lt;pre&gt;' vs. &quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
| MySQL uses ' or &quot; to quote values (i.e. &lt;code&gt;WHERE name = &quot;John&quot;&lt;/code&gt;). This is not the ANSI standard for databases.  PostgreSQL uses only single quotes for this (i.e. &lt;code&gt;WHERE name = 'John'&lt;/code&gt;).  Double quotes are used to quote system identifiers; field names, table names, etc.  (i.e. &lt;code&gt;WHERE &quot;last name&quot; = 'Smith'&lt;/code&gt;). MySQL uses &lt;code&gt;`&lt;/code&gt; (accent mark or backtick) to quote system identifiers, which is decidedly non-standard. Note: you can make MySQL interpret quotes like PostgreSQL using &lt;code&gt;SET sql_mode='ANSI_QUOTES'&lt;/code&gt;.
|- 
| &lt;pre&gt;... WHERE lastname=&quot;smith&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
| &lt;pre&gt;... WHERE lower(lastname)='smith'&lt;/pre&gt;
|PostgreSQL is case-sensitive for string comparisons.  The value 'Smith' is not the same as 'smith'.  This is a big change for many users from MySQL (in MySQL, VARCHAR and TEXT columns are case-insensitive unless the &quot;binary&quot; flag is set) and other small database systems, like Microsoft Access.  In PostgreSQL, you can either:
* Use the correct case in your query.  (i.e. &lt;code&gt;WHERE lastname='Smith'&lt;/code&gt;)
* Use a conversion function, like &lt;code&gt;lower()&lt;/code&gt; to search.  (i.e. &lt;code&gt;WHERE lower(lastname)='smith'&lt;/code&gt;)
* Use a case-insensitive operator, like &lt;code&gt;ILIKE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;*~&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;pre&gt;`LastName` = `lastname`&lt;/pre&gt;
and maybe not?
| &lt;pre&gt;&quot;LastName&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;lastname&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
| Database, table, field and columns names in PostgreSQL are case-independent, unless you created them with double-quotes around their name, in which case they are case-sensitive.  In MySQL, table names can be case-sensitive or not, depending on which operating system you are using.&lt;br /&gt;Note that PostgreSQL actively converts all non-quoted names to lower case and so returns lower case in query results!
|-
| &lt;pre&gt;'foo' || 'bar'&lt;/pre&gt; means OR
| &lt;pre&gt;'foo' || 'bar'&lt;/pre&gt; means string concatenation (= 'foobar')
| MySQL accepts C-language operators for logic, SQL requires &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;; use the SQL standard keywords for logic, both databases understand it.

==== Data Types ====
The ideas for this table were partially derived from automated dump converting script [http://www.xach.com/aolserver/mysql2psql.pl].
Official documentation:
* [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/datatype.html PostgreSQL 8.4 Data Types]
* [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/data-types.html MySQL 5.1 Data Types]
List of available data types can be reached also by using psql's internal slash command &lt;code&gt;\dT&lt;/code&gt;.

SERIAL = 1 – 2147483647 &lt;br/&gt; BIGSERIAL = 1 – 9223372036854775807

SERIAL is in fact an entity named SEQUENCE. It exists independently on the rest of your table. If you want to cleanup your system after dropping a table, you also have to &lt;code&gt;DROP SEQUENCE ''name''&lt;/code&gt;. [http://www.sitepoint.com/article/site-mysql-postgresql-1/3 More on that topic...]


Note for MySQL:
 ''column'' SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
or
 ''column'' SERIAL,
 PRIMARY KEY(''column'')
Will result in having 2 indexes for ''column''.
One will be generated by the &lt;code&gt;PRIMARY KEY&lt;/code&gt; constraint, and one by the implicit &lt;code&gt;UNIQUE&lt;/code&gt; constraint present in the &lt;code&gt;SERIAL&lt;/code&gt; alias.

| [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.FAQ.html#item4.11.2 CURRVAL('serial_variable')]
| NOTE: it is not only &quot;subsitute string&quot; solution as you need to know the name of SERIAL variable (unlike AUTO_INCREMENT in MySQL). Also note that PostgreSQL can play with the OID of the last row inserted by the most recent SQL command.

NOTE2: Even better way to replace LAST_INSERT_ID() is creating a rule, because this cannot suffer from race-conditions:

&lt;code&gt;CREATE RULE get_{table}_id_seq AS ON INSERT TO {table} DO SELECT currval('{table}_id_seq'::text) AS id;&lt;/code&gt;

(usage is somehow strange, you get a result from an INSERT-statement, but it works very well)

&lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (...) RETURNING my_serial_column_name;&lt;/code&gt;

== Common Errors ==
* '''ERROR:  relation &quot;something&quot; does not exist''' - usually table doesn't exist as you probably didn't make it with the new datatypes or syntax. Also watch out for case folding issues; PostgreSQL = postgresql != &quot;PostgreSQL&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Variable names==

The ubiquitous &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not always the variable as you will all know by now. One problem dealing with real applications is sorting out which symbols are the variables and which are constants. (If you look very carefully at professionally set equations in text books you should find that there are rules that constants are set in Roman type, ''i.e.'' straight letters and variables in ''italics''. Do not rely on this as it is often ignored.)

Here are some examples where the variable is conventionally something other than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

# The [[w:en:Euler_angles|Euler angles]] which are used in rotation are conventionally  &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; not the more usual angle names &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. The ''rotation matrix'' for the final twist in the commonest Euler definition therefore looks like &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\cos (\gamma) &amp; \sin (\gamma) &amp; 0 \\-\sin (\gamma) &amp; \cos (\gamma) &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
# The energy transitions in the [[w:en:Hydrogen_atom|hydrogen atom]] which give the [[w:en:Balmer_series|Balmer series]] are given by the formula &lt;math&gt;\tilde {\nu } = {\rm R_H} \left(  \frac 1 {2^2}  - \frac 1 {n^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\tilde {\nu }&lt;/math&gt; is just a single variable for the energy the ''tilde '' being a convention used by spectroscopists to say it is wavenumbers, (cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). The H subscript on &lt;math&gt;{\rm R_H} &lt;/math&gt; has no mathematical meaning. It is the Rydberg constant and is therefore in Roman type. &lt;math&gt;{\rm R_H} &lt;/math&gt; is known very accurately as 109,677.581 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. It has actually been known for a substantial fraction of the class to make an error  putting this fraction over a common denominator in examination conditions.
# In the theory of light &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is used for frequency and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; not surprisingly for time. Light is an oscillating electric and magnetic field therefore the cosine function is a very good way of describing it. You can also see here the use of complex numbers. Using the real axis of the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArgandDiagram.html Argand diagram] for the electric field and the imaginary axis for the magnetic field is a very natural description mathematically and maps ideally onto the physical reality. Here we are integrating with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, the operating frequency if it is a laser experiment is a constant, therefore it appears on the denominator in the integration. &lt;math&gt;\int \cos ( \omega t) \sin ( \omega t) dt = -{\frac {\cos(\omega )^{2}}{2\,\omega}} + c&lt;/math&gt; In this case we can see a physical interpretation for the integration constant. It will be a ''phase factor''. If we were dealing with sunlight we might well be integrating a different function over &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in order to calculate all of the phenomenon which has different strengths at the different light frequencies. Our integration limits would either be from zero to infinity or perhaps over the range of energies which correspond to visible light.
# This example is a laser experiment called [[w:en:Second_harmonic_generation|Second Harmonic Generation]]. There is an electric field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and a property constant &lt;math&gt; \chi_{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{0} &lt;/math&gt; is a fundamental constant. We have  an  intense  monochromatic laser field fluctuating at the frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, (''i.e.'' a strong light beam from a big laser). &lt;math&gt;F_{v} \sin (2\pi \nu t)&lt;/math&gt; Therefore the &lt;math&gt;F^{2}&lt;/math&gt; term contributes &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{0} \chi_{(2)} F_{v}^{2} \sin^{2}(2 \pi \nu t )&lt;/math&gt; to the polarization. We know from trigonometric identities that &lt;math&gt;\sin^{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as a cosine of the double angle &lt;math&gt;\cos ( 2 \theta ) = 1 - 2 \sin^{2}\theta&lt;/math&gt; Therefore the polarization is &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 2 \epsilon_{0}\chi_{(2)}F_{v}^{2} ( 1 - \cos 4 \pi \nu t )&lt;/math&gt; In this forest of subscripts and Greek letters the important point is that there are ''two'' terms contributing to the output coming from &lt;math&gt;( 1 - \cos 4 \pi \nu t )&lt;/math&gt; which multiplies the rest of the stuff. In summary we have &lt;math&gt;A \sin^{2}( t )&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;B ( 1 - \cos( 2 t ) )&lt;/math&gt; where everything except the trig(t) and trig(2t) are to some extent unimportant for the phenomenon of doubling the frequency. &lt;math&gt;\sin&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos&lt;/math&gt; differ only in a phase shift so they represent the same physical phenomenon, ''i.e.'' light, which has phase. (One of the important properties of laser light is that it is ''coherent'', ''i.e.'' it all has the same phase. This is fundamentally embedded in our mathematics.)

==van der Waals Energy==

The [[w:en:Van_der_Waals_force|van der Waals energy]] between two inert gas atoms can be written simply as a function of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_{vdw} =  \frac {\rm A} {r^{12}} -  \frac {\rm B} {r^{6}}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the &lt;math&gt;r^{12}&lt;/math&gt; term is positive corresponding to repulsion. The &lt;math&gt;r^{6}&lt;/math&gt; term is the attractive term and is negative corresponding to a reduction in energy. A and B are constants fitted to experimental numbers.

This function is very easy to both differentiate and integrate. Work these out. In a gas simulation you would use the derivative to calculate the forces on the atoms and would integrate [[w:en:Newton's_laws_of_motion|Newton's equations]] to find out where the atoms will be next.

Another potential which is used is:

&lt;math&gt;E_{vdw} =  {\rm A} e ^{- {\rm B} r} - {\rm C} r ^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;

This has 1 more fittable constant. Integrate and differentiate this.

The &lt;math&gt;\frac {\rm A} {r^{12}} -  \frac {\rm B} {r^{6}}&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[w:en:Lennard-Jones_potential|Lennard-Jones potential]] and is often expressed using the 2 parameters of an energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and a distance &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;E(r) =  4 \epsilon \left( { { \left( \frac \sigma r \right) } ^ {12} - { \left( \frac \sigma r \right) } ^ 6 } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an energy. Set the derivative of this to zero and find out where the van der Waals minimum is. Differentiate again and show that the derivative is positive, therefore the well is a minimum, not a turning point.

==A diatomic potential energy surface==

[[Image:Argon dimer potential.png|right|thumb|Interaction energy of argon dimer. The long-range part is due to London dispersion forces]]

In a diatomic molecule the energy is expanded as the bond stretches in a polynomial. We set &lt;math&gt;x = ( r - r_0 )&lt;/math&gt;. At &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; the function is a minimum so there is no &lt;math&gt; dE / dx&lt;/math&gt; term.

&lt;math&gt;E =  \frac 1 2 k_{harm.} \frac {{\rm d}^2 E} {{\rm d} x^2} +  \frac 1 6 k_{anharm.} \frac {{\rm d}^3 E} {{\rm d} x^3}&lt;/math&gt;

Whatever function is chosen to provide the energy setting the 1st derivative to zero will be required to calculate &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt;. The 2nd and 3rd derivatives will then need to be evaluated to give the shape of the potential and hence the infra-red spectrum. &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is usually modelled by a very complicated function whose differentiation is not entered into lightly.

==A one-dimensional metal==

A one-dimensional metal is modelled by an infinite chain of atoms 150 picometres apart. If the metal is lithium each nucleus has charge 3 and its electrons are modelled by the function

&lt;math&gt;cos^2\left\{ \frac \pi  2 \frac r {150} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

which repeats every 150 pm. What constant must this function be multiplied by to ensure there are 3 electrons on each atom? (Hint... integrate &lt;math&gt;cos^2&lt;/math&gt; between either &lt;math&gt;-\frac \pi  2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+\frac \pi  2&lt;/math&gt; or -75pm and +75pm according to your equation. This integral is a dimensionless number equal to the number of electrons, so we will have to multiply
by a ''normalisation constant''.)

Here we have modelled the density of electrons. Later in the second year you will see electronic structure more accurately described by functions for ''each independent electron'' called ''orbitals''. These are subject to rigorous mathematical requirements which means they are quite fun to calculate.

==Kepler's Laws==

Another physics problem but a good example of a log-log plot is the radius and time period relations of the planets.

This data is dimensionless because we have divided by the time / distance of the earth. We can take logs of both. 

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;th&gt; Mercury &lt;th&gt; Venus&lt;th&gt; Earth&lt;th&gt; Mars&lt;th&gt; Jupiter&lt;th&gt;Saturn
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;r&lt;th&gt; 0.3871&lt;th&gt; 0.7233 &lt;th&gt; 1&lt;th&gt; 1.524&lt;th&gt; 5.203 &lt;th&gt;9.539
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;T&lt;th&gt; 0.2408 &lt;th&gt; 0.6152 &lt;th&gt; 1 &lt;th&gt; 1.881&lt;th&gt; 11.86&lt;th&gt; 29.46
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;th&gt; Mercury &lt;th&gt; Venus&lt;th&gt; Earth&lt;th&gt; Mars&lt;th&gt; Jupiter&lt;th&gt;Saturn
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;th&gt; -0.4122 &lt;th&gt;  &lt;th&gt; 0 &lt;th&gt; &lt;th&gt; &lt;th&gt; 0.9795
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;th&gt; -0.6184 &lt;th&gt;  &lt;th&gt; 0 &lt;th&gt; &lt;th&gt; &lt;th&gt; 1.4692
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Try a least squares fit on your spreadsheet program. Using the Earth and Saturn data: (which is extremely bad laboratory practice, to usejust two points from a data set!)

&lt;math&gt;\Delta({\log} T ) / \Delta({\log} r ) = 1.5000359&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt;{\log} T = 1.5 {\log} r =  {\log} r^{1.5}&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt; T = r^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;   and &lt;math&gt;T^2 = r^3&lt;/math&gt;

This is [[w:en:Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion#Third_law|Kepler's 3rd law]]. If you use either a least squares fit gradient or the mercury to saturn data you get the same powers. We have got away with not using a full data set because the numbers given are unusually accurate and to some extent tautological, (remember the planets go round in ellipses not circles!).

==Newton's law of cooling==

&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the excess temperature of a cooling body over room temperature (20&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C say). The rate of cooling is proportional to the excess temperature.

&lt;math&gt;-\frac {{\rm d} \theta} { {\rm d} t} = k \theta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\rm using ~~~~~}\frac {{\rm d} x} { {\rm d} y} =  \frac 1{ \frac {{\rm d} y} { {\rm d} x} }&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {{\rm d} t} { {\rm d} \theta} = - \frac 1 {k \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a differential equation which we integrate with respect to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; to get

&lt;math&gt;t = - \frac 1 k \ln \theta + c&lt;/math&gt;

The water is heated to &lt;math&gt;80^o&lt;/math&gt;C and room temperature is &lt;math&gt;20^o&lt;/math&gt;C. At the beginning &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta = 60&lt;/math&gt;, so

&lt;math&gt;0 = - \frac 1 k \ln 60 + c&lt;/math&gt;

therefore

&lt;math&gt;c = \frac {\ln 60}  k&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t = - \frac 1 k \ln \theta +  \frac 1 k \ln 60&lt;/math&gt;

but &lt;math&gt;\ln 60  -\ln \theta = - \ln {\frac \theta {60}}&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt;\ln {\frac \theta {60}} = - k t&lt;/math&gt;

After 5 minutes the water has cooled to &lt;math&gt;70^o&lt;/math&gt;C.

so &lt;math&gt;\ln {\frac {50}  {60}} = - 5k &lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;k = - \frac 1 5 \ln \frac 5 6 =  \frac 1 5 \ln \frac  6  5&lt;math&gt;.
So &lt;math&gt;k = 0.0365&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ln{\frac \theta {60}} = -0.0365 t&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac \theta {60} = e ^{-0.0365 t}&lt;/math&gt;

by the definition of logarithms. This gives the plot of an exponential decay between 80 and 20&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.

So after 10 minutes &lt;math&gt;t = 20 + 60 e^{-0.365} = 61.6^o&lt;/math&gt;C. After 20 minutes &lt;math&gt;t = 20 + 60 e^{-0.73} = 49.9^o&lt;/math&gt;C. After 30 minutes &lt;math&gt;t = 20 + 60 e^{-1.10} = 40.1^o&lt;/math&gt;C.

==Bacterial Growth==

2 grams of an organism grows by 1/10 gram per day per gram.

&lt;math&gt;\frac {{\rm d} m} { {\rm d} t} = \frac m {10}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a differential equation which is solved by integration thus

&lt;math&gt;\int \frac {10} m {\rm d} m = \int  { {\rm d} t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;10 \ln m = t + c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ln m = \frac t {10} + c&lt;/math&gt;

therefore

&lt;math&gt;m = e^c e^{\frac t {10}}&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;t = 0 &lt;/math&gt; we have 2 grams so

&lt;math&gt;m = 2 e^{t/10}&lt;/math&gt;

For the sample to double in mass

&lt;math&gt;4 = 2 e^{t/10}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2 =  e^{t/10}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ln 2 = \frac t {10}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t = 10 \ln 2 = 6.9315 {\rm days}&lt;/math&gt;

Half life calculations are similar but the exponent is negative.

==Partial fractions for the 2nd order rate equation==

In chemistry work you will probably be doing the 2nd order [[w:en:Rate_equation|rate equation]] which requires partial fractions in order to do the integrals.

If you remember we have something like

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(2-x)(3-x)} = \frac{A}{(2-x)} + \frac{B}{(3-x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Put the right-hand side over a common denominator

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(2-x)(3-x)} = \frac{A(3-x)+B(2-x)}{(2-x)(3-x)}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives &lt;math&gt;1 = 3A - Ax + 2B - Bx&lt;/math&gt;

By setting x to 3 we get 1 = -B  (B=-1). Setting x = 0 and B = -1

&lt;pre&gt;

             1 = 3A -2     (A=+1)

   Check    1 = 3 -x -2 +x  true...

&lt;/pre&gt;

Therefore

&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{(2-x)(3-x)} dx = \int\frac{1}{(2-x)} - \int\frac{1}{(3-x)} dx = \ln (2-x) + \ln (3-x) + c&lt;/math&gt;

noting the sign changes on integrating 1/(2-x) not 1/x.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Limits==
Many textbooks go through the proper theory of differentiation and integration by using limits.
As chemists it is possible to live without knowing this so we might well not have it as
an examinable topic. However here is how we differentiate &lt;b&gt;sin&lt;/b&gt;
from 1st principles.

&lt;math&gt;\frac {{\rm d} y} { {\rm d} x} = \left( \frac {{\delta} y} { {\delta} x} \right)_{{\rm limit}~~~~ \delta x \rightarrow 0}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \frac { \sin (x + \delta x) - \sin x} {\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \frac { \sin x \cos  \delta x +\sin \delta x \cos  x - \sin x} {\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=  \frac { \sin x } {\delta x} - \frac { \sin x } {\delta x} + \frac { \sin \delta x } {\delta x} \cos x&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt; \sin \delta x =  \delta x&lt;/math&gt; for small &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; this expression is &lt;math&gt;\cos x&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly for &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {{\rm d} y} { {\rm d} \theta} = \frac { \cos (\theta + \delta \theta) - \cos \theta} {\delta \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \frac { \cos \theta \cos  \delta \theta -sin  \theta \sin \delta  \theta - \cos \theta} {\delta \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= \frac { \cos \theta } {\delta \theta} - \frac { \sin  \theta ~~\delta \theta} {\delta \theta} - \frac { \cos \theta } {\delta \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

This is equal to &lt;math&gt;- \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;.

== Numerical differentiation==

You may be aware that you can fit a quadratic to 3 points, a cubic to 4 points, a quartic to 5 ''etc''. If you differentiate a function numerically by having two values of the function &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt; apart you get an approximation to  &lt;math&gt;\frac {{\rm d} y} { {\rm d} x}&lt;/math&gt; by constructing a triangle and the gradient is the tangent. There is a forward triangle and a backward triangle depending on the sign of &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt;. These are the forward and backward differentiation approximations.

If however you have a central value with a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; either side you get the central difference formula which is equivalent to fitting a quadratic, and so is second order in the small value of &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt; giving high accuracy compared with drawing a tangent. It is possible to derive this formula by fitting a quadratic and differentiating it to give:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {{\rm d} y} { {\rm d} x} = \frac { f^+ + f^-  - 2  f^0 } {\delta^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This is calculated data for the shielding in ppm of the proton in HCl when the bondlength  is stretched or compressed by 0.01 of an Angstrom (not the approved unit pm). The total shielding is the sum of two parts, the  paramagnetic and the diamagnetic. Notice we have retained a lot of significant figures in this data, always necessary when doing numerical differentiation.

''Exercise'' - use numerical differentiation to calculated d (sigma) / dr and d2 (sigma) / dr2 using a step of 0.01 and also with 0.02. Use 0.01 to calculate d (sigma(para)) / dr and d (sigma(dia)) / dr.

==Numerical integration==

Wikipedia has explanations of the [[w:en:Trapezium_rule|Trapezium rule]] and [[w:en:Simpson's_rule|Simpson's Rule]]. Later you will use computer programs which have more sophisticated versions of these rules called [[w:en:Gaussian quadrature|Gaussian quadratures]] inside them. You will only need to know about these if you do a numerical project later in the course. [[w:en:Chebyshev–Gauss quadrature|Chebyshev quadratures]] are another version of this procedure which are specially optimised for integrating noisy data coming from an experimental source. The mathematical  derivation averages rather than amplifies the noise in a clever way.

== Community studies ==

I plan to start a Module on [[Community studies]] under [[Sociology]]. The focus at this time is on the [[w:Community studies|Wikipedia article of the same name]]. If interested in helping out, please meet me [[w:Talk:Community studies|there]]. Thanks! &amp;bull; [[User:CQuinton|CQuinton]] 21:43, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

== Perl ==

I got your message on my talk page, thank you for contacting me. I am still interested in Perl, but unfortunately I am also highly interested in wikibooks (at the expense of being uninterested in other wikiprojects). Thank you for inviting me to your wikia and wikiversity projects, but I only have the time, energy, and motivation to contribute here at wikibooks. 

However, if other people on wikiversity, wikia, etc. are interesting in working on a collaborative bot project, we could start a project on sourceforge or something, and then use the resulting bot on our own projects. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:05, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Documentation ==
The purpose of this series of templates is to increase the readability of code examples in programming books.  Each template includes a div with an colored outline and colored background, and a second div with a colored outline and white background.  Inside the first div is a space which allows a comment or other instruction; inside the second div is the code space.  The include code is used along with two arguments, the first being the comment and the second being the code.

Due to parsing limitations, the current version of the code template requires the user to include &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; tags around the code sample.  (Inclusion of the &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; tags causes the wiki parser to render the wiki include code as plain text instead of parsing it.)  This may change if I am able to hack around the parser and insert the include tag manually. (Note you can now do this using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#tag:pre|content}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[User:YanWong|Yan]] ([[User talk:YanWong|talk]]) 21:38, 13 November 2008 (UTC))

Templates initially created by [[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] 01:04, 6 August 2006 (UTC) for the [[PHP Programming|PHP wikibook]].  These templates are intended to be usable in all programming wikibooks, but specific alterations or exceptions may be required for a particular programming language.  Please be extremely careful when modifying these templates, as your changes may be propagated across a large number of pages unbeknownst to you.  If you'd like to use a code template that is not described below, feel free to add your own and include it in the list (please also include the &quot;Code Template&quot; category on each new template's page, inside &amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/noinclude&amp;gt; tags; see an existing template as an example).

Another concern I have is that these will add large sections of color to &quot;Print&quot; pages on wikibooks that use them, thus vastly increasing printing costs.  If anyone has a suggestion on how to filter these to white (see template Misc2, below), please leave a note on the discussion page.

== Why Use Code Templates? ==

''Why use code templates?  Isn't there already a blue box around code?''

The design presentation using the code template / code box highlights the code much more obviously, allowing the reader to see the code much more easily.  Thus, the user is able to focus his or her energy on parsing the code ''only'', rather than having to parse the wiki page to figure out which sections actually ''are'' code.  Because there is room for comment text inside the code template, it is easier to attach a specific note, instruction, or link to a particular piece of code.  This affords the author greater clarity when making reference to code examples.  The code template also allows the code to be easily recognized and edited inside the wiki source because it has distinct bracketing (from the template code itself).  Finally, some of the alternate stylesheets to not designate code with anything more than monospace font.

== Usage Notes ==

*I highly recommend the use of &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; tags to format code inside the code template.  This allows code to break lines and allows additional code to be added easily.  It also allows authors to establish an indentation scheme, which increases readability.
*With the inclusion of the [[mw:Extension:Highlight|Highlight extension]] to wikibooks, you can now use &amp;lt;source lang=&quot;x&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/source&amp;gt; which is automatically converted to &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; with colour-formatted code.
*All code templates must include the correct number of vertical lines '''|''', even if the argument is blank.  If you don't want to enter text after a particular argument, that's fine, but you still need the vertical line.

== Code Templates ==

*[[Template:Code:Basic]]  - Show basic programming example without any other features
*[[Template:Code:Valid]]  - Show valid programming example with green box and checkmark icon
*[[Template:Code:Error]]  - Show errors, invalid or otherwise broken programming example with red box and x-mark icon
*[[Template:Code:Output]] - Show basic programming example with resulting output
*[[Template:Code:Interpreted]] - Show basic programming example for an interpreted language, with many styles
*[[Template:Code:Tip]]    - Show a useful programming tip with yellow box and star icon
*[[Template:Code:Transclude]] - Show a programming example by transcluding a programming example template

*[[Template:Code:Alt]] - Compare two programming examples using logical &quot;or&quot;/&quot;and&quot; connector.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Screen Printing}}

==A Brief Overview==
In screenprinting, you use a fine mesh material, stretched over a frame, to produce a stencil by blocking parts of the screen with filler material. One of the most popular and effective methods is by using a photo-sensitive material called [[Wikipedia:Photo Emulsion|photo emulsion]] which hardens when exposed to light. We will describe the process of using this substance to make stencils suitable for screenprinting in the section [[Screen Printing/Making the Stencil|&quot;Making the Stencil&quot;]]. Once you have a stencil, you use it as a pattern for transfering ink onto your printing surface. The screen helps to prevent you from using too much ink and allows a very sharp edged design to be printed, with a little practice. The screen also allows you to deposit the ink more evenly, and more easily, over the printing surface to help create consistent prints. 

The process of creating the stencil can take a few days, but once it's created, printing is fast and easy. You can also save stencils indefinitely for reuse, so those few days are a one time deal for each stencil.

==Materials==
===Fabric/Paper===
*Keep in mind, when transferring to different materials, different ink will be necessary
===Inks===
Many inks available for different materials.  Brand list:
*Speedball
**$20 for pack of six
===Printing Frame===
*Making one
*Buying one
*Makeshift frames
**Embroidery hoops
***Usually under two dollars
===Screen Material===
What to keep in mind
*Nylon
*Tulle
*Silk

      <comment>don't need 5 links to hot dog. Link to sugar is inappropriate - saying something is &quot;sugary&quot; is different to linking to sugar because it is in the recipe</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipesummary|Sausage recipes|Serves 1-2|&lt;10 Minutes|1|}}
{{recipe}}

'''Fruity Cheese Dogs''' are a quick fix for a kid who definitely needs more sugar in their system. The healthiness of this concoction is questionable, so it is advised that you limit servings to once every so often. 

==Ingredients==
* 2 jumbo [[Cookbook:Hot_Dog|Hot Dogs]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|Cup]] (240ml) of melted [[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]] ([[Cookbook:Mozzarella|Mozzarella]], [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Cheddar]], [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss]], or any cheese that melts easily and is not very creamy)
* 1/8 [[Cookbook:Cup|Cup]] (30ml) of crushed froot loops (or any equivalent fruity breakfast cereal)

==Procedure==
# Cook the Hot Dogs in any manner; the original recipe used a pan on a stove, but a toaster oven would suffice. Once the Hot Dogs have cooked (you can tell that they are ready once they split), remove them from the heat source.
# Melt the cheese either in the oven or the microwave (microwave works best), and pour the melted Cheese on the Hot Dogs
# Sprinkle the Froot Loop chunks over the cheese and let cool

==Notes==
* It works best when the Hot Dogs are closer together on the serving plate so that any stray Froot Loops are caught in between.
* Also, this is quite sugary, so it is not recommended for those who don't enjoy large amounts of [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">It might be useful if we asked people on the Haskell Wiki if we could use their material.  http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/. If i'm not mistaken, there's no expicit license, so we'll either have to contact editors individually or find some sort of collective policy, or make some sort of announcment. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:19, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: anyway, i've put put a page here http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/UsingHaskellWikiMaterial

:: Yippee! The new Haskell wiki has a [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellWiki:Copyrights simple permissive license].  I guess this means anything that goes on the new wiki can go here.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:56, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

I've also got permission from Jeff Newburn to rip material from his &quot;All about monads&quot; tutorial (which is the one thing that enabled me to understand the damn things!).  -- [[User:Paul Johnson|Paul Johnson]] 19:05, 2 Jan 2006 (GMT)

: Cool! We could also mix and match with stuff from my tutorial, [http://www.loria.fr/~kow/monads Of Monads and Spacesuits], not to self-plug or anything :-) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 19:47, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

Hmmm.  I've had a look, and I like the idea.  However having space stations processing astronauts does seem a bit of a stretch.  How about having machines processing bits of nuclear waste.  Each machine must always ensure that the waste leaves it in a sealed conatiner.  This also allows us to have a machine that takes several containers of material and puts the contents into a single container, which is what &lt;tt&gt;sequence&lt;/tt&gt; does (the thought of several astronauts in a spacesuit, while comic, does stretch things a bit far I think). -- [[User:Paul Johnson|Paul Johnson]] 23:13, 3 Jan 2006 (GMT)

:Heh. :-)  I tend to think of multiple astronauts in a suit as just being in a space shuttle.  Maybe I could say that explicitly to make it easier to swallow.  As for nuclear waste, we should try it!  I tend to believe that we've got grab a whole of different metaphors and flesh them completely out until one of them fits nicely enough or until we cover enough readers' mental models.  The Jeff Newburn assembly line and tray metaphor might also work.  I guess we're all just instances of Cale Gibbard's monad as container idea.  Whatever we do, I'd prefer that the metaphor have nothing to do whatsover with computers.  See below for more thoughts -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 20:27, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

== Monadic metaphors ==

Nuclear waste. How should we go about explaining the state monad?  What would you is a good way to represent the lambda (ticket) in a nuclear waste metaphor? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 20:27, 4 January 2006 (UTC)


: I would say that each container contains both some waste and a ticket describing the state of the waste.  Each machine modifies the waste and updates the ticket.  You can also move the ticket into the waste compartment (get) or put some waste in the ticket compartment (put).  Aside: Dell use a ticket called a &quot;traveller&quot; in their build-to-order manufacturing system, which parallels this system closely except for the rule about sealed containers.

: Paul.

:: Hmm... of course.  The notion of 'ticket' could be very easily transfered over to the waste container thing.  Don't know why that didn't occur to me.  Ok, so now what?  Do we start importing text?  Are there other issues to work out? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 20:37, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

::: I think we can start importing text.  I know I haven't been active recently.  I'm hoping to get back to this soon.  BTW, thanks for getting started with the &quot;Practical Haskell&quot; bit.  -- [[User:Paul Johnson|Paul Johnson]] 22:31, 10 Jan 2006 (GMT)

----

From the main page...
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is almost unique about Haskell is that it is purely functional. If you have a function f on integers, then it really is a function. For exampele f(x) - f(x) will always be zero, you don't need to know the definition of f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This statement is at best misleading, and at worst, false.  Ignoring for a moment that f(x) will have to be in the class Num (because of the subtraction) in order for your program to compile, it is trivially easy to come up with examples where f(x) - f(x) isn't zero...

&lt;tt&gt;

 main = do
        print $ f - f
        print $ g - g
 
 f :: Double
 f = 1/0
 
 g :: Integer
 g = 1 `div` 0
&lt;/tt&gt;

:I've fixed the f x - f x problem.

----
== Operators ==

I see we have a bit of minor dispute over how infix functions should be referenced. The articles previously used things like &quot;&gt;&gt;=&quot;, and I've been using &gt;&gt;=. I actually prefer (&gt;&gt;=) because that is the way it would be written as a &quot;normal&quot; function. Should I go in and put quotation marks around all those operators, or should we use one of the others? --[[User:Ihope127|Ihope127]] 16:40, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

:I've been a bit inconsistent myself, mostly as a result of the learning curve on WikiBooks markup.  I'm now using &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt; .. &amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to flag Haskell keywords and identifiers when used in-line.  I don't want to use brackets around infix operators because it adds visual clutter for newbies, even though it is technically correct.

:--[[User:Paul Johnson|Paul Johnson]] 19:05, 2 January 2006 (GMT).

How about quotation marks the first time, and nothing after that? --[[User:Ihope127|Ihope127]] 02:28, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

:I have no strong views, other than a wish to avoid work and be consistent.  If you feel strongly enough to go back and fix everything then I'll be happy to fit in with the convention from now on.  Whatever we do ought to be documented in the notes for contributors though.  --[[User:Paul Johnson|Paul Johnson]] 23:15, 3 January 2006 (GMT).

::How about &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;? That code tag is mighty handy -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:04, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

== A CPS draftything ==

Since talk pages for nonexistent pages never get noticed: [[Talk:Programming:Haskell_CPS]] --[[User:Ihope127|Ihope127]] 17:01, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

== Metaphor corral ==

Just a place for just to jot down useful metaphors and mental images for explaining Haskell or functional programming stuff.  Of course, not everything needs a metaphor.  Somethings are best explained directly...

* monads - nuclear waste containers
* monad transformers - monadic sandwiches
* Parsec - Pacman! (you can use try to make it spit the pills back out)


== Renaming ==
We need to rename the pages, as per [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].

:It's not entirely clear to me what to rename it to.  Can we just name it [[Haskell]]? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 19:15, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

::Rename to things like:
::Haskell (Probably without Programming:)
::Haskell/Beginning_Haskell
::Haskell/Beginning_Haskell/Basic_Concepts
::Haskell/Beginning_Haskell/Lists
::etc...
::Haskell/The_Libraries
::Haskell/The_Libraries/The_Hierarchical_Libraries
::etc...
::--[[User:Tchakkazulu|Tchakkazulu]] 22:38, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

:::Works for me, although I would probably just keep the structure pretty flat
:::Haskell/Basic_concepts
:::Haskell/Lists
:::etc...
:::
:::You agree? Anybody else want to comment? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 17:25, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

::::Starting the move now.  Please help, or complain if you disagree -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:11, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

== Write yourself a Scheme in 48 hours ==

Johnathan Tang has given just permission to import [http://halogen.note.amherst.edu/~jdtang/scheme_in_48/tutorial/overview.html Write yourself a Scheme in 48 hours] into the wikibook!  There's great material for Parsec and practical Haskell that we could mine from this book.  Many thanks, Johnathan. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 17:24, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

:Note that this import is now complete, and can be found at [[Haskell/Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours]] - now all the remains is to mine it for content in the main wikibook -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 00:33, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

== Use of the term 'statement' ==
The only appropriate place to use the term 'statement' is in the context of the lines of a do-block (but not for the do-block as a whole, or in reference to let or if). It's used in error in a bunch of places here, try to correct any incorrect uses you see.

:Thanks for pointing this out.  Would the appropriate fix be s/statement/expression/ where relevant? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:20, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

== PLEAC code considered harmful ==

I've removed the link to PLEAC, because the code there isn't educational.  The code is barely recognizable as Haskell.  For example, the author overrides the (.) operator (usually used for function composition) to an OO like application operator.  (^) is changed from exponentation to concatenation.  These are just a few of the problems at PLEAC; we really can't recommend this material to those learning Haskell.</text>

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;



Welcome to the '''SAS Programming''' tutorial at Wikibooks. This book was started in August 2006 to provide a template for the first foray into SAS programming in the Wikibooks world.  It is hoped that memebrs of the SAS development community will recognise the value in having a centralised teaching resource for SAS programming and contribute accordingly.  In particular, links to the many papers presented at various SAS conferences around the world and over the years are very much encouraged.

Current Development Stage for '''SAS Programming''' is &quot;{{stage|00%|Aug 7, 2005}}&quot;. It's a lengthy road ahead, but it has to begin somewhere!

Please feel free to contribute (that's what a Wikibook is all about) and please spread the word amongst SAS developers everywhere that this book is now here. 

== About SAS ==
{{Wikipedia|SAS System}}

The '''SAS System''', (originally referring to the '''S'''tatistical '''A'''nalysis '''S'''ystem), is an integrated suite of software products used to perform a number of data and statistical analysis operations.  Whilst specialist sub-products exist within the SAS Sytem, some of which use a graphical interface (e.g. the data-mining tool SAS Enterprise Miner), the core programming language that underpins all of these tools is '''Base SAS'''.

In addition, the SAS System integrates with many SAS business solutions that enable large scale software solutions for areas such as [[human resource management]], [[financial management]], [[business intelligence]], [[customer relationship management]] and more.

==Description of SAS==
[[Image:SAS_8_on_IBM_Mainframe3.png|thumb|SAS 8 on an [[IBM Mainframe]] under 3270 emulation]]
SAS is driven by SAS [[Computer program|programs]] that define a sequence of operations to be performed on data stored as [[Table (database)|tables]]. Although non-programmer [[graphical user interfaces]] to SAS exist (such as the SAS Enterprise Guide), most of the time these GUIs are just a front-end to automate or facilitate generation of SAS programs. SAS components expose their functionalities via [[application programming interface|application programming interfaces]], in the form of [[Statement (programming)|statements]] and [[Procedural programming|procedures]].

A SAS program is composed of three major parts, the DATA step, procedure steps (effectively, everything that is not enclosed in a DATA step), and a macro language.  SAS Library Engines and Remote Library Services allow access to data stored in external data structures and on remote computer platforms.  

The DATA step section of a SAS program, like other [[Fourth-generation programming language|database-oriented fourth-generation programming languages]] such as [[SQL]] or [[Focus software|Focus]], assumes a default [[file structure]], and automates the process of identifying files to the [[operating system]], opening the input file, reading the next record, opening the output file, writing the next record, and closing the files. This allows the user/programmer to concentrate on the details of working with the data within each record, in effect working almost entirely within an implicit [[program loop]] that runs for each record.

All other tasks are accomplished by procedures that operate on the dataset (SAS' terminology for &quot;table&quot;) as a whole. Typical tasks include printing or performing [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and may just require the user/programmer to identify the dataset. Procedures are not restricted to only one behavior and thus allow extensive customization, controlled by mini-languages defined within the procedures.  SAS also has an extensive [[SQL]] procedure, allowing SQL programmers to use the system with little additional knowledge. 

There are [[macro]] programming extensions, that allow for rationalization of repetitive sections of the program. Proper [[imperative programming|imperative]] and [[procedural programming]] constructs can be simulated by use of the &quot;open code&quot; macros or the SAS/IML component.

Macro code in a SAS program, if any, undergoes [[preprocessor|preprocessing]].  At [[runtime]], DATA steps are compiled and procedures are interpreted and run in the sequence they appear in the SAS program.  A SAS program requires the SAS System to run.

Compared to [[general-purpose programming language]]s, this structure allows the user/programmer to be less familiar with the technical details of the data and how it is stored, and relatively more familiar with the information contained in the data. This blurs the line between user and programmer, appealing to individuals who fall more into the 'business' or 'research' area and less in the '[[information technology]]' area, since SAS does not enforce (although SAS recommends) a structured, centralized approach to data and infrastructure management.

The SAS System runs on [[IBM mainframe]]s, [[Unix]] machines, [[OpenVMS|OpenVMS Alpha]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]; and code is almost transparently moved between these environments. Older versions have supported [[PC-DOS]], the [[Apple Macintosh]], [[OpenVMS|VMS]], [[VM/CMS]] and [[OS/2]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cygwin==
Added some Cygwin support. DevCpp would be nice too, though I am not sure how Windows are it is. It lacks a GUI design tool, though it has support for win32 and opengl, as well as SDL and allegro and many other programs. It uses addons for that purpose. Its latest features include code completion, which is a nice detail that other open source C++ compilers don't seem to have on Windows. 

PS: Nice to see that this wikibook has progressed since the beginning of the year. I had been here before and noticed too many empty entries that have apparently been at least stubbified this time around. I have interest in the content, as well as providing some in-depth Cygwin details from my personal installation and a few years of using it for simple tasks and X. --[[User:64.131.175.112|64.131.175.112]] 09:56, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

:I personally use Dev-C++ for my own work, so i really should have added a section about it in here. This book does still need alot of work, and I've been focusing alot of my attention on the [[Reverse Engineering]] book recently, because it is the current collaboration of the Month. Any help is certainly appreciated, however. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:49, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

:I don't agree with the &quot;arduous&quot; set up of VC++ Express assertion ! I downloaded it last week along with the full Plateform SDK, installled them,  and merged docmentation (you need to go to a special ms-help://.. URL in the MS document explorer to do that). It all took few minutes and worked the first time on a pretty large application I compiled. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/.

Hello there, great book, I am still reading it. I belive the [http://bellard.org/tcc/ Tiny C Compiler] is also a good choice for people looking for a simple command line compiler, I have already compiled a couple Windows C programs and it seem to work very well, perhaps it could be included if you agree. --[[User:Keylor.gonzalez|Keylor.gonzalez]] ([[User talk:Keylor.gonzalez|talk]]) 15:52, 28 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Simultaneous linear equations==

If we have 2 equations of the form &lt;math&gt;y = {\rm m} x + {\rm c}&lt;/math&gt; we may have a set of ''simultaneous equations''. Suppose two rounds of drinks are bought in a cafe, one round is 4 halves of orange juice and 4 packets of crisps. This comes to 4 pounds 20. The thirstier drinkers at another table buy 4 pints of orange juice and only 1  packet of crisps and this comes to 6 pounds 30.
So we have:

&lt;math&gt;4.20 = 2 x + 4 y&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;6.30 = 4 x + y&lt;/math&gt;

''i.e.''
&lt;math&gt;y =  \frac {4.20}  4 - \frac 2 4 x  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {\rm and}   ~~~~~~~~~~~y =  6.30 - 4 x&lt;/math&gt;

If you plot these equations they will be simultaneously true at &lt;math&gt; x=1.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = 0.30&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that if the two rounds of drinks are 2 pints and 2 packets of crisps and 3 pints and 3 packets of crisps we cannot solve for the prices! This corresponds to two parallel straight lines which never intersect.

If we have the equations:

&lt;math&gt;3 x + 4 y = 4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;3 x + 2 y = 1&lt;/math&gt;

If these are simultaneously true we can find a  ''unique'' solution for both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

By subtracting the 2 equations a new equation is created where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has disappeared and the system is solved.

&lt;math&gt;2y = 3&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting back &lt;math&gt;y = 1.5&lt;/math&gt; gives us &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

This was especially easy because &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; had the same coefficient in both equations. We can always multiply one equation throughout by a constant to make the coefficients the same.

If the equations were:

&lt;math&gt;3x + 4y = 4&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;6x + 8y = 8&lt;/math&gt;

things would go horribly wrong when you tried to solve them because they are two copies of the same equation and therefore not ''simultaneous''. We will come to this later, but in the meantime notice that 3 times 8 = 4 times 6. If our equations were:

&lt;math&gt;3 x + 4 y + 9 z = 4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;3 x + 2 y - 4 z  = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;9 x + 2 y - 2 z  = 1&lt;/math&gt;

we can still solve them but would require a lot of algebra to reduce it to three (2x2) problems which we know we can solve. This leads on to the subject of matrices and determinants.

Simultaneous equations have applications throughout the physical sciences and range in size from (2x2)s to sets of equations over 1 million by 1 million.

==Practice simultaneous equations==

Solve:

&lt;math&gt;x - 2y = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x + 4y = 8&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;x + 5y = 10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;7x - 4y =10&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that you can solve:

&lt;math&gt;3 x + 4 y + 9 z = 4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;3 x + 2 y - 4 z  = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;0 x + 0 y - 2 z  = 1&lt;/math&gt;

because it breaks down into a (2x2) and is not truly a (3x3). (In the case of the benzene molecular orbitals, which are (6x6), this same scheme applies. It becomes two direct solutions and two (2x2) problems which can be solved as above.)

==Matrices==

The multiplication of matrices has been explained in the lecture.

&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; -2\\ \end{pmatrix}
~~~~~~~~B = \begin{pmatrix}3 &amp; -3\\ 4 &amp; -4\\ 5 &amp; -5\\ \end{pmatrix}
~~~~~~~~~~AB = \begin{pmatrix}14 &amp; -14\\ -14 &amp; 14\\ \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;BA = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 6 &amp; 12\\ 0 &amp; 8 &amp; 16\\ 0 &amp; 10 &amp; 20\\ \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\rm if} A = \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp;  2 &amp; 3\\ \end{pmatrix}  ~~~~~~~
{\rm and} ~~~~~   B = \begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp; 5\\ 6 &amp; 7\\ 8 &amp; 9\\ \end{pmatrix}  ~~~~~~~
AB = \begin{pmatrix}40 &amp; 60\\ \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

but &lt;math&gt;BA&lt;/math&gt; cannot exist. To be multiplied two matrices must have the 1st matrix with the same number of elements in a row as the 2nd matrix has elements in its columns.

&lt;math&gt;a_{ij} = \Sigma_k a_{ik} b_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;s are the elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13}\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23}\\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33}\\ \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Look at our picture of &lt;math&gt;\cos&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin&lt;/math&gt; as represented by  a unit vector in a circle. The rotation of the unit vector &lt;math&gt;{\hat j}&lt;/math&gt; about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis can be represented by the following mathematical construct.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
\cos (\theta) &amp; \sin (\theta) &amp; 0   \\
-\sin (\theta) &amp; \cos (\theta) &amp; 0   \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1   \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
0   \\
1   \\
0   \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
\sin (\theta)    \\
\cos (\theta)   \\
0   \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In two dimensions we will rotate the vector at 45 degrees between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
\cos (\theta) &amp; \sin (\theta)    \\
-\sin (\theta) &amp; \cos (\theta)   \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac r {\sqrt 2}   \\
\frac r {\sqrt 2}   \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac {r \cos \theta} {\sqrt 2} + \frac {r \sin \theta} {\sqrt 2}  \\
\frac {-r \sin \theta} {\sqrt 2} + \frac {r \cos \theta} {\sqrt 2}  \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
r   \\
0   \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is if we rotate by +45 degrees. For &lt;math&gt;\theta = -45^o&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cos(-45) = \cos 45&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin(-45) = -\sin 45&lt;/math&gt;. So the rotation flips over to give &lt;math&gt;( 0 1 )&lt;/math&gt;. The minus sign is necessary for the correct mathematics of rotation and is in the lower left element to give a right handed sense to the rotational sign convention.

As discussed earlier the solving of simultaneous equations is equivalent in some deeper sense to rotation in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensions.

==Matrix multiply practice==

i) Multiply the following (2x2) matrices.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp; 5   \\
6 &amp; 4   \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp; 2   \\
3 &amp; 4   \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; = 
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
3 {\rm x} 1 + 5 {\rm x} 3&amp; 3 {\rm x} 2 + 5 {\rm x} 4   \\
6 {\rm x} 1 + 4 {\rm x} 3 &amp; 6 {\rm x} 2 + 4 {\rm x} 4   \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

ii) Multiply the following (3x3) matrices.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
38.15 &amp; -42.17&amp; 4.02   \\
4.69 &amp; 0.76 &amp; -5.35   \\
-9.94 &amp; 8.20 &amp; 2.74   \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
0.205 &amp; 0.665&amp; 1   \\
0.181 &amp; 0.647 &amp; 1   \\
0.207 &amp; 0.476 &amp; 1   \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

You will notice that this gives a ''unit matrix'' as its product.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0   \\
0&amp; 1 &amp;0   \\
0&amp; 0 &amp;1   \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first matrix is the ''inverse'' of the 2nd.
Computers use the inverse of a matrix to solve simultaneous equations.


If we have
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
y_1 = a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + a_{13} x_3 .....  + a_{1n} x_n  \\
y_2 = a_{21} x_2 + a_{22} x_2 + a_{23} x_3 .....  + a_{2n} x_n  \\
.....  \\
.....  \\
y_n = a_{n1} x_n + a_{n2} x_n + a_{n3} x_3 .....  + a_{nn} x_n\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


In matrix form this is....

&lt;math&gt;
Y = AX
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
A^{-1}Y=X
&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of work this is equivalent to the elimination method you have already employed for small equations but can be performed by computers for &lt;math&gt;10~000&lt;/math&gt; simultaneous equations.

(Examples of large systems of equations are the fitting of reference data to 200 references molecules, dimension 200, or the calculation of the quantum mechanical gradient of the energy where there is an equation
for every way of exciting 1 electron from an occupied orbital to an excited, (called ''virtual'', orbital, (typically  &lt;math&gt;10~000&lt;/math&gt; equations.)

==Finding the inverse==

How do you find the inverse... You use Maple or Matlab on your PC but if the matrix is small you can use the formula...

&lt;math&gt;A^{-1} = \frac 1 {Det A} Adj A&lt;/math&gt;

Here Adj A is the adjoint matrix, the transposed matrix of cofactors. These strange objects are best described by example.....

&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2  \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1  \\
3 &amp; -1 &amp; 1  \\
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This determinant is equal to:   1 ( 1 x 1 - 1 x (-1)) - (-1) ( 2 x 1 - 1 x 3) + 2 ( 2 x (-1) - ( 1 x 3) each of these terms is called a ''cofactor''.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
a_{11}  &amp; a_{12}  &amp; a_{13}   \\
a_{21}  &amp; a_{22}  &amp; a_{23}   \\
a_{31}  &amp; a_{32}  &amp; a_{33} \\
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt; Det A =  -1^{i+j-1} \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} ( a_{22}   a_{33} - a_{23}   a_{32} ) \\ 
 +  -1^{i+j-1} a_{12} ( a_{21}   a_{33} - a_{23}   a_{31} ) \\ 
 +  -1^{i+j-1} a_{13} ( a_{21}   a_{32} - a_{22}   a_{31} ) \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt; -1^{i+j-1}&lt;/math&gt; thing gives the sign alternation in a form mathematicians like even though it is incomprehensible.

Use the determinant

&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2  \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1  \\
3 &amp; -1 &amp; 1  \\
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

to solve the simultaneous equations on page 47 by the matrix inverse method. The matrix corresponding to the equations on p47.2 is:
&lt;pre&gt;

     1      -1      2                 6

     2       1      1          =      3

     3      -1      1                 6


The cofactors are

     2       1     -5

    -1      -5     -2

    -3       3      3


You may find these 9 copies of the matrix useful for
striking out rows and columns to form this inverse....

    1    -1    2      1    -1    2        1    -1    2
    2     1    1      2     1    1        2     1    1
    3    -1    1      3    -1    1        3    -1    1



    1    -1    2      1    -1    2        1    -1    2
    2     1    1      2     1    1        2     1    1
    3    -1    1      3    -1    1        3    -1    1



    1    -1    2      1    -1    2        1    -1    2
    2     1    1      2     1    1        2     1    1
    3    -1    1      3    -1    1        3    -1    1


 These are the little determinants with the -1 to the (n-1) factors
 and the value of the determinant is -9.

The transposed matrix of cofactors is

     2      -1     -3

     1      -5      3

    -5      -2      3

So the inverse is


                 2      -1     -3

    -1/9  X      1      -5      3

                -5      -2      3

Giving a solution


               2      -1     -3         6          1

  -1/9  X      1      -5      3    X    3     =   -1

              -5      -2      3         6          2

&lt;/pre&gt;

This takes a long time to get all the signs right. Elimination by subtracting equations is MUCH easier. However as the computer cannot make sign mistakes it is not a problem when done by computer program.

The following determinant corresponds to an equation which is repeated three times giving an unsolvable set of simultaneous equations.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3  \\
-1 &amp; -2 &amp; -3  \\
2 &amp; 4 &amp; 6  \\
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Matrix multiplication is not necessarily commutative, which in English means &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; does not equal &lt;math&gt;BA&lt;/math&gt; all the time. Multiplication may not even be possible in the case of rectangular rather than square matrices.

I will put a list of the properties and definitions of matrices in an appendix for reference through the later years of the course.

==Determinants and the Eigenvalue problem==

In 2nd year quantum chemistry you will come across this object:
&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
\alpha - E &amp;  \beta  &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
\beta &amp; \alpha -E &amp; \beta  &amp;  0  \\
0 &amp; \beta &amp; \alpha -E &amp; \beta    \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \beta &amp; \alpha -E    \\
\end{vmatrix}
= 0&lt;/math&gt;

You divide by &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;(\alpha - E ) / \beta&lt;/math&gt; to equal &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to get:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
x &amp; 1  &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
1 &amp; x &amp; 1  &amp;  0  \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; x &amp; 1    \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; x    \\
\end{vmatrix}
= 0&lt;/math&gt;

Expand this out and factorise it into two quadratic equations to give:

&lt;math&gt;(x^2 +x -1)(x^2-x-1)= 0&lt;/math&gt;

which can be solved using &lt;math&gt;x = -b \pm etc.&lt;/math&gt;

===Simultaneous equations as linear algebra===

The above determinant is a special case of simultaneous equations which occurs all the time in chemistry, physics and engineering which looks like this:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
 ( a_{11} - \lambda ) x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + a_{13} x_3 .....  + a_{1n} x_n = 0   \\
 a_{21} x_2 + ( a_{22} - \lambda ) x_1 + a_{23} x_3 .....  + a_{2n} x_n = 0   \\
.....  \\
.....  \\
 a_{1n} x_n + a_{2n} x_n + a_{n3} x_3 .....  +  ( a_{11} - \lambda ) x_1 = 0\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation in matrix form is &lt;math&gt;({\mathbf  A} - \lambda {\mathbf 1}) {\mathbf x} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and  the solution is &lt;math&gt;{\rm Det }({\mathbf A} - \lambda {\mathbf 1}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a ''polynomial equation'' like the quartic above. As you know polynomial equations have as many solutions as the highest power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''i.e.'' in this case &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. These solutions can be ''degenerate'' for example the &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; orbitals in benzene are a degenerate pair because of the factorisation of the &lt;math&gt;x^6&lt;/math&gt; polynomial from the 6 Carbon-pz orbitals. In the 2nd year you may do a lab exercise where you make the benzene determinant and see that the polynomial is

&lt;math&gt;(x^2-4) (x^2-1) (x^2-1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

from which the 6 solutions and the orbital picture are immediately obvious.

The use of matrix equations to solve arbitrarily large problems leads to a field of mathematics called ''linear algebra''.

==Matrices with complex numbers in them==

Work out the quadratic equation from the 3 determinants

&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
x &amp; i    \\
-i &amp; x   \\
\end{vmatrix}
~~~~~~~
\begin{vmatrix}
x &amp; 1    \\
1 &amp; x   \\
\end{vmatrix}
~~~~~~~
\begin{vmatrix}
x &amp; \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} + \frac i {\sqrt 2}    \\
 \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} - \frac i {\sqrt 2} &amp; x    \\
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

They are all the same! This exemplifies a deeper property of matrices which we will ignore for now other than to say that complex numbers allow you to calculate the same thing in different ways as well as being the ''only'' neat way to formulate some problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Odysseus (also referred to as Ulysses in later Roman myths) is the hero in the story [[Wikipedia:Odyssey|''The Odyssey'']].

He was the king of Ithaca, was married to a lady by the name of Penelope, and had a son, Telemachus. He fought against the Trojans in the [[Greek Mythology/Stories/Trojan War|Trojan War]]. He is especially noted for his cleverness throughout Homer's poem.  He was favored by the goddess [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Athena|Athena]].

He's most famous for coming up with the idea of building the Trojan Horse and constructing that particular plan of attack. This idea came to him after ten long years of war. After the destruction of Troy, he and his men left for home without paying proper respect to [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Poseidon|Poseidon]]. For this, [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Poseidon|Poseidon]] punished Odysseus with what turned out to be a ten year journey home to Ithaca. Further insults against [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Poseidon|Poseidon]] complicated this journey. One insult includes the blinding of the [[Greek Mythology/Beasts/Cyclops|Cyclops]], [[Greek Mythology/Beasts/Cyclops/Polyphemus|Polyphemus]] (also known as Polyphemus), who was the son of [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Poseidon|Poseidon]]. For this, [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Poseidon|Poseidon]] vowed Odysseus would never see his home. It wasn't until [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Athena|Athena]] petitioned [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Zeus|Zeus]] for his safe return home that it actually happened.

==(raw materials)==

From [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Moral_Equivalent_of_War William James' ''Moral Equivalent of War'']:

----

&lt;small&gt;In modern eyes, precious though wars may be they must not be waged solely for the sake of the ideal harvest. Only when forced upon one, is a war now thought permissible.

&lt;small&gt;It was not thus in ancient times. The earlier men were hunting men, and to hunt a neighboring tribe, kill the males, loot the village and possess the females, was the most profitable, as well as the most exciting, way of living. Thus were the more martial tribes selected, and in chiefs and peoples a pure pugnacity and love of glory came to mingle with the more fundamental appetite for plunder.

&lt;small&gt;Modern war is so expensive that we feel trade to be a better avenue to plunder; but modern man inherits all the innate pugnacity and all the love of glory of his ancestors. Showing war's irrationality and horror is of no effect on him. The horrors make the fascination. War is the strong life; it is life in extremis; war taxes are the only ones men never hesitate to pay, as the budgets of all nations show us.

&lt;small&gt;History is a bath of blood. The Illiad is one long recital of how Diomedes and Ajax, Sarpedon and Hector killed. No detail of the wounds they made is spared us, and the Greek mind fed upon the story. Greek history is a panorama of jingoism and imperialism -- war for war's sake, all the citizen's being warriors. It is horrible reading -- because of the irrationality of it all -- save for the purpose of making &quot;history&quot; -- and the history is that of the utter ruin of a civilization in intellectual respects perhaps the highest the earth has ever seen.

&lt;small&gt;Those wars were purely piratical. Pride, gold, women, slaves excitement were their only motives. In the Peloponesian war, for example, the Athenians ask the inhabitants of Melos (the island where the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; was found), hitherto neutral, to own their lordship. The envoys meet, and hold a debate which Thucydides gives in full, and which, for sweet reasonableness of form, would have satisfied Matthew Arnold. &quot;The powerful exact what they can,&quot; said the Athenians, &quot;and the weak grant what they must.&quot; When the Meleans say that sooner than be slaves they will appeal to the gods, the Athenians reply, &quot;Of the gods we believe and of men we know that, by a law of their nature, wherever they can rule they will. This law was not made by us, and we are not the first to have acted upon it; we did but inherit it, and we know that you and all mankind, if you were as strong as we are, would do as we do. So much for the gods; we have told you why we expect to stand as high in their good opinion as you.&quot; Well, the Meleans still refused, and their town was taken. &quot;The Athenians,&quot; Thucydides quietly says, &quot;thereupon put to death all who were of military age and made slaves of the women and children. They then colonized the island, sending thither five hundred settlers of their own.&quot;&lt;/small&gt;

----

The translation of Thucydides used here is that of Thomas Hobbes.  Although the language is rather antiquated, the student of political philosophy will find special interest in Hobbes' translation, especially if her interest in political philosophy extends into the modern period.  The editor's notes, will, however, make note of some significant differences between this and more contemporary translations.  Also, if a passage is particularly confusing, it may be worthwhile to consult the Benjamin Jowett translation, also in the public domain:

==(raw materials)==
Aristotle was born in Stagira, on the peninsula of Chalcidice in 384 BC. His father, Nicomachus, was court physician to King Amyntas III of Macedon. It is believed that Aristotle's ancestors held this position under various kings of the Macedons. He did not go to school, instead he was taught by his father. His father's medical knowledge was perhaps the inspiration for Aristotle's later interest in natural phenomena.

Little is known about his mother, Phaestis, who died early in Aristotle's life. His father Nicomachus died when Aristotle was ten, making him an orphan. Then he was placed under the guardianship of his uncle, Proxenus of Atarneus, who also took over his education. He gave Aristotle significant instruction in Greek, rhetoric, and poetry (O'Connor et al., 2004). Aristotle went to Athens at the age of 18, and attended Plato's school for young Greek aristocracy (the Academy). Aristotle quickly became Plato's favorite student.

From the age of 18 to 37 Aristotle remained at the Academy. The relationship between Plato and Aristotle has formed the subject of various legends, many of which depict Aristotle unfavorably. No doubt there were divergences of opinion between Plato, who took his stand on sublime, idealistic principles, and Aristotle, who even at that time showed a preference for the investigation of the facts and laws of the physical world. It is also probable that Plato suggested that Aristotle needed restraining rather than encouragement, but not that there was an open breach of friendship. In fact, Aristotle's conduct after the death of Plato, his continued associations with Xenocrates and other Platonists, and his allusions in his writings to Plato's doctrines prove that while there were conflicts of opinions between Plato and Aristotle, there was no lack of cordial appreciation or mutual forbearance. Legends that reflect Aristotle unfavourably are allegedly traceable to the Epicureans, although some doubt remains of this charge. If such legends were circulated widely by patristic writers such as Justin Martyr and Gregory Nazianzen, the reason may rest in the exaggerated esteem which early Christian heretics had for Aristotle.

It is not exactly clear when in his life, but according to Clearchus of Soli in his work &quot;De Somno&quot; (apud: Josephus, Contra Apionem, I, 176-183:), Aristotle met a Jew in Asia Minor and regarded him very favorable, noting that there is something to learn from him. Clearchus of Soli quotes Aristoteles as: &quot;'Well', said Aristotle, [...] 'the man was a Jew of Coele-Syria. These people are descended from the Indian philosophers. The philosophers, they say, are in India called Calani, in Syria by the territorial name of Jews; for the district which they inhabit is known as Judea. Their city has a remarkably odd name: they call it Hierusaleme. (180) Now this man, who entertained by a large circle of friends and was on his way from the interior to the coast, not only spoke Greek but had the soul of a Greek. (181) During my stay in Asia, he visited the same places as I did, and came to converse with me and some other scholars, to test our learning. But as one who had been intimate with many cultivated persons, it was rather he who imparted to us something of his own.&quot; Flavius Josephus writes: &quot;...he [Aristoteles] went on to speak of the great and astonishing endurance and sobriety displayed by this Jew in his manner of life.&quot; (trans. H. St. J. Tackery, The Loeb Classical Library, Cambridge (Mass.)-London)

== Function ==
Function generates only one value for each value of an element. Function can be tested using Vertical Line Test.

Let's try to express the area of an equilateral triangle as a function of one of its sides. This problem can be solved by using property of 30-60-90 special right triangle. We know that 30-60-90 right triangle has side ratio of &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{3}:2&lt;/math&gt;. Also, we know that we can divide an equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles. Let x denote the base of an equilateral triangle and A(x) be the area of an equilateral triangle. Then,
:&lt;math&gt;A(x)=\frac{\frac{x}{2}\times\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}\times2\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\sqrt{3}\times x}{4}\;, x&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Functions can be classified into power function, root function, a degree of polynomial, rational function, algebraic function, trigonometric function, exponential function, or trigonometric function. Let's try to classify some functions ourselves. &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt[5]{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a root function. &lt;math&gt;g(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt; is an algebraic function. &lt;math&gt;h(x)=x^9+x^4&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree 9. &lt;math&gt;r(x)=\frac{x^2+1}{x^3+x}&lt;/math&gt; is a rational function. &lt;math&gt;s(s)=\tan 2x&lt;/math&gt; is a trigonometric function. &lt;math&gt;t(x)=\log_{10} x&lt;/math&gt; is a logarithmic function. Transcendental functions include trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions.

In statistical study of linear regression, there is a way to conceptualize function as joint distribution of marginal distribution P(x) of explanatory variable x and conditional distribution P(y|x) of response variable y. Explanatory variable is also called endogenous variable or input variable. Response variable is also called exogenous variable or output variable. Of course, there can be more than one explanatory variables in marginal distribution and more than one response variables in conditional distribution.

== Tutorial Questions ==

=== Tutorial 2 ===

1. (a) Sketch &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt{x}-4&lt;/math&gt; and state its domain and range. 

To find the domain we know that x&gt;0, so the domain is x&gt;0. To find the range we consider x,y-intercepts, domain, and shape of the curve. The x-intercept is 16, the y-intercept is -4, we know the domain is x&gt;0, and we know that f(x) is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; moved downwards by 4 units. Therefore, the range for f(x) is y&gt;-4. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

(b) &lt;math&gt;f(f^{-1}(x))=x&lt;/math&gt;, use this to find the inverse function of f(x) and state its domain and range.

&lt;math&gt;x=f(f^{-1}(x))=\sqrt{f^{-1}(x)}-4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x+4=\sqrt{f^{-1}(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x+4)^2=f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

So, the inverse function of f(x) is &lt;math&gt;(x+4)^2&lt;/math&gt;. By the definition of inverse function, we know that the domain of the inverse function is the range of f(x), and the range of the inverse function is the domain of f(x). Therefore, the domain of the inverse function is x&gt;-4, and the range is y&gt;0.

== Proofs ==

=== Theorem ===

&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty\frac{1}{x^p}dx=\begin{cases}p&gt;1,integral\;converges\\p\le1,integral\;diverges\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

==== My Proof ====

&lt;math&gt;\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x^p}dx=lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\int_1^a\frac{1}{x^p}dx=\begin{cases}lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\left[\frac{x^{-p+1}}{-p+1}\right]^a_1,p\ne1\\lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\left[ln x^p\right]^a_1,p=1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

'''If &lt;math&gt;p&gt;1, -p+1&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;:'''

Let &lt;math&gt;|-p+1|=k&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{x^{-k}}{-k}\right]^a_1=\frac{a^{-k}}{-k}-\frac{1}{-k}=\frac{1}{-ka^k}-\frac{1}{-k}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\left[\frac{1}{-ka^k}+\frac{1}{k}\right]=\frac{1}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;1, -p+1&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;:'''

Let &lt;math&gt;-p+1=k&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{x^k}{k}\right]^a_1=\frac{a^k}{k}-\frac{1}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\left[\frac{a^k}{k}-\frac{1}{k}\right]\rightarrow\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

'''If &lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt;:'''

&lt;math&gt;\left[ln x^p\right]^a_1=ln a^p-ln 1=ln a^p&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\left[ln a^p\right]\rightarrow\infty.\Box&lt;/math&gt;</text>

'''Borhani''' are [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]]-based drinks traditionally served at wedding ceremonies in Bangladesh.

==Ingredients==

* 500 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (2 cups) full-fat [[Cookbook:Yoghurt|yoghurt]]
* 1 c (200 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) cold water
* 3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|ts]] [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]], roasted and ground 
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|ts]] fresh green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|ts]] [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|ts]] [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
* ¾ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|ts]] [[Cookbook:Mustard|white mustard seeds]]
* ¾ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|ts]] [[Cookbook:Pepper|ground white pepper]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|ts]] [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|ground black pepper]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|ts]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|ts]] [[Cookbook:Salt|rock salt]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|ts]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
Dry-roast cumin seeds by cooking them over low heat in small pan until you can smell the seasoning, about 2 minutes. Cool and grind. 

Beat yoghurt with water until it becomes smooth. Strain green chili, mint leaf and coriander pastes with some water blend into the yoghurt. Combine all other ingredients and mix well. This makes about 6 servings which should be served cold.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Requirements==

It should be possible to have different GC Implementations. E.g.
* precise
* concurrent
* generational
* compacting/moving

This leads to more concrete requirements

===Which word is a pointer===
A precise GC should only mark that memory, that is referenced from a pointer. It should not mark memory &quot;referenced&quot; from non-pointer types. A moving GC also needs to modify pointer values, if an object was relocated.

===Which address belongs to which Object===
If a pointer is scanned, the start address of an object should be know. So it should be possible to get the PLI (pointer location information), which is needed to go on.

===Moving references===

In concurrent/incremental GC implementation, the moving reference is a problem.
 Object refa = new Object;
 Object refb = null;

# start of gc collecting cycle
# gc scans refb, which is null
# gc pauses or is interrupted from another thread
# somewhere else: refb = refa; refa = null;
# gc continues ('thinking' refb is null)
# gc scans refa, which is now null also
# GC: Oh, no ref to obj, I can free it!
# the appl tries to reference refb which is not null and crashes

This is the cause for the need of a '''write barrier'''. In a concurrent/incremental GC, every write to a reference needs to invalidate the scans of the old target reference value.

===Conservative Stack Scanning===

Since scanning the stack precisely could be a hard problem (especially when considerign C interfaces, i.e. callbacks from C code to D code), one could simply conservatively scan the stack and &quot;pin&quot; all objects that are possibly referenced from the stack. The new 
[http://www.mono-project.com/Compacting_GC Mono GC] does this.

See section &quot;Conservative Scanning&quot;. The stack is treated in a similar way like the current mark &amp; sweep algorithm does it.

===Object hash codes===
In order to support
 Object.toHash()
in presence of a moving GC, one needs to store the hash code in the object itsself. The hash code can be taken from the object's address, but since its address can be changed, it needs to be stored.

===Weak Pointers===

It should be considered to support weak pointers, which are a potentially useful and an often requested feature. A weak pointer is set to null, if there are no more non-weak pointers to an object. Java and C# also support weak pointers.

===Pointer to native types and member variable===

Pointer to native types should be possible by the language, 
but should not be GC relevant. This means, they should not prevent the GC 
from deleting an object, and they are not marked as &quot;pointers&quot;.

So the GC does not need to find the object start. The programmer just needs 
to be sure, that he does not make references to member, that live longer than
the complete object.

===GC specific per object data===
A specific GC implementation might be implemented more efficiently if it is possible to store a limited amount of GC data inside the object (i.e. flags). But note that most management data can be stored in the memory block which contains the object.

==Object Layout==

Brain storming what concrete object layouts (only wrt. to GC) would be possible:

=== Typeinfo pointer ===

The first 4 bytes would contain a typeinfo pointer, and the type info contains the layout information for the object. This layout information would exist as a bitmap or 
a region list (a list of (offset, length) pairs)).

=== Bidirectional memory layout ===

A very specialized idea to separate pointer and integer data, so no bitmap or similar complex data structures would be required for the GC to scan an object.
Pointers and integers would just be completely separated:

     +----------+
     + integers +
     .   ...    .
     +----------+
     + reflen   +
     +----------+   &lt;------ object ptr
     .   ...    .
     + pointers +
     +----------+

A pointer to an object always points into the middle of the object. Above object ptr, all data is integer data, and below the object ptr, everything is pointer data. The &quot;reflen&quot; member can be used by the GC to find the size of the region it needs to scan.

Inherited classes just can attach their integer/pointer data above/below the data of the base address. The &quot;reflen&quot; member would need to be set correctly if the object is constructed.

Although this would be very fast (as opposed to bitmaps), it also maybe would be very hard to integrate into existing compilers/environments/toolchains. With interrior pointers, the class head would be harder to find. Arrays of structs also would be a (maybe solvable) problem.

=== Modified bidirectional memory layout ===

One also could organize pointer data in regions and link that pointer-data regions like a singly linked list (i.e. in presence of inheritance, where pointers can't be grouped into a single region).
Every pointer-data region would start with a non-pointer word containing the size of the region, and either the first word of an object would contain a pointer to the first pointer-data region, or the object would start with such a region by itsself.

==Compiler support==

===Read/Write Barriers===
Some GC need to run some code each time a reference is overwritten
and/or if a reference is read.
A flexible way can be, to give the compiler an function, to use for read
and write accesses. These functions should always be inlined and
optimized. e.g.:
 ___ref_assign( void * trg, void * src ){ trg = src; }
 void* ___ref_read( void * src ){ return src; }

===Management of pointer location info===
The allocation function of the GC should not only receive the size of
memory, which is required. It should also receive a bitfield with the
information, which words in this memory are references.

===Reference info for the stack===
each stack frame begins with the bitfield with reference information.
If the GC scans the stack, the frames have to be recognized.

===Register values===
The compiler should ensure, that reference values are always present in memory also.
So the GC do not need to scan the registers, and it does not need to know which one 
contains pointer values.

==The GC Interface==

===addRoot/removeRoot===

===enable/disable===
Implemented for concurrent. Should be recursive usable. This means it should work with a counter. The counter is incremented with each call of disable and decremented with calls to enable.

===pin/unpin===
Implemented for moving/compacting GCs.

===fullcollect===
Forces a collection cycle. The call returns after the collection cycle finished. In a Stop-the-world implementation this means, that all threads will pause. In a concurrent implementation not. A reference counting solution will return immediately.

The &lt;tt&gt;whatsnew&lt;/tt&gt; command allows you to get an overview of what unrecorded changes you have made on your working copy. 

This way you can get an idea of what needs to be saved.

[[Image:Darcs-repo-whatsnew.png|center|Darcs whatsnew]]

=== &lt;tt&gt;changes&lt;/tt&gt; ===

Changes gives a changelog-style summary of the repo history

[[Image:Darcs-repo-changes.png|center|Darcs changes]]

=== &lt;tt&gt;diff&lt;/tt&gt; ===

Using this command you can get an output like that produced by the &lt;tt&gt;diff&lt;/tt&gt; command.
Allowing you to save changes in a plain old (yet very common) format.

Note that &lt;tt&gt;darcs&lt;/tt&gt; does not depend on the &lt;tt&gt;diff&lt;/tt&gt; binary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Islam
An American friend asked me; what is Islam? Well, I replied submission to God.
     My friend wanted to know more about the religion of Islam so I decided to pot a brief introduction of Islam for whoever is interested to know about it.

     Islam has spread from Arabia Peninsula around 1400 years ago by a chosen one name Muhammad.  At the age of 40 this man was chosen to be Lord’s last messenger on Earth.  Prophet Muhammad was not able to either write or read.  He did not write the holy book Quran.  It was reveled to him by the Angle Gabriel in Mount Hara which is located in Saudi Arabia.  The religion of Islam has spread quickly all over the world.  Right now there are 108 billion Muslims in the world in the second major religion on Earth.
     There are two major sects: Sunnis whom are about 90% of the Muslims of the world and the rest are Shiite.  They both worship only one God.   Both they do disagree in the doctrines.

	Who is a true Muslim?   Anyone who believe in only God
	Who is without child, parents, or wife.
	God does not have an equal 
	God is not created by any other being.
	Any one whom believes in these rules is a Muslim 

	There are five pillars which must be followed:
	Delectation of Faith
	Five times daily Prayers
	Giving to the charity from a portion of your wealth
	Establishing a Family
	Taking a trip to Mecca for Hij if your finical situation permits you

We are peaceful people.  God has instructed us to be respectful and tolerant toward the people of scriptures’.  God has mentioned in Oran 5:87 that Lord does not like aggressors.  Also in Koran 49:13 has mentioned “O people, we created you from the same male and female and rendered distinct people, that you may recognize one another.  The best among you in the sight of God is the most righteous one:</text>

Hello!

My name is David, and I'm new here at wikibooks, well, as a contributor anyway.  I have long surfed wikipedia and wikibooks to glean information for fun and profit.

So, here I am now, ready contribute (hopefully positive) back this excellent resource and the comunity at large.

I think the first couple of things I'll help work on is the python wikibook, and then some of the help pages.  I don't quite yet fully comprehend the organisation of site, so any pointers would be useful.

The help system and information seems to be disjointed between the &quot;help&quot; and wikibooks categories.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{C sharp/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

An INTERFACE in C# is a type definition similar to a class, except that it purely represents a contract 
between an object and its user. It can neither be directly instantiated as an object, nor can data members be defined. So, an interface is nothing but a collection of method and property declarations. The following defines a simple interface:

&lt;code&gt;
  {{C sharp/kw|interface}} IShape
  {
    {{C sharp/kw|double}} X { {{C sharp/kw|get}}; {{C sharp/kw|set}}; }
    {{C sharp/kw|double}} Y { {{C sharp/kw|get}}; {{C sharp/kw|set}}; }
    {{C sharp/kw|void}} Draw();
  }
&lt;/code&gt;

A CONVENTION             used in the .NET Framework (and likewise by many C# programmers) is to place an &quot;I&quot; at the beginning of an interface name to distinguish it from a class name. Another common  interface naming convention is used when an interface declares only one key method, such as {{C sharp|Draw()}} in the above example. The interface name is then formed as an adjective by adding the &quot;...able&quot; suffix. So, the interface name above could also be {{C sharp|IDrawable}}. This convention is used throughout the .NET Framework.

Implementing an interface is simply done by inheriting off it and defining all the methods and properties declared by the interface after that. For instance,

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|class}} Square : IShape
 {
      {{C sharp/kw|private}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} _mX, _mY;
 ''
      {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Draw() { ... }
 ''
      {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} X 
      { 
           {{C sharp/kw|set}} { _mX = {{C sharp/kw|value}}; }
           {{C sharp/kw|get}} { {{C sharp/kw|return}} _mX; }  
      }
 ''
      {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} Y 
      {
           {{C sharp/kw|set}} { _mY = {{C sharp/kw|value}}; }
           {{C sharp/kw|get}} { {{C sharp/kw|return}} _mY; }
      }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

Although a class can inherit from one class only, it can inherit from any number of interfaces. This is a simplified form of multiple inheritance supported by C#. When inheriting from a class and one or more interfaces, the base class should be provided first in the inheritance list, followed by any interfaces to be implemented. For example:

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|class}} MyClass : Class1, Interface1, Interface2 { ... }
&lt;/code&gt;

Object references can be declared using an interface type. For instance, using the previous examples,

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|class}} MyClass 
 {
      {{C sharp/kw|static}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Main()
      {
           IShape shape = {{C sharp/kw|new}} Square();
           shape.Draw();
      }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

Interfaces can inherit off of any number of other interfaces, but cannot inherit from classes. For example:

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|interface}} IRotateable
 {
      {{C sharp/kw|void}} Rotate(double theta);
 }

 {{C sharp/kw|interface}} IDrawable : IRotateable
 {
      {{C sharp/kw|void}} Draw();
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

== Additional details ==

Access specifiers (i.e. {{C sharp|private}}, {{C sharp|internal}}, etc.) cannot be provided for interface members, as all members are public by default. A class implementing an interface must define all the members declared by the interface as public. The implementing class has the option of making an implemented method virtual, if it is expected to be overridden in a child class.

There are no static methods within an interface, but any static methods can be implemented in a class that manages objects using it.

In addition to methods and properties, interfaces can declare events and indexers as well.

For those familiar with Java, C#'s interfaces are extremely similar to Java's.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many older and cheaper lug centric wheel spacer design were unsafe and gave wheel spacers a bad reputation.  As a result wheel spacers are now banned in the following states.  Keep in mind that hub centric cast aluminum wheel spacers are usually perfectly safe as long as they're regularly checked for tightness.

Pronoun Usage

A pronoun comes from a Latin word that means 'for a noun'. It is a word that stands in for a noun. The English language has lots of different kinds of pronouns.

Pronouns are often divided into first, second and third person, singular and plural. First person refers to the speaker, second person refers to the person being spoken to, and third person refers to a person (or thing) neither speaking nor being spoken to.

The first person pronoun (referring to the speaker) is 'I' or 'me' in the singular, and 'we' or 'us' in the plural. The first of each set, &quot;I/we&quot;, is used as the subject of a verb; the second, 'me/us', is used as the object of a verb or preposition, which can be made 'reflexive' (i.e. they are the same person as the subject) by adding the suffix '-self' to the possessive (myself/ourselves).

The second person pronoun (referring to the person being spoken to) is 'you' in singular and plural, as subject or object. The reflexive is &quot;yourself&quot; in the singular and &quot;yourselves&quot; in the plural.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Control Flow|Conditional Statements}}

Python, like many other computer programming languages, uses Boolean logic for its decision control.  That is, the Python interpreter compares one or more values in order to decide whether to execute a piece of code or not, given the proper syntax and instructions.

Decision control is then divided into two major categories, conditional and repetition.  Conditional logic simply uses the keyword '''if''' and a Boolean expression to decide whether or not to execute a code block.  Repetition builds on the conditional constructs by giving us a simple method in which to repeat a block of code while a Boolean expression evaluates to ''true''.

== Boolean Expressions ==
Here is a little example of boolean expressions (you don't have to type it in):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 6
b = 7
c = 42
print (1, a == 6)
print (2, a == 7)
print (3, a == 6 and b == 7)
print (4, a == 7 and b == 7)
print (5, not a == 7 and b == 7)
print (6, a == 7 or b == 7)
print (7, a == 7 or b == 6)
print (8, not (a == 7 and b == 6))
print (9, not a == 7 and b == 6)
&lt;/source&gt;
With the output being:
&lt;pre&gt;
1 True
2 False
3 True
4 False
5 True
6 True
7 False
8 True
9 False
&lt;/pre&gt;
What is going on?  The program consists of a bunch of funny looking &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; statements.  Each &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; statement prints a number and an expression.  The number is to help keep track of which statement I am dealing with.  Notice how each expression ends up being either True or False; these are built-in Python values.
&lt;!-- For example: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;pre&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; if 1: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;true&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ... else: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;false&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...  --&gt;
&lt;!-- true --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; if 0: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;true&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ... else: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;false&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...  --&gt;
&lt;!-- false --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/pre&gt; --&gt;
The lines:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print (1, a == 6)
print (2, a == 7)
&lt;/source&gt;
print out True and False respectively, just as expected, since the first is true and the second is false.  The third print, &lt;tt&gt;print (3, a == 6 and b == 7)&lt;/tt&gt;, is a little different.  The operator &lt;tt&gt; and&lt;/tt&gt; means if both the statement before and the statement after are true then the whole expression is true otherwise the whole expression is false.  The next line, &lt;tt&gt;print (4, a == 7 and b == 7)&lt;/tt&gt;, shows how if part of an &lt;tt&gt; and&lt;/tt&gt; expression is false, the whole thing is false.  The behavior of &lt;tt&gt; and&lt;/tt&gt; can be summarized as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!expression 
!result 
|-  
|true and true 
|true 
|-
|true and false 
|false 
|-
|false and true 
|false
|-
|false and false 
|false
|}

Note that if the first expression is false Python does not check the second expression since it knows the whole expression is false.  

The next line, &lt;tt&gt;print (5, not a == 7 and b == 7)&lt;/tt&gt;, uses the &lt;tt&gt;not&lt;/tt&gt; operator.  &lt;tt&gt;not&lt;/tt&gt; just gives the opposite of the expression (The expression could be rewritten as &lt;tt&gt;print (5, a != 7 and b == 7)&lt;/tt&gt;).  Here's the table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!expression 
!result
|-
|not true 
|false 
|-
|not false 
|true
|}

The two following lines, &lt;tt&gt;print (6, a == 7 or b == 7)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;print (7, a == 7 or b == 6)&lt;/tt&gt;, use the &lt;tt&gt; or&lt;/tt&gt; operator.  The &lt;tt&gt; or&lt;/tt&gt; operator returns true if the first expression is true, or if the second expression is true or both are true.  If neither are true it returns false.  Here's the table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!expression 
!result
|-  
|true or true 
| true
|-
|true or false 
|true
|-
|false or true 
| true  
|-
|false or false 
| false 
|}

Note that if the first expression is true Python doesn't check the second expression since it knows the whole expression is true.  This works since &lt;tt&gt; or&lt;/tt&gt; is true if at least one of the expressions are true.  The first part is true so the second part could be either false or true, but the whole expression is still true.

The next two lines, &lt;tt&gt;print (8, not (a == 7 and b == 6))&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;print (9, not a == 7 and b == 6)&lt;/tt&gt;, show that parentheses can be used to group expressions and force one part to be evaluated first.  Notice that the parentheses changed the expression from false to true.   This occurred since the parentheses forced the &lt;tt&gt; not&lt;/tt&gt; to apply to the whole expression instead of just the &lt;tt&gt; a == 7&lt;/tt&gt; portion.

Here is an example of using a boolean expression:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [&quot;Life&quot;,&quot;The Universe&quot;,&quot;Everything&quot;,&quot;Jack&quot;,&quot;Jill&quot;,&quot;Life&quot;,&quot;Jill&quot;]

# Make a copy of the list.
copy = list[:]
# Sort the copy
copy.sort()
prev = copy[0]
del copy[0]

count = 0

# Go through the list searching for a match
while count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] != prev:
    prev = copy[count]
    count = count + 1

# If a match was not found then count can't be &lt; len
# since the while loop continues while count is &lt; len
# and no match is found
if count &lt; len(copy):
    print (&quot;First Match:&quot;,prev)
&lt;/source&gt;

See the [[Python Programming/Lists|Lists chapter]] to explain what [:] means on the first line.

Here is the output:
&lt;pre&gt;
First Match: Jill
&lt;/pre&gt;

This program works by continuing to check for a match &lt;tt&gt; while count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] != prev&lt;/tt&gt;.  When either &lt;tt&gt; count&lt;/tt&gt; is greater than the last index of &lt;tt&gt; copy&lt;/tt&gt; or a match has been found the &lt;tt&gt; and&lt;/tt&gt; is no longer true so the loop exits.  The &lt;tt&gt; if&lt;/tt&gt; simply checks to make sure that the &lt;tt&gt; while&lt;/tt&gt; exited because a match was found.  

The other 'trick' of &lt;tt&gt; and&lt;/tt&gt; is used in this example.  If you look at the table for &lt;tt&gt; and&lt;/tt&gt; notice that the third entry is &quot;false and won't check&quot;.   If &lt;tt&gt; count &gt;= len(copy)&lt;/tt&gt; (in other words &lt;tt&gt; count &lt; len(copy)&lt;/tt&gt; is false) then copy[count] is never looked at.  This is because Python knows that if the first is false then they both can't be true.  This is known as a short circuit and is useful if the second half of the &lt;tt&gt; and&lt;/tt&gt; will cause an error if something is wrong.  I used the first expression (&lt;tt&gt; count &lt; len(copy)&lt;/tt&gt;) to check and see if &lt;tt&gt; count&lt;/tt&gt; was a valid index for &lt;tt&gt; copy&lt;/tt&gt;.  (If you don't believe me remove the matches `Jill' and `Life', check that it still works and then reverse the order of &lt;tt&gt; count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] != prev&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt; copy[count] != prev and count &lt; len(copy)&lt;/tt&gt;.)

Boolean expressions can be used when you need to check two or more different things at once.

== Examples ==
password1.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
## This programs asks a user for a name and a password.
# It then checks them to make sure that the user is allowed in.
# Note that this is a simple and insecure example,
# real password code should never be implemented this way.

name = raw_input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
password = raw_input(&quot;What is the password? &quot;)
if name == &quot;Josh&quot; and password == &quot;Friday&quot;:
    print (&quot;Welcome Josh&quot;)
elif name == &quot;Fred&quot; and password == &quot;Rock&quot;:
    print (&quot;Welcome Fred&quot;)
else:
    print (&quot;I don't know you.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs
&lt;pre&gt;
What is your name? Josh
What is the password? Friday
Welcome Josh

What is your name? Bill
What is the password? Saturday
I don't know you.
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Exercises ==
# Write a program that has a user guess your name, but they only get 3 chances to do so until the program quits.

== Introduction ==

Delegates and events are fundamental to any Windows or Web Application, allowing the developer to &quot;subscribe&quot; to particular actions carried out by the user. Therefore, instead of expecting everything and filtering out what you want, you choose what you want to be notified of and react to that action.

A '''delegate''' is a way of telling C# which method to call when an event is triggered. For example, if you click a {{C sharp|Button}} on a form, the program would call a specific method. It is this pointer that is a delegate. Delegates are good, as you can notify several methods that an event has occurred, if you wish so.

An '''event''' is a notification by the .NET framework that an action has occurred. Each event contains information about the specific event, e.g., a mouse click would say which mouse button was clicked where on the form.

Let's say you write a program reacting &lt;em&gt;only to a {{C sharp|Button}} click&lt;/em&gt;. Here is the sequence of events that occurs:

* User presses the mouse button down over a button
** The .NET framework raises a {{C sharp|MouseDown}} event 
* User releases the mouse button
** The .NET framework raises a {{C sharp|MouseUp}} event
** The .NET framework raises a {{C sharp|MouseClick}} event
** The .NET framework raises a {{C sharp|Clicked}} event on the {{C sharp|Button}}

Since the button's click event has been subscribed, the rest of the events are ignored by the program and your &lt;em&gt;delegate&lt;/em&gt; tells the .NET framework which method to call, now that the event has been raised.

== Delegates ==

Delegates form the basis of event handling in C#. They are a construct for abstracting and creating objects that reference methods and can be used to call those methods. A delegate declaration specifies a particular method signature. References to one or more methods can be added to a delegate instance. The delegate instance can then be &quot;called&quot;, which effectively calls all the methods that have been added to the delegate instance. A simple example:

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|using}} System;
 {{C sharp/kw|delegate}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Procedure();
 ''
 {{C sharp/kw|class}} DelegateDemo
 {	
     {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|static}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Method1()
     {
          Console.WriteLine(&quot;Method 1&quot;);
     }
 ''
     {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|static}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Method2()
     {
          Console.WriteLine(&quot;Method 2&quot;);
     }
 ''
     {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Method3()
     {
          Console.WriteLine(&quot;Method 3&quot;);
     }
 ''
     {{C sharp/kw|static}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Main()
     {
          Procedure someProcs = {{C sharp/kw|null}};
 ''
          someProcs += {{C sharp/kw|new}} Procedure(DelegateDemo.Method1);
          someProcs += {{C sharp/kw|new}} Procedure(Method2);  // Example with omitted class name
 ''
          DelegateDemo demo = {{C sharp/kw|new}} DelegateDemo();
 ''
          someProcs += {{C sharp/kw|new}} Procedure(demo.Method3);
          someProcs();
     }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

In this example, the delegate is declared by the line {{C sharp/kw|delegate}} {{C sharp/kw|void}}{{C sharp| Procedure()}}. This statement is a complete abstraction. It does not result in executable code that does any work, but merely declares a delegate type called {{C sharp|Procedure}} that takes no arguments and returns nothing. Next, in the {{C sharp|Main()}} method, the statement {{C sharp|Procedure someProcs}} = {{C sharp/kw|null}}; instantiates a delegate. The assignment means that the delegate is not initially referencing any methods. The statements {{C sharp|someProcs}} += {{C sharp/kw|new}}{{C sharp| Procedure(DelegateDemo.Method1)}} and
{{C sharp|someProcs}} += {{C sharp/kw|new}}{{C sharp| Procedure(Method2)}} add two static methods to the delegate instance. Note that the class name can also be left off, as the statement is occurring inside {{C sharp|DelegateDemo}}. The statement {{C sharp|someProcs}} += {{C sharp/kw|new}}{{C sharp| Procedure(demo.Method3)}} adds a non-static method to the delegate instance. For a non-static method, the method name is preceded by an object reference. When the delegate instance is called, {{C sharp|Method3()}} is called on the object that was supplied when the method was added to the delegate instance. Finally, the statement {{C sharp|someProcs()}} calls the delegate instance. All the methods that were added to the delegate instance are now called in the order that they were added.

Methods that have been added to a delegate instance can be removed with the &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt; operator:

&lt;code&gt;
  someProcs -= {{C sharp/kw|new}} Procedure(DelegateDemo.Method1);
&lt;/code&gt;

In C# 2.0, adding or removing a method reference to a delegate instance can be shortened as follows:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
     someProcs += DelegateDemo.Method1;
     someProcs -= DelegateDemo.Method1;
&lt;/source&gt;

Invoking a delegate instance that presently contains no method references results in a {{C sharp|NullReferenceException}}.

Note that, if a delegate declaration specifies a return type and multiple methods are added to a delegate instance, an invocation of the delegate instance returns the return value of the last method referenced. The return values of the other methods cannot be retrieved (unless explicitly stored somewhere in addition to being returned).

== Anonymous delegates ==
Anonymous delegates are a short way to write delegate code, specified using the {{C sharp/kw|delegate}} keyword. The delegate code can also reference local variables of the function in which they are declared. Anonymous delegates are automatically converted into methods by the compiler. For example:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
delegate void Procedure();

class DelegateDemo2
{
    static Procedure someProcs = null;
    
    private static void AddProc()
    {
        int variable = 100;
 
        someProcs += new Procedure(delegate
            {
               Console.WriteLine(variable);
            });
    }
    
    static void Main()
    {
        someProcs += new Procedure(delegate { Console.WriteLine(&quot;test&quot;); });
        AddProc();
        someProcs();
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

They can accept arguments just as normal methods can:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
delegate void Procedure(string text);

class DelegateDemo3
{
    static Procedure someProcs = null;
    
    private static void AddProc()
    {
        int variable = 100;
 
        someProcs += new Procedure(delegate(string text)
            {
               Console.WriteLine(text + &quot;, &quot; + variable.ToString());
            });
    }
    
    static void Main()
    {
        someProcs += new Procedure(delegate(string text) { Console.WriteLine(text); });
        AddProc();
        someProcs(&quot;testing&quot;);
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:

 testing
 testing, 100

=== Lambda expressions ===
Lambda expressions are a clearer way to achieve the same thing as an anonymous delegate. Its form is:

 (type1 arg1, type2 arg2, ...) '''=&gt;''' ''expression''

This is equivalent to:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
delegate(type1 arg1, type2 arg2, ...)
{
    return expression;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If there is only one argument, the parentheses can be omitted. The type names can also be omitted to let the compiler infer the types from the context. In the following example, {{C sharp|str}} is a {{C sharp/kw|string}}, and the return type is an {{C sharp/kw|int}}:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
Func&lt;string, int&gt; myFunc = str =&gt; int.Parse(str);
&lt;/source&gt;

This is equivalent to:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
Func&lt;string, int&gt; myFunc = delegate(string str)
{
    return int.Parse(str);
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Events ==

An event is a special kind of delegate that facilitates event-driven programming. Events are class members that cannot be called outside of the class regardless of its access specifier. So, for example, an event declared to be public would allow other classes the use of &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt; on the event, but firing the event (i.e. invoking the delegate) is only allowed in the class containing the event. A simple example:

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|delegate}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} ButtonClickedHandler();
 {{C sharp/kw|class}} Button
 {
     {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|event}} ButtonClickedHandler ButtonClicked;	
     {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} SimulateClick()
     {
          {{C sharp/kw|if}} (ButtonClicked != {{C sharp/kw|null}})
          {
               ButtonClicked();
          }
     }
 ''
     ...
 ''
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

A method in another class can then subscribe to the event by adding one of its methods to the event delegate:

&lt;code&gt;
 Button b = {{C sharp/kw|new}} Button();
 b.ButtonClicked += MyHandler;
&lt;/code&gt;

Even though the event is declared public, it cannot be directly fired anywhere except in the class containing it.

Hello!

My name is David, and I'm new here at wikibooks, well, as a contributor anyway.  I have long surfed wikipedia and wikibooks to glean information for fun and profit.

So, here I am now, ready contribute (hopefully positive) back this excellent resource and the comunity at large.

I think the first couple of things I'll help work on is the python wikibook, and then some of the help pages.  I don't quite yet fully comprehend the organisation of site, so any pointers would be useful.

The help system and information seems to be disjointed between the &quot;help&quot; and wikibooks categories.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Basics in limiting public access to documents =

This guide is based on the site installed with the Website Wizard package and is therefore referencing specific templates and documenttypes from this installation. However the basics apply to other templates and documenttypes as well.

==== Approaching protection ====

You have two ways of protecting one or more documents in [[Umbraco]].

#Access based on a simple shared login and password. 
#Access based on memberGroups - memberTypes and Members

==== Install the Member Controls package ====

If you can't find it at [http://rtk-cv.dk/1050.aspx rtk-cv.dk] then you will have to ask in the [http://forum.umbraco.org Umbraco Forum]

After installing the package you will have 3 new macros in your Developer/Macros section.

*Member Login
*Member Password Reminder
*Member Signup

==== Create a template ====

You need to create a template to hold the login function. This has to be done for either approach and is done in the 'Settings' section of your [[Umbraco]] installation.

*Rightclick on 'Templates' and click 'Create'.
*Give the template a descriptive name fx. 'Login'
*Go to the Textpage template and copy alt its contents to the clipboard
*Go to your newly created Login template and paste the contents of your clipboard
*Set the Login template's parent template to your master template
*Make a new line right after your '&lt;?UMBRACO_GETITEM field=&quot;bodyText&quot;/&gt;'
*Add in a '&lt;?ASPNET_FORM&gt;' field.
*Click 'Insert umbraco macro' icon in the toolbar and select 'Member Login' from the dropdown combo and click 'OK'
*Add in a '&lt;/?ASPNET_FORM&gt;' after the macro insert.
*Fill in the fields with your desired text and click 'OK'
*Save your template
*Finally allow the basic document to inherit the Login template by opening 'Document Types', clicking your 'Textpage' type and in the 'Allowed Templates' section check the 'Login' template
*Save your document type

==== Create a login page. ====

*Go to the 'Contents' of your installation.
*Rightclick on your 'Frontpage' document and select 'Create'
*Set your document type to 'Textpage' and name it 'Login' (or whatever you prefer) and click 'OK'
*Select your new 'Login' document
*Select 'Properties' and change the template to the 'Login' template
*Save your document

==== Protect your document(s) ====

If the document you are applying protection to has child documents these documents are protected as well.

The easy approach to protecting documents is one single username/password and this is achieved by 

*Right-clicking your document and selecting 'Public Access'
*Select the 'Simple: ....' link
*Fill in username and password
*Click 'Choose' to select your login page and browse to your 'Login' document
*Do the same with 'Error page' and select your 'Login' document
*Click 'Update'

==== Advanced protection ====

If you want more control over the access to the documents you can apply security on a memberGroup basis.

If you choose this approach you will have to go to the Members Section before applying security on the document(s).

*In the Members Section you start by adding a Member Group.
*The Member Group can contain several different Member Types which can be assigned to Members.
*When you have created a Member Group and at least one Member Type, create a user.

If you start using Member Groups you might want to look into how to create password reminders and even automated user registration.

==== Important ====

When assigning security on documents it is important to remember that '''both Login page and Error page has to be defined'''. They can easily be the same page but both has to be selected. If you fail to do so you will get a servererror when trying to update the settings.

==== Other resources ====
If you prefer some visualizing you could goto Niels Hartvigs online [http://hartvig.com/screencasts/members.htm Screen Cast] showing how to protect documents in [[Umbraco]] CMS. There is also a reference [[Umbraco/Reference/Members|here]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Decision Control|Loops}}

== Decisions ==
A '''Decision''' is when a program has more than one choice of actions depending on a variable's value. Think of a traffic light. When it is green, we continue our drive.  When we see the light turn yellow, we reduce our speed, and when it is red, we stop. These are logical decisions that depend on the value of the traffic light. Luckily, Python has a decision statement to help us when our application needs to make such decision for the user.

== If statement ==
Here is a warm-up exercise - a short program to compute the absolute value of a number:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;absoval.py&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
n = raw_input(&quot;Integer? &quot;)#Pick an integer.  And remember, if raw_input is not supported by your OS, use input()
n = int(n)#Defines n as the integer you chose. (Alternatively, you can define n yourself)
if n &lt; 0:
    print (&quot;The absolute value of&quot;,n,&quot;is&quot;,-n)
else:
    print (&quot;The absolute value of&quot;,n,&quot;is&quot;,n)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is the output from the two times that I ran this program:
&lt;pre&gt;
Integer? -34
The absolute value of -34 is 34

Integer? 1
The absolute value of 1 is 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

What does the computer do when it sees this piece of code?  First it prompts the user for a number with the statement &quot;&lt;tt&gt;n = raw_input(&quot;Integer? &quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. Next it reads the line &quot;&lt;tt&gt;if n &lt; 0:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. If &lt;tt&gt; n&lt;/tt&gt; is less than zero Python runs the line &quot;&lt;tt&gt;print &quot;The absolute value of&quot;,n,&quot;is&quot;,-n&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. Otherwise python runs the line &quot;&lt;tt&gt;print &quot;The absolute value of&quot;,n,&quot;is&quot;,n&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.  

More formally, Python looks at whether the ''expression'' &lt;tt&gt; n &lt; 0&lt;/tt&gt; is true or false. An &lt;tt&gt; if&lt;/tt&gt; statement is followed by an indented ''block'' of statements that are run when the expression is true. After the &lt;tt&gt; if&lt;/tt&gt; statement is an optional &lt;tt&gt; else&lt;/tt&gt; statement and another indented ''block'' of statements. This 2nd block of statements is run if the expression is false.  

Expressions can be tested several different ways.  Here is a table of all of them:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!operator 
!function
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; 
|less than
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt; 
|less than or equal to
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; 
|greater than
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; 
|greater than or equal to
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; 
|equal
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;!=&lt;/tt&gt; 
|not equal
|}


Another feature of the &lt;tt&gt; if&lt;/tt&gt; command is the &lt;tt&gt; elif &lt;/tt&gt; statement. It stands for &quot;else if,&quot; which means that if the original &lt;tt&gt; if&lt;/tt&gt; statement is false and the &lt;tt&gt; elif&lt;/tt&gt; statement is true, execute the block of code following the &lt;tt&gt;elif&lt;/tt&gt; statement. Here's an example:
&lt;br /&gt;
ifloop.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 0
while a &lt; 10:
    a = a + 1
    if a &gt; 5:
        print (a,&quot;&gt;&quot;,5)
    elif a &lt;= 7:
        print (a,&quot;&lt;=&quot;,7)
    else:
        print (&quot;Neither test was true&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

and the output:

&lt;pre&gt;
1 &lt;= 7
2 &lt;= 7
3 &lt;= 7
4 &lt;= 7
5 &lt;= 7
6 &gt; 5
7 &gt; 5
8 &gt; 5
9 &gt; 5
10 &gt; 5
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice how the &lt;tt&gt; elif a &lt;= 7&lt;/tt&gt; is only tested when the &lt;tt&gt; if&lt;/tt&gt; statement fails to be true.  &lt;tt&gt; elif&lt;/tt&gt; allows multiple tests to be done in a single if statement.

=== If Examples ===

&lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;High_low.py&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Plays the guessing game higher or lower 
# (originally written by Josh Cogliati, improved by Quique, now improved
# by Sanjith, further improved by VorDd, with continued improvement from
# the various Wikibooks contributors.)
 
# This should actually be something that is semi random like the
# last digits of the time or something else, but that will have to
# wait till a later chapter.  (Extra Credit, modify it to be random
# after the Modules chapter)
 
# This is for demonstration purposes only. 
# It is not written to handle invalid input like a full program would.
 
answer = 23
question = 'What number am I thinking of?  '
print ('Let\'s play the guessing game!')

while True:
    guess = int(input(question))

    if guess &lt; answer:
        print ('Little higher')
    elif guess &gt; answer:
        print ('Little lower')
    else: # guess == answer
        print ('MINDREADER!!!')
        break
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample run:
&lt;pre&gt;
Let's play the guessing game!
What number am I thinking of?  22
Little higher
What number am I thinking of?  25
Little Lower
What number am I thinking of?  23
MINDREADER!!!
&lt;/pre&gt;

As it states in its comments, this code is not prepared to handle invalid input (''i.e.'', strings instead of numbers). If you are wondering how you would implement such functionality in Python, you are referred to the [[Python_Programming/Errors|Errors Chapter]] of this book, where you will learn about error handling. For the above code you may try this slight modification of the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
while True:
	inp = input(question)
	try:
		guess = int(inp)
	except ValueError:
		print('Your guess should be a number')
	else:
		if guess &lt; answer:
			print ('Little higher')
		elif guess &gt; answer:
			print ('Little lower')
		else: # guess == answer
			print ('MINDREADER!!!')
			break
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;even.py&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Asks for a number.
#Prints if it is even or odd

print (&quot;Input [x] for exit.&quot;)

while True:
	inp = input(&quot;Tell me a number: &quot;)
	if inp == 'x':
		break
	# catch any resulting ValueError during the conversion to float
	try:
		number = float(inp)
	except ValueError:
		print('I said: Tell me a NUMBER!')
	else:
		test = number % 2
		if test == 0:
			print (int(number),&quot;is even.&quot;)
		elif test == 1:
			print (int(number),&quot;is odd.&quot;)
		else:
			print (int(number),&quot;is very strange.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs.
&lt;pre&gt;
Tell me a number: 3
3 is odd.

Tell me a number: 2
2 is even.

Tell me a number: 3.14159
3.14159 is very strange.
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== If Exercises ===
# Write a password guessing program to keep track of how many times the user has entered the password wrong. If it is more than 3 times, print ''You have been denied access.'' and terminate the program. If the password is correct, print ''You have successfully logged in.'' and terminate the program.
# Write a program that asks for two numbers.  If the sum of the numbers is greater than 100, print ''That is a big number'' and terminate the program.
# Write a program that asks the user their name.  If they enter your name, say &quot;That is a nice name.&quot;  If they enter &quot;John Cleese&quot; or &quot;Michael Palin&quot;, tell them how you feel about them ;), otherwise tell them &quot;You have a nice name.&quot;
# Ask the user to enter the password. If the password is correct print &quot;You have successfully logged in&quot; and exit the program. If the password is wrong print &quot;Sorry the password is wrong&quot; and ask the user to enter the password 3 times. If the password is wrong print &quot;You have been denied access&quot; and  exit the program.

=== Conditional Statements ===
Many languages (like Java and PHP) have the concept of a one-line conditional (called The Ternary Operator), often used to simplify conditionally accessing a value.  For instance (in Java):
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
int in= ; // read from program input

// a normal conditional assignment
int res;
if(number &lt; 0)
  res = -number;
else
  res = number;

// this can be simplified to
int res2 = (number &lt; 0) ? -number : number;
&lt;/source&gt;

For many years Python did not have the same construct natively, however you could replicate it by constructing a tuple of results and calling the test as the index of the tuple, like so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
number = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter a number to get its absolute value:&quot;))
res = (-number, number)[number &gt; 0]
&lt;/source&gt;

It is important to note that, unlike a built in conditional statement, both the true and false branches are evaluated before returning, which can lead to unexpected results and slower executions if you're not careful.  To resolve this issue, and as a better practice, wrap whatever you put in the tuple in anonymous function calls (lambda notation) to prevent them from being evaluated until the desired branch is called:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
number = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter a number to get its absolute value:&quot;))
res = (lambda: number, lambda: -number)[number &lt; 0]()
&lt;/source&gt;

Since Python 2.5 however, there has been an equivalent operator to The Ternary Operator (though not called such, and with a totally different syntax):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
number = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter a number to get its absolute value:&quot;))
res = -number if number &lt; 0 else number
&lt;/source&gt;

== Switch ==
A switch is a control statement present in most computer programming languages to minimize a bunch of If - elif statements. Sadly Python doesn't officially support this statement, but with the clever use of an array or dictionary, we can recreate this Switch statement that depends on a value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = 1

def hello():
  print (&quot;Hello&quot;)

def bye():
  print (&quot;Bye&quot;)

def hola():
  print (&quot;Hola is Spanish for Hello&quot;)

def adios():
  print (&quot;Adios is Spanish for Bye&quot;)

# Notice that our switch statement is a regular variable, only that we added the function's name inside
# and there are no quotes
menu = [hello,bye,hola,adios]

# To call our switch statement, we simply make reference to the array with a pair of parentheses
# at the end to call the function
menu[3]()   # calls the adios function since is number 3 in our array.

menu[0]()   # Calls the hello function being our first element in our array.

menu[x]()   # Calls the bye function as is the second element on the array x = 1
&lt;/source&gt;

This works because Python stores a reference of the function in the array at its particular index, and by adding a pair of parentheses we are actually calling the function. Here the last line is equivalent to:

==Another way. Using function through user Input==
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;

go = &quot;y&quot;
x = 0
def hello():
  print (&quot;Hello&quot;)
 
def bye():
  print (&quot;Bye&quot;)
 
def hola():
  print (&quot;Hola is Spanish for Hello&quot;)
 
def adios():
  print (&quot;Adios is Spanish for Bye&quot;)

menu = [hello, bye, hola, adios]
 

while x &lt; len(menu) :
    print &quot;function&quot;, menu[x].__name__, &quot;, press &quot; , &quot;[&quot; + str(x) + &quot;]&quot;
    x += 1
    
while go != &quot;n&quot;:
    c = input(&quot;Select Function: &quot;)
    menu[c]()
    go = raw_input(&quot;Try again? [y/n]: &quot;)

print &quot;\nBye!&quot;
   

#end

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Another way ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if x == 0:
    hello()
elif x == 1:
    bye()
elif x == 2:
    hola()
else:
    adios()
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Another way ===

Another way is to use lambdas. Code pasted here with permissions[http://simonwillison.net/2004/May/7/switch/]{{dead link}}. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
result = {
  'a': lambda x: x * 5,
  'b': lambda x: x + 7,
  'c': lambda x: x - 2
}[value](x)
&lt;/source&gt;

For more information on ''lambda'' see [[Python_Programming/Functions#Lambda_expressions|anonymous functions]] in the function section.

Documentation is the process of leaving information about your code.  The two mechanisms for doing this in Python are comments and documentation strings.

== Comments ==

There will always be a time in which you have to return to your code.  Perhaps it is to fix a bug, or to add a new feature.  Regardless, looking at your own code after six months is almost as bad as looking at someone else's code.  What one needs is a means to leave reminders to yourself as to what you were doing.

For this purpose, you leave comments.  Comments are little snippets of text embedded inside your code that are ignored by the Python interpreter.  A comment is denoted by the hash character (#) and extends to the end of the line.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
# commentexample.py

# Display the knights that come after Scene 24
print(&quot;The Knights Who Say Ni!&quot;)
# print(&quot;I will never see the light of day!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, you can also use comments to temporarily remove segments of your code, like the second print statement.

=== Comment Guidelines ===

The following guidelines are from [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP 8], written by [[w:Guido van Rossum|Guido van Rossum]].

* General
** Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments.  Always make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes!
** Comments should be complete sentences.  If a comment is a phrase or sentence, its first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter (never alter the case of identifiers!).
** If a comment is short, the period at the end can be omitted.  Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of complete sentences, and each sentence should end in a period.
** You should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period.
** When writing English, [[w:Strunk and White|Strunk and White]] applies.
** Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please write your comments in English, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never be read by people who don't speak your language.
* Inline Comments
** An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement.  Inline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement.  They should start with a # and a single space.
** Inline comments are unnecessary and in fact distracting if they state the obvious.  Don't do this: &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;x = x + 1  # Increment x&lt;/source&gt; But sometimes, this is useful: &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;x = x + 1  # Compensate for border&lt;/source&gt;

== Documentation Strings ==

But what if you just want to know how to use a function, class, or method?  You could add comments before the function, but comments are inside the code, so you would have to pull up a text editor and view them that way.  But you can't pull up comments from a C extension, so that is less than ideal.  You could always write a separate text file with how to call the functions, but that would mean that you would have to remember to update that file.  If only there was a mechanism for being able to embed the documentation and get at it easily...

Fortunately, Python has such a capability.  Documentation strings (or docstrings) are used to create easily-accessible documentation.  You can add a docstring to a function, class, or module by adding a string as the first indented statement.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
# docstringexample.py

&quot;&quot;&quot;Example of using documentation strings.&quot;&quot;&quot;

class Knight:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    An example class.
    
    Call spam to get bacon.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    
    def spam(eggs=&quot;bacon&quot;):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Prints the argument given.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        print(eggs)
&lt;/source&gt;

The convention is to use triple-quoted strings, because it makes it easier to add more documentation spanning multiple lines.

To access the documentation, you can use the &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; function inside a Python shell with the object you want help on, or you can use the &lt;code&gt;pydoc&lt;/code&gt; command from your system's shell.  If we were in the directory where docstringexample.py lives, one could enter &lt;code&gt;pydoc docstringexample&lt;/code&gt; to get documentation on that module.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Modules|Errors}}

Modules are libraries that can be called from other scripts. For example, a popular module is the &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; module. You can call it using:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;import time&lt;/source&gt;

Then, create a new python file, you can name it anything (except time.py, since it'd mess up python's module importing, you'll see why later):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import time

def main():
    # define the variable 'current_time' as a tuple of time.localtime()
    current_time = time.localtime() 
    print(current_time)              # print the tuple
    
    # if the year is 2009 (first value in the current_time tuple)
    if current_time[0] == 2009: 
        print('The year is 2009')    # print the year

if __name__ == '__main__':     # if the function is the main function ...
    main() # ...call it

&lt;/source&gt;

Modules can be called in a various number of ways. For example, we could alias the time module with the reserved word as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import time as t    # import the time module and call it 't'

def main():
    current_time = t.localtime() 
    print(current_time)
    if current_time[0] == 2009: 
        print('The year is 2009')

if __name__ == '__main__': 
    main()
&lt;/source&gt;

It is not necessary to import the whole module. If you only need a certain function or class, use from-import. Note that a from-import would import the name directly into the global namespace. In other words, when invoking the imported function, don't include the module's name:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from time import localtime         #1

def main():
    current_time = localtime()     #2
    print(current_time)
    if current_time[0] == 2009: 
        print 'The year is 2009'

if __name__ == '__main__': 
    main()
&lt;/source&gt;

The from-import form can also be aliased:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from time import localtime as lt 

def main():
    current_time = lt()
    print(current_time)
    if current_time[0] == 2009: 
        print('The year is 2009')

if __name__ == '__main__': 
    main()
&lt;/source&gt;

{{TODO|Describe how modules are searched}}
{{TODO|Describe relative import and absolute import and the evil of relative import}}

People who do test-first programming or perform regression testing
write
a main() function in every Python module, and
a [[Java Programming/Understanding a Java Program | main() method in every Java class]],
to run automated tests.
When a person executes the file directly,
the main() function executes and runs the automated tests for that file.
When a person executes some other Python file
that in turn imports many other Python files,
only one main() function is executed --
the main() function of the directly-executed file.

== Summary ==
Every module can be easily searched or imported. A module is just an ordinary file in the form &lt;code&gt;&lt;filename&gt;.py&lt;/code&gt;.  A module called &lt;code&gt;mymodule.py&lt;/code&gt; can be imported into &lt;code&gt;main.py&lt;/code&gt; by inserting &lt;code&gt;import mymodule.py&lt;/code&gt; at the top of &lt;code&gt;main.py&lt;/code&gt;.  After importing &lt;code&gt;mymodule.py&lt;/code&gt;, you can modify and use the module's functions and variables in main.py. To access them, use the form &lt;code&gt;mymodule.myfunction()&lt;/code&gt;.  To access any documentation, use the form &lt;code&gt;pydoc mymodule&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WMOG-header}}
Cleaning up a garden bed can be a joy, but can also be daunting if the bed hasn't been maintained on a regular basis. By organizing the cleanup into separate tasks, the gardener can concentrate on getting one thing done at a time, perhaps breaking up the chores over different days, or having one gardener start with the first step, and another gardener working on the next.

The most important thing is to keep cleaned up as the work progresses, meaning that the gardener shouldn't start the next step before cleaning up after the previous one. Cleaning up is often more time consuming and physically arduous than doing the actual chores,so it should not be left for the end of the day.

Garden bed cleanup:

*Initial run-through
::The initial run-through is the time for taking care of the big problems such as large weeds, dead plants, debris, etc. This should always be done first because if the gardener is called away to other tasks, at least the major eyesores will be taken care of. This stage of the cleanup doesn't require tools, just eyes and hands. If something requires tools, just wait for a later step, since there's only so much room on a tool belt and while you're removing the big stuff it's best to have both hands free.
**Pull big, easy weeds
**Leave small weeds in areas that can be cultivated using a hoe
**If transplanting or potting up volunteers, do this during the initial run through and pot them up or heel them right away (see [[../Plant Rescues/]])
*[[../Edging|Edge]], if necessary.
*Go through with weeding tool and pruners or loppers.
**Cut down or dig out large weeds that can't be pulled.
**Get weeds that can’t be gotten by root with hand-pulling
**Cut any tree saplings too large for the weeder
*Cultivate in any open areas using a hoe or other cultivator
*Prune if appropriate, and divide any large plants (depending on season).
*Detail around plant crowns (areas not able to be cultivated), and take care of any dead stems or foliage.
*Clean up thoroughly
*Pick up any piles of rocks or other debris present.
*Add plants, if desired
*Irrigate well
*Add mulch or pre-emergents, if desired

      <comment>/* The Moving Average Filter */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Filtering is a broad subject. For the MATlab wiki I will focus on how to implement filters. For more on the theory of filtering the reader should reference the [[Digital Signal Processing]] wiki book.


=== The Moving Average Filter ===

Formula:

&lt;math&gt;y[n] = \frac{1}{h} \sum_{p=0}^{h-1} x[n-p] &lt;/math&gt;

MATLAB implementation(All the code here was intended to be put in an M-file):
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
 clc;
 clear;             % clear all 
 
 v=.01
 f=100;
 fs=5000;
 t=0:1/fs:.03
 x=sin(2*pi*f*t);                             %original signal
 
 r=sqrt(v)*randn(1,length(t));                %noise
 Xw=x+r;                                      %signal plus noise (filter input)
                                              % I have chosen h=3 
 for n=3:length(Xw),
    y(n)=sum(Xw(n-2:n))/3;       %y[n] is the filtered signal
 end
 
 plot(y);
 hold;
  
 plot(x,'r');                                 %plot the original signal over top the  
                                              %filtered signal to see the difference
&lt;/source&gt;
The moving average filter is simple and effective. One of the things that is a problem is the lag associated with the moving average filter. The more samples used the longer the lag experienced(All filters have lag). How much lag can be tolerated is up to the individual.

=== The Alpha Beta filter ===

=== The Kalman Filter ===

The Kalman filter is a recursive method of combining two estimates to determine the truth.
A few parameters that are widely used are the initial conditions or current value and measured data.

Equation:



Example: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
 n=100;
 sigma=(20/6076);
 R=100;
 Rm=R+sigma*randn;
 Rs(1)=Rm(1);
 Cs=sigma^2
 
 for i=2:n
    Rm(i)=R+sigma*randn;
    alpha=Cs/(Cs+sigma^2);
    Rs(i)=Rs(i-1)+alpha*(Rm(i)-Rs(i-1));
    Cs=(1-alpha)*Cs;
 end
&lt;/source&gt;
All this code does is take a constant value R and adds noise to it. Then it filters the new signal in an effort to separate the noise from the original signal.

=== The discrete Fourier transform ===

We can move around in the editor by first entering command mode, and then using the {{vi/key|h}}, {{vi/key|j}}, {{vi/key|k}}, and {{vi/key|l}} keys.

; Note: your arrow keys may be set up to work, and you can use them if you like, but for proficiency and for advanced work later, you should learn to use the letter keys.

* The {{vi/key|h}} key, in command mode, moves the cursor one character '''left'''.
* The {{vi/key|j}} key, in command mode, moves the cursor one character '''down'''.
* The {{vi/key|k}} key, in command mode, moves the cursor one character '''up'''.
* The {{vi/key|l}} key, in command mode, moves the cursor one character '''right'''.

If you have trouble remembering this, keep in mind that {{vi/key|h}} is leftmost, the letter {{vi/key|j}}goes down below the line, the letter {{vi/key|k}}pokes up above the line, and the {{vi/key|l}} key is rightmost. (J also resembles an arrow pointing downward, if you squint a bit.)

After you have moved the cursor using those keys, you can enter insert mode again by pressing {{vi/key|i}}. When you do this, you insert text at the cursor, inserting text between the character to the '''left''' of the cursor and the '''current''' position of the cursor. Let's practice this in an exercise.

      <comment>/* Pronoun drop */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Verbs in the present tense of Croatian are simpler than those of English.  ''Pišem'' can mean ''I write'', ''I do write'', or ''I am writing''.  In the present tense, verbs can be categorized into three basic types, as: znati, raditi, pisati.  As it is difficult to distinguish which category a verb belongs to, it is often given in the infinitive and present forms. For most verbs, the present forms can be deduced from the first person singular (exceptions: biti, htjeti, moći). The infinitive and the first person singular present form are the so-called &quot;principal forms&quot; of a Croatian verb.

To form verbs in the present tense, if the first person singular present is not known:&lt;br/&gt;
Start with the infinitive: znati &lt;br/&gt;
Remove the final three letters: znati  = zn + -a + -ti =  zn-&lt;br/&gt;
Add the appropriate endings, i.e.: (ja) zn'''am'''&lt;br/&gt;

The best way is to memorize the 1st person singular to create the other forms without any problems.

=== Verbs like ''znati'' (principal form: ''-am'')=== 
'''znati''', ''to know''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!width=&quot;75&quot;|Pronouns
!width=&quot;250&quot;|Verb Forms

|-
| on/ono/ona || zn'''a'''
|-
| mi || zn'''amo'''
|-
| vi || zn'''ate'''
|-
| oni/one/ona || zn'''aju'''
|}

=== Verbs like ''raditi'' (principal form: ''-im'') === 
'''raditi''', ''to work'', ''to do''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!width=&quot;75&quot;|Pronouns
!width=&quot;250&quot;|Verb Forms
|- 
| ja || rad'''im'''
|-
| ti || rad'''iš'''
|-
| on/ono/ona || rad'''i'''
|-
| mi || rad'''imo'''
|-
| vi || rad'''ite'''
|-

|-
| vi || pi'''sj'''ete (s+j=&gt;š) piš'''ete'''
|-
| oni/one/ona || pi'''sj'''u (s+j=&gt;š) piš'''u'''
|}
=== Verbs like ''ići'' (principal form: ''-em'') === 
'''ići''', ''to go''&lt;br&gt;
ići = id + -ti = id-
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!width=&quot;75&quot;|Pronouns
!width=&quot;250&quot;|Verb Forms
|- 
| ja || id'''em'''
|-
| ti || id'''eš'''
|-
| on/ono/ona || id'''e'''
|-
| mi || id'''emo'''
|-
| vi || id'''ete'''
|-
| oni/one/ona || id'''u'''
|}

=== Infinitive === 

It ends on '''-ti''' or '''-ći'''

-TI: '''raditi''', ''to work''; '''spavati''', ''to sleep''; '''igrati''', ''to play''; 
'''jesti''', ''to eat''; '''trčati''', ''to run''; '''ubiti''', ''to kill''; '''tražiti''', ''to search''; '''piti''', ''to drink'';

-ĆI: '''ići''', ''to go''; '''teći''', ''to flow''; '''reći''', ''to say''; '''moći''', ''to be able to, can'';

=== Pronouns (accusative form) ===

In Croatian language reflexive pronouns have 2 forms: shorter and longer. It is often better to use shorter form than longer one. Longer ones can sometimes be used on the beginning of a sentence while short forms can't.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!width=&quot;75&quot;|Pronouns
!width=&quot;200&quot;|Accusative form
!width=&quot;200&quot;|Shorter
|- 
| ja || mene || me
|-
| ti || tebe || te
|-
| on/ona/ono || njega/nju/njega || ga/ju/ga or nj/je/nj 
|-
| mi || nas 
|-
| vi || vas
|-
| oni/one/ona || njih || ih
|}
Here is an example:&lt;br&gt;
Vidim je. - I see her.

===Pronoun drop===
Croatian, like all other Slavic languages and the Romance ones as well, is a pro-drop language. This means that personal pronouns (I, you, etc.) are omitted from most sentences. Because the verb stem ending clearly indicates who performs the action, it is not necessary to put pronouns, unless it is for emphasis.

For example: '''Razumijem hrvatski.''', ''I understand Croatian''.&lt;br&gt;
From this sentence, we know that the speaker is speaking in the first person singular.

Exceptions to pro-drop:

#For emphasis, e.g., 
::'''Tko zna odgovor?''', ''Who knows the answer?''
::'''Ja znam!''', ''I know''

#Two verbs '''htjeti''' and '''biti''' have longer forms that are used as answers to questions. They can be translated as &quot;I/you/he/she/it/we/they did&quot; or in some cases &quot;I am/You are/He is/She is/It is/We are/They are&quot; (when confirming identity).
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
|
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;biti
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;center&gt;htjeti
|-
|Person  
|Affirmative
|Negative 
|Affirmative
|Negative
|- 
| Ja/I
| Jesam
| Nisam
| Hoću
| Neću (or ne ću)
|-
| Ti/You (sing.)
| Jesi
| Nisi
| Hoćeš
| Nećeš (or ne ćeš)
|-
| On,ona,ono/he,she,it
| Jest
| Nije
| Hoće
| Neće (or ne će)
|-
| Mi/we
| Jesmo
| Nismo
| Hoćemo
| Nećemo (or ne ćemo)
|-
| Vi/You (plur.)
| Jeste
| Niste
| Hoćete
| Nećete (ne ćete)
|-
| Oni,One,Ona/They
| Jesu
| Nisu
| Hoće
| Neće (or ne će)
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
*Negative forms of the verb '''htjeti''' can be written in two ways: '''neću''' or '''ne ću'''. I, as croatian native speaker, prefer this first form, &quot;neću&quot;. Of course, both forms are correct.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Self Interest and Social Behavior'' introduces you to decision theory and game theory by considering important applications throughout the social sciences. 

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
Some sample questions we will ponder:&lt;br /&gt;
GREED or ALTRUISM ??&lt;br /&gt;
When do people sacrifice for others?&lt;br /&gt;
How about animals?&lt;br /&gt;
Or is there really a payoff for them after all?
&lt;/div&gt;

Social behavior, in general, involves actions taken by individuals that, at least when aggregated over a group, affect other individuals. We want to predict and explain this behavior. Viewing this as scientists, we would like to discover, in effect, any “natural laws” that determine this behavior, if not for all environments then for some.  One candidate for such a law of social behavior, one that may offer the foundation for a paradigm for each of the social sciences, is that individuals behave to further their own self interest. These models are relatively simple, powerful in their predictions, and might apply to all social behavior. ''Self Interest and Social Behavior'' examines these models, builds up their mathematical infrastructure as necessary, and examines these models and their implications through important applications throughout the social sciences. These applications clearly come from economics, political science, psychology, and anthropology, but also biology and philosophy whenever they try to predict or explain social behavior. We intend to demonstrate that these models should, at a minimum, be considered seriously because of their simplicity, their power, and their potentially wide scope.

Models of individuals furthering their own self interest are formalized with either decision theory or game theory. '''Decision theory''' is the mathematics of optimizing behavior, where choices are made that further self interest against an environment that does not change in response to these choices. In decision theory, each individual’s choices can be considered independently of choices that any other individual makes. It can be the foundation of either rational choice models or of evolutionary models. '''Game theory''', building upon the foundation of decision theory, is the mathematics of strategic decisions, decisions where the value of the outcome to each individual depends upon the actions that other individuals take as well as actions that the decision maker takes herself. The rival’s choices may be influenced by the first individual’s choices. In game theory, an individual’s choices are interdependent with other individual’s choices. These &quot;choices&quot; might actually be rational choices that individuals make, or they may be the implicit &quot;choices&quot; that natural selection or cultural selection make, in that other alternatives nearly vanish in later populations.

:C ) The brain and the neurons
:D )The brain and the spinal cord

10. Explain what LTP does to enhance communication between two neurons, on the postsynaptic end.
*More receptors, such as AMPA receptors, are added and existing ones are sensitized via phosphorylation. Dendritic spine number and surface area is increased as well.

11. Explain what LTP does to enhance communication between two neurons, on the presynaptic end.
*If the retrograde messenger theory is correct, presynaptic cells participate in the enhancement by increasing the probability of synaptic vesicle release. (Please remember the retrograde messenger is theoretical, I just thought it should be  included here)

==Senses==

===Critical Thinking: Vision===
1. Explain why you are normally unaware of your blind spot.
:*Since your eyes are looking from different angles, they see each other's blind spot and your brain combines the two images.

2.Stare at a bright light for 10 seconds and then stare at a white sheet of paper. What do you observe and why?
:*You should observe a negative afterimage. This happens when the rod/cone (mostly cone) cells in your eye adapt to the stimulus and lose their sensitivity, leaving you with the negative of the color that was adapted to.

3. What is it that makes things &quot;disappear&quot; when you are staring at them at night, and how do you make them reappear?
:*There are no rods in the fovea, so little light is picked up when you stare directly at the object. To make it reappear, just don't look right at it.

4. Name what rods are sensitive to and also what cones are sensitive to.
:*Rods are more sensitive to lower light levels, but lack color-seeing ability. Cones work in brighter light and perceive color (blue, green, red).

5. Explain how Deadly Nightshade works
:*Normally, the parasympathetic nervous system constricts the pupil as needed with acetylcholine. The atropine in nightshade is a competitive agonist on the same receptor as the one that accepts acetylcholine. Basically: the atropine takes up all of the places for acetylcholine to bind, and the pupils dilate.

===Critical Thinking: Hearing===
1. Explain how the pitch of sound is coded. How is the loudness of sound coded?

2. What do the three semicircular canals in the inner ear enable us to do? How do they accomplish this?
:*Each of the three fluid filled canals is on a different plane. Movement is detected on these planes when the fluid inside moves around, vibrating cilia on the cupula which sends it on to the brain.

3. What does the eustachian tube do? What does the eustachian tube have to do with a middle ear infection?
:*The eustachian tube is to keep pressure in the middle ear the same as atmospheric pressure. If the tube is blocked, the gases in the ear will diffuse back into the surrounding tissues and a vacuum will be made. Eventually, this will pull fluid in and if it becomes infected... You have an ear infection.

4. What is the advantage of having a oval window?

Sound transducted from air to a more dense medium (endolymph, in scala media where the organ of cortis is placed) would be partially reflected and greatly weakened if not for the ossicular bones that transfer the vibration from membrana tymphani trough malleus, incus and stapes to the foramen ovale where it puts the liquids of cochlea in motion. This motion is then transfered trough membrana vestibularis to membrana basilaris, which in turn puts the haircells in motion. This leads to a bending of the stereocills, fastened to membrana tectori, and as a result; a depolarization of the afferent sensory fibre receptor of n. cochlearis through release of glutamate.
The loss of energy in transduction is partially re-gained by the size of membr. tympani compared to the size of foramen ovale and the rotation of the ossicular bones.

===Review Questions===
1.  Located under the hardest bone in the body, these control not only hearing but also a sense of gravity and motion:
:A) The incus and the stapes
:B) The pinna and the ear drum
:C) the vestibular nerve and the semi circular canals
:D) The eustachian tube and the stapes

2.   The retina does the following;
:A) allows vision in light and dark, using cones and rods
:B) Gives depth perception using binocular vision
:C) Contains the ciliary muscles that control the shape of the lens

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
*General definition of how-tos
::How-to books are textbooks designed for use in a vocational setting. This setting might be a classroom, a family project, or for self-teaching. Topic areas include home economics, crafts, construction and repair, and so on.
*Goals
::Completed how-to books should provide clear and easy to understand instructions for the project at hand. These instructions should be accessible to a beginner, but detailed enough to be of use to an expert. 
==Standards==
('''Note'' - a good example is [[Cookbook]]
*Accurate descriptions of processes, easy to follow step-by step instructions
*Tools and materials well-described (linking to wikipedia may be acceptable in some instances)
*Well-categorised
**(In general, the how-to categories need to be cleaned up to allow for clear structure).
***'''Suggested splits below'''
*Well-defined topics
**Particular modules should not describe more than one process. If there are alternative processes, perhaps use something like the disambig pages on wikipedia.
**Not too narrow: unless a project has multiple stages that justify independent treatment (e.g.: &quot;building a house&quot;), it's better to keep the process on one page. 
**Flowcharts may be useful: some how-to modules may require flow charts for steps. This may override the preference for keeping all the steps on one page. 
==Transwikis==
*Transwikis should be cleaned up and then put into the proper (sub) categories. In the case of transwikied articles from wikipedia that contain how-to information only in part, it may be useful to create a page using the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[MODULENAME/Transwiki]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and use it as source material for the main module. The contribution history from the wikipedia side can be placed onto the talk page of the &quot;/Transwiki&quot; page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I strongly think that relativity does not belong here. It should have a separate section for those that are interested in reading about it.

==RT vs. Placebo==
*'''VA Lung Group (VALG)''' PMID 4170866 -- &quot;The survival of patients with inoperable lung cancer: a large-scale randomized study of radiation therapy versus placebo.&quot; (Roswit B, Radiology. 1968 Apr;90(4):688-97.)
**Randomized. 800 patients. Localized but inoperable  KPS 80-100 33%, KPS 50-70 55%, Treated with: 1) RT, 2) placebo, 3) chemo
**RT: 90% treated with orthovolatage (200-260 kV), 10% with Cobalt-60. Target dose 40-50 Gy, but 33% received &lt;40 Gy
**Median OS: RT 4.6 months vs. 3.7 months; 1-year survival: RT 18% vs. placebo 14% (p=0.05). 
**Long-term survivors (top 25%): RT 10 monts vs. 7.6 months (SS)
**Conclusion: RT does not impact median OS, but improves long-term survival

==Dose and Fields==
*'''RTOG Review''' PMID 16015546 -- &quot;A review of radiation dose escalation trials for non-small cell lung cancer within the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group.&quot; (Bradley J, Semin Oncol. 2005 Apr;32(2 Suppl 3):S111-3.)
**Dose 60 Gy &quot;standard&quot; for the past 30 years; insufficient to control local disease
**RT alone: 83.8 Gy using 3D-CRT tolerable, 90.3 Gy excess mortality (from RTOG 93-11)
**RT with chemotherapy: maximum 70-74 Gy


*'''RTOG 93-11''' (1995-2001) -- dose escalation
**Phase I/II dose escalation. 176 patients. Stage I-III NSCLC, SCV LN+ excluded ( Prior chemotherapy allowed, concurrent chemotherapy not allowed. 3D treatement planning . GTV = primary tumor and enlarged LN. No elective nodal irradiation. PTV = GTV + 1 cm minimum; verified on fluoroscopy because of breathing motion. Dose prescribed to ICRU reference point within GTV, 93% isodose line to cover PTV, maximum PTV dose &lt;=107%, no heterogeneity correction. Patients grouped based on V20 value using 2.15 Gy/fx:
***Group 1 (V20 &lt;25%): 70.9/33 -&gt; 77.4/36 -&gt; 83.8/39 -&gt; 90.3/42 (Stage I 53%, Stage III 38%)
***Group 2 (V20 25-36%): 70.9/33 -&gt; 77.4/36 -&gt; 83.8/39 (Stage I 21%, Stage III 75%) (''accrual stopped after 77.4 Gy due to opening of RTOG 0117'')
***Group 3 (V20 &gt;36%): 64.5/30 -&gt; 70.9/33 -&gt; 77.4/36 (''accrual stopped after 2 patients'')
**'''2005''' PMID 15667949 &amp;mdash; &quot;Toxicity and outcome results of RTOG 9311: a phase I-II dose-escalation study using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients with inoperable non-small-cell lung carcinoma.&quot; (Bradley J, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Feb 1;61(2):318-28.) Minimum median F/U 13.4 months	 
***Acute toxicity: minimal. Group 1 had 9% Grade 3 pneumonitis at 90.3 Gy; Group 2 had 8% Grade 3 pneumonitis at 77.4 Gy. '''Acute dose-limiting toxicity not reached'''
***Late toxicity. Predictors for pulmonary toxicity: mean lung dose, V20
****'''Group 1''' had 13% Grade 3-5 lung and 6% Grade 3-5 esophageal toxicity (1 death of hemoptysis, 1 death of tracheoesophageal fistula) at 90.3 Gy; tolerable otherwise. '''Late dose-limiting toxicity at 90.3 Gy level.''' 
****'''Group 2''' had 16% Grade 3-4 lung toxicity, and 4% esophagus toxicity. '''Late dose-limiting toxicity not reached.'''
***Outcome: 2-year LR 50-78% (but small individual group sizes); LR sole site 18%, component 38%. Elective nodal failure &lt;10%
***Conclusion: For Group 1 (V20 &lt;25%), 83.8 Gy safe; for Group 2 (V20 25-36%), 77.4 Gy safe using 2.15 Gy/fx

*'''RTOG 73-01''' (1973-78)
**447 pts. Unresectable Stage III (included T3N0). Randomized to 40 Gy split course (20 Gy in one week, 2 weeks rest, then 20 Gy in one week -- total 4 weeks), 40 Gy continuous (over 4 weeks), 50 Gy, or 60 Gy. Included tumor + mediastinal + hilar LN. Used spinal cord block to limit dose to cord.

***Analysis of RTOG 73-01 and 73-02
**Conclusion: Determined 60 Gy in 2 Gy/fx to be optimal dose.

*'''MGH''' PMID 6263449 1972-1977 -- &quot;Improved survival of patients with unresectable non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma by an innovated high-dose en-bloc radiotherapeutic approach.&quot; (Choi NC, Cancer. 1981 Jul 1;48(1):101-9.)
**Retrospective.  162 patients treated with RT. Initially 40-45 Gy small volume (AP/PA POP), evolved into 60-64 Gy large volume (Ap/PA POP plus AP-RPO-LPO) including regional lymphatics
**Surival: Median survival independent of dose and volume, long-term (2-year) survival dose and volume dependent (36% vs. 10%). Local control also dose dependent
**Failure: Squamous cell in primary/regional lymphatics, adeno in brain/bone


'''''Concomitant boost:'''''
*'''RTOG 83-12'''
**Phase I/II, T3-T4 NSCLC. Concomitant boost at 1.8 Gy/fx to 50.4 Gy (elective nodal). Primary tumor to 2.68 Gy/day to total of 75 Gy in 28 fx.
**PMID 7860394 (1995)

***Comparable OS: 59% QW vs 49% QD at 1 year, 29% QW vs 23% QD at 2 years. No difference in late toxicity
**'''Prelim; 1986''' PMID 3519551 (1982-84) &amp;mdash; &quot;A prospective randomized trial comparing once-a-week vs daily radiation therapy for locally-advanced, non-metastatic, lung cancer: a preliminary report.&quot; Salazar OM et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1986 May;12(5):779-87.
***No difference in outcome.

==Hyperfractionation==
*'''RTOG 81-08''' - feasibility study
**120 pts. 1.2 Gy BID to 50.4 Gy - 74.4 Gy.
**Update: PMID 1650526, 1991

*'''RTOG 83-11''' (1983-87)
**848 pts. Unresectable Stage II-IV (without distant mets). 1.2 Gy BID to 60.0, 64.8, 69.6 Gy, 74.4 Gy or 79.2 Gy.

*''The supreme task of the physicist is to arrive at those universal elementary laws from which the cosmos can be built up by pure deduction. There is no logical path to these laws; only intuition, resting on sympathetic understanding of experience, can reach them.'' Albert Einstein

==What is a law of nature ? Introduction ==
During history of the human culture and science rules about nature were found and stored. Among those rules there were very simple laws, as for example the sentence:      

 On earth every held up object falls down to the ground,   
 unless it can fly  
 or it is lighter than air 
 or it is fixed firmly.    

Many of these rules were clear to everyone without big thinking: Nearly each human being knew that hungry lions are dangerous.     
Many of these rules had to be reformulated again and again, since they proved as partly wrong. Some rules were also completely rejected, since they were completely ''' wrong '''. A famous example of it was the idea: The earth is the center of the universe and the sun moves around the earth. This idea had to be overcome during a long painful process.      

A big improvement in the development of scientific rules was the moment when the scientists started to ask questions and answered them by experiments. The speculations became less and less, the experiments and observations became more and more. Some parts of nature however where out of reach for ''' experiments ''', since the objects were too far away or too heavy.    

A further improvement was the idea to formulate laws of nature mathematically. In particular physical laws were easily translated to mathematical statements. Chemistry and biology got along quite a time without mathematics.     

Each science thus won a refined set of rules in the course of the time. Again and again  contradictions emerged, which had to be fitted in.

It turned out that some events in the development of nature could just be described as a ''' historical ''' fact, but not as a physical law. '''Randomness''' was recognized as factor of influence for such historical events. So it is more or less random, when and where the earth was hit by meteorites and which influence such a meteorite impact on the development of the biological evolution took.     

Since the term law of nature suggests safe knowledge, it should be used only critically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter introduces you to the basics of decision theory and how it can be applied to improve your decisions. It starts with a review of material in ''Smart Choices'', a book written by John Hammond, Ralph Keeney, and Howard Raiffa, experts from the Harvard Business School in the field of decision theory and its application in business. (An MBA program is largely the study of how to improve decisions important to business, and decision theory is a key component of this study.) It continues with a discussion of our goals for models intended to help us predict and explain social behavior. We see that our modeling focuses only upon the most important factors necessary to predict and explain, even if we must sacrifice a complete or accurate description of the individual’s actual decision making process. 

== Components of a Good Decision ==

We want the models that we will eventually build throughout this course to help us in predicting and explaining social behavior around us. Since we will be examining a class of models based upon individuals choosing alternatives that promote their self interest, it will be important for us to know what it means exactly for a choice to be rational and to which situations different levels of rationality might fruitfully be applied. To help us understand “rationality” better, to help us in modeling what decisions are actually made, we will first consider advice on improving the rationality of your decisions, or what decisions should be made. How should you decide to best meet your goals? What constitutes a rational choice? 

Some decisions in your life will be fairly easy, but most of the important ones will be tough and complex with no obvious choice as the best. Even though a great deal may be at stake, for you and for those around you that you care about, with these tough decisions we risk anxiety from confusion and doubt and the fear of error, regret, and embarrassment. We want to provide you with an anxiety-reducing structure or process to help you with these important, tough decisions. 

=== Find feasible alternatives ===

Decision theory separates the selection of choices to be considered feasible from how to choose among these choices. It, thus, separates the analysis of what is feasible from the analysis of what is good. Each of these two key steps can also be broken into key components. This divide-and-conquer approach is an important benefit from the use of decision theory. Your assumptions, data, and logic become clear, where they might not be otherwise. As we will see later, separating the analysis of the feasible from analysis of the good is a major benefit from the use of game theory as well. 

Ideally, you want to consider all possible feasible alternatives, rank them in order of your preferences, and then choose the best. In practice, the set of all possible alternatives may not be obvious. Further, many feasible options may be clearly sub-optimal, so for simplicity’s sake you might omit them from consideration. Even so, the alternatives in your model represent the range of potential choices you will have for pursuing your objectives. Since you’ll eventually be choosing the best among the alternatives that you consider, make sure that you include all possible best alternatives. 

==== Reconsider the scope of your problem ====

“A good solution to a well-posed decision problem is almost always a smarter choice than an excellent solution to a poorly posed one.” (16) Be creative about defining your problem; it is often broader than it first appears. The trigger that initiated the decision may suggest a relatively narrow problem, but upon reconsideration you learn that broader issues are involved and should be considered. For example, changes considered to deal with the trigger may open up complementary changes that would not be considered otherwise. (see p.18 for example) 

In defining the problem consider the following: What is the trigger? What are the constraints to the problem? What are the essential elements of the problem? What decisions impinge on or hinge upon this decision? Can this problem be broken into smaller parts? After you have asked and answered these questions, talk with others about this problem, either experts that have a similar problem before or non-experts that have your interests at heart. You may gain insight just from your explaining your thinking, as well as from any advice itself. 

Crafting an appropriate definition takes time, and it often can’t be done effectively in one sitting. Like the crafting of an introductory paragraph for a Freshman Studies paper, the problem definition often needs reworking as the body is developed. Like that introductory paragraph, keep revisiting it as your analysis proceeds. Reconsidering the problem definition is especially important when circumstances change rapidly or new information becomes available. Remember, if you have an inappropriate problem definition, at best, you may go very fast—but in the wrong direction. 

;use your objectives and work backwards — ask “how?” :Make sure that each of the constraints that limit your alternatives is real. If not, eliminate it. Even if they are real, can you find any ways around these constraints? 
;challenge constraints :Make sure that each of the constraints that limit your alternatives is real. If not, eliminate it. Even if they are real, can you find any ways around these constraints? 
;set aspirations high :“One way to increase the chance of finding good, unconventional alternatives is to set targets that seem beyond reach.” (51) Start with an alternative with a great outcome, but one that is also infeasible, and then modify it to make it feasible. 
;give your subconscious time to operate :Your mind doesn’t work just by direct attack. If you start on the problem early, you give yourself time to be reconsidering the problem in a “low” mode while doing something else (a shower? drifting off to sleep? working on another problem?). Sometimes good ideas come. Start early and give yourself the chance.

==== learn from others ====

Find out what you and others have done in similar situations. What lessons do you learn from these other situations? What could have been done better? 

Others may be able to provide some insights from earlier experience with similar situations or they may suggest new paths that you haven’t considered. Also, keep an open mind during your conversations with others. The primary benefit may not be the specific ideas that others provide, but simply the insights that you gain from organizing your thoughts into explanations and from answering questions. 

At the same time, talking with others first may limit you to their framework of the problem. Think about the problem first yourself, since you may find a new approach. 

==== consider more alternatives ====

;consider process alternatives :Especially when you need to justify your choice to others or have their approval, the best alternative may be a process for making a choice, rather than the choice itself. Could you use a voting mechanism? an auction? set standards that would then be applied after gathering more information? 
;search for win-win alternatives :Again, especially when you need to justify your choice to others or have their approval, you should consider alternatives that make them better off as well as you. Put yourself in their shoes, and ask yourself how they might choose. Create alternatives where you both win. 
;consider information-gathering alternatives :You may be dealing with important uncertainties. You might want to gather more information that would reduce this uncertainty. Another possibility is a choice that allows you to defer a complete decision that may allow you to gather useful information. Remember, though, that deferring a decision may mean other alternatives may disappear, and thus, have a price. (Consider how to deal with uncertainties and whether to gather more information with Chapters 7-9.) 

For the most part you want to generate as many alternatives as possible to evaluate later. Be careful not to eliminate seemingly bad alternatives if they might be transformed into good ones. Even alternatives with a fatal flaw might be modified to eliminate the flaw and yield an exceptional candidate. Also, throughout the decision-making process keep looking for alternatives. 

At the same time, some balance is needed here in considering new alternatives. You don’t want to spend time, money, and energy if there is no potential payoff. The model of your decision does not need to include all possible alternatives that may be taken—just all the possible best ones. Is the time, effort, and energy of this decision-making process with it? How much value and how much cost is likely to come from the extra effort?

=== Choose best among the feasible ===

Now that you’ve considered your decision problem and the alternative choices available to you, what do you really want to achieve? What are your goals? You need to know these goals to be able to evaluate your various alternatives. 

a procedure for uncovering your objectives 

write down all your concerns that you hope to address through your decision 
convert your concerns into succinct objectives; use short phrases with verb and object (e.g. maximize profit, raise chance of re-election, reduce pollution) 
separate ends from means to establish your fundamental objectives; these fundamental objectives will be used to evaluate the alternatives 
clarify what you mean with each objective 
test your objectives against several alternatives; are they consistent with your underlying feelings? 

====understand the consequences of each alternative ====

From the choice of any alternative will come consequences, first the physical consequences, and then the consequences in terms of all of the objectives of your decision problem. 

*Describe the physical consequences with appropriate accuracy, completeness, and precision 
*Describe the consequences in terms of each of the objectives with a consequences table 
*#as much as possible, experience the consequences — try before you buy 
*#use common scales as much as possible 
*#use scales with the appropriate level of precision 
*#don’t rely exclusively on hard data; subjective assessments are important too 
*#make the most of available information 
*#use experts wisely; understand their assumptions as well as their conclusions 
*#address uncertainty head on 

====consider the tradeoffs between different objectives of each of the alternatives ====

&lt;/center&gt;

==== eliminate dominated alternatives ====

With two alternatives, if the first is better in some objectives and no worse in any, the second alternative cannot be the best choice, and thus, can be eliminated. In the job example below, Job B is better than Job E with four objectives and equal with two. Therefore, eliminate Job E. 

==== make tradeoffs clearer by subtracting equals====

In any comparison, since we are looking for differences to determine which is best, we can eliminate anything of equal value from all columns. We change the decision problem by substituting components of equal value, and then focus on differences, ignoring all parts of the outcomes that are of equal value. In the job example, we may eliminate $1800 of salary, health benefits, and 10 vacation days from all columns. 

Try to subtract the most easily identified equals first. When evaluating the differences, is there a common scale for some of the objectives? When the difference in the number of vacation days is small, one additional vacation day may be worth $100 to Vincent. This would then mean that the monthly salary and vacation days rows can be combined by adding the salary and the value of the extra vacation days. With this change, Job A dominates Job D, and Job D can be eliminated. 

Similarly, Vincent can hire someone to be with his ill father for those times that he could not be with him for $100 per month to make up the difference between low and high work schedule flexibility. After swapping $100 plus low flexibility for Job B with high flexibility for Job C, we find Job B now dominates Job C, and Job C can be eliminated. 

Now all that remains of Vincent’s decision problem is to choose between Job A and Job B. Vincent needs to decide if the higher enjoyment, retirement benefits, and extra work schedule flexibility is worth more or less than an extra $400 in salary and better skill development. Vincent determines that the retirement benefits and extra work schedule flexibility are worth $200, so he must compare whether the remainder, the higher enjoyment with A is worth more or less than an extra $200 in salary and better skill development. 

Often subtracting the most easily identified equals will allow enough alternatives to be eliminated that difficult tradeoffs may not be necessary to establish. Sometimes not, though. The tradeoffs may remain difficult. Unfortunately, no matter what choice you make, you are implicitly placing a value on these tradeoffs. You might as well confront the choices directly. Following the procedures above allows you to simplify your decision-making problem as much as possible to allow you to better understand the tradeoffs that you must face in your decision.

== Modeling Behavior as Rational Decisions ==

Now we want to shift our focus. Instead of examining how some person should make a decision, we want to examine what decisions people actually make. We are most interested in predicting and explaining decisions that we see made in some social behavior of interest. To do this, we want to construct a model that incorporates the most important features of some social behavior of interest that would help us predict and explain what we see. In doing this, we are certainly willing to sacrifice a complete description of some people, their environment, or the resulting behavior, if we can describe in as simple a way as possible what will happen and why.

=== Create models that predict and explain behavior ===

{{SideBox|[[Image:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|right|120px]]&lt;br&gt;''Everything &lt;br&gt;should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.'' &lt;br&gt;— Albert Einstein }}

One must always remember that a model is not intended to describe the fullness of actual behavior. It is only a stripped down version of the real thing, but one designed to determine how important factors influence observed behavior. The modeler consciously includes only those factors that he feels are most important. Especially at the beginning of an investigation, he keeps the model extremely simple. Once the effect of those few factors of an early model are understood, then he includes another to determine its effect, then another, and then another. To test the resulting logic, he adds and subtracts various factors, and applies his new models to various environments. And he compares his predicted results to actual choices made in similar environments. But even at the end, factors that at times may have some influence over some behavior may be left out. For the questions asked, these factors may add nothing of importance in predictive power and, in their inclusion, add such difficulty to obscure the essence of an appropriate explanation. These factors should not ever be included; the simplifying assumptions that omit these factors are to be encouraged. Note that a model that predicts and explains best always remains a simplified version of the world; it is not intended to be a description of the real thing. 

Keeping a model simple not only improves the model's ability to explain, it also reduces the probability that mere chance explains the success of the model. A more parsimonious model, one that is more concise and simple, is more likely to be correct. We seek models that have parsimony. 

A model with power, one that explains a large number of phenomena, also reduces the probability that mere chance explains the success of the model. A model with more power is more likely to be correct. We seek models that have more power.

If you don't question it, you're living by faith, not by science.'' &lt;br&gt;— Ian Stewart 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

At the same time, these models are not used within a vacuum. Each discipline shares common views and assumptions that they find most useful for making progress in their discipline. Some of the disciplines that study social behavior share paradigms based upon models of individuals furthering their own self interest. Some do not. 

An objective of this course is to demonstrate that, compared to other views that could be used in each discipline that studies social behavior, models of individuals furthering their own self interest appear to predict observed behavior reasonably well in many contexts, they seem to explain why this behavior is occurring relatively simply and with great power. These models have sufficiently wide applicability that they may offer a common paradigm for the study of all social behavior. For especially those disciplines where practioners do not now generally share this view, much work is needed to test this view against others and to reassess which views are likely to be the most useful for making progress in these disciplines. For these disciplines, we may be in the midst of paradigmatic revolution.

=== All models are wrong, but some are useful if . . . ===

{{SideBox|''All models are wrong, but some are useful.'' — George Box}}

As would be expected if texts are needed to teach people how to make rational decisions, many actual decisions are made that do not meet the standards of a rational choice model. “Virtually no one believes that anything approximating such a procedure is observed in any individual or organization . . . for any number of . . . decision tasks that confront them. . . . Pure rationality strains credulity as a description of how decisions actually happen.” (March, 1994, 5) 

In many actual decisions, we find (March, 1994, 8-9): 
*Instead of considering all alternatives simultaneously, some decision makers appear to consider only a few of these alternatives and then look at them sequentially. 
*Some decision makers do not consider all of the consequences of their alternatives: they focus on some and ignore others. 
*Relevant information about consequences is not sought, and available information is often not used. 
*Some decision makers implicitly use preferences that are incomplete and inconsistent.
*Some decision makers don’t choose their best alternative possible, but choose a choice that is good enough. 

To make models more consistent with these concerns, modern decision theory sometimes modifies the rational choice model by changing the knowledge of the decision makers, the number of decision makers, loosening the restrictions on their preferences, or changing the decision rules that they use. Most importantly, they allow limited rationality. With this limited rationality, decision makers intend to be rational, but they are constrained by limited cognitive capabilities and incomplete information, and thus their actions may be less than completely rational, at least when compared to those that would be selected with costless decision making, in spite of their best intentions and efforts. The internal costs of making a decision lead them to decide in ways inconsistent with the rational choice model that does not include these internal costs. 

Are these differences important for our purposes? Sometimes, sometimes not. For three reasons (or for combinations of these three reasons), the rational choice model can still remain appropriate. 

In some decisions, the rational choice model may model the decision making process quite well. When a great deal is at stake, when the decision making environment is one in which the decision maker has a great deal of experience, and when the decision making environment is relatively simple, decisions may be made rationally. For these situations, certainly, the rational choice model is perfectly appropriate to predict and to explain observed behavior. Determining the situations to which this model applies then becomes a critical question. 

In some other decisions, even when a decision maker does not decide as the rational choice model describes, she may act as if she does. For example, as a driver of an automobile, she may not know or understand all of the mechanics and physical forces at work in her car. Nevertheless, she has learned that when she moves her hands and feet in certain ways in certain situations, the car reacts in certain ways. With experience, she still may choose actions that maximize consistent preferences as if she understood all of this knowledge. The rational choice model would be perfectly appropriate to predict behavior in such situations. At the same time, it may be less valuable at explaining what is happening. The appropriateness of this model would then depend upon why we want to use it. 

In other decisions, the rational choice model may not even be able to predict individual decisions very well, but aggregate behavior or average behavior may be quite accurate. For example, for some economic good, the quantities demanded by some individual consumers in this market may not always match the predictions from the rational choice model, but the aggregate over all consumers, the market demand, may be quite accurate. Some consumers may choose a bit more than the model predicts, while others choose a bit less, so that the aggregate is quite accurate. If our concern is this aggregate or average behavior, the rational choice model is useful. A more complete, limited rationality model may allow the observed “noise” around the rational-choice prediction, but if introducing this limited rationality doesn’t introduce any bias in the central tendency, the greater simplicity of the rational choice model may be valuable itself. 

Remember that formal models have two purposes: We want to use them both to ''predict'' and to ''understand'' behavior under specified circumstances. These two purposes also have conflicting needs. Prediction usually improves if more and more factors that have any impact at all are included within the model. Understanding usually improves if fewer factors are included within the model. The goal then is to include only those factors that have an important effect without significantly changing the reasons behind the prediction. This means we always want to include any assumption that omits a factor that does not change the prediction of the model, a '''simplifying assumption''', but for other assumptions, how &quot;important&quot; the effect has to be and how &quot;significant&quot; a change in the reasons behind the prediction for some factor to be included within the model depends upon the questions to be asked of it. 

In any event, we will return later to consider how observed behavior sometimes does not match up with the predictions from our rational choice models. We reconsider situations where rational choice models seem more likely to apply, and how this might alter the models that we might want to use and when we might want to use them. Also, since we will be examining social behavior in many different contexts, we will look for similarities across many different types of social behavior. As a first attempt, we will assume that when reasonable people who have the same goals are put into similar situations, they tend to make similar choices.

We would like to view social behavior as scientists and seek any &quot;natural laws&quot; that determine this behavior. Models of self interest offer one candidate for such laws. These models are relatively simple, powerful in their predictions, and might apply to all social behavior. 

While we do examine both strengths and weaknesses of these models, we leave it to others to provide detailed empirical support or refutation of these models in these applications, but we do intend to demonstrate that these hypotheses should, at a minimum, be considered seriously because of their simplicity, their power, and their potentially wide scope. 

As we contruct these models, we also illustrate the process of building models of social behavior. You will see how our predictions and our level of understanding change when we alter our assumptions, when we make seemingly innocuous changes to the feasible choices available, and when we focus on different characteristics that we expect to occur in equilibria. We hope that this experience improves your judgment when you create and modify models of social behavior or at least when you criticize (constructively, of course) models that others create. 

== Our Objectives ==

{{SideBox|[[Image:LEONARDO.JPG|right|110px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.'' &lt;br&gt;— [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_daVinci Leonardo DaVinci]}}

We have 3 primary objectives:
#Develop skills in models of self interest: decision theory and game theory 
#Learn through real applications throughout the social sciences 
#Be accessible to undergraduates and general readers 

=== Develop skills in models of self interest: decision theory and game theory ===

Our first objective for this course is to introduce you to models of self interest, that is, those based upon the mathematics of decision theory and game theory, and to allow you to develop skill with these models and their use for predicting and explaining social behavior. 
Social behavior, in general, involves actions taken by individuals that, at least when aggregated over a group, affect other individuals. We want to predict and explain this behavior. Viewing this as scientists, we would like to discover, in effect, any “natural laws” that determine this behavior, if not for all environments then for some. As with any scientific search for natural laws, science takes any candidates for such natural laws and their associated models of behavior, however obtained, determines consequences that must occur if they are to hold, and ultimately tests these predicted consequences against experience. This process is continually repeated with new candidates for natural laws, candidates that now come from incremental modifications of the best performing models and occassionally from models based upon a new approach. Over time, we find potential natural laws and models that predict and explain actual experience better than the alternatives. Thus, at least eventually, we find more accurate predictions and more powerful explanations, those which are simpler or applicable to a wider variety of environments. If almost all practitioners conclud that such a set of natural laws and their associated model is more successful than other candidates, and they adopt it as their best explanation for the phenomena under study, then this model would offer a paradigm for their field. 

One candidate for such a law of social behavior, one that may offer the foundation for a paradigm for each of the social sciences, is that individuals behave to further their own self interest. Models of individuals furthering their own self interest are formalized with either decision theory or game theory. Decision theory is the mathematics of optimizing behavior, where choices are made that further self interest against an environment that does not change in response to these choices. In decision theory, each individual’s choices can be considered independently of choices that any other individual makes. It can be the foundation of either rational choice models or of evolutionary models. Game theory, building upon the foundation of decision theory, is the mathematics of strategic decisions, decisions where the value of the outcome to each individual depends upon the actions that other individuals take as well as actions that the decision maker takes herself. The rival’s choices may be influenced by the first individual’s choices. In game theory, an individual’s choices are interdependent with other individual’s choices. These &quot;choices&quot; might actually be rational choices that individuals make, or they may be the implicit &quot;choices&quot; that natural selection or cultural selection make, in that other alternatives become less frequent in later populations. 

=== Learn through real applications throughout the social sciences ===

{{SideBox|''The seeds of great discoveries are constantly floating around us, &lt;br&gt;but they only take root in &lt;br&gt;minds well prepared to receive them.'' &lt;br&gt;— [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry Joseph Henry] }}

Our second objective for this course is to introduce you to these models of self-interested individuals through many of the actual applications that social scientists have actually wrestled with. We believe this is valuable for three reasons. 

First, and most important, we conclude that a hypothesis that behavior is based upon self interest should be considered seriously throughout the social sciences. In the tradition of a good liberal arts education that highlights the interconnections between various fields, this course centers on the use of common models within these many, varied fields. We introduce you to models of individuals furthering their own self interest primarily through applications of these models over all areas of social behavior, whether the concern is competition versus cooperation; individuals acting alone or in alliances; or the use of money, sex, violence, or power. These models are applied to environments where individuals make rational choices, where natural selection favors the spread of the expression of some genes over others, or where cultural selection favors the spread of some ideas over others. 

These applications come from the disciplines of economics, political science, psychology, biology, anthropology, and philosophy. Practioners in these disciplines have adopted these models to varying degrees. These models provide the foundation of the current paradigm for two of these disciplines, economics and biology, and for two fields within two more disciplines, positive political economy within political science and evolutionary psychology within psychology. These models and modifications of them are the leading contenders in cognitive science within psychology and within behavioral economics. In other fields, these models remain controversial. 

We especially introduce these models outside of those disciplines where they are not yet a core of their paradigms, not only because these models show us interconnections between disciplines, but also because any success in these new environments shows these models to be stronger. Data consistent with predictions from any model seen to apply over more environments are less likely to be due to chance or artifacts of a specific environment. Further, for those social sciences that do not now have models of self interest as a core of their paradigms, great research opportunities exist transplanting well-known tools into new fields. 

With each of these applications, we determine some of the predicted consequences from these models. We also describe briefly whether these consequences appear consistent or inconsistent with observations that others have made, but we largely leave the empirical testing to others with more expertise in these fields. We conclude that this hypothesis, that individuals further their own self interest, yields predictions that appear consistent with actual social behavior within many environments; it is relatively simple, though more subtle than it might appear at first. We believe these models, or modifications of them, could apply to a tremendously wide scope of environments where social behavior occurs in all of them. 

The focus on these models of self interest that can provide a foundation for a paradigm that can be shared across all social behavior is a unique feature of this material over other courses or books on game theory or decision theory. Even though knowledge passes through disciplinary walls only with difficulty in almost all universities, especially through many of these disciplinary walls, we want the practioners and students in all of these disciplines to see beyond their own walls and see the greater power these models have because of their tremendous scope. No other course or book covers the wide scope of social behavior that this material does. 

Second, we believe that constructing useful mathematics as we see the need for it in these applications better motivates why this mathematics has been developed and why various concepts are important, which in turn, better motivates most students to consider these concepts in greater depth. The usual approach of constructing the mathematics and then illustrate the math with simplified, idealized &quot;stick figure&quot; applications leaves some students cold, especially students that have not yet developed an appreciation for the beauty or even the usefulness of mathematics. The richer applications do require more words, but in this situation, we feel that these additional words ease understanding. Presenting decision theory and game theory in this manner, developing richer applications first and the math as necessary, makes this course unusual but we hope this approach is more effective for you. 

Third, we believe that considering this wide range of social behavior and the incremental construction of more sophisticated models will help you develop better judgment when considering what elements of an environment should be included within a model that you will find useful for your purposes. We take care to consider the effect of various assumptions, when it's useful to incorporate more elements of the environment within the model, and when its more useful to make knowingly false assumptions. Making good choices of what to include within a model requires good judgment. 

=== Be accessible to undergraduates and general readers ===

Our third objective for this course is to make this material accessible to any undergraduate or general reader willing to examine social behavior through a mathematical prism, say at the level of a relatively mathematically adept sophomore. Our presentation primarily presumes some mathematical maturity, as we look at the world through these mathematical models, but not a great deal. As a test of this maturity and for some of the content, we presume the student has had a first calculus course; we do not presume any mathematical background beyond this one calculus course. To serve these students as well as the more advanced students, we intend to stress the intuition behind the questions, arguments, and conclusions, but without losing the rigor in any analysis considered for that application. In doing this, we do not present some questions, arguments, or conclusions in their most general form. We omit arguments or proofs that are not particularly insightful for the application. Some proofs we place in appendices. References should lead more advanced readers to any greater depth that they desire.

== An Overview ==

We introduce you to these models of self interest and their applications in four parts, roughly in order of their technical complexity. In each part, we apply the models developed across the social sciences, and depending upon the discipline these models may be applied to individuals making rational decisions, to natural selection favoring behavior that tends to follow with individuals having some particular DNA over other possibilities, to culture selection favoring behavior associated with some particular ideas over others, or to some combination of these mechanisms. 

=== Decision Theory ===
Decision theory provides the framework for many important models throughout the social sciences, but we are primarily interested in many of its concepts and tools that we need for both decision theory and game theory. Decision theory provides an infrastructure for us to develop models based upon furthering one's self interest. Preferences that are consistent or rational allow us to order feasible choices. We can express such choices as maximization problems: it's as if the individual makes a choice that maximizes the value of a &quot;utility&quot; function. We can even add uncertainty, further consistency requirements on our preferences, and describe that individual as maximizing his expected &quot;utility.&quot; 

The first part of our material introduces you to decision theory through applications in business, economics, political science, biology, and psychology. For some of these applications, we expect the individual to act as a rational decision maker, and we predict this outcome with our models. For others, we don't expect this exact mechanism to work, but we expect the individual to act as if he were a rational decision maker, while other elements of his environment, maybe the institutions in which he makes his choices or repeated experience, lead him to make these choices over time. We predict these outcomes with the same models. And for still other applications, a &quot;dumb&quot; evolutionary process is at work and over time an equilibrium is attained, and we can describe these outcomes too with these same models. 

=== Static Games ===
Game theory provides a taxonomy for interdependent interactions based on self interest. As with all good models, although such taxonomies may miss many crucial details in the particular application, they do capture basic strategic aspects of various situations, allowing us to better predict and explain outcomes for similar situations and to make linkages between applications. We intend to strengthen our common-sense intuition by starting with simple applications that we understand fairly well, and then in stages, consider slightly more compelx environments with the same tools where our existing intuitions are less reliable. Over time, as we see enough applications, we strengthen our intuitions and ultimately understand these interdependent environments more deeply. 

The second part of our material introduces you to static games, games in which all players choose their own strategies simultaneously. These are the simplest games, so they are the best place to learn some of the most important game-theoretic concepts, and they also provide the framework for what have been the most important contributions of game theory so far in its application. We consider all that is feasible when we define the game's strategic form, and then we predict outcomes to occur in equilibrium for such situations by the characteristics that we expect of any equilibria. We will consider applications to market power in economics, strategic voting in political science, fight or flight responses in biology, strategic international trade policy, and sexual strategies in biology. 

=== Dynamic Games ===
The third part of this material introduces you to dynamic games with complete information and their applications. The language of games in their extensive form, which we compare and contrast with their strategic form, permits us to ask questions about the dynamics of games that allow individuals to take actions that are contingent upon previous actions taken by others. These more sophisticated strategies may allow more cooperation and more efficient outcomes than are possible without them. We consider applications to the common resource problem in economics, bargaining, collusion in economics, reciprocity in animal behavior, the development of cultural norms in small towns versus large cities, the development of ethics, incentives for firms to merge, and the coordination of behavior with communication. 

=== Incomplete Information Games ===
The fourth part of this material introduces you to dynamic games with incomplete information and their applications. With incomplete information, a player does not know with certainty what game he is playing, but some players may have some proprietary information, generally about their own payoffs. With these games, a player may learn about his environment or about the characteristics of other players from actions that others take. Such possibilities also allow for the opportunity for individuals to reveal or disguise the actual environment to other individuals. With these games, we see moral hazard, adverse selection, and signaling in the context of insurance, education, and used cars. 

A recurring thread throughout this material is determining when individuals following their self interest is also in the interest of the group. In many situations, observers have seen what appear to be examples of altruism, the behavior of individuals that helps others but harms themselves. Are these examples of situations where models of self interest fail? In what situations can self-interested individuals cooperate with each other for the greatest benefit for the group? 

In some of these situations, the simplest model leads directly to efficient behavior, so that following individual self interest is clearly mutually advantageous. In others, the simple model leads to inefficient behavior and enough cooperation for efficiency has not occurred. In these cases, we examine extensions of these models, usually creating a related dynamic game, and find six types of modifications that can lead to greater cooperation: 

#kin selection — Individuals may sacrifice to help family members, but from the gene's point of view they are acting to promote this expression of the gene in later populations. 
#Coasian bargaining — Individuals may choose to bargain and voluntarily accept income transfers that then modify their incentives enough to lead to an outcome that aids everyone. 
#reciprocity — Individuals may choose to aid other individuals, even if it harms them in the short run, if they expect the recipients of this aid to reciprocate, and this swapping of favors may lead to an outcome that aids everyone. 
#reputations — Individuals may be able to choose with whom they interact, and information is available that allows them to identify who has cooperated with others in the past, so that more individuals cooperate, yielding an outcome that aids everyone. 
#relatively isolated sub-groups — In some situations, a general population splits into sub-groups and the success of these sub-groups depends upon this cooperation, so that when the general population re-forms more of the cooperators have survived. 
#moral authority — Some individuals may promote the use of some behavioral rules that if followed would tend to lead to outcomes that aid everyone, offering their approval to individuals that follow them and their disapproval to those that don't, and the value of this approval or disapproval is enough for some individuals in some situations to follow these behavioral rules.

Ultimately, the behavior that we predict in these situations promotes the individual's self interest, even though the behavior may look altruistic to an outside observer. These extensions show how additional cooperation can occur so that the group's interests are pushed as far as possible, but they are not based upon altruistic behavior.

== Alternate Paths ==

The biggest drawback resulting from trying to both examine applications throughout the social sciences and make the discussion accessible to undergraduates is the greater length of exposition required. Even so, the reading tends to be easier (less dense) than most alternative presentations of decision theory and game theory, and no student is expected to cover every application in detail. Whatever your background beyond a first calculus course, you may pick a path of interesting applications through this material while still understanding the major insights that these models of self interest provide. We mark particularly advanced sections with an asterisk. 
Once all of this material has been compiled, even after offering abriged versions of much of the best related literature for you, we find that covering all of the material here is not possible in a single undergraduate course. Nevertheless, this material offers several selective paths through it that remain coherent. If you are a social science student, one fruitful path is to focus on the basic tools plus applications in your discipline but only sample applications in the other disciplines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The History of Islam begins with Muhammad (s.a.w)* (c. April 20, 570 - June 8, 632 AD)[1] who was an Arabian religious and political leader who Muslims believe to be the last prophet of Allah (God). He is a descendent of Ishmael, a son of Abraham, he is considered the most important person in the religion of Islam.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== '''Prophet Muhammad''' == 
 
 &lt;br /&gt;
Was born in 570 CE (Common Era) in the city of Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula, part of modern day Saudi Arabia. As his father had died shortly after marriage, his grandfather ‘Abd al-Muttalib became his guardian. ‘Abd al-Muttalib was the respected head of the clan of Hashim and the tribe of Quraysh, to which his clan belonged. With the Quraysh being the biggest and most influential tribe in Mecca, ‘Abd al-Muttalib was seen as the master of all of Mecca. The Quraysh had a special status in Mecca because they used to be in charge of the sacred Ka’ba. The Qur’an tells us that this holy edifice was built by Prophets Abraham and his son Ishmael:
[[File: Mosquée Masjid el Haram à la Mecque.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Kabaa]]


(And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House [Abraham prayed]: “Our Lord! Accept from us; surely You are the Hearing, the Knowing (2.127). Our Lord! Make us Muslims and raise from our offspring a nation of Muslims. Show us our ways of worship, and relent toward us. Surely, Your are the Relenting, the Merciful”) (2.128).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


This means that the Ka’ba was built around 1900 BCE, which is when Abraham is thought to have lived. The Ka’ba maintained its venerable status as the destination of pilgrimage in the eyes of the pilgrims and the Arab population of the Arabian Peninsula down the centuries. ‘Abd al-Muttalib was personally in charge of the Ka’ba.&lt;br /&gt;


The Prophet was only about five to six years old when he lost his mother. Orphan Muhammad then lost his grandfather and custodian ‘Abd al-Muttalib at the age of eight. Now one of ‘Abd al-Muttalib’s sons, Abu Talib, became the guardian of his orphan nephew. Though respected by the clan of Hashim and the people of Mecca in general, Abu Talib did not possess the high status and influence of his father. Had he been more fortunate financially, he might have aspired to acquire that special leadership status.&lt;br /&gt;


When Muhammad was twenty five years old, he was hired by a woman called Khadija to take her merchandize to Syria. Khadija, a widow fifteen years Muhammad’s senior, later proposed marriage to him, which he agreed to. They lived together for almost a quarter of a century, until the death of Khadija about 8-9 years after the revelation of the Qur’an.&lt;br /&gt;


It is interesting to note that Muhammad did not get married to any other woman during Khadija’s life, despite the fact that polygamy was common practice in that society.
But after her death he took a number of wives. The exact number is not certain but it is believed that he had 9 wives in all. &lt;br /&gt;
=== the revelation ===

Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as “Hira‘” on the Mountain of “Noor” (light) for contemplation. The cave itself, which survived the times, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations. Resting on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world. In fact, it is not easy to find at all even if one knew it existed. After visiting the cave, I found myself concluding that Muhammad must have been divinely guided to that hideaway, even if he had chosen it consciously. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation. Nothing can be seen other than the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave. The inhabitant of that cave was obviously interested in things beyond this world and its material riches.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Cave Hira.jpg|thumbnail|right|Hira Cave]]


It was in that cave in 610 CE, i.e. at the age of forty, that Prophet Muhammad received from Allah the first verses of the Qur’an. Then and there, history changed.&lt;br /&gt;


The Qur’an continued to be revealed in fragments to Prophet Muhammad over the following twenty two years. The last words of the Book were revealed to the Prophet shortly before his death in 632 CE.&lt;br /&gt;
 

In the first two to three years after the revelation, the Prophet preached Islam secretly to individuals whom he trusted. When he started calling people to Islam publicly, the new religion gradually attracted more people but, not surprisingly, also increasing hostility from the idol worshipping population of Mecca. The Prophet was subjected to harassment and abuse. However, armed with patience, resilience, and determination, and protected by his uncle Abu Talib and the clan of Hashim, the Prophet was able to carry on preaching the new faith to people.&lt;br /&gt;


Converts to Islam, some of whom were slaves, had to suffer all kinds of persecution, including brutal torture and murder, at the hands of the enemies of the new religion in Mecca. In 614 CE, the Prophet had to instruct a group of Muslims to escape the persecution to Abyssinia and seek the protection of its just Christian king. The Quraysh then sent a delegation to the king, carrying precious gifts, to secure the extradition of the Muslim refugees. The king, however, rejected the bribe and let the Muslims stay in Abyssinia.&lt;br /&gt;


One year later, the Quraysh imposed economic and social sanctions on the Prophet, his followers, and his clan. As a result, the Muslims withdrew to a mountain in Mecca. The sanctions lasted about three years before collapsing in 618/619 CE without achieving their goals.&lt;br /&gt;


Soon afterward, the Prophet lost his wife Khadija. Matters got worse quickly with the death of his uncle and protector. Prophet Muhammad started to suffer more from the disbelievers’ relentless attempts to uproot Islam and destroy its followers. During the pilgrimage season in 622 CE, Muhammad met in Mecca with a number of chiefs from the city of Yathrib, where he had previously sent some Muslims to settle in. Having converted to Islam, the chiefs made a secret pledge to protect the Prophet should the Quraysh try to kill him.&lt;br /&gt;


However, the Quraysh learned about the agreement, so the people from Yathrib had to return quickly to their city. Sensing that the danger to Muslims has increased, Muhammad instructed them to immigrate individually or in small groups to Yathrib. The Qurayshites tried to prevent Muslims from fleeing Mecca to Yathrib, but the converts continued to sneak out gradually.&lt;br /&gt;


The continuing immigration of Muslims to Yathrib where they had allies was already very bad news for the Qurayshites. This could yet get much worse if Muhammad also would move to that city. They decided that they had no other option but to kill him.&lt;br /&gt;


The various clans of the tribe of Quraysh agreed to act as one and assassinate the Prophet while asleep. The idea behind acting collectively was that no one party could be blamed for the killing and become embroiled in a war of vengeance with the clan of Hashim.&lt;br /&gt;


The assassination plan, however, was sabotaged by divine intervention. The night the murder was planned to take place, Allah informed His Prophet of the danger and ordered him to secretly leave Mecca and head to the city of Yathrib. The latter became known as “al-Madina al-Munawwara” (the illuminated city), or “al-Madina” for brief, after the arrival of the Prophet.&lt;br /&gt;


This famous event, known as the “Hijra ” (immigration), occurred in 622 CE, about twelve years after the revelation of the first verses of the Qur’an. This flight was destined to have far-reaching consequences in establishing the Islamic community, strengthening the position of Islam, and spreading its message.&lt;br /&gt;


The Prophet lived in al-Madina for about ten years. By the time of his departure from this world in 632 CE, Islam had become well established as the religion of the Arabian Peninsula and had made inroads in neighboring regions; Muslims had become a major force to be reckoned with in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== '''Abu Bakr''' ==
 Alsiddiq
 &lt;br /&gt;
Was always a very close Companion of the Prophet, he knew him better than any other man. He knew how honest and upright the Prophet was. Such knowledge of the Prophet made Abu Bakr be the first man to follow the Message of Prophet Muhammad . He was indeed the first adult male to accept Islam.&lt;br /&gt;


The Prophet told Abu Bakr what had happened at Hira Cave, he told him that Allah had revealed to him and made him His Messenger. When Abu Bakr heard this from the Prophet , he did not stop to think, he at once became a Muslim. He submitted to Islam with such determination that once the Prophet himself remarked, &quot;I called people to Islam, everybody thought over it, at least for a while, but this was not the case with Abu Bakr, the moment I put Islam before him, he accepted it without any hesitation.&quot; &lt;big&gt;He was titled as-Siddiq by the Prophet&lt;/big&gt; because his faith was too strong to be shaken by anything.&lt;br /&gt;


In fact, Abu Bakr was more than a great believer, as soon as he became a Muslim, he immediately began to preach Islam to others. Among those who accepted Abu Bakr's invitation to Islam were 'Uthman, Az-Zubayr, Talhah, 'Abdur-Rahman ibn Awf, Sa'ad ibn Waqqas and others who later became component's of the prophet themselves.&lt;br /&gt;


Abu Bakr's love of the Prophet was so great that he was willing to sacrifice his life for the sake of protecting and comforting the Prophet saw. Such love and sacrifice were demonstrated when one day the Prophet was saying his prayers in the Ka'bah, while some of the chiefs of Makkah were sitting in the court yard of the Ka'bah. Seeing the Prophet praying, 'Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'it took a long piece of cloth and put it around the Prophet's neck and twisted it hard in an attempt to strangle the Prophet sallallahu to death. At that moment Abu Bakr happened to pass by from a distance, he saw 'Uqbah trying to strangle the Prophet to death. Immediately Abu Bakr ran to the help of the Prophet, he pushed 'Uqbah aside and took the cloth from around the Prophet's neck. Thereupon the enemies of Islam came down upon Abu Bakr and beat him unmercifully, although Abu Bakr with faith like a rock did not care for his own suffering, he was glad that he was able to save the Prophet of Allah, even at the risk of his own life.&lt;br /&gt;


Abu Bakr with the wealth he had, also had a major role in freeing some of the Muslim slaves, who were barbarically tortured by their heartless masters to give up the faith and return to their masters' beliefs. The heartless monsters tried all kinds of torture: they made them lie all naked on the burning desert sand, putting big stones on their chest, as well as other kinds of torture. Here Abu Bakr's wealth came to the rescue, as he bought the poor helpless slaves from their inhuman masters and set them free, Bilal al-Habashi, the slave of 'Umayyah ibn Khalaf, was among those who were set free by Abu Bakr. Bilal became afterwards the mu'adhin at the Prophet's mosque.&lt;br /&gt;


=== ''Migration to Madinah'' ===

Islam was growing rapidly in Makkah, the enemies of Islam were getting frustrated by this rapid growth. The chiefs of Makkah found that it is necessary for them to get rid of the Prophet before Islam can cause a real threat to them, so they planned to kill the Prophet. Allah revealed to his Prophet the intentions of the non-believers and ordered him to migrate to Madinah. So the Prophet quickly went to Abu Bakr's house who was among the few that were left in Makkah with the majority of Muslims having already migrated to Madinah.&lt;br /&gt;


The Prophet informed Abu Bakr that he was commanded to migrate to Madinah that night and that he has chosen him to have the honor of joining him on his migration. Abu Bakr's heart was full of joy, &quot;I have been looking forward to this day for months,&quot; he exclaimed.

The Makkans were so eager to find the Prophet they were searching for him like mad hounds. Once they came to the mouth of the cave, Abu Bakr grew pale with fright, he feared not for himself, but for the life of the Prophet. However, &lt;big&gt;the Prophet remained calm and said to Abu Bakr, &quot;do not fear, certainly Allah is with us&quot;.&lt;/big&gt; Such words quickly calmed down Abu Bakr and brought back tranquility to his heart.&lt;br /&gt;


=== Participation in Battles ===

Abu Bakr, being the closest of Companions to the Prophet sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam, took part in all the battles that Prophet Muhammad had fought.&lt;br /&gt;


At 'Uhud and Hunayn, some members of the Muslim army showed signs of weakness, however, Abu Bakr's faith never wavered, he always stood like a rock by the side of the Prophet.&lt;br /&gt;


Abu Bakr's faith and determination to raise the banner of Islam were so great that at Badr, one of his sons, who had not yet embraced Islam was fighting among the enemies, Abu Bakr was so eager to find his son in the battle that he was searching for him amongst the enemies in order to slay him.&lt;br /&gt;


Abu Bakr's great love of the Prophet was demonstrated when peace talks at Hudaibiya were held. During the negotiations, the spokesman of Quraysh was touching the beard of the Prophet every now and then. Abu Bakr's love for the Prophet was so great that he could bear no more, he took out his sword and looked angrily at the man saying, &quot; ... if that hand touches the beard of the Prophet again, it will not be allowed to go back.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;


Tabuk was the last expedition of the Holy Prophet. He was keen to make it a great success, he therefore asked people to help the expedition with whatever they could. This brought the best out of Abu Bakr who beat all records as he took all his money and household articles and heaped them at the Prophet's feet.&lt;br /&gt;


&quot;Have you left anything for your children?&quot; asked the Prophet. Abu Bakr then responded with great faith &quot;Allah and his Messenger are enough for them.&quot; Companions standing around were stunned they realized that whatever they do they could not outdo Abu Bakr in the field of service to Islam.&lt;br /&gt;


=== The Successor of the Prophet ===

The Prophet Mohammed appointed Abu Bakr as his agent to lead the Hajj in place of him in 9th Year of Hijra. 

The Prophet  led the prayers himself ever since he arrived to Madinah. During his last illness, the Prophet could no longer lead the prayers, he was too weak to go to the mosque, he therefore had to choose someone to fill such high position after him. Abu Bakr was also the one who was honored to be chosen by the Prophet for such a task.&lt;br /&gt;



When the news of the Prophet's death came out, many Muslims were confused and stunned. 'Umar himself was so overcome with emotions that he drew his sword and declared, &quot;If anyone says that the Messenger of Allah is dead, I will cut off his head.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;


Muslims stayed in such state until Abu Bakr arrived and gave his famous address:&lt;br /&gt;


&quot;O People! If anyone among you worshipped Muhammad, let him know that Muhammad is dead. But those who worshipped Allah, let them know that He lives and will never die. Let all of us recall the words of the Qur'an. It says:&lt;br /&gt;


(Muhammad is only a Messenger of Allah, there have been Messengers before him. What then, will you turn back from Islam if he dies or is killed?)&lt;br /&gt;


Suddenly Abu Bakr's words started to sink in, and in no time confusion was gone.

Having shrugged off the shocking news of the Prophet's death, Muslims realized that they need someone to fill the position of leadership amongst them.&lt;br /&gt;


The two main groups amongst Muslims were Muhajirun (refugees from Makkah), and Ansar (the people of Madinah). The Ansar gathered at the Thaqifah Bani Saydah their meeting place. Sa'ad ibn Abadah, the Ansar leader, suggested that the Caliph should be from amongst them. Although many refused saying that the Muhajirun in right have a better claim to Khilafah. When the news reached Abu Bakr, he quickly went to their gathering, fearing that confusion might spread once again, and said, &quot;Both Muhajirun and Ansar have done great service to Islam. But the former were the first to accept Islam, they were always very close to the Messenger of Allah. So, O Ansar, let the Caliph be from amongst them.&quot; After a short discussion, the Ansar agreed that they should choose the Caliph from amongst the Muhajirun, being from the tribe of Quraysh and being the first to accept Islam.&lt;br /&gt;


Abu Bakr then asked people to choose between 'Umar ibn al-Khattab and Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah. Hearing this, both men jumped to their feet and exclaimed &quot;O Siddiq, how can that be? How can anyone else fill this position as long as you are among us? You are the top man amongst he Muhajirun. You were the Companion of the Prophet sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam in the Thawr cave. You led prayers in his place, during his last illness. Prayer is the foremost thing in Islam. With all these qualifications you are the fittest person to be the successor of the Holy Prophet. Hold out your hand that we may pledge loyalty to you.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;


In the next day, Abu Bakr addressed the gathering of Muslims in the Prophet's mosque urging them to continue their path as true Muslims and to give him loyalty and support as long as he is obeying the Commands of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and His Messenger.&lt;br /&gt;
He was followed by Umar, Uthman ibn Affan and then Ali. These four are called the Rashidun caliphs which means The Righteous Caliphs. The word caliph means religious and spiritual leader. Under these caliphs Islam became one of the most important religions of the middle East. Administrative offices of the Muslim nation were established. Under Umar more then two thirds of the Eastern Roman Empire was conquered by the Muslims. Umar also started the Muslim calender.

The first civil war in Islam, also known as the First Fitna broke out in Islam during the rule of the fourth caliph Ali and lasted throughout his caliphate. The third caliph Uthman ibn Affan had been murdered by rebel Muslim groups who had political motives. After Ali took over, the most important problem he faced was that of punishing those responsible for murder. However many people felt that before accepting the position of the caliph, Ali should have focussed his attention on finding and punishing the murderers. A group of people led by Muhammad's wife Aisha(r.a), her brothers in law Talhah and Zubair ibn al-Awam refused to recognize Ali's caliphate. They instead raised an army which met Ali's army at Basra in Iraq, originally for the purposes of negotiations. In the night, some fighting broke out, probably out of confusion or due to rebel groups who were involved in the infamous murder. This led to the Battle of Bassorah (also known as Battle of the Camel) in which Ali's party emerged victorious. Aisha(r.a) was escorted back to Medina honorably after the battle by Ali.

This battle however did not entirely finish the tension in the Muslim empire. Ali was soon challenged by Muawiyah, the governor of the Muslim provinces of Syria. He too raised the issue of punishing Uthman's murderers and refused to acknowledge Ali as caliph until the issue had been solved. Muawiyah was a kinsman of Uthman and his army pledged to bring to justice the murderers and those who sheltered them. People who are sheltering the murderers was a reference to Ali and his followers. Accordingly, the two groups met and fought a battle, called the Battle of Siffin. This battle ended in a draw and so both groups decided on arbitration which also didn't lead to any concrete decision. Another group of Muslims, The Kharijites who had previously been with Ali, meanwhile rejected him because they felt that he was not following true Islam and conducting business over the caliphate as if it were his own property.

In the following years Ali's governors could not prevent his losing provinces to Muawiyah who increased his strength by further expanding his army. Ali had shifted the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa in 656. He was killed by a Kharijite assassin in 661.

I've seen your comment on the [[x86 Assembly]] wikibook, and I wanted to personally thank you. We need all the help we can get on that book, and it is rare to find a contributer here that knows the subject. The [[x86 Assembly]] book was originally created by combining a number of smaller books and articles, some of which were poorly written to begin with. I have been slowing doing work to it myself, but I currently dont have any assemblers on my PC to use in writing example problems. 

You are more then welcome to make any changes that you see fit, and I encourage you to contribute to this project more if you are able and willing. If you need anything at all, you can feel free to leave me a message [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my talk page HERE]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:01, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==3 zones of distortion==

The starting point for dialing-in various electric Rock guitar tone is not a crystal-clean full-range amplifier and speaker, but rather, a tube power amp pushing a guitar speaker that has limited frequency response, with the power tubes on the edge of breakup. 

With power-tube distortion, and to a lesser extent with preamp tube distortion or solid-state distortion pedals, there are three zones: Clean, Compressed, and Distorted, somewhat corresponding to the terms Clean, Crunch or Rhythm, and Lead. The Clean zone ranges from literally clean with linear response, to the beginning of warmth and some smoothing and coloration. The Compressed zone ranges from slightly warm, smoothed, and colored, into slightly audible distortion.  The Distorted zone runs from slight breakup to full distortion.
Mathew laframboise

==Controlling distortion voicing==

An electric guitar has a volume control and tone control.  The volume control almost always has a side-effect on equalization as you turn it down, affecting the pre-distortion equalization (EQ).  The tone control reduces the amount of treble, affecting the pre-distortion EQ and thus the distortion voicing.  

For increased control of the pre-distortion EQ, place an equalizer pedal in-between the guitar and the first distortion stage such as a distortion pedal or the guitar amp's built-in preamp.  Switch between all the pickup settings, in conjunction with changing the distortion settings and EQ settings, to use the full range of basic sounds or &quot;tones&quot; the amp can produce.

The preamp Gain control on the distortion channel of the amp, or the Distortion control on a distortion pedal, sometimes has a side-effect of changing the equalization and thus the distortion voicing.  In that case, you can use a lower distortion setting combined with a higher volume setting prior to the distortion stages, to dial-in a different distortion voicing with the same amount of distortion.

The tone stack on a standard tube amp is in-between the preamp distortion and the power-tube distortion.  Thus the tone stack acts as the final part of shaping the preamp distortion voicing and also shapes the power-tube distortion voicing, together with the Master Volume control, which affects the amount of power-tube distortion voicing.  For maximum power-tube distortion, set the tone controls and Master Volume to maximum, which is equivalent to bypassing them entirely.

When setting the preamp distortion, learn all the ways to adjust the equalization before the preamp distortion, including the guitar's volume and tone controls, a wah pedal, an equalization pedal, and any other volume or tone controls prior to the distortion stage.  These affect the distortion voicing.  More treble causes the treble to predominate in the complex clipping, resulting in a glassy liquid breakup tone; more bass prior to a distortion stage causes a dry, crusty breakup tone.

The same principles hold for controlling the power-tube distortion voicing.  Learn all the ways to affect the equalization and level prior to the tube power amp, but after the preamp distortion.

==Obtaining distortion independently of volume==

To get power-tube distortion quietly or independently of volume level, use a power attenuator or an amplifier that has a built-in power attenuator, or a built-in power-supply based power attenuation (Power Scaling, Power Dampening, a Sag circuit, or a Variac).

It is possible to further voice the power-tube distortion by placing a dummy load (usually a power attenuator set entirely to use its built-in dummy load), an equalizer, and then a solid-state power amp between the power tubes and the guitar speaker.

A guitar speaker is a complex dynamic filter and transducer.  Line-level cabinet simulators attempt to simulate this complex dynamic sound.

In the recording studio, the amp head and speaker cabinet are typically separated and the miked speaker cabinet is placed with microphones in a soundproofed isolation booth or in the live room.  Either location is a soundproofed room separate from the control room where the mic signals return and the full-range monitor speakers reside for listening to the resulting power-tube distortion sound or loud quasi-clean amp sound at a controlled volume.  In a home studio, the guitar speaker is sometimes placed in an isolation box with microphones.

Place one or two microphones near the guitar speaker. If you use two microphones, this causes some complex comb filtering; be prepared to swing the mixer's equalization for the two channels around very freely, because the effects of comb filtering are unpredictable. If you use a single microphone, setting the mixer's equalization is more straightforward.

      <comment>/* Pressure recovery */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Air enters a jet engine via the intake or inlet, which is a shaped duct connecting the streamtube (approaching the inlet) to the compressor face. A major objective is to lose as little total (or stagnation) pressure as possible in the process, whilst minimizing any distortion to the flow entering the compressor. Supersonic intakes often employ cones or ramps to create conical/oblique shock waves to help improve pressure recovery at supersonic flight speeds.

==Functional requirements==

Intakes are matched to the jet engine to provide maximum performance. This imposes different requirements on the intake depending upon the operating regime. 

* Brake release: maximize mass flow by accelerating the static surrounding air without raising entropy.

* Takeoff &amp; climb: Maximize pressure recovery while minimizing flow distortions due to off angle conditions

* Subsonic: maximize pressure recovery at speed and altitude

* Maneuver: Maximize mass throughput for given speed

* Supersonic: maximize pressure recovery at speed and altitude without suffering unstarts

* Hover (VTOL): Maximum mass flow with minimal hot gas reingestion


===Pressure recovery===

The incoming air flow is diffused. For subsonic flows a divergent duct is commonly used and for supersonic flows a convergent divergent duct is used. Supersonic intakes usually require movable structures to perform well. Without such measures lower performance results.

===Distortion avoidance===

The intake straightens the flow at high angles of attack and sideslip conditions. Using flow splitters, the low energy boundary layers next to fuselages can also be removed to provide uniform flow at the compressor face. 


===Noise suppression===

Intakes usually have noise suppression surface treatments to reduce forward noise transmission.

===EMF suppression===

Compressor faces have a distinct dignature that can be supressed by appropriately shaped screens, intake surface treatments and intake vanes.

==Types==

===Pitot===

A diverging forward facing duct is most often used. The length of the duct is governed by the flow straightening, boundary layer development and diffusion requirments. 

//[[Image:jet_engine_intake.JPG||400px|Boeing 747 jet engine intake]]


===3D compression (Conical centrebody)===

For supersonic applications. Conical shockwaves from the central conical ramp are used to progressively compress the supersonic flow till a terminating normal shockwave makes the flow subsonic. From that shock wave onwards a divergent duct is used to diffuse the subsonic flow.

[[Image:MiG-21 RB15.JPG||400px|Cone centrebody intake MiG-21MF]]


The cone can be moved depending upon the speed of operation although the cone angle cannot easily be changed.

===2D compression (ramp)===

A ramp is used to generate the inclined shockwaves to provide compression. The ramp angle is varied depending upon speed of operation. At low speeds the ramp can be oriented to provide minimal acceleration of the flow.

Fuel is injected into the compressed air stream, vaporized, and burned. Typical fuel to air ratios are as low as 1:60 (vs 1:14 of stoichiometric) and flame stabilization is difficult.

The compressor exit flow is diffused and divided into the primary and secondary flows. Since conventional flame velocities are low the primary flow is swirled and fuel is injected to provide the recirculation to stabilize the flame.

The burning area is enclosed by a perforated liner which assists in directing the flame and provides a heat shield for the surrounding structure. The chamber liner is cooled by the secondary air which subsequently mixes with the burning primary flow and cools the burnt gases to the required temperature. 

[[Image:Whittle Jet Engine W2-700.JPG|thumb||The whittle W2/700 engine with 10 can type combustors]]
The early combustion chambers were &quot;can&quot; shaped, and needed individual ignition sources and tuning.

The intermediate design was can-annular or cannular which connected the individual can chambers and provided better uniformity of combustion. 

Annular combustors have a more compact axisymmetric design with only the swirl vanes and injector nozzles locating the primary flame positions. Annular designs are more space and energy efficient. 


===Reverse flow and straight flow===


==Emissions==

Understanding of combustion processes has allowed the development of smokeless combustors.

Annular combustors with dual injection rings are used in engines such as the GE90. Both annuluses are lighted for take off thrust. Under lighter loads such as cruise only one row operates.

==Afterburners==
An [[Jet Propulsion/Afterburner|afterburner]] (or reheat) is a combustor located immediately upstream of the engine final nozzle, where fuel is burnt to raise the nozzle entry gas temperature, thereby increasing the net thrust of the engine. Because of the relatively high fuel consumption associated with afterburning, the system has to be used sparingly. A variable area nozzle is normally fitted to accommodate the increased gas volume flow when the afterburner is alight. Increasing the nozzle area enables a satisfactory compression match to be maintained, as nozzle temperature is increased. Afterburning is used mainly on military aircraft to reduce take-off roll and to overcome the additional drag encountered when the aircraft is flying at transonic and supersonic conditions. Concorde, the supersonic airliner, also incorporated engine afterburning, but the system  was unlit at supersonic cruise, which considerably enhanced the aircraft's range.

No, It's not Turkish (I own a Turkish restaurant), but it's definately NOT Greek.  It is Middle Eastern, and the name Humus (Homous, Hommos etc etc) is Arabic.  Most probably it's from the region around Lebanon.
--[[User:Alper|Alper]] 14:32, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

It is a common missconception that Hummus is a Greek recipe. 
I see this frequently in UK supermarkets. 
It's deffinetly middle-eastern.

I have seen MANY varients from all over . ie from palistine/israel they add some parsley to it and like lebanon they add a little more garlic.

{{TextBox|The 2006-07 Career Guide to Industries &amp;mdash; U.S. Department of Labor &amp;mdash; Bureau of Labor Statistics &amp;mdash; Bulletin 2601 &amp;mdash; Career Guide to Industries, Overview and Outlook}}

The U.S. economy is comprised of industries with diverse characteristics. For each industry covered in the Career Guide, detailed information is provided about specific characteristics: The nature of the industry, working conditions, employment, occupational composition, training and advancement requirements, earnings, and job outlook. This chapter provides an overview of these characteristics and the outlook for the various industries and economy as a whole.

== Nature of the Industry ==

Industries are defined by the processes they use to produce goods and services. Workers in the United States produce and provide a wide variety of products and services and, as a result, the types of industries in the U.S. economy range widely�from agriculture, forestry, and fishing to aerospace manufacturing. Each industry has a unique combination of occupations, production techniques, inputs and outputs, and business characteristics. Understanding the nature of the industry is important because it is this unique combination that determines working conditions, educational requirements, and the job outlook for each of the industries discussed in the Career Guide.

Industries consist of many different places of work, called establishments. Establishments are physical locations in which people work, such as the branch office of a bank, a gasoline service station, a school, a department store, or a plant that manufactures machinery. Establishments range from large factories and corporate office complexes employing thousands of workers to small community stores, restaurants, professional offices, and service businesses employing only a few workers. Establishments should not be confused with companies or corporations, which are legal entities. Thus, a company or corporation may have a single establishment or more than one establishment. Establishments that use the same or similar processes to produce goods or services are organized together into industries. Industries are, in turn, organized together into industry groups. These are further organized into industry subsectors and then ultimately into industry sectors. For the purposes of labor market analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics organized industry sectors into industry supersectors. A company or corporation could own establishments classified in more than one industry, industry sector, or even industry supersector.

Each industry subsector is made up of a number of industry groups, which are, as mentioned, determined by differences in production processes. An easily recognized example of these distinctions is in the food manufacturing subsector, which is made up of industry groups that produce meat products, preserved fruits and vegetables, bakery items, and dairy products, among others. Each of these industry groups requires workers with varying skills and employs unique production techniques. Another example of these distinctions is found in utilities, which employs workers in establishments that provide electricity, natural gas, and water.

There were slightly more than 8 million private business establishments in the United States in March 2004. Business establishments in the United States are predominantly small; 59.9 percent of all establishments employed fewer than 5 workers in March 2004. However, the medium-sized to large establishments employ a greater proportion of all workers. For example, establishments that employed 50 or more workers accounted for only 4.6 percent of all establishments, yet employed 56.3 percent of all workers. The large establishments�those with more than 500 workers�accounted for only 0.2 percent of all establishments, but employed 17.3 percent of all workers. Table 1 presents the percent distribution of employment according to establishment size.

The average size of these establishments varies widely across industries. Most establishments in the construction, wholesale trade, retail trade, finance and insurance, real estate and rental and leasing, and professional, scientific, and technical services industries are small, averaging fewer than 20 employees per establishment. However, wide differences within industries can exist. Hospitals, for example, employ an average of 724.9 workers, while physicians� offices employ an average of 10.1. Similarly, although there is an average of 14.3 employees per establishment for all of retail trade, department stores employ an average of 124.1 people but jewelry stores employ an average of only 5.8.

Establishment size can play a role in the characteristics of each job. Large establishments generally offer workers greater occupational mobility and advancement potential, whereas small establishments may provide their employees with broader experience by requiring them to assume a wider range of responsibilities. Also, small establishments are distributed throughout the Nation�every locality has a few small businesses. Large establishments, in contrast, employ more workers and are less common, but they play a much more prominent role in the economies of the areas in which they are located.

== Working Conditions ==

Just as the goods and services produced in each industry are different, working conditions vary significantly among industries. In some industries, the work setting is quiet, temperature-controlled, and virtually hazard free, while other industries are characterized by noisy, uncomfortable, and sometimes dangerous work environments. Some industries require long workweeks and shift work, but standard 40-hour workweeks are common in many other industries. In still other industries, a lot of the jobs can be seasonal, requiring long hours during busy periods and abbreviated schedules during slower months. Production processes, establishment size, and the physical location of work usually determine these varying conditions.

One of the most telling indicators of working conditions is an industry�s injury and illness rate. Overexertion, being struck by an object, and falls on the same level, are among the most common incidents causing work-related injury or illness. In 2003, approximately 5.0 million nonfatal injuries and illnesses were reported throughout private industry. Among major industry divisions, manufacturing and construction tied for the highest rate of injury and illness�6.8 cases for every 100 full time workers�while financial activities had the lowest rate�1.7 cases. About 5,700 work-related fatalities were reported in 2004; the most common events resulting in fatal injuries were transportation incidents, contact with objects and equipment, assaults and violent acts, and falls.

Work schedules are another important reflection of working conditions, and the operational requirements of each industry lead to large differences in hours worked and in part-time versus full-time status. In food services and drinking places, for example, fully 38.0 percent of employees worked part time in 2004 compared with only 1.5 percent in motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment manufacturing. Table 2 presents industries having relatively high and low percentages of part-time workers.

The low proportion of part-time workers in some manufacturing industries often reflects the continuous nature of the production processes that makes it difficult to adapt the volume of production to short-term fluctuations in product demand. Once begun, it is costly to halt these processes; machinery must be tended and materials must be moved continuously. For example, the chemical manufacturing industry produces many different chemical products through controlled chemical reactions. These processes require chemical operators to monitor and adjust the flow of materials into and out of the line of production. Because production may continue 24 hours a day, 7 days a week under the watchful eyes of chemical operators who work in shifts, full-time workers are more likely to be employed. Retail trade and service industries, on the other hand, have seasonal cycles marked by various events that affect the hours worked, such as school openings or important holidays. During busy times of the year, longer hours are common, whereas slack periods lead to cutbacks in work hours and shorter workweeks. Jobs in these industries are generally appealing to students and others who desire flexible, part-time schedules.

== Employment ==

The total number of jobs in the United States in 2004 was 145.6 million. This included 12.1 million self-employed workers, 141,000 unpaid workers in family businesses, and 133.5 million wage and salary jobs�including primary and secondary job holders. The total number of jobs is projected to increase to 164.5 million by 2014, and wage and salary jobs are projected to account for more than 152.1 million of them.

As shown in table 3, wage and salary jobs are the vast majority of all jobs, but they are not evenly divided among the various industries. Education, health, and social services had the largest number of jobs in 2004 with almost 28 million. Manufacturing, construction, and utilities had almost 21.9 million jobs, including 14.3 million manufacturing and 7.0 million construction jobs. The trade supersector was nearly as large, with about 20.7 million jobs, followed by professional and business services with 16.4 million jobs in 2004. Among the industries covered in the Career Guide, wage and salary employment ranged from only 156,200 in steel manufacturing to over 13 million in health care. The three largest industries�education services, health care, and food services and drinking places�together accounted for 34.7 million jobs, over one-quarter of the Nation's wage and salary employment.

;Note: May not add to totals due to omission of industries not covered in the Career Guide.

Although workers of all ages are employed in each industry, certain industries tend to possess workers of distinct age groups. For the previously mentioned reasons, retail trade employs a relatively high proportion of younger workers to fill part-time and temporary positions. The manufacturing sector, on the other hand, has a relatively high median age because many jobs in the sector require a number of years to learn and perfect specialized skills that do not easily transfer to other firms. Also, manufacturing employment has been declining, providing fewer opportunities for younger workers to get jobs. As a result, one-forth of the workers in retail trade were 24 years of age or younger in 2004, compared with only 8.2 percent of workers in manufacturing. Table 4 contrasts the age distribution of workers in all industries with the distributions in five very different industries.

Employment in some industries is concentrated in one region of the country. Such industries often are located near a source of raw or unfinished materials upon which the industry relies. For example, oil and gas extraction jobs are concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma; many textile mills and products manufacturing jobs are found in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia; and a significant proportion of motor vehicle manufacturing jobs are located in Michigan and Ohio. On the other hand, some industries�such as grocery stores and educational services�have jobs distributed throughout the Nation, reflecting the general population density.

== Occupations in the Industry ==

The occupations found in each industry depend on the types of services provided or goods produced. For example, because construction companies require skilled trades workers to build and renovate buildings, these companies employ large numbers of carpenters, electricians, plumbers, painters, and sheet metal workers. Other occupations common to construction include construction equipment operators and mechanics, installers, and repairers. Retail trade, on the other hand, displays and sells manufactured goods to consumers. As a result, retail trade employs numerous retail salespersons and other workers, including more than three-fourths of all cashiers. Table 5 shows the industry sectors and the occupational groups that predominate in each.

The Nation�s occupational distribution clearly is influenced by its industrial structure, yet there are many occupations, such as general managers or secretaries, that are found in all industries. In fact, some of the largest occupations in the U.S. economy are dispersed across many industries. For example, professional and related occupations is among the largest in the Nation while also experiencing the fastest growth rate. . (See table 6.) Other large occupational groups include service occupations, office and administrative support occupations, sales and related occupations, and management, business, and financial occupations.

== Training and Advancement ==

Workers prepare for employment in many ways, but the most fundamental form of job training in the United States is a high school education. Better than 88 percent of the Nation�s workforce possessed a high school diploma or its equivalent in 2004. However, many occupations require more training, so growing numbers of workers pursue additional training or education after high school. In 2004, 28.7 percent of the Nation�s workforce reported having completed some college or an associate's degree as their highest level of education, while an additional 29.5 percent continued in their studies and attained a bachelor's or higher degree. In addition to these types of formal education, other sources of qualifying training include formal company-provided training, apprenticeships, informal on-the-job training, correspondence courses, Armed Forces vocational training, and non-work-related training.

The unique combination of training required to succeed in each industry is determined largely by the industry�s production process and the mix of occupations it requires. For example, manufacturing employs many machine operators who generally need little formal education after high school, but sometimes complete considerable on-the-job training. In contrast, educational services employs many types of teachers, most of whom require a bachelor�s or higher degree. Training requirements by industry sector are shown in table 7.

Persons with no more than a high school diploma accounted for about 64.7 percent of all workers in construction; 64.3 in agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; 60.7 percent in accommodation and food services; 60.4 percent in mining; 51.5 percent in manufacturing; and 50.6 in retail trade. On the other hand, those who had acquired a bachelor�s or higher degree accounted for 63.2 percent of all workers in private educational services; 60.6 percent in professional, scientific, and technical services; 43.4 percent in finance and insurance; and 42.0 percent in information.

Education and training also are important factors in the variety of advancement paths found in different industries. Each industry has some unique advancement paths, but workers who complete additional on-the-job training or education generally help their chances of being promoted. In much of the manufacturing sector, for example, production workers who receive training in management and computer skills increase their likelihood of being promoted to supervisory positions. Other factors that impact advancement and that may figure prominently in the industries covered in the Career Guide include the size of the establishments, institutionalized career tracks, and the mix of occupations. As a result, persons who seek jobs in particular industries should be aware of how these advancement paths and other factors may later shape their careers.

== Earnings ==

Like other characteristics, earnings differ by industry, the result of a highly complicated process that reflects a number of factors. For example, earnings may vary due to the nature of occupations in the industry, average hours worked, geographical location, workers� average age, educational requirements, industry profits, and the degree of union representation of the workforce. In general, wages are highest in metropolitan areas to compensate for the higher cost of living. Also, as would be expected, industries that employ a large proportion of unskilled minimum-wage or part time workers tend to have lower earnings.

The difference in earnings of between the software publishers and the food services and drinking places industries illustrates how various characteristics of industries can result in great differences in earnings. In software publishers, earnings of all wage and salary workers averaged $1,342 a week in 2004, while in food service and drinking places, earnings of all wage and salary workers the averaged only $194 weekly. The difference is large primarily because software publishing establishments employ more highly skilled, full-time workers, while food services and drinking places employ many lower skilled workers on a part time basis. In addition, most workers in software publishing are paid an annual salary, while many workers in food service and drinking places are paid an hourly wage, but many are able to supplement their low hourly wage rate with money they receive as tips. Table 8 highlights the industries with the highest and lowest average weekly earnings.

Employee benefits, once a minor addition to wages and salaries, continue to grow in diversity and cost. In addition to traditional benefits�paid vacations, life and health insurance, and pensions�many employers now offer various benefits to accommodate the needs of a changing labor force. Such benefits sometimes include childcare, employee assistance programs that provide counseling for personal problems, and wellness programs that encourage exercise, stress management, and self-improvement. Benefits vary among occupational groups, full- and part-time workers, public and private sector workers, regions, unionized and nonunionized workers, and small and large establishments. Data indicate that full-time workers and those in medium-sized and large establishments�those with 100 or more workers�usually receive better benefits than do part-time workers and those in smaller establishments.

Union representation of the workforce varies widely by industry, and it also may play a role in determining earnings and benefits. In 2004, about 13.8 percent of workers throughout the Nation were union members or covered by union contracts. As table 9 demonstrates, union affiliation of workers varies widely by industry. Fully 50.0 percent of the workers in air transportation were union members, the highest rate of all the industries, followed by 37.6 percent in educational services, and 33.0 percent in iron and steel mills and steel product manufacturing. Industries with the lowest unionization rate include computer systems design and related services, 1.3 percent; food services and drinking places, 1.7 percent; and advertising and related services, 1.7 percent.

== Outlook ==

Total employment in the United States is projected to increase by about 14 percent over the 2004-14 period. Employment growth, however, is only one source of job openings. The total number of openings in any industry also depends on the industry�s current employment level and its need to replace workers who leave their jobs. Throughout the economy, replacement needs will create more job openings than will employment growth. Employment size is a major determinant of job openings�larger industries generally have larger numbers of workers who must be replaced and provide more openings. The occupational composition of an industry is another factor. Industries with high concentrations of professional, technical, and other jobs that require more formal education�occupations in which workers tend to leave their jobs less frequently�generally have fewer openings resulting from replacement needs. On the other hand, more replacement openings generally occur in industries with high concentrations of service, laborer, and other jobs that require little formal education and have lower wages because workers in these jobs are more likely to leave their occupations.

Employment growth is determined largely by changes in the demand for the goods and services provided by an industry, worker productivity, and foreign competition. Each industry is affected by a different set of variables that determines the number and composition of jobs that will be available. Even within an industry, employment may grow at different rates in different occupations. For example, changes in technology, production methods, and business practices in an industry might eliminate some jobs, while creating others. Some industries may be growing rapidly overall, yet opportunities for workers in occupations could be stagnant or even declining because they are adversely affected by technological change. Similarly, employment of some occupations may be declining in the economy as a whole, yet may be increasing in a rapidly growing industry.

As shown above in table 3, employment growth rates over the next decade will vary widely among industries. Agriculture and natural resources is the only sector in which all of the industries are expected to experience employment declines. Consolidation of farm land, increasing worker productivity, and depletion of wild fish stocks should continue to decrease employment in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Employment in mining is expected to decline due to laborsaving technology while jobs in oil and gas extraction are expected to decrease with the continued reliance on foreign sources of energy.

Employment in manufacturing, construction, and utilities is expected to remain nearly unchanged as growth in construction is partially offset by declines in utilities and selected manufacturing industries. Growth in construction employment will stem from new factory construction as existing facilities are modernized; from new school construction, reflecting growth in the school-age population; and from infrastructure improvements, such as road and bridge construction. Employment declines are expected in chemical manufacturing, except drugs; machinery manufacturing; computer and electronic product manufacturing; printing; steel manufacturing; and textile, textile product, and apparel manufacturing. Textile, textile product, and apparel manufacturing is projected to lose about 321,200 jobs over the 2004-14 period�more than any other manufacturing industry�due primarily to increasing imports replacing domestic products.

Employment gains are expected in some manufacturing industries. Small employment gains in food manufacturing is expected, as a growing and ever more diverse population increases the demand for manufactured food products. Employment growth in pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing is expected, as sales of pharmaceuticals increase with growth in the population, particularly among the elderly, and with the introduction of new medicines to the market. Both food and pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing also have growing export markets. Aerospace product and parts manufacturing and motor vehicle and parts manufacturing are both expected to have modest employment increases.

Growth in overall employment will result primarily from growth in service-providing industries over the 2004-14 period, almost all of which are expected to have increasing employment. Job growth is expected to be led by health care and educational services�the two largest industries discussed in the Career Guide�with large numbers of new jobs also in employment services, food services and drinking places, state and local government, and wholesale trade. When combined, these sectors will account for almost half of all new wage and salary jobs across the Nation. Employment growth is expected in many other service-providing industries discussed in the Career Guide, but they will result in far fewer numbers of new jobs.

Health care will account for the most new wage and salary jobs, about 3.6 million over the 2004-14 period. Population growth, advances in medical technologies that increase the number of treatable diseases, and a growing share of the population in older age groups will drive employment growth. Offices of physicians, the largest health care industry group, is expected to account for about 760,000 of these new jobs as patients seek more health care outside of the traditional inpatient hospital setting.

Educational services is expected to grow by nearly 17 percent over the 2004-14 period, adding about 2.1 million new jobs. A growing emphasis on improving education and making it available to more children and young adults will be the primary factors contributing to employment growth. Employment growth at all levels of education is expected, particularly at the postsecondary level, as children of the baby boomers continue to reach college age, and as more adults pursue continuing education to enhance or update their skills.

Employment in one of the Nation�s fastest growing industries�employment services�is expected to increase by more than 45 percent, adding another 1.6 million jobs over the 2004-14 period. Employment will increase, particularly in temporary help services and professional employer organizations, as businesses seek new ways to make their workforces more specialized and responsive to changes in demand.

The food services and drinking places industry is expected to add almost 1.5 million new jobs over the 2004-14 projection period. Increases in population, dual-income families, and dining sophistication will contribute to job growth. In addition, the increasing diversity of the population will contribute to job growth in food services and drinking places that offer a wider variety of ethnic foods and drinks.

Over 890,000 new jobs are expected to arise in State and local government, adding over 11 percent over the 2004-14 period. Job growth will result primarily from growth in the population and its demand for public services. Additional job growth will result as State and local governments continue to receive greater responsibility for administering federally funded programs from the Federal Government.

Wholesale trade is expected to add almost 480,000 new jobs over the coming decade, reflecting growth both in trade and in the overall economy. Most new jobs will be for sales representatives at the wholesale and manufacturing levels. However, industry consolidation and the growth of electronic commerce using the Internet are expected to limit job growth to 8.4 percent over the 2004-14 period, less than the 14 percent projected for all industries.

Continual changes in the economy have far-reaching and complex effects on employment in each of the industries covered in the Career Guide. Jobseekers should be aware of these changes, keeping alert for developments that can affect job opportunities in industries and the variety of occupations that are found in each industry. For more detailed information on specific occupations, consult the 2006-07 edition of the Occupational Outlook Handbook, which provides information on hundreds of occupations.

__TOC__

==Introduction==

'''Pathology''' is the study of the processes underlying disease and other forms of illness, harmful abnormality, or dysfunction. Within biology but also a branch of medicine, it means specifically the study and diagnosis of the structural and functional changes in cells, tissues and organs that underlie disease. Pathology as a field of knowledge hence forms the basis of the scientific reasoning behind the practice of medicine. 

==Scope of pathology==
The primary goal of pathology is the study of the four main aspects of a disease:
* Etiology: what causes the disease
* Pathogenesis: the mechanism by which a certain etiological factor causes disease
* Morphologic changes: the structural changes induced in the cells, tissues and organs
* Clinical significance: the functional consequences of the morphologic changes

== Pathologists' work ==
Because the public rarely meets pathologists, their work is not well understood. Pathology is a large and diverse field that allows a pathologist to participate in multiple areas of the field or focus their scope to a specific area.

Essential to everyday surgeries, pathologists are responsible for processing and reporting on all '''specimens generated during surgery'''.  Tissue samples are taken from the submitted specimens, stained, and processed for microscopic evaluation.  Microscopic examination searches for disease of any type and this information is returned to the surgeon via a pathology report.

Pathologists are also responsible for '''laboratory specimens'''. They, along with medical technologists, process specimens at medical laboratories for interpretations. In other words, when a doctor refers to a &quot;laboratory result&quot;, they are not referring to a number generated by a black box; instead, it is the interpretation of a value by a pathologist or a technologist. It is also important to understand that a different laboratory might produce a different value on the same specimen.

Pathologists are also called upon to perform '''autopsies'''. Autopsies represent less than 5% of the workload of a typical modern pathologist. There exists a subspecialty in pathology that allows for the training of medical examiners who wish to pursue forensics. 

Pathologists usually do not see patients, but do on occasion such as when performing bone marrow biopsies and aspirates or fine needle aspirations of superficial nodules.  Thus, pathology is best considered a form of '''diagnostic medicine'''.

In addition to the diagnosis of disease, including cancer, and the administration of medical laboratories, pathologists often participate in the '''teaching''' of medical students (Pathology is a core course in the medical curriculum).

Pathologists express their opinion as a '''pathology report''' addressed to the doctor requesting it. Since pathologists most often communicate with other doctors, they are sometimes nicknamed &quot;the doctor's doctor&quot;.

Pathology is often considered the most '''scientific''' branch of medicine because of the available avenues of research involving human material.

Finally, the circulation of laboratory data is a central issue in medical '''informatics''' and the current tendency towards electronic medical records.

==Tools of pathology==
The techniques used most often in the study of the disease process and hence diagnosis are:
* Gross pathology: the recognition of disease based on macroscopic examination of surgical specimens generated at the time of surgery or at autopsy.
* Histology: the microscopic study of tissues. Histopathology is the science of diagnosing diseases on the basis of the histological aspect of the diseased tissues.
* Cytology: the study of detached cells. Cytopathology is the science of diagnosing diseases on the basis of the cytological aspects of detached cells. The most common application of this technique is the Pap smear.
* Clinical chemistry: the gathering, detection, and reporting of an incredible array of chemical measures found by the analysis of collected body samples.
* Immunology: the use of specific immune markers and antibodies to aid in the diagnosis of disease.
* Flow cytometry:analysis of a process that allows for the identification of specific cells .
* Molecular Biology techniques, like PCR and Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are increasingly useful to diagnose diseases, especially microbiological and cancer diagnosis.

===Medicine===

In the United States, pathologists are medical doctors (MD) or doctors of osteopathic medicine (DO), that have completed a four year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, and four to five years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology residency. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the American Board of Pathology:
* Anatomic Pathology, the science of diagnosing diseases based on the appearance, both gross and microscopic appearance of tissues.
* Clinical Pathology, the science of diagnosing diseases based on the analysis of body fluids like blood, urine, etc.

Most pathologists seek a broad based training in both fields and thus require five years of postgraduate training known as residency.  Finally, a board certification examination is required.  Boarding requirements are set by the [http://www.abpath.org/default.aspx American Board of Pathology].  Pathologists, like all other medical doctors, are also required to meet continuing medical education requirements.

==Pathology laboratories==

A '''pathology laboratory''' ('''medical''' or  '''clinical''' laboratory) is a laboratory where tests are done on biological specimens in order to get information about the health of a patient.

===Types of laboratory===
In many countries, there are two main types of labs that process the majority of medical specimens. '''Hospital laboratories''' are attached to a hospital, and perform tests on these patients. '''Private''' (or '''community''') '''laboratories''' receive samples from general practitioners, insurance companies, and other health clinics for analysis.

For extremely specialised tests, samples may go to an environmental science or research laboratory.

A lot of samples are sent between different labs for uncommon tests. It is more cost effective if a particular laboratory specialises in a rare test, receiving specimens (and money) from other labs, while sending away tests it cannot do.

===Sample processing===
 Sample processing will usually start with a set of samples and a request form.

Typically a set of vacutainer tubes containing blood, or any other specimen will arrive to the laboratory in a small plastic bag, along with the form.

The form and the specimens are given a laboratory number. The specimens will usually all receive the same number, often as a sticker that can be placed on the tubes and form. 
Entry of requests onto a laboratory management system involves typing, or scanning (where barcodes are used) in the laboratory number, and entering the patient identification, as well as any tests requested. This allows laboratory machines, computers and staff to know what tests are pending, and also gives a place (such as a hospital department, doctor or other customer) for results to go.

. For biochemistry samples, blood is usually centrifuged and serum is separated. If the serum needs to go on more than one machine, it can be divided into separate tubes.

Many specimens end up in one or more sophisticated automated analyser, that process a fraction of the sample and return one or more &quot;results&quot;.

== Laboratory Informatics ==
Laboratories today are held together by a system of software programs and computers that exchange data about patients, test requests and test results, known as a ''laboratory information system''.

This system enables hospitals and labs to send the correct test requests for each sample and keep track of individual patient or sample history, and help to guarantee a better quality of results, as well as publishing the results for doctors to check and patients to read.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The pathology department is involved in discovering/confirming the cause of someone's death and in using tissue samples to diagnose diseases in living subjects.

=The role of the pathology department.=

Attention should be drawn to the nature of the samples being processed and the processing procedures.

Samples are fixed and sectioned on to slides, and then stained for microscopy.

Candidates could look at prepared slides back in school or college, and make comparisons of different tissue types; for example of the appearance of pathological changes in tissues.

=Types of specimens tested.=

Solid tissue, cell smears, blood samples, etc.

=What does the work involve?=

*Histology: process solid tissue removed from the body to make slides and examine cellular detail.

*Cytology: examine smears of cells (such as from the cervix) for evidence of cancer and other conditions.

*Cytogenetics: involves using blood and other cells to get a karyotype. This can be helpful in prenatal diagnosis (e.g. Down's syndrome) as well as in cancer (some cancers have abnormal chromosomes).

Preparation of tissue samples for microscope slides.
Recognising conditions such as atheroma and emphysema from prepared microscope slides.

The stages involved in processing specimens:

*sending and receipt of specimens
*recording
*sorting
*storage
*testing
*recording, interpretation and dissemination of results
use of computers and the Data Protection Act.

=Anatomic pathology=

'''Anatomic pathology''' is the branch of [[pathology]] that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the gross and microscopic examination of cells and tissues. The father of the modern Anatomical pathology is the Italian [[w:Giovanni Battista Morgagni]].

Anatomic Pathology (AP) is one of the two primary certifications offered by the [http://www.abpath.org/default.aspx American Board of Pathology]. The other is [[w:Clinical Pathology]] (CP).

==Role of the anatomic pathologist==
Contrary to popular belief, the field mostly concerns the study of tissue obtained from live patients. In fact, almost all tissues removed from a patient for any reason are examined by a pathologist. The autopsy, though, remains an important tool in gaining medical knowledge.

'''[[w:Biopsy]]''' specimens are small pieces of tissue. Biopsy of a tumour is helpful when its nature is uncertain. Histological examination of the tumour biopsy usually allows the pathologist to determine if the tumour is benign or malignant, and differentiate between different types of cancer. This information is important for accurate estimation of the prognosis and choice of the best therapy. Biopsies can also be used to diagnose diseases other than cancer. For example, the dermatopathologist sees many skin biopsies from rashes and other inflammatory skin diseases, taken by dermatologists when the nature of the disease is not evident. Stomach and colon biopsies are also taken to help diagnose inflammatory or infectious diseases of the digestive tract. 

In contrast to a biopsy that merely samples a lesion, an '''excision''' (or resection) specimen is the complete removal of the tumour or diseased organ by a surgeon. For example, a mastectomy specimen contains the whole breast tissue, overlying skin and adjacent lymph nodes. On excision specimens, the pathologist will comment on surgical margins to estimate the likelihood that the tumour was completely excised during the surgery. 

The opinion of the pathologist is written as a '''pathology report''' addressed to the doctor who performed the procedure.

==Procedures==

The procedures used in anatomic pathology include:
* Gross pathology, the examination of diseased tissues with the naked eye. This is important especially for large tissue fragments, because the disease can often be visually identified. It is also at this step that the pathologist selects the part that will be processed for histopathology.

* [[Histopathology]] is the microscopic examination of stained tissue sections using histological techniques. The standard stains are haematoxylin and eosin but many others exist. The science of staining tissues sections is called histochemistry. Antibodies can also be used to stain specific proteins, a technique called immunohistochemistry. Specific DNA and RNA molecules can be identified on sections using the technique of ‘’in situ’’ hybridization. When the probe is labelled with fluorescent dye, the technique is called Fluorescent ‘’in situ’’ hybridisation (FISH).

* [[Cytopathology]] is the examination of loose cells spread and stained on glass slides using cytology techniques.
* Electron microscopy is used to identify organelles within the cells. Its usefulness has been greatly reduced by immunhistochemistry but it is still irreplaceable for the diagnosis of kidney disease, identification of immotile cilia syndrome and many other tasks.
* Tissue cytogenetics can identify genetics defects, like chromosomal translocation.
* Flow immunophenotyping is the determination of the immunophenotype of cells using flow cytometry techniques. It is very useful to diagnose the different types of leukaemia and lymphoma.

==Subspecialties==
Doctors turn to pathologists for help when the diagnosis is not evident. Therefore, pathologists are expected to know many more diseases than clinicians - they are the &quot;doctor's doctor&quot;. The amount of knowledge needed is enormous. Since one person cannot possibly know everything, pathologists tend to sub-specialize. The [http://www.abpath.org American Board of Pathology] certifies anatomic pathologists, and recognizes the following secondary specialties of Anatomic Pathology: Neuropathology, Cytopathology, Dermatopathology, Forensic pathology, Hematology. Here is a (probably incomplete) list of the commonly recognized subspecialties, including those which do not have subspecialty boards:
*Surgical pathology: diagnosis of diseases in organs removed by general surgeons, especially breast, lung, bowel. This is the core of anatomic pathology. Most of these organs are covered by sub-subspecialties:
**Gastrointestinal pathology: diagnosis of bowel diseases from biopsies taken by a gastroenterologist. One of its sub-subspecialty is hepatopathology, the diagnosis of liver diseases based on liver biopsy.
**Uropathology, including diseases of the urinary tract and the male genital tract
**Cardiac pathology
**Pulmonary pathology
**Endocrine pathology
**Gynaecologic Pathology, including diseases of the female genital tract and the placenta
**soft tissue pathology and orthopaedic pathology
**E.N.T. Pathology
**Neuropathology: diagnosis of diseases from tissues removed by neurosurgeons. Neuropathologists also examine whole brains and spinal cords removed at autopsy. Additionally, neuropathologists are called upon to interpret muscle and peripheral nerve biopsies. And, at many institutions, they are called upon to examine eyeball specimens from patients who have undergone ocular exenteration.
**Dermatopathology: diagnosis of skin diseases from the histological examination of skin biopsies taken by a dermatologist.
**Ophthalmic pathology
**Haematopathology
**Nephropathology
**Paediatric pathology and its sub-subspecialty neonatal pathology
**Immunopathology
*Cytopathology
*Forensic pathology

Oral &amp; Maxillofacial pathology is different; the [http://www.abomp.org/ American Board] of Oral and maxillofacial pathology certifies dentistry doctors, not medical doctors, to practice this sub-specialty of Pathology.

==Histopathology==

'''Histopathology''' is a field of pathology which specialises in the histologic study of diseased tissue.  It is an important tool of anatomical pathology and is used for accurate diagnosis of cancer and other diseases.

===Collection of tissues===
Histopathological examination of tissues starts with surgery, biopsy or autopsy.  The tissue is removed, and then placed in a fixative which stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay.  The most common fixative is formalin (10% formaldehyde in water).

===Preparation for histology===
The tissue is then prepared using histology procedures for viewing under a microscope. Briefly, the samples are transferred to a cassette, a container designed to allow reagents to freely act on the tissue inside.  This cassette is immersed in multiple baths of progressively more concentrated ethanol, to dehydrate the tissue, followed by toluene or xylene, and finally hot liquid paraffin.  During this 12 to 16 hour process, paraffin will replace the water in the tissue, turning soft, moist tissues into a sample miscible with paraffin, a type of wax.  This process is known as '''tissue processing'''.

The processed tissue is then taken out of the cassette and set in a mould.  Through this process of '''embedding''', additional paraffin is added to create a paraffin block which is attached to the outside of the cassette.

The process of embedding then allows the sectioning of tissues into very thin (2 - 7 micrometer) sections using a microtome.  The microtome slices the tissue ready for microscopic examination. The slices are thinner than the average cell, and are layered on a glass slide for staining.

To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more pigments. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components, counterstains are used to provide contrast.

The most commonly used stain in histopathology is a combination of haematoxylin and eosin. Haematoxylin is used to stain cell nuclei blue, while eosin stains cytoplasm and the extracellular connective tissue matrix pink.  There are hundreds of various other techniques which have been used to selectively stain cells. Other compounds used to colour tissue sections include safranin, oil red o, Congo red, silver salts and artificial dyes.  '''Histochemistry''' refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. A commonly performed histochemical technique is the Perls Prussian Blue reaction, used to demonstrate iron deposits in diseases like Haemochromatosis.

Recently, antibodies are used to stain specific proteins,lipids and carbohydrates: this is called immunohistochemistry.  This technique has greatly increased the ability to specifically identify categories of cells under a microscope.  Other advanced techniques include '''in situ hybridization''' to identify specific DNA or RNA molecules.
Digital cameras are increasingly used to capture histopathological images.

==Interpretation==
The histological slides are examined under a microscope by a pathologist, a medically qualified specialist. The diagnosis is formulated as a '''pathology report''' describing the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. In the case of cancer, this represents the '''tissue diagnosis''' required for most treatment protocols.

An '''atheroma''' (plural: atheromata) is an abnormal inflammatory accumulation of macrophage white blood cells within the walls of arteries. These anatomic lesions typically begin in later childhood, well before age 10, and progress over time. Veins do not develop atheromata, unless surgically moved to function as an artery, as in bypass surgery.  The accumulation is always between the endothelium lining and the smooth muscle wall of the arterial tube. While the early stages, based on gross appearance, have traditionally been termed fatty streaks by pathologists, they are not composed of fat, i.e. adipose cells. In the context of heart or artery matters, '''atheroma''' are commonly referred to as &quot;plaque.&quot;

Collectively, the process of atheroma development within an individual is called atherogenesis and the overall result of the disease process is termed atherosclerosis.

===Stages===
In humans, atheroma usually begin in later childhood, about ages 5–9, as [[fatty streaks]]. These, and older, larger atheroma lesions have long been observed in autopsy examinations of people who have died for unrelated reasons; they are so common, more so with increasing age, they were long considered normal, even though clearly unhealthy.

More advanced atheroma develop multiple different internal tissue characteristics within the same atheroma. By light microscopy visualisation, pathologists have characterized as many as 10 different tissue subtypes within a single advanced atheroma. Generally, these range from collections of macrophage cells, always the initiating cells in the newest sections of atheroma, to more complex structures including living cells, cellular debris of cells which have died and extracelluar deposits of fibrous tissue &amp; calcified crystals, within the oldest, outermost portions of atheroma structures.

Atheroma typically progress silently for decades and remain undetected by most clinical diagnostic approaches, including cardiac stress testing and angiography. Eventually, their presence is revealed by disastrous clinical events and permanent disability, such as heart attack or stroke, with the majority of people assuming they were healthy until finally proven otherwise by events. For some individuals, warning symptoms do occur before the onset of major debility or death, however these are the minority.

Historically physicians, who are trained to treat symptoms and avoid treatment before onset of clear enough symptoms and physical abnormalities, have just considered the processes a normal part of ageing, even though unhealthy.

'''Emphysema''' is a chronic lung disease. It is often caused by exposure to toxic chemicals or long-term exposure to tobacco smoke.

=== Signs and symptoms ===
Emphysema is characterised by loss of elasticity of the lung tissue; destruction of structures supporting the alveoli; and destruction of capillaries feeding the alveoli. The result is that the small airways collapse during expiration, leading to an obstructive form of lung disease (air is trapped in the lungs in obstructive lung diseases). Symptoms are: shortness of breath on exertion—particularly when climbing stairs or inclines (and later at rest), hyperventilation and an expanded chest. 

=== Diagnosis ===
Diagnosis is by spirometry (lung function testing), including diffusion testing. Other investigations might include X-rays, high resolution spiral chest CT-scan, bronchoscopy (when other lung disease is suspected, including malignancy), blood tests, pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas sampling.

===Pathophysiology===
The scientific definition of emphysema is:
:&quot;Permanent destructive enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles without obvious fibrosis&quot;.
Hence, the definite diagnosis is made by a pathologist. However, we can easily ascertain clinical diagnosis by history, clinical examination, chest radiography and lung function tests.

In normal breathing, air is drawn in through the bronchial passage]s and down into the increasingly fine network of tubing in the lungs called the alveoli, which are many thousands of tiny sacs surrounded by capillaries. These absorb the oxygen] and transfer it into the blood.

When toxins such as smoke are breathed into the lungs, the particles are trapped by the hairs and cannot be exhaled, leading to a localised inflammatory response. Chemicals released during the inflammatory response (trypsin, elastase, etc.) begin to break down the walls of alveoli (alveolar septum). This leads to fewer but larger alveoli, with a decreased surface area and a decreased ability to take up oxygen and lose carbon dioxide. 

After a prolonged period, hyperventilation becomes inadequate to maintain high enough oxygen levels in the blood, and the body compensates by vasoconstricting appropriate vessels. This leads to pulmonary hypertension. This leads to enlargement and increased strain on the right side of the heart, which in turn leads to peripheral oedema (swelling of the peripherals) as blood gets backed up in the systemic circulation, causing fluid to leave the circulatory system and accumulate in the tissues. 

===Associations===
Emphysema is commonly associated with bronchitis and chronic bronchitis and as it is
rather difficult to delineate &quot;pure&quot; cases of emphysema or chronic bronchitis
they are classed together into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

=== Prognosis and treatment ===
Emphysema is an irreversible degenerative condition.  The most important measure that can be taken to slow the progression of emphysema is for the patient to stop smoking and avoid all exposure to cigarette smoke and lung irritants.  Pulmonary rehabilitation can be very helpful to optimize the patient's quality of life and teach the patient how to actively manage his or her care.

It is treated by supporting the breathing with anticholinergics, bronchodilators and (inhaled or oral) steroid medication, and supplemental oxygen as required. Treating the patient's other conditions including gastric reflux and allergies may also help the patient's lung function.  Supplemental oxygen used as prescribed (20+ hours/day) is the only non-surgical treatment which has been shown to prolong life in emphysema patients.  Other medications are being researched.  There are lightweight portable oxygen systems which allow patients increasing mobility.  Patients fly, cruise, and work while using supplemental oxygen.

The only known 'cure' for emphysema is a lung transplant, although not many patients are strong enough physically to survive the surgery. The combination of patient's age, oxygen deprivation and the side-effects of the medications used to treat emphysema cause damage to the kidneys, heart and other bodily organs.  Transplants also require the patient to take an anti-rejection drug regimen which suppresses immunities and creates new medical issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Traditional Techniques==

Shaken cocktails are similar to stirred cocktails, but have the obvious difference of using a shaking motion to combine the ingredients.  Drink components are poured over ice into either a cocktail shaker or a Boston Shaker.  The vessel is covered, vigorously shaken, and the resulting mixture is strained into a glass of appropriate size and shape.  When preparing cocktails that contain syrups, fruit juices, or dairy (including eggs), shaking is generally preferred over stirring, as the violent action will better combine these ingredients.
&lt;p&gt;
Some drinkers will prefer to order a cocktail that is shaken regardless of the ingredients, the assumption being that this will result in a smoother, colder beverage.  James Bond popularized the idea of a shaken cocktail on screen when he ordered a &quot;Martini. Shaken, not stirred.&quot;  Some drinkers believe that shaking cocktails will &quot;bruise&quot; the ingredients, meaning the liquor will be overly diluted, resulting in a flat, watery taste.

      <comment>question about weirdness - 1.5 recipes here</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I see two variations for how to cook this. As I'm a brand-new cook I'd like to know which to try... Would people please indicate differences when adding contrasting methods? In this case seems like the difference is centered around how long the various vegitables cook, with vegitables being added all at once in one and at different times in the other. Still, it is the most attractive looking recipe for beef stew I've found searching online, since I am looking for something simple, easy, low prep etc but also potentially well worth cooking in terms of flavor.  Thank you --[[User:Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] 22:10, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

==Something's wrong - parts of 2 recipes here==

The second &quot;recipe&quot; (under &quot;procedure&quot;) doesn't include a list of ingredients. It's not the same as the first - the second mentions bay leaf, but the first does not. What up? [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 03:11, 2 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

The section is to introduce programmer to programming with the aim of portability across several OSs environments.  In today’s world it does not seem appropriate to constrain applications to a single operating system or computer platform, and there is an increasing need to address programming in a ''cross platform'' manner.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Boolean algebra (named after the mathematician [[w:George Boole|George Boole]]) is a form of aritmetic that deals solely in ones and zeroes. It has only three operators: addition, multiplication and negation. As we shall see these correspond to OR, AND and NOT repectively.

XOR is sometimes included for convenience, and we shall see how in the [[#XOR and XNOR|XOR section]].

Variables are written as capital letters, unlike &quot;real&quot; algebra, where lowercase ones can be used.

This page is not concerned with the identities and properties of boolean operators beyond that of the equivalence to the logic functions. These properties are discussed on the [[Practical_Electronics/Logic/Boolean_Identities|Boolean Identities]] page.

==Negative Numbers, Subtraction and Division==

As 1 and 0 are the only permissible numbers in Boolean algebra, there can be no negative numbers. 

This means that there is no subtraction, as 0-1 is the same as 0+(-1). -1 is not an allowed number, so the concept of subtraction is meaningless in Boolean algebra.

As division is just a variation on subtraction, just as multiplication is a variation on addition, division is also meaningless in Boolean algebra.

==Addition==

Consider the following sums:

::&lt;math&gt;0+0=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;0+1=1\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;1+0=1\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;1+1=1\,&lt;/math&gt;

The first three make sense, as the same holds true for real algebra. The fourth statement, however, is different as it goes against real arithmetic. 2 is not allowed in Boolean algebra so it cannot be the answer, and 1+1 is definitely not equal to 0, so the answer must be 1.

{|align=left class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=30 rowspan=2|A!!width=30 rowspan=2|B!!width=30|Q
|-
&lt;th&gt;A+B&lt;/th&gt;
|-
|0||0||0
|-
|0||1||1
|-
|1||0||1
|-
|1||1||1
|}

If we display the above equations in a table as on the left, it is clear that the Boolean addition operator is equivalent to the logical [[Practical Electronics/Logic#OR|OR]]. This is why the logic OR operator has a plus sign as its symbol:

::&lt;math&gt;A\mbox{ OR }B = A + B\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Multiplication==

Consider the following equations:

::&lt;math&gt;0 \times 0=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;0 \times 1=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;1 \times 0=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;1 \times 1=1\,&lt;/math&gt;

As you can see, multiplication behaves in exactly the same way with Boolean algebra as it does in real arithmetic: anything multiplied by zero becomes zero, and anything multiplied by one stays the same.

You should be able to see that the multiplication operator has exactly the same effect as the logical [[Practical_Electronics/Logic#AND|AND]] operator, and this is why the AND function is represented by multiplication:

::&lt;math&gt;A\mbox{ AND }B = A \cdot B =AB\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Complementation==

Because there are only two numbers in Boolean algebra, if we know the value of a variable, then we automatically know the value of the number that it ''isn't''. This number is the '''complement''' of the variable. Thus 0 is the complement of 1 and 1 is the complement of zero. A complement of a variable is written as the variable with a line over it:

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Complement of A}=\overline A&lt;/math&gt;

If a line cannot be drawn over the variable, as in text like this, then a &quot;¬&quot; symbol is used before the variable. This should not be used if a line can be drawn over the variable. Sometimes, a &quot;prime&quot; symbol (') is placed after it, but this should never be used.

Complementation is equivalent to a logical NOT.

==NOR and NAND==

These two logic fuctions are made up of the complement of their respective underlying functions:

::&lt;math&gt;A\mbox{ NAND }B = \overline{A \cdot B}\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;A\mbox{ NOR }B = \overline {A + B}\,&lt;/math&gt;

==XOR and XNOR==

XOR cannot be represented as a simple Boolean function such as addition or multiplication, and as such, it is not directly supported by Boolean algebra. Nevertheless, it does have a symbol - a plus sign in a circle.

::&lt;math&gt;A\mbox{ XOR }B =A \oplus B\,&lt;/math&gt;

The XNOR function is given as:

::&lt;math&gt;A\mbox{ XNOR }B =\overline{A \oplus B}\,&lt;/math&gt;

As the rules and identities of Boolean algebra do not apply to this invented function, when writing and simplifying logical statements, the following equivalent substitution is used:

::&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B=\bar A B + A \bar B&lt;/math&gt;.

It is easy to see how this substitution works. The XOR function gives a high output if one and only one of the inputs is high. In this case, the complement of one input is equal to the other input. When the inputs are the same (i.e. the XOR function returns a low), one input and the complement of the other will be different. Therefore, by ANDing the first input and the second's complement, and ANDing the first's complement and the second input, we will always have a high at the output of one of the AND gates when only one input is high. BY ORing these two together, we get a high at the final output if either one is high and the other one is low.

This uses one of the alternative gate arrangements shown [[Practical_Electronics/Logic/Alternative XOR|here]].

XNOR can be substituted as:
::&lt;math&gt;\overline{A \oplus B}=\overline{\bar A B + A \bar B}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Summary==

*Boolean addition is equivalent to a logical OR.
*Boolean multiplication is equivalent to a logical AND.
*Boolean complementation is equivalent to a logical NOT.

*XOR has its own special symbol as it is not directly included in the framework of Boolean algebra.

I can't understand this either. It might make sense to someone who already knows what they are doing, but if you don't it's nearly incomprehensible.

Named after Sir Ronald Fisher, who developed the F distribution for use in determining ANOVA critical values.  The cutoff values in an F table are found using three variables- ANOVA numerator degrees of freedom, ANOVA denominator degrees of freedom, and significance level.

ANOVA is an abbreviation of analysis of variance. It compares the size of the variance between two different samples. This is done by dividing the larger variance over the smaller variance. The formula of the F statistic is:

&lt;math&gt;
F(r_1, r_2) = \frac{\chi_{r1} ^2 /r_1}{\chi_{r2} ^2 /r_2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \chi_{r1}^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \chi_{r2}^2&lt;/math&gt; are the chi-square statistics of sample one and two respectively, and &lt;math&gt; r1 \mbox{and } r2 &lt;/math&gt; are their degrees of freedom, i.e. the number of observations.

One example could be if you want to compare apples that look alike but are from different trees and have different sizes. You want to investigate whether they have the same variance of the weight on average.

There are three apples from the first tree that weigh 110, 121 and 143 grams respectively, and four from the other which weigh 88, 93, 105 and 124 grams respectively. The mean and variance of the first sample are 124.67 and 16.80 respectively, and of the second sample 102.50 and 16.01. The chi-square statistic of the first sample is 

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{110-124.67}{16.80^2} + \frac{121-124.67}{16.80^2} + \frac{143-124.67}{16.80^2} = 2.00
&lt;/math&gt;,

and for the second sample

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{88-102.50}{16.01^2} + \frac{93-102.50}{16.01^2} + \frac{105-102.50}{16.01^2} + \frac{124-102.50}{16.01^2} = 3.00
&lt;/math&gt;.

The F statistic is now F = &lt;math&gt;\frac{3/4}{2/3} = 1.125&lt;/math&gt;. The Chi-square statistic divided by degrees of freedom appears on the nominator for the second sample because it was larger than that of the first sample.

The critical value of the F distribution for 4 degrees of freedom. in the nominator and 3 degrees of freedom in the denominator, i.e. F(f1=4, f2=3) is 9.12 at a 5% level of confidence. Since the test statistic 1.125 is smaller than the critical value, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that they have the same variance. The conclusion is that they have the same variance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Slice steak?=

I'm not sure I know what that refers to.
Could we insert a more obvious name for whatever meat is in there?
I've found it listed online elsewhere (in Spanish) as ''&quot;2 tazas de carne molida&quot;''... which I can't translate, except as ''two cups of worn-out (moldy?) meat''.

Can someone help with this, or clarify the recipe?

Actually it is Ground Beef.  That's what we use</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Issues influencing Asset allocation==

===Volatility===

Investments vary in the extent of their potential losses or gains.  Stocks are prone to greater rises and falls than would be experienced in cash deposit investments.  The level of loss an individual is willing to accept will influence the spread of asset type.  Equally too little risk may also be unacceptable to an individual who wishes to benefit from the potential increase in a rising market

===Term of Investment===

The volatility that is experienced over short periods of time may not be as significant to an investor who is investing over several years.  The overall trend of a market becomes more important. Investments with a greater measure of volatility may be more prudent over longer periods than safer investments that carry a greater risk of not only a lower relative return to other investments, but also the risk of loss through inflation.

===Currency Risk===

Investments outside the domestic market or currency zone of an investor will be subject to additional risk through movements in exchange rates.  Markets investing in similar assets may perform closely, but changes in the value of their respective currencies can mean that from the reference point of the investor they have performed very differently.

===Correlation===

Diversifying asset allocation through investing in different funds that are in the same market or are heavily influenced by similar factors (such as is the case with many stock markets) is unlikely to be an efficient means of diversifying risk.  Assets that perform closely over a period of time are said to be closely correlated.  Investments that do not perform in line with each other may be negatively correlated (one is likely to rise on the fall of another through changing business cycles or patterns of demand) or, where there is little relationship, be said to be uncorrelated.  Some bond markets have a measure of reverse correlation to stocks and generally real estate investments are uncorrelated to the performance of stocks.

Actually, if we were going to go that way, it would be Slatero Quirrell, for reasons that I put forward on the character page itself. But I don't think we should -- no first name appears in the book, and so we probably shouldn't have a first name in the article. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 07:31, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

[[/Engine Swaps/]]
You have stumbled on the first (and only I've seen) AEM EMS Wikibook for owners and tuners of the AEM EMS Engine Management System. This was started on 8/9/2006 and will hopefully grow much from there! I have created a basic outline for people to work with for now and hope it will expand from here! AEM did not include a manual with anything but barebones information for using the program, and a more extensive Reference would be very useful!

==Editing and adding to this Wiki==
Please make sure when adding ANY entry or changing ANYTHING you post a description of what you have changed in the history section, as well as ending your addition to the end of the page with four tilde symbols (~) to mark user and date. Please try to stick to a standard formatting scheme and style when entering items.

==What is the AEM EMS?==
The AEM EMS is a versatile Standalone Engine Management System that can control a variety of engines and allows the end user the ultimate in expandability and control over their engines operating conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Boost comp==
''I cannot take credit for this. [http://forum.aempower.com/forum/index.php?topic=11494.0 This] was originally posted by BLKMGK and Wadzii on the aem ems forums (hope you guys dont mind this being regurgitated!). This is a repost of their explanation of this simple, yet effective method:''


You need to get the car running and driving first before you can do this.

Let me briefly explain the concept behind Boost Compensation tuning. If at, say, 4,000 RPM and 100KPA you need X amount of fuel to get Y A/F then at 4,000 RPM and 200KPA you will need 2X fuel to get the same Y A/F. Make sense? Yes, in extreme cases the VE of the motor will change at some point due to restrictions somewhere but for the most part this concept holds true.

If you look at a Full Boost Comp'd mapping you will see that all fuel columns are the same vertically. The way that fuel is taken care of is there's a Fuel Modifier table called Boost Fuel Correction. This is setup usually so that say 100KPA is a &quot;zero point&quot; - no change (the zero point can be anywhere you choose). But 200KPA effects a +100% change in fuel and 0KPA is a -100% change in fueling. Points in between are linear. Making sense so far?

Now you can Boost Comp, a mapping that's done cell by cell, just by applying those percentage changes to the existing map. The effect is greater granularity in fueling although you MAY need to modify something called the MicrosecBit. MicroSecBit defines the number &quot;1&quot; in the RAW view of the fuel map - more on that later. Okay, so you now have a mapping that is Boost Comp'd but numbers up and down are not the same - should drive as fine as the original map. You can stop at this point or go further. IF you stop here, as I did once upon a time, and tune multiple load rows for the same A/F you'll get a surprise as they all become the same number.

Okay, go do a WOT pull at the lowest load value your W/G will allow - easy if it's a N/A motor! Tune that load row to whatever A/F you need WOT and make the cells above and below that load the same so there's no interpolation. If you take those numbers you get and apply them anywhere you go WOT you should find that you maintain the same A/F in those load areas that you tuned for. You now have what I call a &quot;Hybrid&quot; Boost Comp map because the vac areas are cell by cell. You can leave that if you want.

To get the vac area done for a &quot;full&quot; Boost Comp map continue copying those same numbers down vertically - the car will now run pig rich. Go into a table called the Throttle Inj Modifier. Adjust the table so that at idle you have a decent A/F and then go for a drive. At cruising speed\throttle adjust the table so that you get a decent cruise A/F and then calculate between the two points to get a linear table. Play with this some but in the end you'll have a table that removes more fuel as the throttle is closed (mine is -26%) and less at say 50% throttle (mine is -3%) in a linear table. Ta Da - &quot;full&quot; Boost Comp.

Another way to do those vac areas is to do a little math. Say you want 12:1 in one row but the vertical numbers give you 11.5:1 - calculate the percentage of difference between the two and either apply that to the Boost Fuel Correction table for that load range or to the fuel table load area. Do this for every area you want something other than whatever your WOT fueling was. In this case there's NO Throttle Mod table filled in. So, why do it this way? Because some small turbos will spool at part throttle - say on hills and things. With Full Boost Comp it's also possible to get into a situation where say the car is lugging on a hill and more throttle just makes it go pig rich but load doesn't go up quickly. I'm actually about to convert to this method to try it out.

First this setting can only be found if you look at the Options, Full List. It's called MicroSec/bit.

Okay, so what's MicroSecBit? Pull up the Fuel Map, Right Click, View RAW. The numbers in those cells can be between 0-255. Look at peak torque at peak load - are you close to 255? Now look at idle - are you close to 0? You can actually have 255 in one of those cells and NOT have full fueling! You can also have very small numbers in the idle area and find that making changes as small as one increment will swing A/F by a LARGE amount. Neither of these situations is one that you want. LEts say the idle range has a number of 10 in it - moving to 11 you swing fueling by 1/10th - that's a lot! My idle numbers are over 100 - now THAT is granularity. MicroSecBit or MSecBit is what defines the value of &quot;1&quot; in the fuel table. You CAN modify it!

So, before you go playing with that number realize it will have BIG impacts on your fueling. Here's how you change it &quot;safely&quot;. Open the fuel map, right click, View Duty Cycle. Highlight the ENTIRE map, right click, Copy to clipboard. Now modify MSecBit up or down and then Paste the fuel mapping back while still looking at Duty Cycle. Right Click, View RAW. Any numbers over 255? IF yes then MSecBit is too small, switch back to Duty Cycle view, make it bigger, Paste the previously saved table, and check the RAW view again until the numbers are big but not huge. Note that if you use Boost Comp as explained above you'll also gain granularity. Doen CORRECTLY fueling shouldn't change much and the car shouldn't need too much retuning when you now upload this mapping to the ECU.

When you change microbit/sec you will also have to modify the crank time table ( the main table in the startup template).  i devised this forumula to correctly change that table.  we will assume the crank time table is all set to one number

CT1=original number in the crank time table
MBS1= original micro bit/sec
MBS2= new microbit/sec
CT2= new value for the crank time table

(CT1*MBS1)/(MBS2)=CT2

Changing microbit sec will also get you a lot more resolution for cranking so you can dial that in better.

The key to getting boost comp tuned right is to make sure afr at WOT is flat first.  Don't worry with fine tuning the throttle inj corr table until WOT is right.

A formula I use to set up the boost comt table is as follows. (I use PSIg, you can modify this for kpa.. But I never use kpa )

min=map min value (ex.. -13.9psi)
max = map max value (ex.. 60psi in the case of the 5bar sensor)

min/14.7*100= %correction at min
max/14.7*100= %correction at max

Enter those 2 points and use the calculate function to create a straight line between those 2 points.

More tips for tuning the throttle inj corr table.
Set that table up on the highway cruising in a high gear.  If the car doesn't idle or drive well at low RPMs, modify the fuel map (making sure to change the whole column).  It's okay for the fuel map to be leaner in the lower RPMs. Usually you will make more power that way any how.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the world of programming needs more Engineering and less Art.  We're probably all familiar with the book &quot;The Art of Programming&quot;, but I believe the term &quot;art&quot; has become over-emphasized in CS.  In my experience, thinking of programming as an &quot;art&quot; has led to less documentation and artsy code (i.e. only legible to the artist).  The results I've seen of artists are poor maintainability / portability.

Sorry for the tirade, it's just my impression when I read &quot;Computer programming is an intricate and elegant art form.&quot;

Am I alone? If I am, then leave it be.

----

There are two common threads on that issue. One asserts that problems in software happen because people don't take the issues seriously enough, or treat development enough like an engineering discipline. The other thread points out first that engineers make mistakes too, and second that software is inherently unlike engineering.

To the first, I say that I've worked with people who are serious about good code, and take good precautions to make sure that things work out well. I've also worked with jack****es who don't seem to care. The lay person is not prepared to evaluate the difference until or unless things break, so preventing disgrace often means cleaning up their messes.

The biggest problem with claiming a particular similarity or difference between software and engineering is that it's a broad generalization. The same goes with art. There is theatre, music, painting, sculpture, and each of these can be divided further into myriad ways. I'm not an art student, and I wouldn't presume to compare sculpture with theatre, much less assert that one could be made more like the other. Similarly, I'm not a chemical engineer, but I'm sure that chemical engineering differs wildly from civil engineering or industrial architecture.

On the other hand, we can make certain observations. At heart, art satisfies the desire to express or appreciate some kind of message, be it a moral message or an emotion. On the other hand, the engineer in any field is faced with a set of constraints and a functional goal, and his work product is the detailed description of a system that satisfies the constraints while accomplishing the goal. In this sense, software is engineering and there's no two ways about it. Yet, any engineered system necessarily expresses a message. There are beautiful bridges, like that over the Golden Gate in the San Francisco area, and there are rather dull ones, like the one over 38th street in Austin. There are great cathedrals, like Notre Dame, and there are hole-in-the-wall churches that meet in a section of a strip mall, like the &quot;Praise Chape&quot; which is missing an L from its signpost. In any event, each is an intelligent response to the actual constraints and economic presures that affected their creation. Occasionally, an engineer or architect is lucky enough to work on a project that allows him to express something the world thinks of as artistic. Frank Lloyd Wright made a career of only ever working on that kind of project, and grew to fame and fortune as a result. Of course, his houses were (and still are) expensive, but they also have had &quot;undesirable features&quot; from time to time.

Let's observe that most houses aren't works of art, and most software projects aren't either. However, most architects (sample size one: my architect friend) want to work at an artistic level, and most software developers seem to want to work on projects with some opportunity for an artistic expression in their chosen medium, which amounts to code.

Coming back from the other direction, again the artist must support his art. If his day job won't pay the bills, then he'd better be a pretty good artist. This implies that it's possible to compare the &quot;quality&quot; of an artist and the art so produced. That's true; art that sells is better for the artist than art which does not sell. Naturally, it pays the artist to understand his market and his potential clients. If he can send a message they understand and will buy into, then they'll buy his art. Otherwise, it's art for art's sake, and that usually isn't appreciated during the artist's lifetime.

Samples of art and engineering both can be compared at the level of how well they serve their purpose. A bridge which collapses in high wind does not serve its purpose, and neither does the unskilled tapping of the ivories at a fine dining establishment. Thus, to become good in any of the fields thus far mentioned, one must first understand how quality is to be measured. Next, you can practice and improve your abilities to produce high-quality work.

Ultimately, such a controlled feedback cycle is engineering, even when the product in question is art. Bridge design is engineering, and so is programming also engineering. A bad engineer will design a faulty bridge, and a bad programmer will create a faulty program.

== However ==

That's all about software engineering. This course is not about software engineering. It's about computer science, which is an entirely different field. Let me explain what I mean:

Chemical engineers don't do what chemists do. The chemist works typically with many tiny quantities of many different reagents and discovers or invents new things that can be done with chemicals. Upon learning the results, the chemical engineer can then work out how to scale the process up to an industrial level. The chemist might invent a new platic, while the chemical engineer then finds a way to build a plant to produce an endless stream of the new plastic. These are entirely different problems, but naturally both involve quite a bit of brainwork. A third person may be responsible for finding uses for the new plastic and bringing them to market.

The software engineer is tasked to apply the discoveries of the computer scientist to solve real-world problems. The computer scientist, then, must invent or discover new solutions in search of a problem. The corresponding third role is to find an audience for, and distribute knowledge of, the latest developments in computer science.


== Afterward ==


We teach natural science and mathematics by first instilling the skills to perform and then setting the educated loose on open problems in the field. The same is done with CS: You'll learn a few programming languages, but you'll also learn why programming languages are the way they are. You'll learn what makes them tick, and why. You'll learn the known concepts by applying them, which is why everyone has to write a linked-list program and a database manager. (What's a linked list? Have patience, Grasshopper.) Eventually, you'll get to work on something really deep, and if the faculty is suitably impressed, the university will try to make money off it. (Usually, this takes the form of patent licensing.) Then, you graduate and you are considered ready to be a computer scientist. However, you are not a software engineer. That will take a different kind of work.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A file system is a way of organizing information on a physical drive or other media (e.g, RAM) for access. In general, file systems can be divided into several groups:

*Local file systems ‒ ext2/3, FAT32, NTFS
*Distributed file systems ‒ NFS, AFS
*Parrallel or cluster file systems ‒ GFS, PVFS, Lustre

Some current file systems:
*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/FAT|File Allocation Table (FAT)]]
*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/NTFS/NTFS|NTFS]]
*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/ext4|ext4]]
*JFS
*BFS
*HFS
*ReiserFS

NTFS and FAT are used under [[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Windows_NT|Windows]], while ext4 and ReiserFS tend to be used by [[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Linux|Linux]].

A file system may be described by a set of characteristics:
*Ability to work with huge number of files/directories in a directory (e.g ReiserFS).
*Large files support ‒ some file systems have 2-4G limit for this. Switching to 64-bits addressing solves the problem.
*Fragmentation ‒ NTFS quickly becomes fragmented, while ext4 doesn't.
*Fault tolerance ‒ compare e2fsck runs on dirty ext2 vs logging facilities of ext3 or ReiserFS.
*Scalability ‒ some file systems have limits on their disk sizes.
*Use of encryption/compression
*Charsets support ‒ for example, FAT does not allow use of some symbols in file names, while NTFS does.
*Long file names ‒ for ext4, 256 chars; FAT16 8+3 chars max

This section discusses the key components to a file system and common problems that an operating system must deal with. It concludes with a discussion about some of the more popular file systems in use today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:DNA_Overview.png|220px|right]]
DNA is generally found as a double helix, composed of two chains, or strands, of nucleotides held together by hydrogen bonds.  A good analogy to this would be a spiral staircase, with the sides of the staircase being the strands, and the steps being the hydrogen bonds.

==Nucleotides==
As was said above, DNA is composed of chains of nucleotides.  Each nucleotide consists of deoxyribose (a 5-carbon sugar), which is bonded to a phosphate group and one of four nitrogenous bases.  The sugar and the phosphate make what is usually referred to as the &quot;sugar-phosphate&quot; backbones of the DNA molecule by binding to the sugar and phosphate groups of other nucleotides.  The nitrogenous base, on the inside of the double helix, makes hydrogen bonds with the nitrogenous base on the opposite strand.

==Base Pairing==
The four nitrogenous bases found in DNA are Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine and Adenine, abbreviated as G, C, T and A, respectively.  Adenine and Guanine, being composed of two rings, are known as purines, while Cytosine and Thymine, being composed as one ring, are known as pyrimidines.

== Help with setting up a &quot;wikimanual&quot; ==

I've just started a book called [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]], and would like some help getting it working properly. The book is inspired by the recurring discussions over at WP about getting &quot;how-to&quot; information out of articles dealing with plant, insect, soil, etc.

:It would be wise to retitle to &quot;A Wiki Textbook of Gardening&quot;.  &quot;Manuals&quot; are frequently rapidly deleted or voted for deletion (VfD) and then deleted.  Local policy is TEXTBOOKS ONLY. [[user:lazyquasar]]

What I'm hoping to do is enable them to create chapters in an organized wikibook, rather than &quot;dumping&quot; information through the transwiki process. I've opened a chapter on that ([[A_Wikimanual_of_Gardening/How_to_Transwiki_Information_to_this_Book]]), perhaps I could get a few pointers on that part of things from you folks? 

Also, I'm moving a couple other books (ones I started) to this one as chapters. Still figuring that part out. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 17:01, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

:We already have a [[Gardening]] textbook. Can you not merge your work into here? Unless you're trying to appeal to a different audience than the [[Gardening]] book, we really shouldn't have two books on the same subject, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:54, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

:::Forgive me for asking I am simply hanging out waiting for Wikiversity.  Can you cite a policy such as NO DUPE or is this a personal interpretation of the best way to proceed locally at the moment.  You are contending that there should only be one textbook on Gardening at Wikibooks? [[user:lazyquasar]]

::From what I understand from the [[Talk:Gardening]] page, that book has serious issues and was slated either for deletion or to be moved to wikisource. Seems better to start anew than work on a book with that hanging over it. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 13:43, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

:::Oh, by all means - though do bear it in mind as a potential source of info for a revised/new book. Once you have culled everything of value, feel free to mark up pages for deletion with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|add your reason for deleting it here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

The [[Gardening]] book really doesn't seem to have much in it when I look at the individual chapters, it's more of a commentary than a guide, and much is quite out of date. I'll keep looking though. Is deletion compulsory? Some readers might find it interesting. (BTW: Why would having &quot;manual&quot; in the title attract an RfD? It's a how-to book, which is just a long-winded way to say &quot;manual&quot;.) [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 11:24, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

== New Logo Discussion ==

There is a logo discussion for Wikibooks going on at Meta. See [[meta:Wikibooks/logo]]. [[User:Dbmag9|Dbmag9]] 19:29, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

:I'm curious about a couple of things regarding this:
:#Who is starting this movement to replace the logo?  i.e. what is the motivation behind why this needs to change?
:#What is wrong with the existing logo?
:If this was the outgrowth of a discussion here on the Staff Lounge or the mailing list (perhaps even an IRC chat), I might be more inclined to support a move like this.  At this time we have a project logo that has been used for a couple of years, so IMHO changing the logo should be for something much cleaner and simpler, or add a huge value to the project.  It is not that I have anything against this, just that it seems to have come from people external to typical Wikibooks contributors that are pushing for this change.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:29, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
::You make a good point that I didn't even consider. The wikibooks logo might not be perfect, but does it really need to change? Who want's it changed and why? What benefit will a new logo bring us, that this logo doesnt? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:14, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
:::Apparently (after some digging around), some of the motivation was by a Russian Wikibooks editor who didn't like what he was seeing, especially when he was trying to translate the Wikibooks &quot;slogan&quot; (Think free.  Learn free.) into Russian.  I've said on many occasions that Wikibooks was more than en.wikibooks, and this apparently is one of those situations.  The idea of changing this slogan I would support much more than changing the logo, and that is something that has come up here on the Staff Lounge in the recent past.  Any ideas for a better slogan? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:03, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

:::&quot;OMG Free Books!&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:26, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

::::Most of the current logo discussions (there are 5) are stimulated in some way by [[User:Nightstallion]]. I'm not sure of the exact circumstances about this one. Answers to both questions at the meta page. [[User:Dbmag9|Dbmag9]] 19:40, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

== collaboration and book of the month ==

Someone please write some nice descriptions for these books. I have made basic templates, but I am a failure at exciting writing. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:25, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

: Also, we should close voting earlier and make the templates before the actual day they change. That way we won't get redlinks like we had this evening. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:33, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
:I tried to add a bit to the Muggles' Guide section. I wish there were more Commons HP images. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 13:20, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

== Computer Help Wiki ==

I work for a charity called U Can Do IT (see [http://www.ucandoit.org.uk www.ucandoit.org.uk]) which provides computer tuition for disabled people in the UK. I am currently trying to start up a wiki at [http://wiki.ucandoit.org.uk wiki.ucandoit.org.uk] which will fulfill various functions for the charity. Perhaps the most important of these is the provision of a set of Instructions and Course Notes for U Can Do IT students to use while they are taking the course.

I have publicised the wiki amongst other U Can Do IT tutors, but I don't think many of them are particularly experienced in editing wikis. Would any experienced wikipedians be able to provide any help in building the UCanWIKI? Accounts are by invitation only, but there's a link on the main page of the wiki from which you can email me an account request. Even if you don't want to contribute, any general advice (e.g., already-extant sources of computer instructions, general design tips etc etc) would be great.

Thank you! --[[User:Jim0203|Jim0203]] 10:53, 1 July 2006 (UTC) [http://wiki.ucandoit.org.uk wiki.ucandoit.org.uk]

== Help with [[Orthopaedic Surgery]] ==

I have been working for some time on [[Orthopaedic Surgery]]. Recently I created two navigation templates. One is for the page navigation &lt;nowiki&gt;{{OrthoSimplePageNav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the other is for chapter navigation &lt;nowiki&gt;{{OrthoMainTOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The idea of having the Chapter navigation was to allow the user to access another chapter in the module easily, which they can do right now. But the problem is the user is not aware of the chapter he is in unless its the first page of the chapter as the link in the template leads to that page. One way to do that would be to probably categorise it into the concerned chapters. However, it would make sense to do it through the navigation template. If anyone has ideas about how to sort this out, I would be more than grateful if you let me to it. Any other ideas are also welcome. Thanks in advance! [[User:Bduttabaruah|BDB]] 04:32, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
:Well, you could add a parameter to {{tl|OrthoMainTOC}}, that would be the name of the chapter that the individual page belongs to. Then, you could add a series of [[meta:ParserFunctions|conditional expressions]] to the navigation template to selectively apply formatting (such as bolding, or underlining, or whatever) to the chapter. This would require some effort, however, so it might be a better idea to simply take an extra parameter, that would be a backlink to the chapter, and then display a &quot;Current Chapter: &quot; statement at the bottom of the TOC. if the parameter isn't provided, you don't print out anything. I'll work out a quick example for you, and see if you like it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:36, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
:Okay, I made a quick version that can be found at {{tl|OrthoMainTOC/test/}}. This one takes, as an optional parameter, the name of the current chapter, and displays a note at the bottom of the template, as to which chapter the reader is currently in. The formatting is simple and lousy, but you should get the general idea. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:43, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
:Seems like a splendid idea! Why not put it into action? We can always modify it if necessary.[[User:Bduttabaruah|BDB]] 17:46, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
:Well, I made attempts but failed to make any progress. Some help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.[[User:Bduttabaruah|BDB]] 18:12, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
:Whew!! That was a lot of experiementing. I finally got it right ...hope it works. But surely this is not the final tweak. Any suggestions are still welcome. [[User:Bduttabaruah|BDB]] 17:07, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
::That looks pretty good! I'm glad you got it to work correctly. Let me know if you need any more help with it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:09, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

== Help me turn on DynamicPageLists for wikibooks ==

Hi everybody; We at the cookbook would like to turn on [[m:DynamicPageList]] for the Cookbook so we can create context-sensitive lists from our categories. [[User:Brion VIBBER]] has indicated that it would be okay on the [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3169 bug]; but he wants a &quot;Yes, turn this on&quot; from other wikibookians. So please, say &quot;YES&quot; here. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:59, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
* You mean, you want to display newest pages in each category? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:09, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
* I have to admit that I have no idea what DynamicPageLists are, what they do, why they currently aren't turned on, or why it would be an issue. A little more information, and perhaps I will agree. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:29, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

Ah, sorry for the lack of extra explanation. Here's a fuller description: DPLs would allow us to create transcluded lists of modules by category. The important part is that we can use multiple category filters; so you can generate a list which has pages which are in BOTH category A and category B. This, for instance, would be useful in automatically creating a listing of recipes for an ingredient, diet, etc (&quot;Breakfast recipes containing apples&quot; &quot;Desserts containing apples&quot; &quot;Vegan Desserts&quot; &quot;Chicken Stews&quot;, etc, etc, etc). For the cookbook, this should signal the end of hand-maintained lists of recipes -- instead we can maintain the categories only but still have nicely formatted views for each page. 

They are not currently turned on because DPLs are a mediawiki extension, so they a developer to turn them on explicitly. There shouldn't be any real issue with having them on, but Brion wanted some show of consensus from wikibookians. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:15, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

: Does DPL not have some performance costs? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:10, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

:: They are apparently not super efficient, so they won't be turned on for wikipedia for now, but Brion said there shouldn't be any problem with them on wikibooks and that we can turn them off if they become a problem anyhow. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:35, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

BTW, something to keep in mind here is that Wikinews uses this feature as well for the &quot;local bureau&quot; pages that are able to pull up the list of say sports stories that happened in New York.  Look at [[wikinews:Portal:New York]] for a Wikimedia project example of how this is used.  I'm not sure what would happen to these pages or indeed much of the Wikinews infrastructure if this were turned off.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:16, 7 July 2006 (UTC) 

:Well if that's the case, then we should turn them on, but immediately employ them to a large degree so that they can't be turned off again. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:27, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

:: Drat! You're on to my plan! [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:05, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

===Yes, turn on DPLs for wikibooks===
* [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:59, 5 July 2006 (UTC)...
* You got my vote.  Why not?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:02, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
* Based on the above discussion, and the fact that I don't really understand the issue. I'll just cast my vote here. If they do have a performance penalty, and we do need to turn them off in the future however, it will be bad if we have built too much infrastructure around them. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:52, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
* Yes. [[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 01:03, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
*[[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 19:07, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

===No, do not turn on DPLs===

===Huh?===
*Still not sure what all this means, though the [[w:transclusion|WP article on &quot;transclusion&quot;]] was a mildly interesting read. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 10:17, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
*: It means we can use this piece of software to generate lists from categories that show up on normal pages ('transclusion' is maybe not quite correct). In the cookbook, this means that we don't end up with two pages that a user must visit for an ingredient, e.g. the page on Lemon, [[Cookbook:Lemon]] and the category containing lemon recipes [[:Category:Lemon recipes]]. Instead we can use DPLs to put the recipe listing right on [[Cookbook:Lemon]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:44, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
*::Slightly more wiki-savy users could also use the feature to do recipe sorts. A user could use DPL on one of their user subpages to find, for example, all very easy through medium dificulty beverage recipes that use Oranges and Chocolate, but no milk, or any other combination of types, ingredients, and ratings. The editors could use such a list to prepare print-version Cookbook Pamphlets, with perhaps 100 recipes and enough technique and ingredient pages for the recipes involved. I think it would be a very useful feature. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 19:06, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
:::OK, this might seem like a silly question, but couldn't you just put the content of &quot;Cookbook:Lemon&quot; on the &quot;Category:lemon recipes&quot; page? (I don't have any objection to the DPLs, but wonder if that might just be easier). [[User:SBJohnny|SB_Johnny]] 11:36, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

:::: Yes, you can do that in certain cases. Consider [[:Category:Dessert recipes]], instead of lemon ones. A listing of dessert recipes would benefit from greater organization (see [[Cookbook:Dessert]]), which just isn't possible with flat categories. We can categorize the recipes all we want, but the truth is that the categories are not a particularly accessible or obvious way for our users to view recipes.

== Wikibooks is reaching three years ==

On 10th July 2003 [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=1 main page] of Wikibooks has been established and the new Wikimedia project started. I think that third birthday of Wikibooks is a good opportunity to promote this website. Perhaps we should write a longer news at Wikinews or even create some kind of 'press release' summarizing what have we achieved during these three years, as well as showing things that still are need to be done? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:21, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
:I'm all for it. I think we could probably get a little bit of press over at slashdot as well, along with some other websites (possibly). 3 years is a long time, and it's amazing to me that i've only been here for 1 year or so. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:25, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

: '''July''' 10th. This is an excellent idea Derbeth. Do you want to make up a draft? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

To accomplish this task, I started this page, which may be something to look into and see if we can expand it somewhat, and perhaps turn it into a formal press release:

[[Wikibooks:State of the Project/2006]]

BTW, it would be nice to get information from other Wikibooks projects in other languages besides English and Polish (thanks Derbeth for the Polish information).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:45, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

: I wrote to the German edition asking them to help preparing the state of the project report. Unfortunately, I am not able to help any more since I am going to two-week mountain trip and will be completely offline then. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:22, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

:: I added some statistics about the german wikibooks project onto the page-link above. Please leave a message on [[:de:Wikibooks:Projekt]], if you need some more oder even additional information about our project. -- [[User:ThePacker|ThePacker]] 23:45, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

== Decimal Classification ==

Your Card Catalog Office is quite cool and the German Wikibooks are growing. So soon or later we will have to use decimal classification too. But at current state our man-power ist too small, to make large steps forward. I would like to ask whether there was a vote or even the idea discussed, to make a Free-Decimal-Classification-Index e.g. on meta. I ask this because the Dewey index is not free and we don't have the knowledge to apply the smaller numbers after the first three (from the main category). Thanks for your attention. -- [[User:ThePacker|ThePacker]] 23:51, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
:I would note that the Library of Congress classification is free (as in speech and beer) to use and is a decimal classification system.  The Dewey Decimal Classification system is free.... as long as you are using the classification catalog from before 1920.  That is the largest problem with the DCC and free projects like Wikibooks and Wikisource, where many categories have been created that are much more modern in origin, even though the basic 100's level classification have been unchanged.
:In terms of trying to come up with a more &quot;modern&quot; classification system, that is an interesting point.  It would be interesting to come up with a categorization system that would allow you to look up a book in multiple langauages that would show related books of the same topic.  Right now the best developed original system that comes close is the current bookshelf system in use here on en.wikibooks, and that basic philosophy has been carried over into other language Wikibooks projects as well.  This is something that does need some more attention and establishing a &quot;classification&quot; system is not a trivial task.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:34, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
:: The german wikibook also has bookshelves, they even have their own namespace. I know that a new decimal classification systems is a huge task, because it depends on knowledge. But a consistent decimal classification of articles and books would even improve the basic search mechanisms in a wiki. Imagine what could be, if you choose the topic in the search-mask, rather than searching for special words in a huge database. Anyway, i wanted  to know whether this idea could interest some people, to start such a project. maybe it will be discussed in the next month on your wikibooks, we discuss this topic also. -- [[User:ThePacker|ThePacker]] 15:36, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

::I would be interested in helping out with the creation of a new classification scheme. It certainly won't be easy, but if we can come up with a good one, and implement it here on wikibooks, it would be a benefit to the community as a whole. Of course, implementing it would involve the creation and adoption of a new policy, and we are historically slow at doing that kind of stuff here on en.wikibooks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:04, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
::: I don't know how to make such a project on meta. But at first: we will have to invest some amount of time into such a system, i mean before any voting to adopt it into an enforced policy. Everybody must be sure about it. It could be, that our efforts will not be accepted at all. Everyone must be sure about this too. The Classification System must come first. -- [[User:ThePacker|ThePacker]] 18:44, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
: Don't go to fast with that. A free classification would be a big think, exspecialy if it should be ready for international usages. (maybe the old DDC isn't the best base for that) A free classification can be used in many projects in the net and would be it own big project, so don't do it fast and ugly ;-) --[[User:PatrickD|PatrickD]] 13:54, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

== Happy Birthday Wikibooks! ==

Today's the big day... should this be announced on the maiin page of WP (maybe under &quot;on this day...&quot;)? [[User:SBJohnny|SB_Johnny]] 11:41, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

== Candidates for Speedy Deletion ==

Could someone clean out [[WB:SD|candidates for speedy deletion]]?  Some pages have been there for 19 days.  Thanks in advance. --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 14:26, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

:I'll get a few of them now. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:02, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

:I deleted a bunch. I didn't delete the ones that I could find reason not to, and there are some at the end of the list that I would have deleted, but I got tired of deleting. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:21, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

:only 19 days.  Wow!  Somebody has been being a diligent admin here!  Seriously, don't get a stress attack over this.  It takes somebody with a lot of time to keep up with the speedy deletes and often it is a thankless and boring job as well.  I also like to let speedy delete markups ferment for some time just to let contributors know that there are objections to the content and potentially respond if they think it should remain, such as turning it into a VfD discussion instead.  This isn't to say that a speedy delete should be up for six months without being culled, but don't expect the same speed of service that you might expect on Wikipedia.  This isn't Wikipedia and I hope that the deletionist culture there never gets to this project.  In other words, relax and trust that it will eventually be dealt with.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:20, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

== AIM Link ==
 
I want to try and make an AIM link, for instant messenger. Hyperlinks need to have the form of: &quot;aim://goim?username=&quot;, or something (I forget the exact syntax, but it's similar to this). Anyway, mediawiki absolutely refuses to let me create a link like this. Any idea how to make it happen, or if it is even possible? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:08, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, I tried &amp;lt;nowiki&gt; tags, I tried every different variation of hyperlink format that mediawiki offers (at least that I know about), and nothing will just come out working. It's just interesting to me, because I know that &quot;irc://&quot; style links are allowed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

::: I don't know much about mediawiki, but I suspect there's a whitelist for link types somewhere. I'm not quite sure of what security implications AIM links might have (can't think of any except perhaps sending messages to the wrong people), but perhaps we can turn them on.

== Transwiking Video game books ==

When Jimbo ordered the removal of all video game books, people started to move them to StrategyWiki, because it was a gaming wiki and used the same license. However now it looks like the license is being changed to [http://strategywiki.net/wiki/StrategyWiki_talk:License a custom version], so what will happen to the game books that have yet to be moved? Will a new wiki have to be found for them or something? [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 14:40, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
:I think... thats a good question to ask over at SW. [[User:ArrowHate|ArrowHate]] 19:53, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

== Protected project ==

Hi, I used to work on a project called [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Players_guide_for_Star_Sonata Players_guide_for_Star_Sonata] before it was moves to Strategy Wiki.  Now all that remains is a link SW.  However, the strat-wiki project has been depreciated and replaced with a dedicated wiki.  I was wondering if I could get an admin to add a link to the project page, since it's protected.  The address to the new wiki is http://www.lyceumarchives.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page and it's proper title is &quot;The Lyceum Archives&quot;.

Thanks, [[User:ArrowHate|ArrowHate]] 19:51, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

== New Algebra text in simple language ==
A new user, [[User:HSTutorials]], who runs [http://www.hstutorials.net/ HSTutorials.net], has started an [[OLPC_-_Algebra_1_in_Simple_English|Algebra in simple english]] text that looks rather ambitious.  I hope other maths contributors can help it conform to style standards and link out to other related texts here. [[User:Sj|Sj]] 14:06, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
:Out of curiosity, why was this not added to the [[:simple:|Simple English Wikibooks]] instead?  I know that project doesn't get too much support, but this seems like a no-brainer about the fact that it should be transwikied to that project instead, if you want to consider Simple English to be something of a seperate language.  It would also get quite a bit more support simply by being associated with other Simple English contributors.  I'm not going to rehash all of the arguments for if a seperate set of Wikimedia sister projects should be set up as a whole other language just for the &quot;simple&quot; versions of English, but this does looks like a good addition to that project.  And nearly double Simple English Wikibooks just off of a transwiki like this.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:43, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
:I didn't even know there was a &quot;simple english&quot; project. I know this isn't the right venue to discuss the merits of that project, but it seems to me a needless diversion of resources away from this project. However, that being said, I doubt that this new book will be written in a manner that distinguishes itself enough from other texts on the subject, and it will probably just be merged eventually. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

== Enhancement request for separating page title rendering from subpage syntax ==

Some time ago we discuss this issue (see [[Wikibooks talk:Naming policy/Archive 2]]).

== &quot;Important&quot; Books ==

Hi all,

I was doing some reading on Wikipedia the other day, and came across their proposal for a Wikipedia 1.0 CD, which would have good quality articles about &quot;core topics.&quot; I was just curious, what do you all think the &quot;core books&quot; of Wikibooks would be? Personally, I would think the most &quot;important&quot; books would be ones that college freshmen and sophomores would use. I'd like to make a list of the &quot;core books&quot; of the Wikibooks project, and see how good the books we have on those topics are- [[User:Paul_Lynch/Core Topics]] [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 07:33, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

: Well we have lots of books which might be considered core subjects, but unfortunately, few of them are really all that complete or up to snuff. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

: &quot;core subjects&quot; and &quot;good quality&quot; are not the same. A small but determined community can produce a high quality book while larger comunity might not bothered because the subject has allready been covered elsewhere. In this we are different from Wikipedia. So if we are to colled &quot;core books&quot; I would go by the quality book in existance and not on how main stream the subject is. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:34, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

:It is a good point. I think that in many developed countries, the books aimed at undergraduates would make the biggest financial impact. After all, I can't think of anybody who is paying more for texts then undergraduate students. However, in the developing world, it is much harder to get ahold of any books, especially books to teach children basic subjects. Fortunately, I think a wikibooks CD would have enough space to include many different books on many different subjects. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:11, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

Is this opening a can of worms or what?  As far as core subjects of Wikibooks, I would have to point to the [[Wikibooks:Book of the month|books of the month]] as the real place to look.  Now if you are trying to come up with a full university-level curriculum based on Wikibooks content, it will be years or even decades before that is going to happen on Wikibooks.  

I don't think you can find even one Wikibook near completion that is based off of any specific educational standard of any kind, although there are a few that certainly are trying to get there.  The problem here is what standard should be we using?  You can look at [[Help:Textbook Standards]] for some standards that have been gathered together in once spot to at least begin the search.  Most of these standards are for traditional elementary and secondary educational instruction, but that is a place to start.  I do wish these standards were used more in Wikibooks.

One of the best &quot;core curriculum&quot; series of books on Wikibooks at the moment is the [[International Baccalaureate]] series that covers many of the core courses mentioned above.  While the depth of these books isn't really up to book of the month standards, the breadth of this project certainly is incredibly ambitious and worthy of continued support by Wikibooks users.  I hope this is more toward what you were looking for in terms of quality core books that deserve note. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:29, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

== ICT4D books ==

Dear Wikibooks Staff: 

APDIP, the Asia Pacific Development Information Programme (under the UNDP), is willing to donate to the Wikibooks programme some of its many ebooks and primers that it brought out, on the theme of ICT4D (information and communication technologies for development). Would Wikibooks be willing to create a special category to give this topic its deserved prominence? --[[User:Fredericknoronha|Fredericknoronha]] 19:49, 20 July 2006 (UTC) (Frederick Noronha, co-founder BytesForAll)

:That certainly sounds like a generous offer. We can easily set up a new category for this type of information. Also, there are bookshelves such as the [[Wikibooks:Computer science bookshelf]], and the [[wikibooks:Engineering bookshelf]], that would make good homes to books on this subject. It might take some work to get all the material formatted for wikimedia, but free ebooks is something that we shouldnt scoff at. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

I would like to note that by moving the content to Wikibooks, you are indicating that you want to allow others to be able to add to, modify (perhaps substantially), and update the contents of these books, all without any formal approval process for these changes other than what is normally done on a Wiki.  If instead you simply want to preserve this content as e-books that would be available to people to read, but you would like to have essentially complete books available to be freely copied, I would suggest our sister project, [[s:|Wikisource]].

I do agree that this is a very generous offer, and if the quality of the content is high, they would deserve some front page attention as well, including a seperate bookshelf and perhaps on things like the Book of the Month or &quot;Hot Picks&quot; sections.

Please make sure that you understand the terms and conditions of the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|Gnu Free Document License (GFDL)]] when you donate this content.  Generally this isn't a big deal for small contributions of text, but for something major like this I just want to make sure that everybody involved understands just what a copyleft license is about and its implications.  That doesn't mean you can't later use the original content under another copyright license (you are the original copyright owner), but that everything that is added to Wikibooks must be available under that distribution license.

I'm certain if there was some significant quality to this content, there would also be some volunteers to perform formatting tasks and other items to make the content &quot;look nice&quot; and conform to typical Wikibooks styles, as well as give it a good look through for any obvious mistakes.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

==The Assayer==

Should Wikibooks carry a link to the [http://www.theassayer.org/ Assayer] on its main page? Certainly we should try to add as many of the completed Wikibooks to the Assayer's list. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:44, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

: Probably not. We don't link to gutenberg or other such projects, so I'm not sure why assayer should get any special preference. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

I would agree that Wikibooks should be linked into the Assayer in terms of book reviews and showing off some of the best of what we got here.  I don't think Mr. Crowell would mind that at all.

As far as having a link from Wikibooks to the Assayer, I would have to agree partially with Kellen that it should be part of a list of &quot;suggested&quot; free e-book links.  The nice thing about the Assayer is that it encourages reviews of copyleft or public domain books, and I think any link from the front page (even if on a seperate page of links to free e-books) should meet a similar standard.  Links to Microsoft publications, for example, would not be encouraged.

We also don't want to clutter up the front page with a bunch of useless stuff, and should make changes there as careful as possible.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

Could those managing a book '''spend a few minutes to merge any relevant pages into their books'''. I want to clear up our backlog as quickly as possible. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 03:14, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

== Navigation links ==

I noticed today that the navigation links on the left-hand side have changed. I don't particularly miss the link to wikiversity, but i know some people did use the links to wikijunior. I personally found the link to the staff lounge to be particularly useful. Why did they remove these links, and how can we change them back? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:34, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

: I thought this was controlled by [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]]... but it appears to still have the wikijunior, etc, links so perhaps the mediawiki version was updated and this is now ignored? The new version of this is bad, too, because it includes [[Current events]] which is just a redirect to [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]] [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:29, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

::This is a long standing problem with the current version of MediaWiki, and is a bug right now.  Generally it will get &quot;fixed&quot; here in a day or so, so don't panic yet.  For some reason the sidebar doesn't always work the way it should, especially when for some reason the servers are being worked on or are particularly slow.  It would be nice to track this bug down, however.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
::: A workaround for this is quite simple: An administrator needs to edit [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]], klick on preview, and then on save. No changes will be needed and not even saved, but: The cache will be updated with the correct version. -- [[User:ThePacker|ThePacker]] 00:03, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

:::: Weird. So ... a new installation of mediawiki has a precached version of the page? Does this work if you just use the purge option on the page's URL? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:07, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

== {{bad link|Template:Qif}} and {{bad link|Template:Switch}} ==

These templates are now deprecated and are replaced by [[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions|ParserFunctions]]. Could an admin please unprotect them and put up a notice on each? I've already removed them from all pages on wikibooks. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:30, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
:On the unlikely chance that the parserfunctions are removed or discontinued, I think we should keep these around, unaltered. No sense unprotecting them either, since most users wont even know what these templates do, much less how to edit them in a way that is consistant with their purpose.  --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:54, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I don't remember if i mentioned this before or not. I have created a proposed revision of the general voting rules policy: [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]]. I created this revision with the intent on removing hard percentages from the voting requirements, and putting an emphasis on community and concensus. 

Also, whether this revision is acceptable or not, I would like the community to come together, and finalize ''at least some general version'' of the general voting rules policy. It is my firm belief that if we can get a voting policy enforced, we can move to decision on other outstanding proposed policies relatively quickly. This policy will help to form a policy foundation that wikibooks can stand on, and can move forward to the future with. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

:Yes, let's get the format for voting accepted and then tackle the problem of consensus, majority votes etc. as a separate issue. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:09, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

I've made changes to this policy as suggested by the few people who have actually come to read it, so far. I think (hope) that this proposed version is broad enough that we can move to a vote on it. I am going to start a vote on it soon, and I will send out a few messages and try to get some more opinions on it first. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:43, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== Reorganization Advice Sought ==

I've been working on a book [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book|(Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book)]] since October, and I have now come across a bit of an organizational problem that I need advice in addressing.

First a bit of background.  This book is an instructor's guide for teaching Pathfinder honors.  Pathfinders is an international youth club similar to Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, and the &quot;honors&quot; are the equivalent of merit badges.  

One of my contributors has been adding entries based on the way the honors are defined in Australia - each area of the world is given the latitude to adopt its own version of the honors, and in some cases they can change substantially.  I have been using the North American version.  It is important that the honors be taught as adopted by the local division, and I estimate that perhaps 60% of the honors differ between these two areas (and there are other areas to consider as well that may have ''their'' own version).

I don't want to say - &quot;use the North American version,&quot; but I need to make it the distinction clear so that the users of the book don't accidently grab the wrong version.

As it is now, the book has three levels of hierarchy:
:Top Level
::Honor Categories
:::Individual Honors

The second level has ten sections, and the third level has something like 350 chapters.  Work has been done on about 25% of these, so anything I do to re-org is going to be painful.

Should I fork the book, making locality-specific versions?  Should I add a fourth level to the existing hierarchy (between the first and second levels I would think), or should I do something else?  Oh - one other thing: not ''all'' of the honors are different.  Many of them are exactly the same from one locality to the next.  So if I add a fourth level, I may end up sharing chapters rather than duplicating them.

Moving it to a different language almost does what I want, but ''they speak English in Australia'' so that's not gonna fly.  I really need some ideas here!

[[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 03:15, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

: I think the way in which pages are marked right now, with the little maps works pretty well for distinguishing the region for specific honors. If you have the same honor in different regiions that differ substantially, just give it a different name like &quot;Sewing (South Pacific Division).&quot; Also, you might consider organizing the honors with categories for each division. That way, you can encode the fact that the honors apply to more than one division, and you can produce a complete listing of available honors by division. Or, you could fork the books and have &quot;Adventist Youth Honors (South Pacific)&quot; but that seems like it'll just make more work for people if a good number of the honors are exactly the same. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

:I wouldnt even do that. I would attempt to separate each page, into different localities. Use headings and templates to indicate specific points or requirements that are specific to a single locality, and don't mark the things that are pretty universal. This way, you dont need to reorg the book at all, and the different material can become very clear. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:06, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

== Vandalism templates ==

There has been some discussion about deleting some of the vandalism user templates, and I would like to turn it into an official discussion. I would like to permanently delete the following templates:

*[[Template:WoW]]
*[[Template:MPS]]
*[[Template:sockpuppet]]
*[[:Category:Suspected Wikibooks sockpuppets of Willy on Wheels]]
*[[:Category:Suspected Wikibooks sockpuppets]]
*[[:Category:Suspected Wikibooks sockpuppets of Mr.Pelican Shit]]
*[[:Category:Suspected sockpuppets]]

If a user is found to be a bad-faith sockpuppet or a sockpuppet of a known vandal, that username should be blocked forever. We do not, however, need to erect a monument to every single sockpuppet, with a fancy template. sockpuppet accounts, IMO should be blocked, and forgotten forever. Also, I would like to delete the several (verbose) categories that accompany these templates, as being nothing but listings of users who have already been identified as vandals, and blocked forever. No sense listing information that doesnt matter. 

I didn't want to make this a VfD discussion, because it is more a matter of policy (the policy of identifying and glorifying sockpuppets).--[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:28, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
:I agree that those should be deleted. This isn't Wikipedia. The user who created these templates may very well just have the &quot;all wikis are like Wikipedia&quot; mentality thinking that all wikis work similarly in the project and is moving those templates, but we don't need them. Upon looking at his contributions, many of his edits seem questionable to me. All those Wikipedia-like template copies should be wiped in my opinion. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 12:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
:The reason for having templates like this is to watch and monitor problematic users.  From my opinion, templates like this add to the notoriety of this particular individual who deserves none.  The templates, categories, and any content in these categories need to be removed.  In fact, I have no problem even deleting any user pages for known vandals.  It is better to treat these users as if they never existed in the first place for some of the acts they have done.  Let's not give another excuse for people to become vandals.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
: I agree 100%. Delete them. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 23:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
:Okay, i'm going to just go ahead and delete them now. If we have need of them in the future (which I doubt), we can always undelete them. Perhaps we could write it into policy somewhere that userpages of known vandals can simply be deleted? but, that's a question for another day. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== Collaboration and Book of the Month for August ==

August 1st is coming up. It would be good to actually have the templates for these ready to go before the front page tips them over into redlinks. The votes are:
* [[Wikibooks:Book of the month/August 2006 voting]]
* [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month/August 2006 voting]]

And the templates which need to be made are:
* [[Wikibooks:Book of the month/August 2006]]
* [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month/August 2006]]

Also, I think the pages state the voting ends at midnight the first day of the month. This is kind of stupid since we could use some time to actually create the templates. Ending it a week before would make more sense.

[[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:52, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

: Okay, I made these. For book of the month, it's the [[Movie Making Manual]]. For collaboration, it's [[Reverse Engineering]]. Once again, the text I've written in these templates is '''bad'''. The image for RE is a breakdown of CIDR blocks, which doesn't really make any sense for RE, but it does at least show translating between binary and something meaningful. I was unsuccessful at finding anything appropriate, so that's my straw-grasping. Someone should find a better image. Whiteknight, I'm looking at you. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:13, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

::Despite what I said on your user page, I actually did go in and change the picture and the text. I wouldn't say that either of them were &quot;bad&quot;, but the new picture is slightly more relevant (i hope). I'll look at the [[Moving Making Manual]], and see if I can do anything to that (although I dont know much about making movies). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:50, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== Transwiki redirect deletion ==

So with transwikis, do we need to keep the old redirects around or can we delete interim redirect pages, like [[Cookbook:Rice and beef soup]]? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:12, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

:I've been deleting them, as I merged them, so i'm going to say that is the correct way to do it. I dont think we need to keep around any redirects, because no books should link to a transwiki: page in the first place. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:51, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== Some Wikibooks on our educational DVD ==

Hello,
I would like to inform you, that some of your Wikibooks are going to be published and distributed for free on our Xplora Knoppix 1.2 DVD. To read more about the project read here:

http://www.xplora.org/ww/en/pub/xplora/library/software/xplora___dvd_knoppix__make_sci.htm

If you send me an email address, I can forward you the preview of the DVD on our webserver.

Thanks
Karl Sarnow

:Sounds like an excellent project, if you ask me. I assume the wikibooks that you are using will all be in pdf format? All I would ask in return is some kind of mention of wikibooks, in an attempt to increase interest in our project, through participation in yours. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:55, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== Category sort enhancement request ==

I've made an [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6387 enhancement request] on the mediawiki bugtracker requesting that categories be able to set the default sort key. This would mean that instead of doing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Category name|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on every single page in every single category we would just go to each category and do &lt;nowiki&gt;__SORTBYPAGENAME__&lt;/nowiki&gt; (or something similiar). This would be a huge boon for the cookbook as we have many, many categories and this would mean many, many places where we don't have to sort things by hand. Please go [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6387 vote for this bug]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:16, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] ==

There has been a suggested ammendment to the [[Wikibooks_talk:Deletion_policy#Add_old_redirect_pages_to_speedy_deletion|deletion policy, HERE]], that would include &quot;redirects that aren't linked to&quot; and &quot;redirects that follow a deprecated naming scheme&quot; under candidates for speedy deletion. At the moment, the only redirects that specifically qualify for speedy deletion are those for which it is &quot;unlikely that anyone will inadventently search for a page under that name&quot;. I think that the policy here should be expanded to give admins more ability to clean out useless garbage like this. I would, however, like to ask for other opinions on the matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== Requesting bot flag ==

My [[User:Swift|owner]] has been scouring the wiki, trying to find where he should ask that I be flagged as a bot. Can anyone point him in the right direction? --[[User:SwiftBot|SwiftBot]] 22:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

:It used to be you could request a bot flag at [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]], but now it is stated that bots require &quot;community concensus&quot; before the botflag can be granted. I would suggest that you use your bot a few times to prove that it is useful and benign. you can try to make a request at [[WB:RFA]] (down at the very bottom), but no guaruntees. Also, if you release your source code so people can see what it is made of, what it does, and that it means no harm, we will feel better about it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Problematic example in General Map */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== treeMap ==
For learning purposes, why I have removed the comment behind the type signature.

The type of &lt;tt&gt;treeMap&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;(a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree b&lt;/tt&gt;. We call &lt;tt&gt;treeMap (+1)&lt;/tt&gt;. The types of &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; are:

  (+) :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
  1 :: Num a =&gt; a --Aye, polymorph!

This turns &lt;tt&gt;(+1)&lt;/tt&gt; into a function of type &lt;tt&gt;Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a&lt;/tt&gt;

So &lt;tt&gt;treeMap&lt;/tt&gt; is of type &lt;tt&gt;Num a =&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree a&lt;/tt&gt;

This means Haskell doesn't get to be confused between &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;, because both will do.

== Tree - elements only in leaves ==
I modified the discussion of Trees in two ways.  First, letting the Branch constructor take a value of type a as well as left and right subtrees just complicated the discussion without adding any substance, so I simplified it: the Branch constructor now just takes a left and right subtree.  Secondly, treeFold as defined was not a true analog of foldr, as explained in the revised text.

Here is an example that shows one of the problems with the way treeFold was defined.  Note that &lt;tt&gt;foldr (:) []&lt;/tt&gt; is the identity function on lists; with my new definition of treeFold, &lt;tt&gt;treeFold Branch id&lt;/tt&gt; is the identity function on Trees; but with the old definition of treeFold, there is no choice of the arguments &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;z&lt;/tt&gt; that will give you the identity function.

--Kevin S. Van Horn (kevin@ksvanhorn.com), 1 July 2007

Great, I came here to see a discussion about why the definition of Branch differed from the one in YAHT. Are you sure this gives the same structure for the BinaryTree? Seems to me like only Leaves have elements rather than one at every branch.

== Problematic example in General Map ==

As of now, the general map example for the Weird type eventually reaches this point:

 weirdMap :: (a -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; d) -&gt; Weird a b -&gt; Weird c d
 weirdMap fa fb = weirdMap'
   where
     weirdMap' (First x)          = First (fa x)
     weirdMap' (Second y)         = Second (fb y)
     weirdMap' (Third ((x,y):zs)) = Third ( (fa x, fb y) : weirdMap' (Third zs))
     weirdMap' (Fourth w)         = --More to follow


However, this expression

     weirdMap' (Third ((x,y):zs)) = Third ( (fa x, fb y) : weirdMap' (Third zs))

is wrong since it tries to cons an (a,b) pair to something that is not a list (weirdMap' (Third zs) evaluates to a Weird c d). For that to work you'd need to extract the zs and provide a base case for the recursion:

     weirdMap' (Third []) = Third []
     weirdMap' (Third ((x,y):zs)) = Third ( (fa x, fb y) : ( (\(Third z) -&gt; z) (weirdMap' (Third zs)) )

Needless to say, that is horribly awkward, &lt;s&gt;and is probably best left to an exercise (say, &quot;rewrite weirdMap' (Third z) making the recursion applied to the list z explicit).&lt;/s&gt; Also, the example is followed by:

:First we change (a,b) into (fa a, fb b). Next we need the mapped version of the rest of the list to add to it. Since we don't know a function for a list of (a,b), we must change it back to a Weird value, by adding Third. This isn't really stylish, though, as we first &quot;unwrap&quot; the Weird package, and then pack it back in. This can be changed into a more elegant solution, in which we don't even have to break list elements into tuples!

I also take issue with the &quot;we don't even have to break list elements into tuples&quot; part, which doesn't really make sense (if the author was referring to breaking down the list into its elements, map is doing that implicitly). I will probably rewrite this part in the next few hours. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 01:41, 30 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

It should be directed at a young audience so that it can be used for education purposes.

Adding stress marks (знаки ударения) would help in the Russian name pronunciation. For instance, until learning from a Russian how to pronounce Борис (Boris), I had always thought the stress was on the first syllable. Properly pronounced in Russian, however, it's on the second syllable.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Assassin Format''' is typically played in groups of five or more.  The name of each player is put into a hat (or whatever) and each player draws a name, to be kept secret.  The rules are thus: A player may only attack the player whose name they drew, or any player that has attacked them at any point in the game (universal effect cards can be played, just as long as your target could be hit with it, e.g. Skullcage, Radiance).  If they drew their own name they may attack any or all other players (stratagy here, simply build up your forces until you can swamp a player, since no one can target you until you attack them).  All types of spells, with the exception of those with universal effects, may only target the player drawn or players who have since attacked you (counter spells, creatures, instants, sorceries...).  Any method of attack goes.  Speed rules are usually enforced, since this format tends to take over an hour to play.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

On the Hogwarts Express, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] invites a number of students to his compartment for lunch, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Belby|Marcus Belby]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Blaise Zabini|Blaise Zabini]], and Cormac McLaggen. It seems that most of them are invited because of their famous relatives, or because they are famous in their own right as Harry is, or because of their own apparent magical ability: Ginny is invited because Slughorn saw her performing a flawless [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bat Bogey Hex|Bat-Bogey hex]]. Harry recognizes this as Slughorn re-establishing his Slug Club.

McLaggen tries out for the Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team, hoping to replace [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] as Keeper. Each Keeper candidate has five chances to stop shots on goal; Ron stops all five, but McLaggen fumbles the final one, and Ron is selected as Keeper. Ron comments that McLaggen had looked [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|Confunded]] on his last shot; Hermione blushes, but Ron does not notice. Later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] sees McLaggen apparently having trouble negotiating the front steps into Hogwarts, and asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] about it. Hermione, aware of his bad temper and denigrating comments about Ron and the other Keepers being tried, quietly admits having Confunded him during his trials so that Harry would have a valid reason to select Ron instead of him.

With Ron thoroughly entangled in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]], Hermione does not have anyone she can take to Professor Slughorn's &quot;Slug Club&quot; Christmas party. She invites McLaggen to make Ron jealous. Once there, finding McLaggen's unrelenting efforts to maneuver her under the mistletoe tiresome, she manages to lose him, instead talking to Harry and his date, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]].

When Ron is put out of action by a glass of poisoned mead, Harry reluctantly puts McLaggen in the team as Keeper. McLaggen immediately starts acting like team captain, trying to set tactics for the games, and telling the other players what is wrong with what they are doing. During the game against Hufflepuff, he borrows a Beater's bat to demonstrate the proper way to hit a Bludger, mis-hits it, and fractures Harry's skull. With Harry out of the game, Gryffindor loses very heavily to Hufflepuff. McLaggen is, of course, cut from the team immediately Harry regains consciousness.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

McLaggen is very self-important and self-centered, and must be the center of any group he is part of. He seems to be one of those irritating people who think they know everything. He tries to reinforce this view by demeaning and insulting those who might know more than he does. When he is passed over for what he considers an honour, he can have a very bad temper.

== Overview ==

'''''Penelope Clearwater''''' is a girl in Ravenclaw house. When she is first identified in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], we are told that she is in her fifth year, thus she is three years ahead of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]. We also learn that she is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefect]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Penelope Clearwater is first seen, although unidentified, at Christmas; Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], disguised as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]], are wandering around looking for the Slytherin common room, and ask her for directions. Shortly after she rebuffs them, they run into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], who threatens them.

In April, Penelope Clearwater is petrified by the Monster in the Chamber of Secrets; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is attacked at the same time. Percy is deeply shocked by this attack, possibly because he believed that Prefects would be protected by their office.

It is only at the end that it is revealed that Penelope is Percy's girlfriend; this explains the magnitude of the shock Percy feels when she is petrified, as well as explaining what she was doing in the school's lower levels at Christmas, near where Percy was.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] complains of having to use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Errol|Errol]] for his correspondence because Percy has been sending messages back and forth to Penelope all summer, fully occupying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermes|Hermes]]' time.

While all the Weasleys are staying at the Leaky Cauldron preparatory to departing for Hogwarts, Percy accuses Ron (who is sharing a room with him) of spilling tea on Penelope's picture; apparently the image has some spots on her nose and is trying to hide behind the frame.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione are trapped by Snatchers, Hermione claims to be Penelope Clearwater. Unfortunately, this ruse does not last, as her likeness in a newspaper clipping identifies her as one of the people believed traveling with Undesirable Number 1, Harry Potter.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Penelope is Percy Weasley's girlfriend throughout the first three books, though it is unsure if their relationship still stands because she never directly appeared in any book after ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. Percy's estrangement from the other Weasleys, up until the final book, likely left his family in doubt as to the state of his personal relationships. 

There is no indication that Penelope and Hermione were friends while at Hogwarts, but in ''Deathly Hallows'', Hermione, to hide her identity, claims her name is Penelope Clearwater when Snatchers capture her, along with Harry and Ron. Whether she chose this name because Penelope was still in a relationship with Percy at the time is unknown, though it seems more likely that the name randomly occurred to Hermione because it had a prior connection to the Weasley family.

In the Weasley family tree that the author created following the series, it is revealed that Percy marries one Audrey. We can, therefore, assume that his relationship with Penelope had ended some time earlier.

== Overview ==

'''''Blaise Zabini''''' is a Hogwarts student in Harry's year. He is a member of Slytherin house.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Blaise Zabini is Sorted into Slytherin.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Blaise Zabini is invited to dine with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] on the Hogwarts Express, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], in Professor Slughorn's renascent Slug Club. Zabini's claim to fame is apparently that his mother is a famously beautiful witch, whose seven successive husbands all died mysteriously and left her pots of Galleons.

Harry follows Blaise back to his compartment on the Hogwarts Express, hoping to overhear some conversation with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] that would give him some clue as to what Malfoy had planned. Malfoy drops some hints, but does not say anything particularly helpful, perhaps because he has seen Harry's foot as Harry climbed into the luggage rack.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

Blaise is described as being excessively vain, as well as bitter, self-centered, and clever. He does not actively participate in the fight against the Light, but is rather more concerned with protecting himself. He does not associate himself fully with anyone, he is considered a loner, although he is some-what of a friend of Malfoy's. He finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] attractive, but would never pursue a relationship with her, due to her family's Blood Traitor status.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

He is a friend of Draco Malfoy's, and seems to get along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]], to an extent. Other than that, he doesn't really associate himself with the other students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello hello.

I work with Wikipedia and Wikibooks Cookbook - my mother's side of the family has some great recipes. They come from her recipe books and various recipe cards she's accumulated over the years.

Leave a message on my talk page if you want to say hi, or if I screwed something up.

Also - you can call me Kitty.

This is from an old recipe book of my mother's. There's a little note on the page: &quot;fruitcake - only better.&quot; This recipe makes three loaves. It's tricky to get right but it's well worth the time and effort. We usually make it around Christmastime.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240ml) pitted dates
*2 cups (480ml) maraschino [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherries]]
*1/2 cup (120ml) cherry juice
*1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*3 cups (720ml) [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*5 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], separated
*1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]]. vanilla
*3 1/2 cups (830ml) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*4 tsp. [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
*1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]]
*1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*2 1/2 cups (600ml) [[Cookbook:Nuts and seeds|chopped nuts]]

==Procedure==
====Day 1====
# Cut dates and cherries into small pieces and soak them in 1/2 cup (120ml) of cherry juice overnight.
====Day 2====
# Preheat oven to 250°F (120c).
# Cream butter, add half of the sugar. Beat until fluffy.
# In another bowl beat egg yolks until thick. Add remaining sugar.
# Combine the two mixtures and beat.
# Sift and measure flour, then add and sift together salt, baking powder, and spices.
# Add dry ingredients and milk alternately to wet mixture, beating well after each addition.
# Fold in stiffly beaten egg whites.
# Add in fruit and nuts dredged lightly with flour.
# Bake in lined loaf pans and in slow oven for 2 hours.

The (continuous) uniform distribution, as its name suggests, is a distribution with probability densities that are the same at each point in an interval. In casual terms, the uniform distribution shapes like a rectangle.

Mathematically speaking, the probability density function of the uniform distribution is defined as

&lt;math&gt;
f\colon[a,b]\to\R
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
f\left(x\right)={1 \over {b-a}}
&lt;/math&gt;

And the cumulative distribution function is:

&lt;math&gt;
F\left(x\right)=
\begin{cases}
0, &amp; \mbox{if } x \le a \\
{{x-a} \over {b-a}}, &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; x &lt; b\\
1, &amp; \mbox{if } x \ge b
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
====Mean====
We derive the mean as follows.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \int^\infin_{-\infin}xf(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;
As the uniform distribution is 0 everywhere but [''a'', ''b''] we can restrict ourselves that interval
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \int^b_a {1 \over {b-a}} x dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \left.{1 \over (b-a)}{1 \over 2} x^2 \right|^b_a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {1 \over 2(b-a)}\left[ b^2-a^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {b+a \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

====Variance====
We use the following formula for the variance.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \operatorname{E}[X^2]-(\operatorname{E}[X])^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \left[\int^\infin_{-\infin}f(x) \cdot x^2 dx\right]-\left({b+a \over 2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \left[\int^b_a {1 \over {b-a}} x^2 dx\right]-{(b+a)^2 \over 4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \left. {1 \over {b-a}}{1 \over 3} x^3 \right|^b_a-{(b+a)^2 \over 4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over 3(b-a)}[b^3-a^3] -{(b+a)^2 \over 4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {4(b^3-a^3)-3(b+a)^2(b-a) \over 12(b-a)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {(b-a)^3 \over 12(b-a)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {(b-a)^2 \over 12}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual Health}}

Barrier methods of birth control use a physical barrier to prevent the man's sperm from entering the woman's reproductive tract.  Spermicide is often used with barrier methods to provide increased protection from pregnancy.

Condoms, both male and female, additionally provide protection from sexually transmitted diseases.

== Male Condoms ==

===Origins of Male Condoms===

Condoms have been around for a lot longer than we think. From as early as 1000 BC, Egyptians used a linen cloth, Chinese used oil-soaked silk paper, and the Japanese even went so far as to use turtle shells and horn. The oldest condoms found were discovered in 1640 in Birmingham, England, made of fish and animal intestine. Condoms made of animal intestines were popular in England at that time, but were very expensive and often reused. The mass production of latex condoms began in 1844, but at the time were as thick as bicycle inner tubes and had a seam down the side. Manufacturing improved in the 1930s, making the single-use condom almost as thin and inexpensive as condoms found today.

===Guidelines for male condom use===
{{wikipedia|Condom}}
[[Image:Condom rolled.jpg|thumb|left|125px|A rolled-up condom]]
[[Image:Condom unrolled durex.jpg|thumb|right|325px|An unrolled latex condom]]

* Condoms should never be stored in hot places like car glove-compartments or wallets kept in pockets close to the body, as prolonged exposure to heat weakens latex.
* Sharp fingernails can damage condoms. In case of shaved or trimmed pubic hair extra care should be taken due to the stubble.
* Condoms are best put on the erect penis as soon as an erection is achieved and before any contact with the other person's body, and should always be put on ''before'' contact with a vagina or anus.
* Retracting the foreskin before putting on a condom maximizes mobility and reduces the risk of breakage during intercourse.
* Room needs to be left at the tip of a condom to hold semen.  Most condoms have a reservoir tip that should be pinched while applying the condom to avoid trapping an air bubble which could burst later.
* Water-based sexual lubricants, such as KY Jelly, are safe for use with condoms, but oil-based lubricants weaken latex and may cause it to tear or develop holes.  Lubrication can be used to reduce the abrasion on the condom during vaginal sex, and is virtually essential for anal sex. However lubrication should be used with care. One study has shown that additional lubrication may double the rate of condom slippage for vaginal sex and increase the rate of condom slippage for oral sex. The rate of condom slippage during anal sex however was reduced. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9671246&amp;dopt=Abstract]
* Some condoms are designed specifically for anal sex. The material is slightly thicker, making these condoms less likely to tear than those designed for vaginal sex.
* Condoms should be discarded after the expiration date on the package.  Even ones that seem fine past that date may be more likely to burst later.
* The penis should be withdrawn ''immediately'' after ejaculation, even if the erection can be maintained; leaving it in leads to needless risk.
* The base of the condom should be held during withdrawal to prevent the condom from slipping off.
* One's hands and penis should be washed before further physical contact with another person (including the sexual partner).
* Condoms are for single use only, and should never be reused.
* Condoms are available in special sizes for people who require larger or smaller ones.
* Practicing applying condoms alone in a well lighted place can help a man learn to apply it correctly before using them for sex.

====Advantages of lubricating the inside tip of a condom====
*Makes sex with a condom feel more like sex without a condom.
*A thicker condom may be used with no loss of sensation. (Very thick condoms could be made to be used this way.)
*This may encourage more to use condoms especially if it enables them to achieve orgasm with a condom on.

====Possible disadvantages of lubricating the inside tip of a condom====
*The condom may be more likely to break (especially if there is not adequate lubrication on the outside) because the penis may push to the end of the condom and stretch the tip to the breaking point (during ejaculation).
*If the condom breaks, the added sensation of the penis slipping inside the condom may make it more difficult for the penis to feel that the condom has broken.
*Lubrication mixed with pre-ejaculate, semen, or infected skin cells may leak around the open end of the condom, especially if too much lubrication is used on the inside.
*The condom may slip up and allow contact of skin or genital fluids, or at least the slipping may interrupt sex while the penis is dried, (sanitized), and a new condom put on.

===General instructions for putting on a male condom ===

[[Image:CondomUse2 alternative.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Male condom application.]]

# Check the expiry date on the condom wrapper - Condoms have a printed expiry date and batch number. '''Do not''' use out of date condoms for sexual contacts, using them for practicing applying condoms alone especially by less experienced users is advised. 
# Gently apply pressure to the condom wrapper to make sure it has a slight pillow-like quality to it, indicating air inside and proper and unbroken sealing. Otherwise air may have escaped from tear or punctures and the condom itself may be damaged as well.
# Exercising caution, open the foil (or plastic) wrapper along one side. Be careful not to damage the condom with sharp objects.
# If the condom is sticky or brittle, discard it and use another one.
# Press firmly together the tip of the condom to expel air that may be trapped inside the condom. Air pockets can cause the condom to burst. This tip is there to contain the discharge in ejaculation. Hold the condom by the tip.
# Ensure that the penis is fully erect &amp;mdash; a condom may fall off the penis which is only partially erect.
# In case of an uncircumcised penis, retract the foreskin before applying the condom.
# Check that the condom is in the right direction to unroll down the penis and before unrolling put it on the tip of the penis. If you accidentally try to put it on the wrong way, discard it and start over with a new condom. Touching the wrong side of the condom with the penis can transfer bodily fluids, defeating its purpose.
# Unroll the condom over the shaft of the penis. Unroll it ''all the way''. If it does not unroll, it is on the wrong way and you must start over with a new condom.
# Make sure the condom isn't loose or at risk of coming off.
# It may be essential to lubricate the outside of the condom to keep it from breaking, especially if lubrication was used on the inside. 
# Do not allow the penis to go flaccid at any time while wearing or putting on the condom, or you will have to discard the condom.



Some men who feel a particular size condom is hard to put on because it is too small have reported that they partly unroll the condom, stretch it with both index fingers, insert the penis (asking their partner to expel air from the tip), remove fingers and unroll. This procedure is ''not recommended'' as one's fingernails can come in contact with the condom. Consider buying a larger condom, or practicing the approved method above.

== Female Condoms ==
===Guidelines for female condom use===
* Because they are not made of latex, all lubricants, including oil-based ones, may be safely used with female condoms.
* Female condoms may be inserted up to 8 hours prior to sexual intercourse.
* Placement of female condoms does not require a male erection.
* Newer condoms made from nitrile are less likely to make rustling noises than the original polyurethane condoms.
* Any &quot;rustling&quot; can be counteracted by applying extra lubricant to the inside of the condom
* Applying lubricant to the inside of the condom also reduces the chances of the outer ring being pulled into the vagina during intercourse.

===General instructions for placing a female condom===
* The condom should be removed carefully from the packaging;
* The small inner ring should be squeezed closed;
* The inner ring should be pushed into the vagina, the outer ring remaining outside;
* The penis should be guided through the outer ring to ensure that it is not pushed aside.
* Before removing the condom, the outer ring should be squeezed and twisted (while the wearer is still lying down, if applicable) to ensure that semen does not leak out of the pouch. Pull to remove the condom.

== Cervical Barriers ==
===Diaphragms===
{{wikipedia|Diaphragm (contraceptive)}}

===Cervical Cap===
{{wikipedia|Cervical cap}}

===Lea's Shied===
{{wikipedia|Lea's shield}}

===Contraceptive Sponge===
{{wikipedia|Contraceptive sponge}}

==Spermicides==
{{wikipedia|Spermicide}}
Spermicides significantly reduce the risk of pregnancy, but are not considered &quot;highly effective&quot; when used alone.  They can, however, significantly increase the effectiveness of other methods.  Concurrent use of condoms and spermicide theoretically results in failure rates as low as that of hormonal methods.

There are many different types of spermicides.  Spermicidal foams may be inserted directly into the vagina.  Films are also inserted into the vagina, but the couple must wait at least 15 minutes after insertion (to allow the film to dissolve) before beginning intercourse.

Spermicides are designed for specific uses.  Those meant for use inside cervical barriers (creams and jellies) should not be used alone or with condoms, and vice versa.

If the spermicide causes irritation to the genitals of either partner, or if the woman develops a vaginal infection following spermicide use, the couple should use a different birth control method.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Sexual Health]] ==

I see that you actually started this book. I'm glad you did. I've wanted to create it for a while, but I just haven't had the time. If you need any help with this project, or anything else on wikibooks, don't hesitate to let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:56, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Cowper's Fluid ==

Hey Lyrl. I've seen sources before that claims cowpers fluid ''can contain sperm''. Of course, i don't have the sources on me, but I have seen it in writing. I'll look around and see if I can find anything to confirm this or not. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:03, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

:Actually, i did find a quote from that very wikipedia artical:
::''it is now believed the primary cause of method failure is the pre-ejaculate fluid picking up sperm from a previous ejaculation.''
:The method by which the sperm can enter the pre-ejaculate fluid is inconsequential compared to the fact that there can be sperm in it at all. I think that we should point this fact out, if only in the interest of completeness. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:07, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

I changed the &quot;Condom Use&quot; image to the alternative version, which is image-filtered, and is less photographic. I think, for the time being, it is a better idea for us to not to show too many graphic images, even if there are alot of them to be found at commons. We can have a complete discussion about this topic, if people think we can display more graphic images (perhaps with a disclaimer, or a warning, or something). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:06, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Loss of redirect and talk page ==

Copying the information to this page from the misspelled page has lost all the edit histories, talk page, and messed up redirects (from the Wikipedia article condom, primarily).  The redirect issue can be fixed by manually changing it (I don't think any other articles besides the condom one linked to the old page), but the edit history and talk page are important (at least, this is what was drilled into me at Wikipedia).

Could an administrator be persuaded to delete the correctly-spelled page so that the edit history and talk page content could be moved here? [[User:Lyrl|Lyrl]] 01:44, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

:I'm not going to delete it, that doesnt make any sense to me. I will, however, copy the text of the old talk page to here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:52, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== Contents of old talk page ==

Oh my goodness, no one has complained about the use of an erect penis here yet! It is great to see, if someone needs to see this guide then chances are a visual aid will also help them. If even one life is affected by seeing that article and picture (wether it is pregnancy, STD or especially an eventually fatal STD) then it is all worth while. Big thank you to whoever put it there, common sense prevails! [[User:202.191.106.29|202.191.106.29]] 17:05, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

I agree, definitely worth having here. What is best when the condom is not as long as the shaft? Stretching it appears to increase the chance of breakage. [[User:213.2.21.113|213.2.21.113]] 15:16, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Hygiene ==

I'm rethinking the inclusion of this as a main topics.  Hygiene, particularly, children need to learn way before the target age of this book.  (Assuming hygiene means things like wiping front to back for women and care of uncircumcised penises for men.)  Things like making sure to pee after intercourse (for women), and washing hands before inserting them into the vagina (if using a cervical barrier, for example), can be covered in other sections. [[User:Lyrl|Lyrl]] 02:04, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with you, perhaps we need to include some sections (if not the whole book) that can be targeted for a younger audience. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:05, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Low impact decisions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Low impact decisions ==
For low-impact decisions, majority rules voting may be used for convenience and clarity. Low impact decisions are those which will not affect the long term culture or policies of Wikibooks. Examples of low impact decisions where majority rules voting would be acceptable are:

#Determining the following month's [[WB:BOTM|book of the month]]
#Determining the following month's [[WB:COTM|collaboration of the month]]
#Determining the following quarter's [[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:New Book of the Quarter|Wikijunior book of the quarter]]
#Resolving disputes where parties agree to use voting as a method of gauging opinion or taking decisions.

== High impact decisions ==

Any decisions which will have a long term effect on the culture or policies of Wikibooks should always be decided by community consensus. Such decisions include:

#Making a Wikibookian an [[WB:RFA|administrator]]
#Making a Wikibookian a [[WB:RFA|bureaucrat]]
#Giving a Wikibookian [[WB:RFA|checkuser rights]]
#Determining whether a page should be [[WB:VFD|deleted]]
#Creating or modifying Wikibooks policies

== Voting ==
When voting is deemed acceptable, the vote should follow these guidelines:
* Each person gets only one vote; additional votes by sockpuppets or alternate accounts should not be counted
* Only votes cast by registered users with 20 or more edits should be counted
* Votes cast in bad faith should not be counted
* Each vote should be signed (using four tildes: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;)
* The start and end period of the vote should be included with the description of the vote, and the period of the vote should be long enough to allow wide user participation
* The vote should be publicised in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] and on the [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]]
* In the case of low-impact decisions, the option with the most valid votes is the winner. 
* For high-impact decisions, votes and debates should be left open as long as progress towards reaching consensus is being made.

== Community consensus ==

&quot;Community consensus&quot; is a state of existence arrived at by following a formal ''consensus decision making process''. Ultimately the state of &quot;community consensus&quot; involves the vast majority of users agreeing on some decision.

=== Process ===

# A proposal is made, and discussion about the proposal is invited.
# The proposal is discussed, and initial concerns are raised. 
# The proposal may be modified to address these initial concerns and resubmitted for discussion.
# A call for consensus regarding the proposal is made, possibly in the form of a [[w:Straw poll|straw poll]].
# If there are no objections, the proposal is accepted and affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; has been reached on the proposal.
# If there are still objections, the objections should be discussed and:
#* The proposal may be dropped. Affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; for the proposal was not reached. 
#* The proposal may be modified to address these objections and resubmitted for discussion.
#* A call for consensus regarding the proposal is made again, in spite of the objections. This action should not be taken lightly and should only occur after substantive good faith discussion of the proposal and objections has taken place. The community can:
#** Accept the proposal in spite of objections, and affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; has been reached.
#** Not accept the proposal as &quot;community consensus&quot; has not been reached.

==== User responses ====

Users who do not agree with the community decison should accept the decision and, if they feel strongly, have one of the following options open to them:
* Propose alternative policies.
* Propose alterations to existing policies.
* Accept the community's decision.'''</text>

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;The youngest Germanic language&lt;/font&gt;==
[[Image:Flag of South Africa.svg|100px|right|]]

The name &quot;Afrikaans&quot; means literally &quot;African&quot;. Afrikaans has its roots in 17th-century Dutch, but has since developed its own distinctive character and flavour in the three centuries that it developed mostly in South Africa and in parts of Namibia. Being a Germanic language, it is closely related to Dutch, English and to a lesser extent German. Compare the following:

*&lt;font color=&quot;#FF3399&quot;&gt;English&lt;/font&gt;: ''I eat an apple.''
*&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/font&gt;: ''Ek eet 'n appel.''
*&lt;font color=&quot;#FF3399&quot;&gt;Dutch&lt;/font&gt;: ''Ik eet een appel.''
*&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;German&lt;/font&gt;: ''Ich esse einen Apfel.''

English has many more words of a Latin or French origin than Afrikaans, but a more archaic word can often show the similarities between the two languages.
*&lt;font color=&quot;#FF3399&quot;&gt;English&lt;/font&gt;: ''hound, fowl, house, milk''
*&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/font&gt;: ''hond, voël, huis, melk''

[[Image:Afrikaansdistrib.png|thumb|150px|left|Provinces of South Africa where Afrikaans is in the majority. Note that Afrikaans is spoken all over the country and also in Namibia.]]
Most interestingly, consider these two sentences:
*''My hand is in warm water.''
*''My pen is in my hand.''

These two sentences can be either English or Afrikaans, and both have exactly the same meaning in both languages. But despite this, Afrikaans has significant differences from English. It might not be as easy to learn for an English speaker as, say, Esperanto, but it is still considered a relatively easy language to learn, and is advocated by some as a good introduction to learning Dutch and other Germanic languages in general.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Can Afrikaans people and Dutch people understand each other?&lt;/font&gt;==

Afrikaans and Dutch are very closely related and are more or less mutually understandable. More about that [[Dutch/Lesson Afrikaans|here]]. Dutch's grammar is a bit more complex than Afrikaans', but they share a lot of the same vocabulary, albeit with slightly different spellings and pronunciations. Comparing Afrikaans and Dutch is somewhat like comparing Norwegian Bokmål and Danish. 

It is a commonly held belief that Afrikaans people tend to understand Dutch quite well, and Dutch people generally need more time to understand Afrikaans. The truth of this claim may vary from individual to individual. Some Afrikaans people claim to understand written Dutch better than spoken Dutch.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Language of the oppressor?&lt;/font&gt;==

Afrikaans is seen by some in a negative light because it was the language promoted by the apartheid regime. Some even claim that it should be forgotten. We acknowledge the terrible atrocities of that regime but still regard Afrikaans language and culture as beautiful and worthy of preservation. The past is the past; it cannot be changed. The future is what really counts. Should German language and culture be done away with because it was once advocated by the Nazi party? 

Besides, many speakers of the language (about half!) were not white and were victims of the regime's many manipulations, including ripping apart families and forcefully moving whole communities.

      <comment>/* Extending the rules for use in general disputes */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I like the wording. Importantly it preserves key elements of the current main version (listing out where votes are currently used, setting out who can vote, placing emphasis on consensus for higher impact decisions) and is clearer than the current text.

I have made some small amendments:

#I have replaced the requirement to have &quot;substantial good faith discussions&quot; with a requirement to have &quot;substantive good faith discussions&quot;. It is the quality of the discussions - which should address all points thought to be key - that is important, not the quantity of those discussions. My guess is that is what you were getting at anyway.
#I have added a requirement to have substantive good faith discussions on any objections, not just on the proposal.

I'm not sure the wording regarding page deletion is quite right though. Some deletions are entirely uncontroversial (deleting patent nonsense, for example) - however, these rarely end up on VfD. What we have had on VfD is experienced Wikibookians coming to a different conclusion than that arrived at by new editors - and some possible (but not necessarily proven) sockpuppets. We have also had statements from above empowering admins to have their head over deletion of text that does not meet our inclusion criteria. In these cases it is debatable as to whether we have consensus to delete text that, in experienced WBian eyes, does not belong. We should not require a high threshold here. In other cases on VfD the matter at hand has very much crossed over the line to policy decisions. Here a high threshold should be required. I'm not sure what alternative wording to suggest though, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 05:14, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Much better... ==

I like this a lot better than the other proposal... for one thing, it's simpler. 

I made some changes to &quot;voting&quot;, my additions in italics:

* ''In the case of low-impact decisions,'' the option with the largest number of valid votes is the winner. 
* ''For high-impact decisions, votes and debates should be left open as long as progress towards reaching consensus is being made.''

The second line probably needs rewording: the point is that debate should be kept open on high-impact decisions so long as there is '''''constructive''''' debate. If there is deadlock and entrenched voting blocs, there's really not much point in debating further. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

:I've replaced &quot;largest number of&quot; with &quot;most&quot; in the interests of brevity, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:54, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

==User responses==

I have changed it to the text suggested on the voting procedures talk page. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 19:08, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

==Extending the rules for use in general disputes==

Here are some effective mnemonic (memory) techniques to help you remember vocabulary. They take some work, but you'll be rewarded with a fast-growing vocabulary.

There are some easy words and some hard words; there are some images which will stick in your head and help you remember, and others that seem ridiculous or just don't work for you. Take what works, and create your own images to help you remember words you come across. 

Remember that repetition also helps - keep a list and review it at increasing intervals until you've got the words memorized.

== Word association ==
Any kind of word association can help you in the early stages of remembering a word. The most effective associations are ones that are vivid, emotional, funny and/or shocking. 

''Note: this section is under construction, and formatting decisions haven't been finalised. Feel free to add your suggestions. If you don't understand the table formatting, just try your best; otherwise, add your suggestion below the table.''

''Note 2: * just for interest and education, where there is an actual connection in the history of the words, the word is marked with an asterix, *.  The connection with English is often via Sanskrit (Hindi words that entered English, like pundit) or Dutch (tea), or Chinese (ketchup).

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Words derived directly (or almost directly) from Indonesian or Malay:

Sometimes there is no exact association that comes to mind. If you're keen to use the technique, you might find an association that's rather distant or twisted, but close enough to help. (Though it might be just that thinking it over and trying to find an association helps you memorize the word, at least as much as the obscure association.)

==Similar words to English==
''Note: This section needs to be arranged in sections - perhaps topics and word types will be more useful than &quot;Words spelt the same as English&quot; and &quot;Nearly the same.&quot; It is suggested, however, that &quot;Less common words&quot; be kept separate, as an advanced vocabulary list.''

=== Words spelled the same as English ===
Remember, just because it's spelt the same, doesn't mean it's pronounced in exactly the same way. Indonesians pronounce things far more phonetically (pronouncing each letter in the standard way with few exceptions). If you use English pronunciation, people may or may not understand you, so it's far better to follow the rules of Indonesian pronunciation, according to how the word is spelt. 

Note also that although the words may look like English, they still follow Indonesian rules of pronunciation word order (blue radio = ''radio biru'') and construction (e.g. to carry on a dialogue = ''berdialog''). 

Common words:
* radio
* organ (as in internal organ)
* hotel
* menu
* gratis
* normal
* hanger (= ''clothes hanger'')
* AC (ah-seh) (air-conditioning)
* WC (weh-seh) (water closet)
* toilet (but WC is the most common term)
* CD, DVD (pr sidi, dividi - i.e. like the English but with short i sounds rather than ee sounds)
* Domain
* Internet (There is also &quot;dunia maya&quot; which is less known)

Less common words
* abnormal
* alias
* target
* formal
* regional (rare, but it's understood. Remember to pronounce phonetically, with a hard g.)

===Modern technology===
There are several abbreviations which are not pronounced in standard Indonesian form, but rather mimic English pronunciation: 
* TV (pronounced as tivi, i.e. almost the same as English)
* DVD (dividi)
* CD (sidi)
* GPS (jipies)

=== Nearly the same ===
* dosis (dose)
* dialog 
* musik (music)
* es (ice)
* es krim (ice cream)
* piyama (pajama)
* sama (same)
* nama (name)
* kartu (card)
* buku (book)
* bir (beer)
* truk (truck)
* bis (or more rarely, bus)
* taksi (taxi)
* telepon (telephone)
* nasional (national)
* internasional (international)
* dosin/lusin (dozen)
* aktif (active)
* dwi- (di-, i.e. prefix meaning ''two'')
* solusi (solution - to a problem)
* migrasi (migration(
* kasus (e.g. police or legal case)
* menit (minute)
* nomor (number)
* paspor (passport)
* kode pos (post code)
* gelas (glass)
* kampanye (campaign)
* transparan (transparent)
* fail (meaning file, pr file; also berkas)
* introspeksi diri (to be introspective; self-examination)
* manajemen (management)
* direksi (direction, actually direksi is referring to director in a company)
* strategis (strategic)
* riil (real)
* aktual (actual)	
* faktual (factual)
* fakta (fact)
* steril (sterile)
* drama 
* dramatik (dramatic) 
* dramatis (dramatic)
* stabil (stable)
* kultur (culture; more commonly //budaya//)
* kultural (cultural)

===Concrete nouns===
* tatu (tatoo - in either sense: a picture on the skin or a military music event)
* sponsor (advertisement; more commonly iklan) 
* artikel
* kios (kiosk)
* brosir (brochure)
* coklat (chocolate; also means brown)
* apel (apple)
* pir (pear)
* mangga (mango)
* manggis (mangosteen)
* sop (soup)
* gosip	
* pensil
* lampu

=== Music ===
* musik
* dram
* band
* grup
* pop
Note, major musical terms in English, such as jazz and rock, are widely recognized.

=== Uncertain ===
These words need to be confirmed before being added above - are these words commonly used in Indonesian?

* melodrama?

===The same word with slightly different meanings===
* Mister (term of address for white male, unofficial but very common)
* Blacksweet (pr. ''blekswit'', in imitation of English) - dark and attractive, used of an attractive dark-skinned woman. (The Indonesian term is hitam manis, but the literal translation &quot;black sweet&quot; is widely known.)

=== moderately common... ===
* tempo (time period)

=== Scientific &amp; academic terms ===
Note, major scientific &amp; academic terms are often very similar to English, including fields of study such as biology, geology. planet names (apart from bumi = earth). Remember that the pronunciation follows Indonesian rules - don't relax and think you know the word, and read the word as if it were English! 
* hortikultura (horticulture)
* planet
* desimal (decimal)

=== Less common words (advanced vocab)===
* sensus (census)
* kudeta (coup d'etat)
* otomotif 
* ambivalen (ambivalent)
* anarki (anarchy)
* sinonim
* antonim
* arsitektur (architecture)
* stasiun (station, as in train station)
* stroberi (strawberry)
* universitas 
* kampus
* akta (act, as in written legal document)

Many technical and philosophical words are also the same, or are formed in predictable ways. E.g. -ization becomes ''-isasi'', so globalization becomes ''globalisasi''.

===Closely related meanings===
* guru (teacher)
* mobil (car i.e. auto''mobile'')
* gubernur (governor c.f. ''gubernatorial'')
* apotek (pharmacy, c.f. ''apothecary''; farmasi is also used)

== Slightly similar ==
* archive (arsip)
* bishop (uskup)
* biru (blue)
== Guide to guessing ==
Try in your usual pronunciation of the English word, '''with an Indonesian accent''' as best you can, and see if it's recognized (then take note how //they// pronounce it). If that doesn't work, try pronouncing the word if read with Indonesian pronunciation rules. 

== Why do so many words sound the same? ==
''Just for your interest:''

You may be wondering why many words sound similar in Indonesian and English. Most or all of these words have come to Indonesian as loan-words from other languages, especially European languages, and most especially Dutch. (See [[w:Loan words in Indonesian|Loan words in Indonesian]] on Wikipedia) Realising the connection might sometimes makes it easier to remember the words. 

Words that appear to have similar origins (lacking confirmation - please supply references if possible)

For example:

'''Portuguese''': tenda

'''Sanskrit and Hindi''': Sanskrit is an Indo-European language and shares a common origin with Latin and most other European languages. There is an additional influence from Hindi on English due to the British colonization of India. E.g. The English word pundit derives from the Hindi word for a priest (and Sanskrit before that) and probably has a common origin with ''pendeta''. ''(reference needed)''

Menteri (government minister) derives from Sanskrit, and the Malay word menteri is in turn the origin of the Portuguese word &quot;Mandarim&quot; (aquele que manda = he who rules) 

&lt;!--minister might also be related to menteri, if minister in Latin (http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?minister) shares an Indo-European origin with the Sanskrit word that menteri is taken from. I'm being speculative though. --Singkong2005 --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rules==
Backgammon is a game of moderate complexity but with deep strategic elements.  It does not take long to learn to play, although obscure situations do arise which require careful interpretation of the rules.  Because the playing time for each individual '''game''' is short, it is often played in '''matches''', where, for example, victory is awarded to the player who first wins five points.

In short, a player tries to get all of his pieces past his opponent's pieces and then off the board. This is difficult because the pieces are scattered at first and may be blocked or captured by the opponent.

===Setup===
Each side of the board has a track of twelve adjacent spaces, called '''points''', usually represented by long triangles of alternating (but meaningless) color.  The tracks are imagined to be connected across the break in the middle and on just one edge of the board, making a continuous line (but not a circle) of twenty-four points.  The points are numbered from 1 to 24, with checkers always moving from higher-numbered points to lower-numbered points.  The two players move their checkers in opposite directions, so the 1-point for one player is noted as the 24-point for the other.  Some recorded games, however, keep the numbering of the points constant from the perspective of one player. Each player begins with two checkers on his 24-point, three checkers on his 8-point, and five checkers each on his 13-point and his 6-point.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;&gt;Robertie, Bill. ''Backgammon for Winners'', Third Edition. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;&gt;Keith, Tom. ''Backgammon Galore''. [http://bkgm.com/rules.html &quot;Backgammon Rules&quot;]. 2006. Retrieved on August 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Points 1 to 6, where the player must attempt to move his pieces, are called the '''home board''' or '''inner board'''.  A player may not bear off any checkers unless all of his checkers are in his home board.  Points 7 to 12 are called the '''outer board''', points thirteen to eighteen are the opponent's outer board, and points nineteen to twenty-four are the opponent's home board. The 7-point is often referred to as the '''bar point''' and the 13-point as the '''mid point'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;&gt;''Hoyle's Rules of Games'', Eighty-second printing. 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement===
At the start of the game, each player rolls one die.  Whoever rolls higher moves first, using the numbers on the already-rolled dice. In the case of a tie, the players roll again. The players then alternate turns, rolling two dice at the beginning of each turn after the first.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

After rolling the dice a player must, if possible, move checkers according to the number of points showing on each die.  For example, if he rolls a 6 and a 3 (noted as &quot;6-3&quot;) he must move one checker six points forward, and another one three points forward.  The dice may be played in either order.  The same checker may be moved twice as long as the two moves are distinct: six and then three, or three and then six, but not nine all at once.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

If a player has no legal moves after rolling the dice, because all of the points to which he might move are occupied by two or more enemy checkers, he forfeits his turn. However, a player must play both dice if it is possible.  If he has a legal move for one die only, he must make that move and then forfeit the use of the other die. If he has a legal move for either die, but not both, he must play the higher number.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

If a player rolls two of the same number ('''doubles''') he must play each die twice.  For example, upon rolling a 5-5 he must play four checkers forward five spaces each.  As before, a checker may be moved multiple times as long as the moves are distinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

A checker may land on any point occupied by no checkers or by friendly checkers.  Also it may land on a point occupied by exactly one enemy checker (a lone piece is called a '''blot''').  In the latter case the blot has been '''hit''', and is temporarily placed in the middle of the board on the '''bar''', that is, the divider between the home boards and the outer boards.  A checker may never land on a point occupied by two or more enemy checkers.  Thus, no point is ever occupied by checkers from both players at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

Checkers on the bar re-enter the game through the opponent's home field.  A roll of 2 allows the checker to enter on the 23-point, a roll of 3 on the 22-point, etc.  A player with one or more checkers on the bar may not move any other checkers until all of the checkers on the bar have re-entered the opponent's home field.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

When all of a player's checkers are in his home board, he must '''bear off''', removing the checkers from the board. A roll of 1 may be used to bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, etc.  A number may not be used to bear off checkers from a lower point unless there are no checkers on any higher points.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt; For example, a 4 may be used to bear off a checker from the 3-point only if there are no checkers on the 4-, 5-, or 6-point.

A checker borne off from a lower point than indicated on the die still counts as the full die. For instance, suppose a player has only one checker on his 2-point and two checkers on his 1-point.  Then on rolling 1-2 he may move the checker from the 2-point to the 1-point (using the 1 rolled), and then bear off from the 1-point (using the 2 rolled).  He is not required to maximize the use of his rolled 2 by bearing off from the 2-point.

If one player has not borne off any checkers by the time his opponent has borne off all fifteen, he has lost a '''gammon''', which counts for double a normal loss (i.e., two games toward the match in a game with normal stakes).  If a player has not borne off any checkers, and still has checkers on the bar, or in his opponent's home board by the time his opponent has borne off all fifteen, or both, he has lost a '''backgammon''', which counts for triple a normal loss (i.e., three games toward the match in a game with normal stakes).&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt; In some variants, a further distinction is made between pieces in the opponent's home board, counting as a triple loss, and pieces on the bar, for a quadruple loss.

===Doubling cube===
To speed up match play and to increase the intensity of play and the need for strategy, a '''doubling cube''' is usually used. A doubling cube is a 6 sided die that instead of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on it, has the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 on it. If a player believes his position to be superior he may, before rolling the dice on his turn, '''double''', i.e., demand that the game be played for twice the current stakes. The doubling cube is placed with the 2 side face up to show that the game's value has been doubled. His opponent must either accept the challenge or resign the game on the spot. Thereafter the right to '''redouble''' (double again) belongs exclusively to the player who last accepted a double. If this occurs, the cube is placed with the face of the next [[w:power of two|power of two]] showing.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

The game rarely is redoubled beyond four times the original stake, but there is no theoretical limit on the number of doubles. Even though 64 is the highest number depicted on the doubling cube, the stakes may rise to 128, 256, 512 and so on. 

A common rule allows '''beavers''', which is the right for a player to immediately redouble when offered the doubling cube while retaining the cube instead of giving it back up. The redouble must be called before the originally doubling player rolls the dice. In this way, the stakes of the game can rise dramatically.&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt; A '''raccoon''' is sometimes pemitted as a response to a beaver. A player who accepts a beaver may offer a raccoon, redoubling again. Beavers and raccoons are commonly allowed when backgammon is played for money game by game and usually not allowed in matches.

The '''Jacoby rule''' allows gammons and backgammons to count for their respective double and triple points only if there has been at least one use of the doubling cube in the game. This encourages a player with a large lead in a game to double, and thus likely end the game, rather than see the game out to its conclusion in hopes of a gammon or backgammon. The Jacoby Rule is widely used in money play but is not used in match play.&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt;

The '''Crawford rule''' makes match play much more equitable for the player in the lead. If a player is one point away from winning a match, his opponent has no reason ''not'' to double; after all, a win in the game by the player in the lead would cause him to win the match regardless of the doubled stakes, while a win by the opponent would benefit twice as much if the stakes are double. Thus there is no advantage towards winning the match to being one point shy of winning, if one's opponent is two points shy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt; To remedy this situation, the Crawford rule requires that when a player becomes one single point short of winning the match, neither player may use the doubling cube for a single game, called the '''Crawford game'''. As soon as the Crawford game is over, normal use of the doubling cube resumes.&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt; Not quite as universal as the Jacoby rule, the Crawford rule is widely used and generally assumed to be in effect for match play.

Sometimes '''automatic doubles''' are used, meaning that any re-rolls that players must make at the very start of a game (when each player rolls one die) have the side-effect of causing a double.  Thus, a 3-3 roll, followed by a re-roll of 5-5, followed by a re-roll of 1-4 that begins the game in earnest will cause the game to be played from the start with 4-times normal stakes. The doubling cube stays in the middle, with both players having access to it. The Jacoby Rule is still in effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;bkgm-rules&quot;/&gt; Again, automatic doubles are common in money games. but they are rarely, if ever, used in match play.

==Sample game==
[[image:bg_sg_w1.png|thumb|240px|right|Blue wins the opening roll with 4-1 and moves 13/9 6/5.]]
A few turns from the beginning of a sample game will illustrate the rules of movement. To start the game, blue rolls a 4 and green rolls a 1, so blue takes the first turn playing a 4-1. This is an unfavorable opening roll, arguably the worst possible, but blue uses it the best he can. He takes a checker from each of his ''heavy'' points by playing 13/9 6/5 (from the 13-point to the 9-point, and from the 6-point to the 5-point).

It is seldom useful to have five checkers on the same point, so blue starts to spread his checkers around.  He is threatening to build a ''prime'', that is, a blockade to prevent green's two trailing checkers from getting home.  The disadvantage of blue's choice is that it is not very safe.  It leaves two blots which green might hit.  Some experts prefer the less aggressive but safer move of 24/23 13/9.

[[image:bg_sg_b1.png|thumb|240px|left|Green rolls 4-4 and moves 1/5*/9* 19/23(2).]]
Green rolls a 4-4.  This is a fortunate roll.  Not only can he hit both of blue's blots with 1/5*/9* (from the 1-point to the 5-point, hitting blue, and from the 5-point to the 9-point, hitting blue again), he also has two more 4s to play.  He may, for example play 19/23(2), moving two checkers from his 6-point to the 2-point.  This leaves blue with two checkers on the bar, trying to re-enter against green's home board, which has two points blocked by green.

Green was wise to hit twice, because it disrupts blue's efforts to build a prime, and it puts blue considerably behind in the race.  Those two checkers must come all the way around the board before blue can begin to bear off.

In contrast, green's decision to make the 2-point was strategically dubious.  Though it may prevent blue from entering with both checkers, and there is some chance green will be able to build a strong home board before blue gets organized, increasing the chances of winning a gammon, the disadvantage is that green will now find it difficult to build a prime.  If blue manages to make an advanced ''anchor'', i.e., get two of his back checkers on green's 3-, 4-, or especially the 5- point, then green's blocking game is damaged.

Green would be in better shape had he played 12/16(2), keeping open the option to block or attack depending on blue's next roll, or taking the 4-point with 17/21(2). The latter more aggressive play has roughly a 3% better chance of winning a gammon, but loses almost 1% more often according to computer analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkgm.com/openings/r41-njgf-frame.html Article on replies to 13/9, 6/5] at Backgammon Galore&lt;/ref&gt; This is interesting as it highlights another aspect of backgammon strategy, the optimal move depends on the current standings: if green is one point from winning the match and in no need of a gammon, he should play safe with 12/16(2), otherwise green should try for the gammon and play the aggressive 17/21(2).

[[image:bg_sg_w2.png|thumb|240px|right|Blue rolls 5-2 and moves bar/20.]]
The game continues and blue rolls 5-2.  The only legal move is bar/20.  The two cannot be played from the bar because green owns his 2-point, and until blue has played all his checkers off the bar, he cannot play anywhere else.  Therefore the 2 is forfeited and blue's turn is over.

Green got what he wanted, in that blue was not able to enter both checkers, but the fight is far from over.  Green must hit the blot on his next roll, or else blue has a 50% chance to cover his blot and take a fairly strong position.  Even if green does hit, blue has many rolls to hit back.  A war for green's 5-point will shape the character of the game in the near future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first moves of a backgammon game are the '''opening moves''', collectively referred to as the opening, and studied in the '''backgammon opening theory'''. Compared to the widely studied [[w:Chess opening|opening theory in chess]], the backgammon opening theory is not developed in as much detail. The reason for this is that following the first move, there are 21 dice roll outcomes per subsequent move, combined with many alternative plays for each outcome, making the [[w:Game tree|tree of possible positions]] in backgammon expand much more rapidly than in chess.

Despite the complications posed by this rapid branching of possibilities, over the course of many years, a consensus did develop amongst backgammon experts on what is the preferred opening move for each given roll. Following the emergence of [[w:Reinforcement learning|self-trained]] backgammon-playing [[w:Artificial neural network|neural networks]], the insights on what are the best opening moves have changed in some unexpected ways. 

==Preferred opening moves==
The table below summarises the most commonly preferred moves, for each of the 15 possible opening rolls, as selected by detailed computer simulations, referred to as &quot;rollouts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+179 Kit Woolsey on Backgammon Galore]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+649 Chuck Bower on backgammon Galore]&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are no opening moves consisting of doubles, because at the start of the game, each player rolls one die. Whoever rolls higher moves first, using the numbers on the already-rolled dice. In the case of a tie, the players roll again.
In cases where no preferred play but only two or more alternative plays are given, these appear to be of equivalent strength within the statistical uncertainties of the simulations and no play could be singled out that is clearly superior.

The moves are captured in standard backgammon notation. For instance, 8/5 denotes the move of a piece from the 8-point to the 5-point. 

{|class=wikitable

|-
|2-1|| &amp;mdash; || 13/11-24/23 || 13/11-6/5|| &amp;mdash;

|-

|-
|4-3|| &amp;mdash; ||13/10-13/9 || 13/10-24/20 || 13/9-24/21 
|-
|5-3|| 8/3-6/3 || &amp;mdash;|| &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash; 
|-
|6-3|| 24/18-13/10 || 24/15|| &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash; 
|-
|5-4|| 13/8-24/20 || 13/8-13/9 || &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash; 
|-
|6-4|| &amp;mdash; || 8/2-6/2 || 24/14 || 24/18-13/9
|-
|6-5|| 24/13 || &amp;mdash;|| &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash; 
|}

The general message that emerges from the above table can be summarised as follows: unless one can make a point, and with the exception of the running move 24/13 (the ''lover's leap''), a successful play is the combination of splitting the 24-point and moving a checker from the 13-point. The latter move should be as small as possible (resulting in a builder close to the 13-point), unless the stack at the 8-point can be reached (resulting in a balancing of the distribution between the 13-point and the 8-point).

The above opening moves which emerged from computer analysis demonstrate that a number of opening moves that were unquestioned for many decades are now considered suboptimal. One example is the move 13/11-13/8 on the roll 5-2. Although not a bad move, the alternative choice preferred by the analyses, 24/22-13/8, is now generally agreed upon to be optimal. In other cases, computer analysis has resulted in alternative strategies that were not seriously considered in the past. For instance, the opening move 8/2-6/2 for a roll of 6-4 was in the past greeted with disdain from experts, but turns out to be on average as effective as the usual plays (24/14 and 24/18-13/9).

==Influencing factors==
The consensus on opening moves is generally extended only to money play, meaning that these plays optimise the expected payout. However, a context different from money play can influence the choice of opening move and may very well tip the balance towards a play that is seen to be slightly inferior. Towards the end of a match play, one such important factor can be the state of the match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+682 Kit Woolsey: Factors to consider in opening moves]&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, an even more important influencing factor is the preferred style of the player. A player might have a strong preference for one out of a number of alternative opening plays that are on average as effective, because the character of the move (passive or aggressive) better suits his or her playing style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls/ Opening rolls on Backgammon.org (1)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls-2/ Opening rolls on Backgammon.org (2)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls-3/ Opening rolls on Backgammon.org (3)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls-4/ Opening rolls on Backgammon.org (4)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old Backgammon Vasa.jpg|thumb|200px|Brädspel, a Swedish Backgammon variant, this board being recovered from the Regalskeppet Vasa, sunk in 1628]]
Backgammon is one of the oldest board games played today, and can be most clearly traced to the ancient game [[w:tabula|tabula]], which appears in an epigram of Byzantine Emperor Zeno (AD 476–481).&lt;ref name=&quot;austin-zeno&quot;&gt;Austin, Roland G. &quot;Zeno's Game of τάβλη&quot;, ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 54:2, 1934. pp 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ancient Egyptians played a game called [[w:senet|senet]], which resembled backgammon,&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, William C. &quot;Egyptian Tomb Reliefs of the Old Kingdom&quot;, ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series 4:7. March 1946. pp 170-178.&lt;/ref&gt; with moves controlled by the roll of dice.  The [[w:Royal Game of Ur|Royal Game of Ur]], played in ancient Mesopotamia, is a more likely ancestor of modern tables games. Recent excavations at the &quot;[[w:Shahr-i Sokhta|Burnt City]]&quot; in Iran showed that a similar game existed there around 3000 BC. The artifacts include two dice and 60 pieces, and the set is believed to be 100 to 200 years older than the sets found in Ur.&lt;ref name=&quot;persian-journal&quot;&gt; [http://www.iranian.ws/cgi-bin/iran_news/exec/view.cgi/2/4743 &quot;Iran's Burnt City Throws up World’s Oldest Backgammon.&quot;] ''Persian Journal.'' December 4, 2004. Retrieved on August 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ancient Romans played a number of games with remarkable similarities to backgammon. ''[[w:Ludus duodecim scriptorum|Ludus duodecim scriptorum]]'' (&quot;game of twelve lines&quot;) used a board with three rows of 12 points each, and the pieces were moved across all three rows according to the roll of dice. Not much specific text about the gameplay has survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;austin-roman1&quot;&gt;Austin, Roland G. &quot;Roman Board Games. I&quot;, ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 4:10, October 1934. pp. 24-34.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[w:Tabula|Tabula]]'', meaning &quot;table&quot; or &quot;board&quot;, was similar to modern backgammon in that a board with 24 points was used, and the object of the game was to be the first to bear off all of one's checkers. Three dice were used instead of two, and opposing checkers moved in opposite directions.&lt;ref name=&quot;austin-zeno&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;austin-roman2&quot;&gt;Austin, Roland G. &quot;Roman Board Games. II&quot;, ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 4:11, February 1935. pp 76-82.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 11th century ''[[w:Shahnameh|Shahnameh]]'', the Persian poet Ferdowsi credits Burzoe with the invention of [[w:Nard (game)|nard]] in the 6th century. He describes an encounter between Burzoe and a Raja visiting from India. The Raja introduces the game of chess, and Burzoe demonstrates nard, played with dice made from ivory and teak.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilkinson&quot;&gt;Wilkinson, Charles K. &quot;Chessmen and Chess&quot;, ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin''. New Series 1:9, May 1943. pp. 271-279&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''jeux de tables'', predecessors of modern backgammon, first appeared in France during the 11th century and became a frequent pastime for gamblers. In 1254, Louis IX of France issued a decree prohibiting his court officials and subjects from playing the games.&lt;ref name=&quot;lillich&quot;&gt;Lillich, Meredith Parsons. &quot;The Tric-Trac Window of Le Mans&quot;, ''The Art Bulletin'' 65:1, March 1983. pp. 23-33.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is mostly known for its extensive discussion of chess, the Alfonso X manuscript ''[[w:Libro de los juegos|Libro de los juegos]]'', completed in 1283, describes rules for a number of dice and tables games.&lt;ref name=&quot;wollesen&quot;&gt;Wollesen, Jens T. &quot;Sub specie ludi...: Text and Images in Alfonso El Sabio's Libro de Acedrex, Dados e Tablas&quot;, ''Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte'' 53:3, 1990. pp. 277-308.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, tables games had spread to Sweden. A wooden board and checkers were recovered from the wreck of the Regalskeppet Vasa among the belongings of the ship's officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;vasa-museum&quot;&gt;[http://www.vasamuseet.se/Vasamuseet/Om/Vasamuseets%20vanner/Bradspelsvanner.aspx?lang=en &quot;Vasamuseet &amp;mdash; The Swedish-Tables Association&quot;], ''The Vasa Museum''. Retrieved on August 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edmund Hoyle published ''A Short Treatise on the Game of Backgammon'' in 1743; this book described the rules of the game and was bound together with a similar text on [[w:whist|whist]].&lt;ref&gt;Allee, Sheila. [http://www.utexas.edu/supportut/news_pub/yg_foreedge.html &quot;A Foregone Conclusion: Fore-Edge Books Are Unique Additions to Ransom Collection&quot;]. Retrieved on August 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The game described by Hoyle is, in most respects, the same as the game played today.

In English, the word &quot;backgammon&quot; is most likely derived from &quot;back&quot; and Middle English &quot;''gamen''&quot;, meaning &quot;game&quot; or &quot;play&quot;. The earliest use documented by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1650.&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;&quot;backgammon&quot;, [http://dictionary.oed.com ''The Oxford English Dictionary''].

Wikibooks users should look for consensus rather than stay on their own positions. However, there are situations where &quot;majority wins&quot; voting is the best solution, like [[Wikibooks:Book of the month|Book of the month]] and [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]] awards, or where consensus cannot be achieved or where it needs to be shown clearly that most people supported a particular proposal.

== Terms ==
''Vote'' is the action of discussing a topic, casting opinions, and reaching consensus. Votes are not performed by anonymous ballots, and every vote or comment should be accompanied by the username of the person casting the vote. The easiest way to do this is by following every comment that you write with &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

''Proposal'' means subject of the vote here. Whether it is request for adminship, vote for deleting a book or making it book of the month or attempt to make proposed policy enforced, all these cases will be called just ''proposal''.

== Who has right to vote? ==

All registered wikibooks users have the right to vote, although users that are suspected of voting in bad faith will have their votes removed. Wikibooks operates on a &quot;one vote per person&quot; rule, not &quot;one vote per username&quot;. This means that if you maintain multiple usernames, you may only cast a meaningful vote with one of them. Sockpuppets will not be allowed for use in voting.

While new users are encouraged to get involved with discussions and helping to plan future directions for this project, it is considered bad form to make your one and only editorial contribution to Wikibooks involving casting votes on opinion pages.  If you are new to Wikibooks, try to read up on the issues involved and help participate in writing content first, to get a sense of understanding about this project.  Regular active contributors will be more highly regarded on their opinions anyway.

Users must be signed in to cast a vote, and anonoymous votes will not be counted. Every vote should be appropriately signed, or else an {{tl|unsigned}} template can be used to identify the voter.

== What does consensus mean? ==

'''Consensus''' is the requirement to have general acceptance from the community. As wikibooks is not a democracy, we do not define &quot;consensus&quot; to be a particular percentage of the vote. However, we do not require that a particular vote obtain complete agreement from all parties involved. If dissenting issues are presented, an effort should be made to compromise.

Consensus also cannot be declared prematurely. A vote should be allowed to remain for at least 2 weeks from the time of the last comment, before the final outcome is decided upon. This will allow time for all users to have a say on the proposal.

== How to prepare vote? ==

It should be made clear what is the subject of the vote and what are consequences of the vote. The proposal should not be altered during voting (except spelling/grammar/formatting corrections). If the meaning of the proposal has changed after any users have voted, the vote should be cancelled or started from the beginning. Users casting votes after a vote has been cancelled or restarted should be notified of the changes and encouraged to cast another vote.

It is a good habit to notify other users about the vote, for example in [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]] or [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]. This does not apply for subjects specific to a single book. In such cases that apply to only a single book, the notification can occur on the main page of the book, or on the talk pages of the book. Some changes, such as those changes that only affect a single book or a single bookshelf might not require a vote, and wikibookians are encouraged to '''be bold''' when making contributions that will have a positive effect. If a bold action results in a problem or dissention, a vote can then be held to finalize the issue.

== Vote results ==
The voting process should be long enough to reach a concensus, and to hear opinions from any interested wikibookians. There is no set time limit to a vote, and it can persist, undecided, until a consensus is reached. Votes that have reached consensus must be allowed to sit for at least 1 week from the time of the last vote, to ensure that no additional votes or opinions are voiced. When a vote is reaching a close, it is a good idea to announce the close of the vote in a public forum, such as [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]], or [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]].

Once a consensus has been reached and maintained for at least 1 week or more, the vote can be declared over, and the final result announced. The debate and voting text may be archived immediately. If the vote is on a matter of policy, the new policy takes effect immediately after the vote has been decided.

== Additional rules ==
This policy does not cover all possibilities, but gives general, basic rules. Everyone can start a vote with more rules and restrictions, provided that they do not violate this policy. Some common occurances, such as [[WB:BOTM|Book of the Month]], or [[WB:COTM|Collaboration of the month]] votes have their own voting rules, and votes are calculated numerically, not by concensus.</text>

== Voting on Wikibooks ==

Currently, voting takes place on Wikibooks in different circumstances. Some general principles apply in all circumstances, and in addition the separate circumstances each have specific principles relevant only to them. This policy first discusses the general principles, and then goes on to outline the circumstance-specific principles. The circumstances in which voting is used are as follows:

;Circumstance A - books of the month/quarter

#To determine the following month's [[WB:BOTM|book of the month]]
#To determine the following month's [[WB:COTM|collaboration of the month]]
#To determine the following quarter's [[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:New Book of the Quarter|Wikijunior book of the quarter]]

;Circumstance B - to give additional user rights

#To agree to make a Wikibookian an [[WB:RFA|administrator]]
#To agree to make a Wikibookian a [[WB:RFA|bureaucrat]]
#To agree to give a Wikibookian [[WB:RFA|checkuser rights]]

;Circumstance C - as an aid to discussions

#On decisions as to whether a page should be [[WB:VFD|deleted]]
#On an ''ad hoc'' basis, where it is considered that a vote might be a useful aid to discussion

;Circumstance D - to help affirm policy
Policy is generally derived from community consensus. Sometimes a vote is used to affirm consensus.

== General principles ==

=== What we mean by &quot;vote&quot; ===

On Wikibooks, by ''vote'' we mean the action of discussing a topic, casting opinions and reaching a consensus. So a ''vote'' is not just a ''yes'' or a ''no'', but also any comments and discussions a user makes during the voting process.

=== What consensus means ===

'''Consensus''' is the requirement to have general acceptance from the community. In the case of elections voting on Wikibooks is vaguely according to the principles of a democratic organisation, however, unlike a democracy that appoints representatives to decide issues, editorial issues require the involvement of the editors. In the case of resolving disputes voting is a measure of opinion and unrelated to concepts such as democracy, we do not define &quot;consensus&quot; to be a particular percentage of the vote. However, we do not require that a particular vote obtain complete agreement from all parties involved. If dissenting issues are presented, an effort should be made to compromise, if dissenters are unable to accept the compromises then, eventually, a majority decision may be required.

Consensus also cannot be declared prematurely. If someone objects to a decision alleged to be made by consensus shortly after it has been announced, it is likely that the original claim that there was consensus was wrong. The most important point is that wikibookians should work together and compromise to make decisions, and to make wikibooks a better place.

=== The right to vote ===

All registered wikibooks users who have made at least 20 ''bona fide'' edits have the right to vote, although users that are suspected of voting in bad faith are liable to having their votes crossed out and ignored or removed. There is one exception to the rule that at least 20 ''bona fide'' edits have been made, and that is with regards to new modules and books, where the creators and other editors of that module or book may argue their case.

Wikibooks operates on a &quot;one vote per person&quot; rule, not &quot;one vote per username&quot;. This means that if you maintain multiple usernames, you may only cast a meaningful vote with one of them. Sockpuppets and bots will not be allowed for use in voting.

While new users are encouraged to get involved with discussions and helping to plan future directions for this project, it is considered bad form to make your only editorial contribution to Wikibooks involving casting votes on opinion pages. If you are new to Wikibooks, try to read up on the issues involved and help participate in writing content first, to get a sense of understanding about this project.  Regular active contributors will be more highly regarded on their opinions anyway.

=== How to make a vote ===

When voting, you must be signed in. Every vote should be appropriately signed. The easiest way to do this is by following every comment that you write with &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Anonymous votes will not be counted. An {{tl|unsigned}} template may be used to identify the voter.

=== Setting out what a vote is for ===

It should be made clear from the start what the subject of the vote is and what the consequences of the vote are. The terms under which the voting process will be considered complete (eg after a specified period of time or at the later of a specified time and a minimum number of votes cast). You should aim to get consensus for this before allowing the vote to start.

The proposal should not be altered during voting (except spelling/grammar/formatting corrections). If the meaning of the proposal has changed after any users have voted, the vote should be cancelled or started from the beginning. Users who cast votes in a vote that gets cancelled and then restarted should be notified of the changes and encouraged to cast another vote.

Except when in circumstance A, it is a good habit to notify other users about the vote, for example in [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]] or [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]. It is also best practice that if the vote affects a particular book to make a reference to it on the talk page of the title page of the book. It is also good practice to inform any Wikibookians who you know are likely to be particularly interested in the vote on their user talk page.

=== Announcing the results of the vote ===

Once a vote has ended, any Wikibookian can formally announce the result, except in Circumstance B, where only a bureaucrat or steward, as appropriate, can announce the result. If the rules outlined elsewhere in the policy have been followed, the declaration of the result should be non-controversial.

== Rules relating only to specific circumstances ==

=== Circumstance A - books of the month ===

The specific rules for circumstance A are as set out at the top of the respective voting pages.

=== Circumstance B - to give additional user rights ===

A significant level of support needs to be gained for a user to gain additional user rights. As a general guide, recent history has seen users promoted to administrator status with 6 to 1 and 8 to 2 support or greater. A bureaucrat nomination requires greater support than that to succeed. Whether there is sufficient support for a checkuser nomination to succeed is determined by a Wikimedia steward, and the determining criteria are not within Wikibooks' power to change.

=== Circumstance C - as an aid to discussion ===

Sometimes votes are used as a discussion aid. The determinant of the vote is based on the weight of the arguments as measured by the effect of the discussion on the voters. For example, [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] is really a discussion on whether or not a module or book is consistent with Wikibooks' inclusion criteria. Although people will summarise their views as ''keep'' or ''delete'', the factor deciding the discussion is whether it is shown that the module or book meets the inclusion criteria or not. In discussions the vote reflects, to some extent, the way that the discussion has persuaded the voters.

=== Circumstance D - to help affirm policy ===

Policy (broadly any overarching principle to be applied either throughout Wikibooks or throughout a particular Wikibook) is decided by consensus.

No vote should be started until all issues and concerns raised by Wikibookians in good faith have been addressed. That does not mean agreement necessarily has to be reached, but it does mean that all pertinent questions should be answered, even if they do not yield answers the questioner is happy with.

A vote may either be used to affirm consensus, or alternatively to overrule dissenters. The latter case should only be used with reluctance - unless the proposers and dissenters accept in advance that they will accept that a vote will resolve the dispute. If possible, some accommodation should be made with dissenters so that the policy proposal is acceptable to everyone, even if a vote has already started.

The aim of the process is to reach a consensus, and the process should therefore not end whilst there is substantive ongoing discussions about the matter in hand. It may be that discussions develop in such a way that it is clear there is consensus and the vote is just a formality. Where it appears that consensus has been reached, say so, but allow the discussion to remain open for at least one week to allow any additional votes or opinions are voiced. It is, however, considered bad form for someone fully aware of the discussion to remain silent about their concerns and then try to block the proposal at the last minute.

When a vote is reaching a close, it is a good idea to announce the impending closure of the vote in a public forum, such as [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] or [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]].

If the vote is on a matter of policy, the new policy takes effect immediately after the vote has been decided.</text>

In the case of resolving disputes voting is a measure of opinion and unrelated to concepts such as democracy, we do not define &quot;consensus&quot; to be a particular percentage of the vote. However, we do not require that a particular vote obtain complete agreement from all parties involved. If dissenting issues are presented, an effort should be made to compromise, if dissenters are unable to accept the compromises then, eventually, a majority decision may be required. If a vote has been called or advertised three times over a period of six months or more and the voting process or result has been blocked or rejected by the same individual or minority on each occasion then, on the fourth cycle, a vote may be taken and implemented on a majority basis.

Consensus also cannot be declared prematurely. If someone objects to a decision alleged to be made by consensus shortly after it has been announced, it is likely that the original claim that there was consensus was wrong. The most important point is that wikibookians should work together and compromise to make decisions, and to make wikibooks a better place. However, it is important that individual Wikibookians with strong views should be prepared to compromise and allow decisions where many others disagree with their views. It should not be necessary to use the six month rule routinely.

=== The right to vote ===

All registered wikibooks users who have made at least 20 ''bona fide'' edits have the right to vote, although users that are suspected of voting in bad faith are liable to having their votes crossed out and ignored or removed. There is one exception to the rule that at least 20 ''bona fide'' edits have been made, and that is with regards to new modules and books, where the creators and other editors of that module or book may argue their case.

== Low impact decisions ==
'''Low-impact decisions''' involve proposals that express the community's preferences and feelings about issues that fall well below the level of policy, and do not affect the long term culture or structure of Wikibooks. For these sorts of decisions, a simply majority vote may be used for convenience and clarity. Low impact decisions are those which will not affect the long term culture or policies of Wikibooks. 

Examples of low impact decisions where majority rules voting would be acceptable are:

#Determining the following month's [[WB:BOTM|book of the month]]
#Determining the following month's [[WB:COTM|collaboration of the month]]
#Determining the following quarter's [[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:New Book of the Quarter|Wikijunior book of the quarter]]
#Resolving disputes where parties agree to use voting as a method of gauging opinion or taking decisions.

== High impact decisions ==

'''High-impact decisions''' involve the adoption or repeal of policies and guidelines that have a long term effect on the culture and structure of Wikibooks. These decisions should always be made through the process of building a community consensus. Such decisions include:

#Making a Wikibookian an [[WB:RFA|administrator]]
#Making a Wikibookian a [[WB:RFA|bureaucrat]]
#Giving a Wikibookian [[WB:RFA|checkuser rights]]
#Determining whether a page should be [[WB:VFD|deleted]]
#Creating or modifying Wikibooks policies

== Voting ==
When voting is deemed acceptable, the vote should follow these guidelines:
* Each person gets only one vote; additional votes by sockpuppets or alternate accounts should not be counted
* Only votes cast by registered users with 20 or more edits should be counted
* Votes cast in bad faith should not be counted
* Each vote should be signed (using four tildes: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;)
* The start and end period of the vote should be included with the description of the vote, and the period of the vote should be long enough to allow wide user participation
* The vote should be publicised in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] and on the [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]]
* In the case of low-impact decisions, the option with the most valid votes is adopted. 
* For high-impact decisions, votes and debates should be left open as long as progress towards reaching consensus is being made.

== Community consensus ==

&quot;Community consensus&quot; is a state of existence arrived at by following a formal ''consensus decision making process''. Ultimately the state of &quot;community consensus&quot; involves the vast majority of users agreeing on some decision.

=== Process ===

# A proposal is made, and discussion about the proposal is invited.
# The proposal is discussed, and initial concerns are raised. 
# The proposal may be modified to address these initial concerns and resubmitted for discussion.
# A call for consensus regarding the proposal is made, possibly in the form of a [[w:Straw poll|straw poll]].
# If there are no objections, the proposal is accepted and affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; has been reached on the proposal.
# If there are still objections, the objections should be discussed and:
#* The proposal may be dropped. Affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; for the proposal was not reached. 
#* The proposal may be modified to address these objections and resubmitted for discussion.
#* A call for consensus regarding the proposal is made again, in spite of the objections. This action should not be taken lightly and should only occur after substantive good faith discussion of the proposal and objections has taken place. The community can:
#** Accept the proposal in spite of objections, and affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; has been reached.
#** Not accept the proposal as &quot;community consensus&quot; has not been reached.

==== User responses ====

Users who do not agree with the community decison should accept the decision and, if they feel strongly, have one of the following options open to them:
* Propose alternative policies.
* Propose alterations to existing policies.
* Accept the community's decision.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nepal Bhasa (नेपाल भाषा, Nēpāl bhāṣā, also known as Newāh Bhāy) is one of the major languages of Nepal. It was Nepal's administrative and day-to-day language from the 14th to the late 18th centuries. Nepal Bhasa is spoken today as a mother tongue by the Newars, the indigenous inhabitants of Nepal Mandala, which consists of the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding regions.
Outside Nepal, Nepal Bhasa is also spoken in India, particularly in Sikkim where it is one of the 11 official languages.
==The name==

The earliest occurrences of the name Nepal Bhasa can be found in the manuscripts ''Narad Sanhita'', dated 1380 AD, and ''Amarkosh'', dated 1389 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. ISBN 99933-56-00-X. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpmalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Classical-Newari-Literature.pdf|title=Classical Newari Literature|publisher= |accessdate=28 December 2011|date=}} Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the name has been used widely on inscriptions, manuscripts, documents and books.

In the 1920s, the name of the language known as Khaskura, Gorkhali or Parbatiya&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hodgson| first =B. H.| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.archive.org/stream/illustrationsofl00hodg/illustrationsofl00hodg_djvu.txt| title =Illustrations of the literature and religion of the Buddhists| work = | publisher =Serampore| year=1841| accessdate = 16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was changed to [[Nepali language|Nepali]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lienhard, Siegfried 1992 Page 3&quot;&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. ISBN 81-208-0963-7. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and Nepal Bhasa began to be officially referred to as Newari while the Newars continued using the original term. Similarly, the term Gorkhali in the former [[national anthem]] entitled &quot;Shreeman Gambhir&quot; was changed to Nepali in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=The kings song|url=http://www.himalmag.com/component/content/article/4214-.html|accessdate=15 June 2012|newspaper=Himal Southasian|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 1995, following years of lobbying to use the standard name, the then His Majesty's Government decided that the name Nepal Bhasa should be used instead of Newari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=It's Nepal Bhasa|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=9 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decision was not implemented, and on 13 November 1998, the Minister of Information and Communication directed all public mass media to use the name Nepal Bhasa instead of Newari language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Mass media directed to use Nepal Bhasa|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=14 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Geographic distribution==
Nepal Bhasa is spoken by over a million people in Nepal according to the 2001 census. 
* In Nepal: Kathmandu Valley ([[Kathmandu Metropolitan City]], [[Patan, Lalitpur|Lalitpur]] Sub-Metropolitan City, [[Bhaktapur]] Municipality, [[Kirtipur]] Municipality, [[Madhyapur Thimi]] Municipality), Dolakha, [[Banepa]], [[Dhulikhel]], Bhimphedi (Makwanpur), [[Panauti]], Palpa, Trishuli, Nuwakot, Bhojpur, [[Biratnagar]], [[Baglung]], [[Bandipur]], [[Birgunj]], [[Hetauda]] and other chief cities.
* In India: [[Sikkim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=Ritual and Identity in the Diaspora: The Newars in Sikkim|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/bot/pdf/bot_2005_01_03.pdf|accessdate=21 March 2011|newspaper=Bulletin of Tibetology|publisher= |year=2005}} Page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[West Bengal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=new Ethnologue entry]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Tibet: [[Zhangmu|Khasa]]

With an increase in emigration, various bodies and societies of Nepal Bhasa-speaking people have emerged in countries like the US, the UK, Australia and Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==

Diarrhea—loose, watery stools occurring more than three times in one day—is a common problem that usually lasts a day or two and goes away on its own without any special treatment. However, prolonged diarrhea can be a sign of other problems. People with diarrhea may pass more than a quart of stool a day.

Diarrhea can cause dehydration, which means the body lacks enough fluid to function properly. Dehydration is particularly dangerous in children and the elderly, and it must be treated promptly to avoid serious health problems. (See &quot;What is dehydration?&quot;)

People of all ages can get diarrhea. The average adult has a bout of diarrhea about four times a year.

== Causes ==

Diarrhea may be caused by a temporary problem, like an infection, or a chronic problem, like an intestinal disease. A few of the more common causes of diarrhea are

Bacterial infections. Several types of bacteria, consumed through contaminated food or water, can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli.

Viral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis.

Food intolerances. Some people are unable to digest some component of food, such as lactose, the sugar found in milk.

Parasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.

Reaction to medicines, such as antibiotics, blood pressure medications, and antacids containing magnesium.

Intestinal diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease.

Functional bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, in which the intestines do not work normally.

Some people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery or removal of the gallbladder. The reason may be a change in how quickly food moves through the digestive system after stomach surgery or an increase in bile in the colon that can occur after gallbladder surgery.

In many cases, the cause of diarrhea cannot be found. As long as diarrhea goes away on its own, an extensive search for the cause is not usually necessary.

People who visit foreign countries are at risk for traveler's diarrhea, which is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or, sometimes, parasites. Traveler's diarrhea is a particular problem for people visiting developing countries. Visitors to the United States, Canada, most European countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand do not face much risk for traveler's diarrhea. 

== Diagnosis ==

Diarrhea may be accompanied by cramping abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or an urgent need to use the bathroom. Depending on the cause, a person may have a fever or bloody stools.

Diarrhea can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). The acute form, which lasts less than 4 weeks, is usually related to a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection. Chronic diarrhea lasts more than 4 weeks and is usually related to functional disorders like irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel diseases like celiac disease.

== Treatment ==

In most cases, replacing lost fluid to prevent dehydration is the only treatment necessary.  Medicines that stop diarrhea may be helpful in some cases, but they are not recommended for people whose diarrhea is caused by a bacterial infection or parasite—stopping the diarrhea traps the organism in the intestines, prolonging the problem. Instead, doctors usually prescribe antibiotics. Viral causes are either treated with medication or left to run their course, depending on the severity and type of the virus. 

===Preventing Dehydration===

Dehydration occurs when the body has lost too much fluid and electrolytes (the salts potassium and sodium). The fluid and electrolytes lost during diarrhea need to be replaced promptly—the body cannot function properly without them. Dehydration is particularly dangerous for children, who can die from it within a matter of days. 

Although water is extremely important in preventing dehydration, it does not contain electrolytes. To maintain electrolyte levels, you could have broth or soups, which contain sodium, and fruit juices, soft fruits, or vegetables, which contain potassium. 

For children, doctors often recommend a special rehydration solution that contains the nutrients they need. You can buy this solution in the grocery store without a prescription. Examples include Pedialyte, Ceralyte, and Infalyte.

===Tips About Food===

Until diarrhea subsides, try to avoid milk products and foods that are greasy, high-fiber, or very sweet. These foods tend to aggravate diarrhea. 

As you improve, you can add soft, bland foods to your diet, including bananas, plain rice, boiled potatoes, toast, crackers, cooked carrots, and baked chicken without the skin or fat. For children, the pediatrician may recommend what is called the BRAT diet: bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==

'''Dehydration''' means your body does not have as much water and fluids as it should. This can be caused by losing too much fluid, not drinking enough water or fluids, or both. Vomiting and diarrhea are common causes.

Infants and children are more susceptible to dehydration than adults because of their smaller body weights and higher turnover of water and electrolytes. The elderly and those with illnesses are also at higher risk.

Dehydration is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on how much of the body's fluid is lost or not replenished. When severe, dehydration is a life-threatening emergency.


== Symptoms ==

*Dry or sticky mouth. 
*Low or no urine output; concentrated urine appears dark yellow. 
*Not producing tears. 
*Sunken eyes. 
*Markedly sunken fontanelles (the soft spot on the top of the head) in an infant. 
*Lethargic or comatose (with severe dehydration). 
*In addition to the symptoms of actual dehydration, you may also have: 
**vomiting 
**diarrhea 
**the feeling that you &quot;can't keep anything down&quot;

== Treatment ==

*Drinking fluids is usually sufficient for mild dehydration. It is better to have frequent, small amounts of fluid (using a teaspoon or syringe for an infant or child) rather than trying to force large amounts of fluid at one time. Drinking too much fluid at once can bring on more vomiting.

*Electrolyte solutions or freezer pops are especially effective. These are available at pharmacies. Sport drinks contain a lot of sugar and can cause or worsen diarrhea. In infants and children, avoid using water as the primary replacement fluid.

*Intravenous fluids and hospitalization may be necessary for moderate to severe dehydration. The doctor will try to identify and then treat the cause of the dehydration.
Treatment includes starting NS@20ml/kg slow push until signs of severe dehydration disappear. Avoid Ringer Lactate till patient passes urine. Maintenance fluid depends on body weight. Either DNS or RL  may be used
10kg and less      100ml/Kg
10-20 kg           1000mL+50ml/kg
20+ Kg             1500ml+ 20 ml/kg
It may be advisable to give half the calculated fluid in the first 8 hours and the remaining over the next 16 hours
*Precautions
check for pulmonary oedema
replenish Potassium as required
Chills may occur due to fluid administration rule out infectious causes

*Most cases of stomach viruses (also called viral gastroenteritis) tend to resolve on their own after a few days.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chromaticism refers to the use of pitches, chords, and keys not associated with diatonic collections.  The etymology of the word chromatic, which refers to colour, gives us a clue as to its function is in nineteenth-century music: it provides inflections to diatonic harmonies.

'''Pitch'''

A chromatic pitch is any note not contained within a given diatonic collection.  For example, in C major, C-sharp, D-flat, D-sharp, E-flat, F-sharp, G-flat, G-sharp, A-flat, A-sharp and B-flat all represent chromatic pitches.  For a chromatic pitch to function 'chromatically', however, it must resolve in a logical way to a diatonic pitch, otherwise the overload of 'colour' undermines the integrity of the key and begins to suggest a modulation to a different key or a non-diatonic modality. As a general rule, chromatically raised tones resolve upward while chromatically lowered ones resolve downward. Hence, chromatically introduced A# usually goes to B while Eb would have to go to D.

'''Chords'''

In nineteenth-century music there can be no pitches without chords, which more fully suggest harmony.  In C major, chromatic chords include all those outside the diatonic framework, including C minor, C-sharp major and minor, D major, E-flat major and minor, E major, F minor, F-sharp major and minor, G minor, A-flat major and minor, A major, B-flat major and minor, and B major and minor.  The way these chords are used in nineteenth-century music is not arbitrary and each chord has its own specific quality and compositional implications.  Most obviously the level of diatonicism, or its displacement around the cycle of fifths, of a chromatic chord makes it sound more or less nearly-related to the tonic (that is within diatonicism, although other theories exist, notably certain neo-Riemannian theories).

'''Keys'''

Finally, keys, which may provide large-scale harmonic structure in nineteenth-century music, may also be chromatic.  Given that gamut of keys for most music of the eighteenth century is diatonic - most often creating a tension between tonic and dominant (Charles Rosen, ''The Classical Style'', 1978) - the use of chromatic keys opens up a vista of new tonal possibilities.  Composers such as Beethoven and to an even greater extent Schubert, are examples of the first composers to explore this.

'''After chromaticism'''

Historically, the prolongations of chromatic pitches, chords, and keys, increasingly undermining a clear diatonic harmonic basis, led it many different directions.  Wagner and Strauss pushed to the extreme the tension of prolonging chromatic pitches, whereas other composers, such as Debussy, overstep the boundary and moves towards modality.  Composers of the Second Viennese School - Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern - completely eradicate any diatonic basis with atonal and dodecaphonic (twelve-tone serialism) harmony, and can thus be said to have moved through and beyond chromaticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Special Relativity}}

==Relativistic Dynamics==
To derive quantities in relativistic dynamics, it is perhaps most straightforward to use Lagrangian mechanics and Principle of Least Action.

===Introduction===
Recall the Principle of Least Action, which states that a mechanical system should have a quantity called the action &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Such quantity is minimised (in other words, &lt;math&gt;\delta S = 0&lt;/math&gt;) for the actual motion of the system.

The action of a relativistic system should be:
* a scalar: that means Lorentz transformations will not affect this quantity
* an integral of which the integrand is a first-order differential

The only quantity that satisfies the two criteria above is the space-time interval &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt;, or a scalar multiple thereof.  In short, we can conclude that the action must have the following form:

&lt;math&gt;S = \kappa\int ds&lt;/math&gt;

Recall the definition of the space-time interval &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;ds = \sqrt{c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2}&lt;/math&gt;

After pulling out &lt;math&gt;cdt&lt;/math&gt; from the square root, and noting that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx^2+dy^2+dz^2}{dt^2} = v^2&lt;/math&gt;, we have:

&lt;math&gt;ds = cdt\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

&lt;math&gt;S = c\kappa\int\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}dt&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the action integral can be expressed as a time integral of the Lagrangian between two fixed time:

&lt;math&gt;S = \int L dt&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can just read off the Lagrangian: 

&lt;math&gt;L = c\kappa\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

What is remaining now is determining the expression for &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.  At this point we should note that for low velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, this relativistic expression for the Lagrangian should resemble that of the classical free Lagrangian, &lt;math&gt;L = \frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;.  To compare the two Lagrangian, we perform a Taylor expansion on the square root:

&lt;math&gt;L = c\kappa\left(1-\frac{v^2}{2c^2}+O(v^4)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The first term, &lt;math&gt;c\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, is a constant.  That will not affect the equations of motion (see Euler-Lagrange Equation, for example).  The second term, after expanding out, is &lt;math&gt;-\kappa\frac{v^2}{2c}&lt;/math&gt;.  To reduce to the classical limit, we can put &lt;math&gt;\kappa=-mc&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the relativistic Lagrangian is:

&lt;math&gt;L = -mc^2\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Momentum and Energy===
Recall that the canonical momentum is given by &lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial v_i}&lt;/math&gt;, and rewriting &lt;math&gt;v^2 = v_i v^i&lt;/math&gt; (Einstein summation notation employed), we have:

&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{1}{2}\frac{2mv_i}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} = \gamma mv_i&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

With the canonical momenta defined, we can now construct the Hamiltonian:

&lt;math&gt;H = \Sigma p_i v_i - L = \gamma mv^2 + mc^2\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the Hamiltonian is invariant with time, it represents the energy.

After some algebra, we obtain:

&lt;math&gt;H = \gamma mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

For an object at rest, &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and the equation above reduces to the famous mass-energy equivalence relation:

&lt;math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

Two additional expressions relating momentum and energy can be derived from the expressions above:

&lt;math&gt;E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = E\frac{\vec{v}}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

====Another approach to momentum and energy====

Classically, momentum is velocity multiplied by mass. We can use the same definition in relativity, and see where it takes us.

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{p}=m_0 \underline{u}= m_0 \gamma (\mathbf{v}, c)&lt;/math&gt;

You may sometimes see the product ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gamma; which shows up here called the ''relativistic mass'', but we will not be using this approach.

The mass, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is generally called the ''rest mass'', to distinguish it from the relativistic mass.

The spatial component of the four-momemntum is clearly the classical momentum, scaled by a factor of &amp;gamma;. At speeds much less than ''c'' this will be approximately 1.

The temporal component is ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gamma;''c''. To see what this means we can look at its value when ''v''/''c'' is small.

:&lt;math&gt;m_0 \gamma c = \frac{m_0 c}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}= 
m_0 c \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{v^2}{c^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{v^4}{c^4} + \cdots
\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The first term in this expansion is a constant.

The second term is 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_0 v^2}{2c}&lt;/math&gt;
which we recognise as being the classical kinetic energy, divided by ''c''.

Now, adding a constant to the definition of kinetic energy makes no real difference, since all that matters are changes in energy, so we can identify this temporal component of relativistic momentum with the energy over ''c''.

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{p}= (\gamma \mathbf{p}, E/c)&lt;/math&gt;

We then have

:&lt;math&gt;E = m_0 c^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_0 v^2 + \frac{3}{8}\frac{m_0 v^4}{c^2} 
+ \cdots  &lt;/math&gt;

Even at rest, the particle has a kinetic energy,

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: thick solid blue;&quot;&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E=m_0 c^2, \,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

the most famous relativistic equation.



===Mass===
At the original version of Special Theory of Relativity as proposed by Einstein, the relativistic mass is given as follows:

&lt;math&gt;m = \gamma m_0&lt;/math&gt;

However, for more contemporary interpretations of Special Relativity, mass, &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt;
is considered an invariant quantity for all reference frames and &lt;math&gt;\gamma m_0&lt;/math&gt; is used instead of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  This convention allows the physicist to keep track of whether it is inertial mass or gravitational mass that is being considered.


==Force==

Classically, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}= \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

We can get the equivalent relativistic equation simply by replacing 3-vectors with 4-vectors and ''t'' with &amp;tau;, giving

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{F} = \frac{d\underline{p}}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

Provided the rest mass is constant, as it is for all simple systems, we can rewrite this as  

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{F} = m \underline{a}&lt;/math&gt;

We already know about &lt;u&gt;''a''&lt;/u&gt; so we can now write

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{F} = \gamma^4 \left( \mathbf{F}, 
\frac{ \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} }{c} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The temporal component of this is essentially the ''power'', the rate of change of energy with time, as might be expected from energy being the temporal component of momentum.</text>

===X-Ray Spectrographic Techniques===
Current X-Ray spectrographic techniques are called XAS, or X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy. XAS is composed of two different techniques: [[Quantum Mechanics/X-Ray_Diffraction_Techniques/XANES|XANES]] and [[Quantum Mechanics/X-Ray_Diffraction_Techniques/EXAFS|EXAFS]]. The two techniques differ in what part of the spectra they analyize: XANES looks at the energies close to the edge and EXAFS looks at the energies past the edge.

XANES or X-Ray Absoption Near Edge Structure is an X-Ray abosorption technique. The tehchnique allows for the study of the chemical species in the sample and the concentration. The use of high energy X-Rays is available at syncrotron sources around the world. The older 2nd generation light sources are strong enough to provide for excellent analysis. However, EXAFS is demanding of the newer 3rd generation light sources such as APS. 

===Edge energy range===
In the absorption edge region of metals the [[w:photoelectron|photoelectron]] is excited to the first unoccupied level above the [[w:Fermi level|Fermi level]]. Therefore its [[w:mean free path]] in a pure single crystal at zero temperature is as large as infinite, and it remains very large increasing the energy of the final state up to about 5 eV above the Fermi level. Beyond the role of the unoccupied [[w:Statistical Mechanics/Density of States | density of states]] and matrix elements in single electron excitations, [[w:many-body|many-body]] effects appear as an &quot;infrared singularity&quot; at the absorption threshold in metals. 

In the absorption edge region of insulators the photoelectron is excited to the first unoccupied level above the [[w:chemical potential|chemical potential]] but the unscreened core hole forms a localized bound state called core [[w:exciton|exciton]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Clarification==

In the low impact section it currently reads: 
:''&quot;Some Low-Impact situations, such as nominating votes for the book of the month and the collaboration of the month already have preexisting sets of voting rules that should be followed in lieu of this policy.&quot;''
Don't the voting rules on those projects already fit within this structure (i.e., ''&quot;wikibookians are welcome to employ multiple means for decision-making, including consensus, majority votes, or 3rd party arbitration&quot;'')? If so, maybe take out this sentence altogether, or remove the phrase ''&quot;that should be followed in lieu of this policy&quot;''. As the phrasing of the rule explicitly encourages low-priority projects to come up with voting rules, it seems a bit strange to add loopholes for certain projects, especially when they don't actually need them. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:48, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

:That's true, but BOTM and COTM also specify that in the case of a tie, the oldest book wins. Also, BOTM and COTM specify a 20 contribution minimum, which might not be a part of the final policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:34, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

::I see. However, those rules certainly fit into the loose framework of the rule in any case. The current wording might be interpreted as those voting rules being &quot;set in stone&quot;, when it seems to me better to leave them flexible in case there's consensus to change them at a later date. [[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:14, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

==Decisions affecting a single module, a single book, or a localized project==

These were part of &quot;low imapct decisions&quot; ie:

4. Decisions affecting a single module, a single book, or a localized project.

[[User:Kellen]] deleted this line but did not provide any replacement text. This means that the voting policy would not apply to large swathes of Wikibooks' processes such as &quot;decisions affecting a single module, a single book, or a localized project&quot;. Kellen noted that he would prefer these types of decision to be &quot;consensus&quot; decisions in the sense used in this proposal.  I am happy either way but they should be included in the proposal. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

:I'm guessing she didn't want that to automatically apply (I believe Cookbook might use consensus). Added this to the High-impact decisions:

::6. Establishing the voting rules for low-impact decisions

:[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:39, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

: The reason I deleted this line is that it if each &quot;single module, single book, or localized project&quot; is allowed to choose majority-rules voting for their content decisions it will fundamentally alter the culture of wikibooks and work to supplant consensus decision making out of convenience. Any content decision should be validated by consensus. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
:: I'm basically asserting that it's not 'low impact' to vote on actual content in any circumstance, and that the line should be deleted again. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

:::In that case I agree completely. Perhaps replace with:
::::&quot;Other votes that express the communities opinion on issues that have no effect on policy, content, or structure.&quot;
:::--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:10, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

(reset indent)Kellen said that item 4 would &quot;supplant consensus decision making&quot; in these areas. In this case item 4 should be moved to the section on consensus decision making. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:52, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

I have added a sentence to explain that votes taken in these circumstances should use the consensus rules. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:01, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Menstrual Cycle */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual Health}}
Sexual reproduction requires genes from two different individuals, a male and a female. To produce healthy infants a these partners should not be closely related. Natural selection suggests that he greater diversity of parents, the better chance of adaptation and thus survival the infant will enjoy.  
{{wikipedia|Female reproductive system (human)}}{{wikipedia|Male reproductive system (human)}}
== Puberty ==

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;Puberty can happen anywhere from 8 years old to 14 years old.}}

Puberty is the phase of development that begins the sexual processes in boys and girls. In girls, puberty triggers the beginning of the '''menstrual cycle''', and the development of the breasts. In boys, puberty causes the penis and testicles to grow in size, and signals the beginning of nocturnal emissions and sperm production. In both girls and boys, puberty causes body hair (and facial hair, in boys) to begin appearing. During puberty, hair will start to grow under the armpits, in the groin, and on the chest and back. Leg and arm hair will also become thicker and darker.

==Chest, Nipples, and Breasts==
In both sexes, nipples and the areas around them are frequently sensitive and responsive to sexual contact. Nipples may be soft or erect. Nipples become erect in response to changes in temperature, sexual contact, and other stimuli. 

In the tissue surrounding the nipples, both males and females have milk ducts.  In females, these glands are stimulated to produce milk by the hormones associated with pregnancy and delivery.  In both sexes, certain kinds of nipple stimulation (such as from a breast pump), certain drugs, and certain hormonal disorders may cause non-pregnancy related milk production.

In females, fatty tissue is formed around the nipples during puberty.  These are referred to as breasts, although the entire area may be referred to as a female's chest.  In males, this area is simply referred to as the chest.

==Male==
===Anatomy===
The male genitals consist of the penis and the testicles. The apparent size of a male genitalia depends on a number of factors, as they become pendulous (hanging down) when warm and relaxed but withdraw tight against the groin when experiencing cold or fear. This may have provided an evolutionary advantage to our ancestors.

==== Penis ====
The penis is a long, tube-like organ that is in the front of a man's body, in the groin area. The base of the penis connects in the groin (lower middle abdomen between the legs. The length of the penis is unimportant for reproduction, fertility or manliness, and can vary between 5cm and 20cm (2-8 inches) with an average of about 13cm (5 inches) for an erect adult adult over age 18. The middle area (the &quot;shaft&quot; of the penis) terminates in a pink gland where the urethra is exposed (the &quot;head&quot; of the penis). The base of the penis is frequently covered in pubic hair. The head of the penis is covered by the foreskin, which can be pulled back to expose the head itself. Men who are '''circumsized''' have had their foreskins removed (typically as infants).

&lt;center&gt;

b) Shaft &lt;br&gt;
c) Glans &lt;br&gt;
d) Foreskin 
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The penis can be either &quot;flaccid&quot; (hanging down, soft, small) or &quot;erect&quot; (pointing upwards or outwards, hard, larger and longer). A penis is flaccid most of the time, and urination is difficult or impossible whilst the penis is erect. 
A penis becomes erect (tumescent or '''hard''') in anticipation of sexual intercourse. Anticipation is not necessarily under conscious control, and erections can occur for no obvious reason. Orgasm (sexual climax or '''The Feeling''') is difficult or impossible whilst the penis is flaccid. Ejaculation of semen usually but not necessarily occurs simultaneously with orgasm. Pre-emission refers to naturally produced fluid lubricant which may sometimes be excreted prior to ejaculation.

==== Testicles ====
The testicles hang below the penis, and are covered by a patch of skin called the '''scrotum'''. The scrotum is typically covered in pubic hair, and is sensitive to sexual contact. Testicles produce sperm, and the hormone called &quot;testosterone&quot;, among other things. Testosterone is a hormone that causes men to develop male secondary sex characters. 

The testicles must remain several degrees below normal body temperature to produce healthy sperm. This is the reason why the testicles hang outside of the body in the scrotum. The muscles in the scrotum can expand and contract, to change the shape of the scrotum. If a man is hot, the muscles in the scrotum will lengthen, causing the testicles to move away from the body (thus cooling off the testicles). If a man is cold, the muscles in the scrotum will shorten, causing the testicles to move closer to the body (warming up the testicles).

Testicles may swell uncomfortably if a male has extended sexual stimulation without ejaculation.  This is colloquially known as &quot;blue balls&quot; and is not a harmful condition.

Testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men.  It is important for men to examine their size and shape is constant on a regular basis, and do not produce pain when handled gently. If there is any change, an early consultation without delay is essential for effective treatment.

====Vas deferens====
Each testicle has a tiny duct connecting it to the penis.  These ducts are known as the vas deferens, and they are the path sperm take from the testicles into the penis during ejaculation.  It is these ducts that are severed in a vasectomy (male sterilization). If conducted before puberty, vasectomy can arrest sexual development, as in medieval Castrati (male singers) in whom cutting the vas diferens was said to make a vast difference (to the voice). Their testicles were not usually removed (actual castration) Such interventions are now strictly prohibited as a serious affront to the boy's human rights, since he can not give informed consent for life-changing operations at such a young age.

==== Semen ====
'''Semen''' is a combination of fluids from multiple glands, and sperm from the testicles. During ejaculation, semen comes out of the erect penis. In some cases, semen squirts or shoots out vigorously, while at other times the semen oozes out slowly and does not travel any distance. Both situations are normal, and both force and volume of ejaculation is unimportant.

Semen can carry STDs and other germs into a partner, so contact with semen should be minimized, and condom protection should always be used during any overtly sexual activity.

Some people choose to take  semen into their mouth, and may swallow semen as well. Oral ingestion of semen is not likely to be harmful, but there are no health benefits. There is some risk of transmission of STDs, especially if there are open wounds or sores in the mouth or on the lips. For this reason, it is recommended that people should use protection such as a condom when performing oral sex (described later), and get tested for STDs regularly.

==== Prostate ====
The '''prostate''' is one of the glands that contributes fluid to semen. The prostate can be stimulated directly through the perineum (skin between the testicles and anus) or from inside the anus, a practice that some men find pleasurable. Prostates are at risk for developing cancer, especially in older men. For this reason, men should get prostate exams regularly &lt;!--beginning at what age? --&gt; to check for cancer and other disorders.

=== Nocturnal Emissions ===
Boys of any age may naturally become aroused during sleep and may experience orgasm voluntarily or involuntarily. Those who have passed puberty can experience a phenomenon known as &quot;nocturnal emission&quot;. Nocturnal emissions occur at night, while sleeping, and are involuntary releases semen while sleeping. Typically, the emission of semen is the first sign that a young man has reached puberty and is producing sperm normally.

Nocturnal emissions may occur more frequently when ejaculation is not achieved consiously on a regular basis.

== Female ==
===Anatomy===
Unlike the male penis and testicles, female reproductive anatomy is almost entirely internal.  The components that are externally visible are known as the vulva.

====Vulva====
[[Image:Vulva anatomy.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of a vulva with component parts labeled.]]
At the front of the vulva is a small structure called the '''clitoris'''. The clitoris is very sensitive to stimulation. During fetal development, the cells that in males develop into the penis, in females develop into the clitoris.  The clitoris has more nerve endings than a male's penis, and even light stimulation can cause sensations of pain or discomfort. The clitoris is surrounded by folds of flesh known as the clitoral hood. The clitoral hood can be pulled back to expose the tip of the clitoris underneath.

Immediately below the clitoris is the urethra.  This opening is connected to the bladder, and is where urine is expelled.

The largest feature of the vulva is the vaginal canal, or vagina. The vaginal canal is a fleshy tube, between 3-5 inches deep (but made of stretchable membranes) that opens between the legs, and connects to the uterus. 

On each side of the vaginal opening is a Bartholin's gland.  The vaginal canal and Bartholin's glands produce lubricating fluid in response to sexual stimulus. Sometimes these glands become clogged, and develop into a Bartholin's cyst.  Usually these cysts resolve on their own, but if they are painful, unusually large, or persist for a long period of time, they should be evaluated by a doctor.

Inside the vagina, toward the front of the body, is an area of spongy tissue known as the Gräfenberg spot, or G-spot.  This tissue may be related to Skene's glands (the female equivalent of the prostate), or may connect to the interior portion of the clitoris.  Some women find stimulation of this area enjoyable.

The clitoris, urethra, and the vaginal opening are surrounded on both sides by the labial lips. The labia is divided into an inner and an outer set of lips, &quot;the labia minora&quot; and &quot;the labia majora&quot;, respectively. The labia serve as protective coverings for the clitoris and the vaginal canal, and are also responsive to sexual contact.  It is more common for the labia majora to be larger and completely enclose the labia minora.  However, it is also normal for the labia minora to be larger and protrude somewhat from the labia majora.

==== Cervix ====

[[Image:Scheme_female_reproductive_system-en.svg|thumb|right|A pictorial illustration of the female reproductive system.]]

The cervix is the muscle connecting the uterus and the vaginal canal. The opening in the cervix is called the cervical os.  The size of the os changes throughout a woman's menstrual cycle, being more open during menstruation, and also near ovulation, and more closed at other times.  The rigidity of the cervix also varies, from being soft like a person's lips, to being more firm like a person's nose.  

Glands inside the cervix, known as cervical crypts, produce a substance known as cervical mucus or cervical fluid.  Cervical mucus is usually thick, sticky, and acidic (to help kill any infectious microorganisms, and to physically block the entrance into the uterus).  In the several days before ovulation, however, cervical mucus increases in water content, becomes less acidic, and develops a texture that helps guide sperm into the uterus.  At this time, cervical mucus may resemble hand lotion, or raw egg white.

Cervical cancer is caused by certain strains of HPV, a sexually transmitted disease.  It is important to use barrier protection during intercourse to reduce the risk of STDs, and for sexually active women to receive regular pap smears to screen for precancerous changes.

==== Uterus ====
The uterus is a pear-shaped organ about the size of a fist.  Two small conduits, called '''fallopian tubes''' extend from each side of the uterus. Each fallopian tube ends with a structure called a fimbria, which catches eggs after ovulation and guides them into the fallopian tube.

The lining of the uterus is called the endometrium.  Several days before ovulation, the endometrium begins to become thicker and grows new blood vessels.  If pregnancy does not occur, the endometrium is shed approximately two weeks after ovulation.  This shedding of the endometrium is known as menstruation.

==== Ovaries ====
The ovaries are the location of a female's gametes (eggs), and are analogous to the male testicles (which contain the male gametes, sperm). Ovaries release eggs, also called ova (or ovum if it is just one) into the '''fallopian tubes'''.  Ovaries also produce '''estrogen''', which is the dominant female sex hormone. Estrogen causes the body to feminize, and is the reason why women grow breasts, and undergo other changes at puberty.

{{-}}

=== Menstrual Cycle ===
Human females begin menstruating, or having periods, as part of puberty.  A girl's first menstruation is called ''menarche'', and usually happens between the ages of eight and sixteen.  After menarche, menstruation typically continues to occur at regular intervals - this is called a ''menstrual cycle''.  Women stop having menstrual cycles when they enter ''menopause'', most commonly between the ages of forty-five and fifty-eight.
{{wikipedia|Menstrual cycle}}
The bleeding of menstruation is the most obvious part of the menstrual cycle. However, there is one other important feature: ovulation.  The time between menstruation and ovulation is called the ''follicular phase'', because this is when follicles on the ovaries begin growing.  On average, the follicular phase lasts fourteen days, however this varies widely from woman to woman and also from cycle to cycle.

When one of the growing follicles reaches maturity, the ovum (egg) bursts through the ovarian wall.  This event is known as ovulation. (The remaining follicles atrophy, or die).  Many women experience pain associated with ovulation - this is called ''mittelschmerz''.

The time between ovulation and menstruation is on average fourteen days, however this may vary from woman to woman.  Some women have post-ovulatory, or ''luteal phases'' of ten days, while others may have luteal phases sixteen days long.

==== PMS and PMDD ====
Prior to menstruation, a woman can experience certain hormonal and chemical changes in her body that can lead to a period of physical and psychological stress known as '''premenstrual syndrome''', or PMS. PMS is usually characterized by cramping, bloating and water retention, moodiness and discomfort. PMS is not always experienced, and it is not experienced in all women, but it is considered a normal part of the menstrual cycle. 

However, some women experience an extreme form of PMS known as '''Premenstral dysphoric disorder''', or PMDD. PMDD is a more serious condition characterized by extreme moodiness, mood swings, and depression. PMDD can frequently be treated medically with success.

== Confused &amp; Upset ==

I started dating this woman five weeks ago. We got into it pretty heavy. We spent alot of time together. I began staying at her house every night, aside from maybe 2 or 3 nights. A week ago things started getting a little rough. We got into a little spat for the first time. Since then, things just seemed to go a little downhill. A few days later we got into another disagreement, and soon after that she told me that we needed some time apart. I can understand the time apart thing, to some degree. But I'm really into this person and am scared about losing her. I stayed at home last night for the first time in roughly three weeks. I miss her alot already. What I want to know I guess, what do I do to keep in contact with her? How do I go abouts keeping contact? How often? My initial reaction is to pour myself out into a note or email and give it to her,yet, I dont want to push her any more.

:I presume the two of you are in your twenties. The chapter [[../Adolescence|Adolescence&amp;#151;Seeking Romantic Love]] shows how young people fall in love, by projecting idealizations onto a partner rather than by seeing who the partner really is. When even a tiny bit of reality cracks that idealization, the fantasy falls apart in a hurry. Young people then go from madly in love to hating each other. Contrast this to [[../Adulthood|Adulthood&amp;#151;Families And Forgiveness]]. Help her to move from adolescent love to mature love.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 21:39, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

== Conflict ==

I got out with a girl, we work in the same place. Before this, I was in love with another girl, but she did not felt the same for me. Then I decided to take a chance with the girl who worked with me. I found out that she liked me and I didn't know that. The problem is that she wants a serious relationship, but I don't think I'm ready for it, I feel quite unconfortable, but now I think there's no return. I was forced to ask her father to date her, but I don't want to (altough he refused). Anyway, she has deeper feeling for me than mine for her. I fear hurting her and I'm ashamed because of it.

== Why develop all 15 archetypes? ==

Why is it ideal, as you said, to develop all fifteen archetypes rather than just a few like most couples do? Are we some kind of super-couple if we can develop all fifteen equally?

== A love style in a relationship ==

Hi all. How can we women deal with men as being ludic?

:Ludic means being playful, there are many games that strengthen  relationship, team activities of exploration and testing of skills will serve to increase mutual reliance and expose character traits that could otherwise not be evident. It is also a good way to define shared interest.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:39, 17 February 2012 (UTC)

==  relationship with a married man  ==

is a relationship with a married man have a great future

::It depends in many factors. A marriage is not only a legal contract but a trust commitment between two persons. If one is infringing on that legal and moral contract without the knowledge of the other partner and without a valid reasons (all extremely limited in time and all excluding participation in most marital functions). That person not only demonstrates a lack of character and reliability but escalates the possibility that he/she is not committed to the new relation or the situation can be repeatable in the future. Even more if he/she knows the new partner is aware of the situation, since he/she is also morally corrupted by association. This seems common sense.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:03, 6 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

{{compactTOC8}}

==A==

;[[w:Acey-deucey|Acey-deucey]] (or Acey-deucy): A variant of [[backgammon]] in which the roll of 1 and 2 gives the player extra turns.  
;Anchor: A [[#P|point]] occupied in the [[#H|home board]] by two or more of opponent's checkers.

==B==

;Backgammon: A game in which one player bears off all of his checkers while his opponent still has one or more checkers on the bar or in the winner's home board, counting for triple a normal game.

;Bar: The area where blots are placed after being hit, usually, a raised divider between the [[#H|home boards]] and [[#O|outer boards]].

;Bar point: Either of the two points in the [[#O|outer board]] adjacent to the bar; the 7-point or the 18-point.

;Bear off: To remove a checker from the [[#H|home board]] by rolling a number that equals or exceeds the point on which the checker resides.

;Block: A [[#P|point]] occupied by two or more checkers on the [[#H|home board]] or the [[#O|outer board]].

;Blot: A single checker vulnerable to being hit.

==C==

;Checker: One of the 15 playing pieces allotted to each player.

;Cubeless Equity: The value of a position ignoring the use of the doubling cube. This is a value between -3 and +3 that takes into account the probabilities of either side winning a [[#S|single game]], winning a [[#D|double game]] or winning a [[#T|triple game]]. If at a given point in the game neither party can make a [[#G|gammon]], the cubeless equity of a player simply is the probability of him/her winning the game, minus the probability of the opponent winning the game.

==D==

;Deep Anchor: An [[#A|anchor]] on the opponent's one-point or two-point.

;Doubles: A dice roll in which both values are identical, e.g. 1-1 or 6-6.

==E==

;End Game: The phase of a game which starts when one of the players begins to [[#B|bear off]].

==F==

;Full prime: A [[#P|prime]] of six consecutive points that completely blocks the opponent from moving checkers in front of the prime to behind the prime.

==G==

;Gammon: A game in which one player removes all his checkers before his opponent can remove any, and counted as a double win.

==H==

;Hit: To move onto a point occupied by an opposing [[#B|blot]], and move the opposing checker to the [[#B|bar]].

;Home board: The portion of the board containing [[#P|points]] 1-6. The checkers need to move here before they can be borne off. It is also the part of the board where the opponent's checkers are re-entered from the [[#B|bar]].

==I==

;Inner board: [[#H|Home board]].

&lt;!-- ==J==


==K==


==L==

--&gt;
==M==

;Match: A series of games of backgammon, played until one participant reaches a predetermined score.

;Mid point: Either of the two [[#P|points]] furthest from the bar; the 12-point or the 13-point.

==N==

;Normalized Match Score: A match score expressed in terms of the number of points needed by both sides to win the match. For instance, '2-away/4-away' (or: -2/-4) could indicate the state of seven-point match in which one party has gained five points and the other side three points.  

;Notation: In backgammon the common way of describing the movement of checkers involves numbering the [[#P|points]] around the board from 24 to 1 such that the numbers diminish when the checkers move towards the [[#H|home board]]. This implies that a reverse numbering applies when the opponent is on roll (with the 24-point now referred to as the 1-point, etc.). A move of a single checker is indicated by the start and the end number separated by a slash. If a move results in a checker being hit, this is indicated by adding an [[w:asterisk|asterisk]] to the number on which a checker was hit.

==O==

;Open point: A point a player can in principle move his checkers to. I.e. a point that is not occupied by more than one opposing checker.

==P==

;Pip: One of the markings on the face of a die, corresponding to a movement of one [[#P|point]].

;Pip count: The total number of remaining [[#P|pips]] needed to bear off all [[#C|checkers]].

;Point: One of the twenty-four narrow triangles on the backgammon board where the players' [[#C|checkers]] sit, or the value of a single [[#G|game]] of backgammon before accounting for the doubling cube, or a gammon or backgammon.

;Prime: Several consecutive points held by a player.

&lt;!-- ==Q==


==R==

--&gt;
==S==

;Split: To break up two checkers which are together on a [[#P|point]] and leave them as [[#B|blots]].

&lt;!-- ==T==


==U==


==V==


==W==


==X==


==Y==


==Z==

Thank you so much for this.
I am just starting to learn Sumerian for postgrad research.
It looks as though you changed the order of your lessons.
The quick quiz for lesson two assumes knowledge of the genitive (.ak) and dative (.ir) case-forms, and includes house (e) and temple (e.gal), vocabulary which is not yet introduced, according to the new sequence. [[User:Alastair Haines|Alastair Haines]] 02:28, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

== Changes made ==

Thanks for catching these! I've fixed both issues. Hopefully adding more chapters as well soon.
[[User:Mike.the.kitty|Mike.the.kitty]] 17:17, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== .ir ==

I haven't been able to find anything on the .ir suffix. Could it please be explained?

== Changes made ==

All the case particles are now handled in a later lesson, in individual pages. Hopefully it will be a bit more fleshed out in time, but I have updated a bit for the Dative particle (.ir). Thanks for the comment! [[User:Mike.the.kitty|Mike.the.kitty]]

== Lesson title ==

I have fixed the misspelling &quot;posessive&quot; several times in this lesson, but I don't know how to fix the lesson title itself.

== Title fixed ==

I've used the &quot;move&quot; feature (it's a tab next to the &quot;history&quot; tab&quot;) to rename the article.

Thank you very much, Enlil :) I mis-spelled it consistently through the whole text. *DOH*! I also always mis-spell &quot;seperate&quot;. No idea why. On the bright side, I've raised my confidence level that I am not a robot.

[[User:Mike.the.kitty|Mike.the.kitty]] ([[User talk:Mike.the.kitty|talk]]) 15:53, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

== English to Sumerian quiz ==

English to Sumerian:
&quot;for her child&quot;

using /.ir/ where for &quot;for&quot; ...dative case? Using .ir not yet explained.



the queen of your temple

using /.ak/ here but /.ak/ not yet explained.
Also should /e/ be explained as also a temple? otherwise should we be writing: /e.gal.zu.ak/ ?? You currently have /e.zu.ak/

Thanks for the great work!!</text>

Hello again, just another couple of tiny quibbles. Firstly, I thought Nanna was the moon god, father of Inanna, and therefore male. Secondly, the dative case actually expresses a 'beneficiary' relationship, rather than a 'benefactor' relationship. A bene-fact-or is one who &quot;does good&quot; to another and will often be the subject. The one who benefits is the beneficiary and is typically (but not always) an indirect object. Compare: &quot;I gave the book to him&quot; and &quot;I gave him the book.&quot; Some do indeed describe the dative as expressing a benefactor relationship, but strictly speaking it is a misnomer. The benefactor may not even be expressed in a sentence that uses the dative, however the beneficiary obviously will. Example: &quot;The book was given to him.&quot; [[User:Alastair Haines|Alastair Haines]] 02:41, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

== Changes made ==

Thanks for catching these. I've edited the error regarding bene(factor|ficiary), and added some info about Nanna. (As you guessed, I originally had Inanna there, but changed it later for reasons I can no longer fathom.) Incidentally, feel free to make these types of changes yourself! That is what the spirit of wiki is all about! - Mike

== Nice Work ==

This is one of the best language intros (of any kind) that I've read.  You've done a wonderful job of explaining what Sumerian is about, without forcing the reader to slog through a lot of technical details right up front.  Most language texts give short shrift to the student's need to get the &quot;lie of the land&quot; before burying him in mechanics.

Many thanks!

== Thanks ==
Many thanks for your time and effort. I was looking for a sumerian intro for a long time. -mehmet</text>

== Bot Bug - newlines between HTML attributes ==

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Portuguese%2FContents%2FPresent_tense_regular_verbs&amp;diff=616291&amp;oldid=523611 this edit] screwed the table right up. I've fixed it now on that page. I guess the bot may have made similar messes elsewhere. The problem is the HTML table sytax allows newlines between tag arributes, but the wiki table syntax does not. The bot should be stripping out any such newlines to avoid this problem -- [[User:Harry Wood|Harry Wood]] 13:47, 14 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

=== Introduction ===
This section covers the terms related to religion and encourage the student to speak about his/her religious beliefs using the Korean language.  When learning about religion in the Korean language, there are some important factors to consider.  First of all, there are 7 different speech levels in the Korean language accompanied by a set of honorific forms for each speech level.  In the Korean Bible, the translators use the Hasoseoche(하소서체) form for many of the verses.  For daily speech, the reader should use one of the lower speech forms instead.

The second thing that the reader needs to do is be prepared to learn the hanja for many of the words used in the religious texts.  If the reader learns a few hanja every week, that reader will be able to be able to learn the vocabulary more quickly.  The hanja are used in the mixed script Korean Bible, 백팔대참회문, as well as some other Korean religious texts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Korean/Navigation panel|Grammar}}

==Forming questions==

To form questions in high form ([[wikt:존댓말|존댓말]]), simply add the ending 습니까? if the verb stem ends in a consonant or ㅂ니까? if it ends in a vowel.

* Example: 당신은 어디로 가고 있습니까? (Where are you going?)

When forming questions in middle and low form, the questions are implied by a rising final tone, much like in English.  The ending for middle form is 요? For low form, just leave off any ending and use just the raw verb stem.

*Example(middle): 당신은 언제 미국에 왔어요? (When did you come to America?)

*Example(low): 넌 어디 갔다왔어? (Where have you been?)

===Interrogative pronouns===

==== 무엇 ====
The interrogative pronoun [[wikt:무엇|무엇]] means &quot;what&quot;. In speech, it is often contracted to [[wikt:뭐|뭐]]:
* 이게 '''뭐'''예요?
*: '''What''' is this?
* '''뭐'''라고 했어요?
*: '''What''' did [you] say?
* '''뭐'''하니?
*: '''What''' are [you] doing?

The pronoun [[wikt:누구|누구]] means &quot;who&quot;. It contracts before 가 to make 누가.

The pronoun [[wikt:어디|어디]] means &quot;where&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Jeep Libertys manufactured in 2006 and later come standard with ESP, or Electronic Stability Program.  Among other things, ESP applies selective breaking to prevent wheel spin.  This traction portion of the ESP has an effect similar to that of an LSD.  So it doesn't interfere with off road driving, parts of the ESP system are disabled in 4-Hi and 4-Lo.  The system relies heavily on the ABS wheel speed sensors to determine if a wheel is slipping.  ESP may interfere with LSDs and lockers because it performs many of the same functions that they do.  It should be noted that when ESP was introduced in 2006 the factory LSD option was dropped, whether this was because ESP defeats the purpose of a LSD or because it's incompatible with a LSD is not yet known.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General suggestions ==
===Environment Variables===
One of the to-dos for the page is to add information on setting the environment variables on Windows systems. I've just done a Java install on my system and reviewed the environment variable information commented out on the wiki page and it seems sound. Can we just un-comment what's there? 

=== JAVAC -version, eh? ===
What do you mean when you say run the &quot;javac -version&quot; command, you should explain how to do that, or link to it for people who are new to the term. I'm pretty good with computers, but some things aren't explained how to do anywhere, so I never have learned how to do them!!! [[User:Chesemonkyloma|Meemo]] 04:49, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
: I completely agree with [[User:Chesemonkyloma|Meemo]] on this. &lt;strike&gt;I am working on a newer, better approach for laymen to understand how to check for the availability of Java Development Kit. Pictures and screenshots might do some justice here.&lt;/strike&gt; - [[User:Arunreginald|Arun Reginald]] 07:17, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

:: I have already added some pictures and comprehensive text in order to make the reader aware of what happens behind the scenes. Please see as to this helps readers understand the topic at hand better or not. - [[User:Arunreginald|Arun Reginald]] 22:38, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

== JavaWIDE ==
I included a link to JavaWIDE on the page because I think this would be a great way to streamline the process of getting to know Java with as little difficulty as possible.  General information about the project is available from [http://www.javawide.org/ the Java WIDE website] and you can play around with the tool at [http://sandbox.javawide.org/ the JavaWIDE sandbox].  Feel free to move this information to more suitable locations if appropriate.  What do you think about including it before all of the installation instructions? - Dr. Jam Jenkins
: With due respect, Dr Jenkins, I think we should move the part regarding JavaWIDE elsewhere within this book. At this point, we would like the readers of the book to enable themselves to install a JDK for themselves on their computer. But, the real challenge here is to actually define the process as simply as possible without talking much about other alternative tools. - [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] ([[User talk:Arunreginald|talk]]) 09:25, 2 March 2010 (UTC)

== Other Platforms ==
As I've murmured elsewhere, I do think it's a good idea to mention the installation process for other platforms, namely a couple of *nix like systems such as Mac and Linux Ubuntu/Debian. We need to keep them under separate titles to make sure they're not confusing. I'll probably start writing a first draft straight away.

ADD: In my replacement, I've veered people away from an IDE such as Netbeans due to my belief that although they do make life a little easier, I think that they can keep new comers from fully understanding what's going on behind the scenes --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 20:14, 7 March 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==
Somatoform disorder is a relatively new term for what many people used to refer to as psychosomatic disorder. In somatoform disorders, the physical symptoms cannot be explained by any underlying physical disease. In some cases of somatoform disorders, a physical disease is present that might explain the occurrence but not the severity or duration of the physical symptoms. People with somatoform disorders are not faking illness; they sincerely believe that they have a serious physical problem.

The most commonly diagnosed somatoform disorders are somatization disorder, conversion disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, and pain disorder. The individual people who are diagnosed with a somatoform disorder vary greatly. Treatment approaches also vary according to which somatoform disorder a person has.

== Diagnosis ==
Before establishing the diagnosis of a somatoform disorder, the doctor makes sure that the child does not have a physical illness that could account for the symptoms. However, extensive laboratory tests are generally avoided because they may further convince the child that a physical problem exists and unnecessary diagnostic tests may themselves traumatize the child. If no physical illness can be found, the doctor then talks to the child and family members to try to identify underlying psychologic problems or troubled family relationships.

== Treatment ==
Increasingly doctors are recognizing the importance of dealing with psychological and social factors in relation to physical disease. As a result, many doctors now try to deal with the whole person. This means taking all these factors into consideration. By doing this, it is important to realize that the doctor is not playing down or ignoring the physical disease. Many people with so-called psychosomatic disorders feel that their doctor does not take them seriously. They feel that the doctor believes that it's all in the mind . The doctor will always attempt to treat the physical illness with appropriate medical treatment if necessary. But he will also be interested to understand more about the person who has the illness. This will in turn help him and the patient to understand the illness better. Sometimes psychotherapy or talking treatment can help. Patients are given the opportunity and time to talk about their feelings and emotions. This will help provide them with an insight into themselves and help them understand their illness better. Sometimes it is helpful to look at the whole lifestyle of the person involved. This may require looking at how the stress is dealt with, teaching techniques for stress management, as well as examining factors such as diet and exercise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sociologists have been theorizing about religion since the inception of sociology.  The earliest and still most commonly used theorem in the sociology of religion is the secularization paradigm. The name was borrowed from the Catholic Church that has used the term “secular” since the dark ages to describe priests working outside religious orders. It gained new meaning in sociology where it began to describe the idea of a decline and negation of religion (Beckford 2003). Casanova (1994) has argued that:
'The secularization theory may be the only theory which was able to attain a truly paradigmatic status within the modern social sciences. In one form or another … the thesis of secularization was shared by all founding fathers: from Karl Marx to John Stuart Mill, from August Comte to Herbert Spencer, from E. B. Taylor to James Frazer, from Ferdinand Toennies to George Simmel, from Emile Durkheim to Max Weber…'  (p.17)

Secularization theory can be traced back to Saint-Simon (1975) who argued that association between church and state had gone through three stages. In ancient Greece and Rome, religion and state were ruled by the same class, which resulted in the interlocking of the two. In medieval times, these two became distinctly separate institutions, with the church being the predominant one. In recent times, the state has become the stronger of the two (Saint-Simon 1975).

At this point, we can distinguish four discrete variations of the secularization theory.  Comte (1974) argued that the progress of sciences will result in the disappearance of religion.  Weber (1990) accepted Comte’s idea of science undermining religion; however, he did not believe that disappearance of religion is altogether possible. His approach to secularization theory called for decline in religiosity (Weber 1990).  The third approach, presented by Luckmann (1963, 1967, 1990), suggested that indeed religion will decline, although a distinction is made between organized religion (which, in his view, is on the decline) and private religion, which will compensate for losses in institutionalized religion. This shift from public to private religions is identified as privatization theory (Luckmann 1963; Luckmann 1967; Luckmann 1990).   Parsons (1977a, 1977b) is credited with the fourth approach, which predicts transformation in religiosity.  He said that the influence of organized religion is on the wane and shifting towards the personal sphere. However, Christian values are intertwined in western society and, in effect, became a sacred core of our social system (Parsons 1977a; Parsons 1977b).

Apart from the four core theories within the secularization paradigm there are numerous additional conceptualizations that attempt to fuse the original four. The most popular one is described by Berger (1967) who crossbreeds transformation and privatization theories and argues that religion does affect society, although increasingly only in the private sphere (Berger 1967). Another theory combines disappearance premise with Weber’s decline hypothesis and states that religious values are entrenched in the customs of established communities. Additionally, the conversion to industrial societies creates a challenge to these values’ authority (Wilson 1982; Wilson 1985).

The critics of the secularization theory have argued that that there is no sufficient empirical support for the theory which sociologist “sacralized” and that, since the founding fathers of sociology on both sides of the Atlantic were staunch critics of religion itself, this paradigm should be abolished from the theoretical discourse (Hadden 1987; Stark 1999; Swatos and Christiano 1999). However, as Yamane (1997) argues, this “sacralized theory” offers “a paradigm in the strict Kuhnian sense of being grounded in a concrete scientific community which shares a core set of concepts, an infrastructure of ‘exemplars,’ even if there is a diversity at the theoretical level within the paradigm” (p.110).  The attacks on the secularization paradigm brought on further modifications in the theory described as “neo-secularization” (Phillips 2004; Sommerville 1998; Yamane 1997). This new approach calls for not connecting secularization with falling rates of religious participation but, instead, describing it as a “descaling scope of religious authority” (Chaves 1994). This is associated with differentiation of once entwined religious and secular institutions, which became increasingly separated from their religious sphere. As Sommerville (1998:251) explains: “…we are not saying that differentiation leads to secularization. It is secularization.” Thus, it appears that the paradigm has been shifting from an emphasis on the outcome to an explication of the process itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==

'''Wheezing''' is a high-pitched whistling sound produced by expiratory air flowing through narrowed breathing tubes, especially the smaller ones deep in the lung. It is a common finding in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).


== Causes ==

*Asthma 
*Bronchiectasis 
*Bronchiolitis 
*Bronchitis 
*Emphysema (COPD)
*Pulmonary Oedema / Heart failure (cardiac asthma)
*Allergic reaction
*Inhalation of foreign matter into the lungs (especially in children) 


Conditions which may exacerbate existing underlying asthmatic tendency include
*Gastroesophageal reflux disease 
*Viral infection, especially in infants younger than 2 years old 
*Pneumonia 
*Smoking 
*Medications (many asthmatics wheeze after taking aspirin or NSAID)

== Treatment ==

*Drugs to relieve narrowing of the airways, (beta agonist)such as albuterol, are usually given by inhalation or nebulisation. These are referred as rescue medication. 
*Steroids are extremely important component in the treatment as airway inflammation has now been proved to be the major component of the disease. Steroids may be given orally during the acute phase treatment, but are usually given by inhalers in the long term treatment(so called 'preventors'). 
*Hospitalization may be required if the patient's breathing is particularly difficult, or if close observation by medical personnel, intravenous medications, supplemental oxygen are required. In any case, the patient needs to be closely monitored as asthma can deteriorate rapidly.

If a diagnosis is made related to wheezing such as asthma or COPD, further action to treat and manage the condition will be needed.

== Hemoptysis ==


'''Hemoptysis''' is coughing up blood from the respiratory tract. The blood can come from the nose, mouth, throat, the airway passages leading to the lungs, or the lungs. The word &quot;hemoptysis&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;haima,&quot; meaning &quot;blood,&quot; and &quot;ptysis,&quot; which means &quot;a spitting&quot;. 


== '''Causes''' ==


Hemoptysis can be caused by a range of disorders:

*Infections. These include pneumonia; tuberculosis; aspergillosis; and parasitic diseases, including ascariasis, amebiasis, and paragonimiasis. 
*Tumors that erode blood vessel walls. 
*Drug abuse. Cocaine can cause massive hemoptysis. 
*Trauma. Chest injuries can cause bleeding into the lungs. 
*Vascular disorders, including aneurysms, pulmonary embolism, and malformations of the blood vessels. 
*Bronchitis. Its most common cause is long-term smoking. 
*Foreign object(s) in the airway. 
*Blood clotting disorders. 
*Bleeding following such surgical procedures as bronchial biopsies and heart catheterization.



== '''Treatment''' ==

*Massive hemoptysis is a life-threatening emergency that requires treatment in an intensive care unit. The patient will be intubated (the insertion of a tube to help breathing) to protect the airway, and to allow evaluation of the source of the bleeding. 
*Patients with lung cancer, bleeding from an aneurysm (blood clot), or persistent traumatic bleeding require chest surgery.
*Patients with tuberculosis, aspergillosis, or bacterial pneumonia are given antibiotics.
*Foreign objects are removed with a bronchoscope.
*If the cause cannot be determined, the patient is monitored for further developments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Could someone define what &quot;A-level economics&quot; is, and what AQA and OCR stand for?

After a quick google, &quot;A-level&quot; refers to a type of advanced high school curriculum.  Could someone defend the existence of a 'principles of' and an 'a-level' book? The content should be identical.  An 'A-level' reader/syllabus could be attached to the 'principles of' book instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt; Previous chapter - &lt;/b&gt; [[../Semiempirical quantum chemistry/]]

===Geometry Optimization===

Important features to notice are that the potential is steeper on the inner side
and shallower especially as it moves out towards dissociation.
This concept is extended to polyatomic molecules where we have a potential
energy  ''surface'' in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions.
(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is 3N-6 where N is the number of atoms. The -6 comes from the translations
and rotations of the molecule, the trivial vibrations referred to in the MOPAC
printouts.)
The bottom of the potential well is at the equilibrium bond length.
In this region the potential function resembles a parabola
&lt;math&gt;
 E = \frac 1 2 f  r ^{2} + c
&lt;/math&gt;

Optimization of the geometry of a diatomic is trivial if we can calculate
the total energy we follow it downwards as a function of varying &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; by
Newton like procedures until we have points either side of the minimum.
From this position we can keep bisecting the interval and using
quadratic  interpolation until the required accuracy is reached.

A vast improvement to this procedure has come from being able to differentiate
the Hamiltonian with respect to the 3N nuclear position coordinates,
( &lt;math&gt;x, y,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; on each atomic centre ).
All the modern quantum chemistry programs now use this technique.
Newton-Raphson like methods are used to descend down the surface and old gradients
are remembered to refine the optimisation.
Once in the quadratic region swift convergence to any accuracy is assured.

===Cartesian Coordinates and Z-Matrices===

''The boring problem of molecular geometries.''

We have talked so far about geometries assuming they were expressed
as matrices of the &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; coordinates of the individual atoms.
Sometimes a more useful and efficient way is to express the same unique
geometrical arrangement as the bond lengths and bond angles of the
molecule. This has factored out the 6 degrees of freedom corresponding to rotation
and translation of the molecule.
===Practical Ways of Making Molecular Geometries===

To write out the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-martix for a medium sized molecule by inspection is a
possible but arduous task. To make the cartesian coordinates without
computerized assistance is impossible. In practice one uses a molecular
modelling system like the MACROMODEL ( Columbia University, New York ),
available on UNIX systems.
The molecular modelling system uses one of several  standard force-fields
to refine the built-up
geometry. (Notice the terminology force-fields for classical
calculations like MM2,
hamiltonians for quantum methods like AM1 (Austin Method-1).)

The force-field calculation has all the connectivity of the molecule
established by the modelling system so generating
the matrices involves walking the ''tree'' of connectivities
in the most chemically sensible way picking off the leaves, (Hydrogen atoms),
with their dihedral angles as &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-matrix entries. In computing
terminology trees grow downwards not up.
The ''nodes'' of a tree are usually the atoms. Terminal nodes are called leaves.

The theoretical study of the connectivity of chemistry is called
Chemical Graph Theory and is important in areas such as computer assisted
chemical synthesis and bibliographic searching.

                         /     ( .         .
                        /(   ((     .      .
                       /  (((          .   .

Notice that there is a handedness to the axis system, following the right hand rule.
The &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, (the principal axis), is the thumb, first finger gives &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
second finger &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. This convention is best adhered to as though left handed coordinate
systems will work if consistent great trouble can be caused by stereochemistry,
(proteins are made of only L-amino acids|).

====Carbon Dioxide====


                       :z
                       :
                       :
                       :
        00             CC           00

                   /
                  /
                 y

By inspection the cartesian coordinates can be written down

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;th&gt;x&lt;th&gt;y&lt;th&gt;z

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;C&lt;th&gt;0&lt;th&gt;0&lt;th&gt;0
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;O1&lt;th&gt;r&lt;th&gt;0&lt;th&gt;0
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;O2&lt;th&gt;-r&lt;th&gt;0&lt;th&gt;0

&lt;/table&gt;

The symmetry point group is &lt;math&gt;D_{\infty h}&lt;/math&gt; but in quantum chemistry calculations
often the algorithms require the use of Abelian,
(~non degenerate~), groups only so &lt;math&gt;D_{2}h&lt;/math&gt; is used for carbon dioxide.
(&lt;math&gt;D_{2}h&lt;/math&gt; is the ab-initio quantum chemist's favourite group as it has 8 irreducible
representations making the calculation
much smaller than the more common
&lt;math&gt;C_{s}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C_{2}v&lt;/math&gt; groups, e.g. Quinone with
only two unique heavy atoms.
The principal axis of rotation is almost always defined as the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis.


====Methyl Chloride====

In methyl chloride the C-Cl bond is 1.8 angstroms the C-H bond
1.094 angstroms and the CL-C-H angle is 110.6667 degrees.
in the diagram the Z-axis is along the C-CL bond.


                        CL
                         :
                         :
                         :
                         :
                         :
                         C --------------------y
                        /=.
                       / = .
                     //  =  ..            (x out of page)
                    //   =   . .
                  / /    =    . .
                 / /    H(3)   . .
                /-/             .-.
               H(1)             H(2)


The obvious atom to make the origin is C. Cl will then be 1.8 up the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis.
All the hydrogens will have the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate &lt;math&gt;1.094~*~\cos~110.67&lt;/math&gt; i.e.
&lt;math&gt;-~(1.094~*~\cos~69.33)&lt;/math&gt;.

H(3) has a &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate zero and an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; coordinate negative,
(that is in a right-handed cartesian framework, see the Polar Coordinates
diagram).

It is best always to use the conventional right handed axes.
The memory trick is to think of a sheet of graph paper, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is across
as usual and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; up the paper.
Positive z then comes out of the paper.
Interestingly failure to get this right does not affect any results
of calculations other than those of optical activity etc. but a more
serious problem is when coordinates
are used as building blocks.
For instance if you combined a set of amino-acid coordinates from your calculation
with some from a crystal structure or the molecular model builder you
could inadvertently end up
mixing D and L forms in the same peptide.

So the above negative &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; value will be &lt;math&gt;1.094~*~\sin~69.33&lt;/math&gt;.
Now remembering this value as '&lt;math&gt;xc&lt;/math&gt;', we can easily get the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinates
of H2 and H3.
These are related by rotations of 120 degrees and have identical
coordinates except for a change of sign in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-direction.
Now the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate will be + or - &lt;math&gt;xc~*~\sin~120&lt;/math&gt;.
The &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate is cos~120.

Sines read down the table and cosines up.


With the MACROMODEL modelling system one would bet the icon for CH4
and prod one of the hydrogens with the 'Cl' icon.
The MM2 force-field could then be used to optimise the geometry.

====Benzene====

The calculation of the geometry for benzene is greatly simplified by placing the origin
at the centre of symmetry. The carbon atoms are 1.39 angstroms away from
the centre of symmetry and the hydrogens are 2.47 angstroms away.
The triangle formed between two adjacent carbons and the centre of symmetry is an
equilateral triangle.
Cos and sin of 60 can be used to calculate the coordinates of H2 and C2.
All the rest are related by sign changes.

One of the problems with the above coordinates which I worked out with
a calculator is the precision.
The atoms on the axes have infinite precision, (~zero|~), whereas the atom positions
worked out have only 4-figures, (atoms 2, 3, 5, and 6).
This manifests itself as a slight slippage from the full &lt;math&gt;D_{6}h&lt;/math&gt; symmetry,
which will cause degenerate orbitals and equal atomic properties
to be not quite equal.

Such unexpected occurrences in computational results are very common though
the effects of only finite precision on both input data and computation are
not usually serious.
In quantum chemistry we need larger than usual accuracy, obtained
by double precision arithmetic, because we are concerned with
differences in energy
between entities which contain large amounts of core electronic energy
which 'uses~up'
the left hand significant figures of the total energy.
(Compared with high energy phenomena most of chemistry is concerned
with small differences in energy.)
If you were working out the coordinates of a molecule containing
a phenyl group you would probably use the molecular modelling system
but there are cases where there is high symmetry
where you would start from highly symmetrical coordinates
as above.

Newman projection is the most useful for quantitative working
with dihedral angles. Programs exist to print out the dihedral
angles from crystal structures or MACROMODEL coordinates.
====Local Origins in Ring Systems====
It is often desirable to describe a subsystem and ''shunt''
it into geometrical position. This rotation / translation process
can be describes by a vector and three ''Euler Angles''.
A very suitable orientation for a model fragment is to make
any aromatic part as planar as possible, (perhaps by least squares
fitting). The origin of the cartesian system can be set to be the
centre of the ring defined by the ''centre of mass assuming all the ring
atoms to be carbon and no other atoms considered}. The
reason for this is obvious if one thinks of
a C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I- group. The centre of mass would be in the C-I bond and the
centre of the ring system is a much more practical origin.

There are many ways of defining the Euler Angles. QM uses
the three angles &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; which are
rotations about &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y^'&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;z^'&lt;/math&gt;   (i.e. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, new &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, then
the        new &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis.



&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;\cos (\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;th&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sin (\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;th&gt; 0
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\sin (\alpha) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;th&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cos (\alpha) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;th&gt; 0
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;0 &lt;th&gt; 0 &lt;th&gt; 1

&lt;/table&gt;


then

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt; \cos (\beta) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;th&gt; 0 &lt;th&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sin (\beta)  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;0 &lt;th&gt; 1 &lt;th&gt; 0
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\sin (\beta) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;th&gt; 0 &lt;th&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\cos (\beta)  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

then

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;\cos (\gamma) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;th&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sin (\gamma) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;th&gt; 0
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\sin (\gamma) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;th&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cos (\gamma) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;th&gt; 0
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;0 &lt;th&gt; 0 &lt;th&gt; 1
&lt;/table&gt;


Here is a piece of FORTRAN code for the resulting transformation
matrix from the product of these three rotations.



   tran (1,1) = (cos (alpha) * cos (beta) * cos (gamma)) _
   - sin (alpha) * sin (gamma)
   tran (2,1) = (cos (alpha) * cos (beta) * sin (gamma)) _
   + (sin (alpha) * cos (gamma))
   tran (3,1) = - cos (alpha) * sin (beta)
   tran (1,2) = - ( (sin (alpha) * cos (beta) * cos (gamma)) _
   +  ( cos (alpha) * sin (gamma))  )
   tran (2,2) = - ( sin (alpha) * cos (beta) * sin (gamma) ) _
   + ( cos (alpha) * cos (gamma) )
   tran (3,2) = sin (alpha) * sin (beta)
   tran (1,3) = sin (beta) * cos (gamma)
   tran (2,3) = sin (beta) * sin (gamma)
   tran (3,3) = cos (beta)

===The optimization===
Once you have your trial geometry, made by a graphical program or by trigonometry as describes previously one of the powerful quantum or molecular mechanics programs will solve the geometry
by minimizing the (3N-6) free coordinates.

In many cases this does not give a unique geometry only one of many possible ''conformations''.

===Frontier Orbital Theory===
(The Fukui Theory of Reactivity and Selection)

One of the most important pieces  of  information  which  can  be
obtained  from the molecular eigenvectors is the Fukui Reactivity
Indices. For normal conditions chemical reactivity there are  two
orbitals  which  are  specially  important,  the occupied orbital
which is highest in energy and the unoccupied  orbital  which  is
lowest  in  energy.  These  are known as the Frontier Orbitals as
they are either side of the occupied / virtual divide. (The empty
orbitals which are produced from  diagonalising  the  Fock-Matrix
are known as the virtual orbitals.)

The  terminology  your  will  come  across  is the HOMO,
Highest  Occupied  Molecular  Orbital,  and  the   LUMO,   Lowest
Unoccupied   Molecular  Orbital.  Initially  nucleophiles  attack
molecules by placing their surplus electrons, (typically a  lone-
pair  orbital), into the LUMO. The attacking lone pair orbital is
then involved as an electron  donor  and  the  LUMO  an  electron
acceptor. This is a description in the terminology of Perturbation
Molecular  Orbital  theory. Of course there is a symmetry here in
that what is nucleophilic attack by one molecule is electrophilic
attach by the other.

Chemical sense is used to decide which label
to place on the reaction but we now  have  a  quantitive  way  to
label  the reaction in terms of the HOMO and LUMO energies of the
reacting species.

In the Fukui theory   reactivity  indices
are  calculated  from  the  square  of  the  coefficients  of the
frontier orbitals. The nucleophilic reactivity indices come  from
the LUMO coefficients and the electrophilic from the HOMO.
For free radical attack the indices are

&lt;math&gt;
(c^2_{(HOMO)} + c^2_{(LUMO)}) / 2
&lt;/math&gt;

The reactivity of pyridine is discussed in Streitwieser and Heathcock p1022 onwards.
It can be seen from the charge densities that there is positive charge at the ortho
(2,5) and para (4) positions, negative charge at the meta (3) position.
Electrophiles overwhelmingly attack at the meta position. Both
the charge density and the frontier orbitals reinforce here. (The HOMO
orbital has equal 0.5 coefficients at ortho and meta positions, but
ortho is deactivated by being positively charged.

Nucleophiles attack the LUMO orbital at C2 or C6 (ortho).
The coefficients of LUMO at ortho and para are about equal but
the ortho position has a greater positive charge which presumably
makes it more attractive to electrophiles.
(This discussion is about the beginning of the reaction. Sometimes
factors which affect the transition state are more
important and the predictions from charge densities etc. may not apply
when the reaction has proceeded nearer the energy barrier.)
In many aromatic systems this kind of frontier orbital analysis
works well though.
With respect to our discussions of ab-initio quantum chemistry
often working in an empty universe with only two molecules involved,
it is quite encouraging that Hückel Theory can give rationalizations
of reactions which are going on in nitrating mixture, (conc. sulphuric
and nitric acids), at 100C plus.

===Charge Transfer Interactions===
The so called charge transfer complexes are particularly amenable to
frontier orbital analysis. In these complexes the acceptor's LUMO
is energetically and geometrically accessible to the donor's HOMO and
a small fraction of an electron (typically about 0.05) is passed across.
The complex has more conjugation than the separated systems and
this often moves the lowest excitation into
the visible region so charge-transfer complexes are frequently strongly
coloured. ( Streitwieser and Heathcock P.832.
===Properties Which can be Calculated by Quantum Mechanics===

====Molecular Geometries  and Force Constants.====

We have talked about this previously. It is of overriding importance
as molecules spend most of their time in the ground state equilibrium
geometry, so molecular geometry optimization is usually  the first process
in any modelling calculation.
The force constants lead to the normal coordinates which describe the
molecular vibrations.
The traversing of a reaction coordinate is sometimes described in rather sophisticated
treatments as a molecular vibration of the super-molecule.
(When calculating interactions between two molecules the geometry which represents
the two molecules in proximity is called the supermolecule.
The interaction energy is the energy of the supermolecule minus the sum
of the energies of the two free species.)

====Atomic Population Analysis and Dipole Moments.====

Atomic population analysis allows the assignment of &lt;math&gt;\delta^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta^-&lt;/math&gt; charges
to the component atoms.
This is the charge separation caused by the different electronegativities
of atoms in different environments.
e.g. Azulene which has only carbon and hydrogen atoms in it but has
a largeish dipole moment caused by quantum effects.
This chemical phenomenon is even accessible to the simplest
quantum method, H\&quot;uckel Theory.

As well as the contribution to the dipole from atomic charges there is
another contribution caused by distortion of charge on each atom. The semi-empirical programs separate
the dipole into these components by
labelling them 'POINT-CHARGE' and 'HYBRID' contributions.

Dipoles are often caused by electronegativity
differences between the component atoms of the molecule.
In some  cases however dipoles are caused by entirely electronic
quantum effects where the molecule is composed
of nothing but carbon and hydrogen.
A good example of this is azulene, a fused pair of a five and a
seven membered ring. The H\&quot;uckel 4~N~+~2 rule predicts the stability
of C6H6 (benzene), C7H7(+) (Tropylium), and C5H5(-) (cyclopentadienyl).
The chemistry of these compounds is in no conflict with the theory,
C5H5(-) being a stable very common ligand in inorganic chemistry,
(it is abbreviated Cp), Ferrocene Fe(C5H5)2 being the
first such 'sandwich' compound to be made.
Tropylium forms stable ionic salts, e.g. C7H7(+)Br(-).

====Electronic Spectra====

Electronic spectra can be investigated by several methods
the simplest of which  of which have the disadvantage that the wavefunction being
used is better for the ground state of the molecule
than the excited state and this introduces some imbalance into the
calculation.
Many ab-initio programs  now have MCSCF calculations
to explore such things analytically. It is however half a
PhD project to do it properly.

====Ionisation Potentials====

Ionisation potentials are often calculated by the approximate Koopmans'
Theorem.
This says that the ionisation potential of an electron in a given orbital
is just minus the orbital energy.
This is simple both to calculate and to interpret
but incorrect in that it takes no account of relaxation processes which occur.
When ionisation has happened the remaining N-1 electrons can relax to see
more of the positive nuclei rather than just staying where
they are.
This relaxation is effectively instantaneous on the laboratory
timescale and so the Koopmans energies are systematically too small.
This is the inverse of the process which makes excitation energies
in general too large when calculated in the virtual orbital
(VO) approximation.

The experimental technique for looking at ionization potentials
is ''photoelectron spectroscopy''.
This comes in several varieties with different acronyms such as ESCA.
The core (1s) ionization potential, despite  being tightly bound to the
nucleus and taking no part in chemical bonding is still subject
to a chemical shift. The simplest example of this is the azide anion, N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
It is charged


    - + -
    N=N=N


leading to two photoelectron spectrum peaks at -399eV and -405eV in the ratio
2:1. The practical non-SI unit of spectroscopy at this energy range is
the electron volt (eV),
1 eV = 96.4853 kJ per mole, and is about a quarter of the energy
needed to break a chemical bond.

====Electron Affinities and Excited States====

The same problem of using MO coefficents optimised by the SCF procedure
for the ground state configuration applies to the Electron Affinity and
to using the virtual orbitals as prototype excited states.
Nevertheless this is something which we often do as it is the simplest
picture and can be worked on using our readily available ground state
semi-empirical wavefunction.

The definitive solution to the above  problems is through the use of the
electron and polarization propagators.

===Problems===
====naphalene and azulene====
Use a molecular gui like  Macromodel make trial geometries for
naphalene and azulene. Optimise
the geometry. Do a single point calculation at the Huckel
level and at the AM1 semiempirical level.
(A single point calculation is the quantum mechanics at
a pre-specified geometry, in this case the MM2* geometry,
often either i) the gas phase experimental geometry, ii)
the crystal structure geometry from X-ray or neutron diffraction.

Look at the
orbital energies and node patterns. Locate both crystal
structures on the database and compare their characteristics
with the  MM2* geometry. Does azulene have C2v symmetry? It should
have experimentally in the gas phase but some methodologies
break the symmetry and produce only Cs symmetry with alternating
single and double bonds. There is a paper on the solution of this problem
at the Hartree-Fock level and with correlated methods. (Hartree-Fock
gets it wrong.) MP2 and above is right. If you were sufficiently
interested you could use a literature search program to find out if the correlated
single-determinant method DFT, (Density Functional Theory), gets
this structure right.

====VSEPR and electronic properties mini project====
This is a mini-project rather than a short problem and involves running
the  abinitio program of your choice.

The motivation of this computer experiment is to draw together various
threads from  chemistry about
shape, symmetry, electronegativity and electric moments so you
will have to consider things
like why UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is a gas and water and HF hydrogen bond
but in the context of
the rather   dry looking numbers from computer programs which actually
mean a lot and can match experiment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment involves  calculation of the electronic
structures of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, HF, BeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,
BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,
SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O  and IF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In order to complete this experiment you will need access to a modern
molecular quantum mechanics program.
You will need to do a bit of literature work and use some common sense to get
starting points and experimental numbers for comparison with theory.
Starting molecular geometries can always be either calculated or &lt;i&gt;estimated&lt;/i&gt; as the
ability to guess
what the value of a number might be approximately is a neccessary
scientific skill.
(Crude examples of this  are estimating a bond length as the
sum of the covalent radii of the atoms,
regardless of the environment of the atoms in the current
molecule or  saying that the
chemical shift of an atom is the usual average  for that
functional group,
in the same way as we habitually use &lt;I&gt;average&lt;/i&gt; bond energies.)
Reference  where you get your covalent radii from, there are
several sources.
You can start with the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,
BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
and IF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (the difficult unusual molecule).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unless you have a GUI you will need to learn a little bit about a file editor
to prepare data files.
&lt;i&gt;vi&lt;/i&gt; is one of several, &lt;i&gt;pico&lt;/i&gt; another.
You typically prepare a file for running and submit it to the batch system.
(Though many calculations will run in seconds, when preparing work for
publication you
must always use the best calculation you can afford, and these are
typically several hours or even days long.)
The quality of the calculation depends on the number of atom
based &lt;i&gt;basis orbitals&lt;/i&gt;
you put in and the cost of the calculations typically
increases by the number of
&lt;i&gt;basis orbitals&lt;/i&gt; to the power 3 and a bit. (You double the basis
and the calculation takes 8 times longer.)
In a Self Consistent Field (SCF) calculation the usual procedure
is to store the many
electron repulsion integrals created by the 1/r&lt;sub&gt;(1,2)&lt;/sub&gt;
operator in the Hamiltonian on
disc. This disc space then becomes a limiting resource which
stops the improvement of
the calculation. If you want to use lots of &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-orbitals on
I and &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbitals
on F in IF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; it will fail by filling the disc.
Even on NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; you might use the unfilled &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbitals in the basis
because they allow the nitrogen atom
(Another way of looking at this is that the shape of the lone pair and to a
lesser extent the tighter bonding orbitals is &lt;i&gt;improved&lt;/i&gt;
by the extra atomic orbitals.)
to be polarized in its bonded environment.
There is a mode of execution of most quantum chemistry programs
called &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt;.
In this case electron repulsion integrals  are calculated &lt;i&gt; on the fly&lt;/i&gt;
and not stored.
This causes the run to take much longer but not to require very much disc space.
(This same technique is always used when calculating the 3N-6  position
derivatives of electron
repulsion integrals
during a geometry optimisation as by using a matrix inversion
technique these are only required
once and not iterated with as in a SCF calculation).
If you are really fanatical about doing the definitive calculation
on a molecule you  might have to use &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt; and
a 32 hour run to use the largest basis to get the best possible calculation.
This is not however necessary to get something good out of this experiment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Estimate the bond lengths in these molecules by adding together the
covalent radii.
Find the experimental geometries of as many of them as you can.
(One of the best compilations of geometries is
Landolt-B&amp;ouml;rnstein.
Use your abinitio program to &lt;i&gt;optimize&lt;/i&gt; the geometries of the ones you cannot find an experimental geometry
for.
Here is the experimental geometry of XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O below.
The units are Angstrom, 10 to the -10 of a metre.
You will notice the experimental precision of the Xe=O bond length, and the artificially
high precision of the fluorine coordinates which have been subjected to a trigonometrical
calculation using 64-bit floating point accuracy!
(You will also notice the sloppy way the editor has not recorded the  terminal page number
of the pre-internet paper and so you might have to go to the library and look it up at some time.)

&lt;p&gt; Preparing data for programs like GAUSSIAN, DALTON, GAMESS or CADPAC can be difficult
If you have to use the raw data structure.
Most programs now have a GUI
by which the
data preparation can be simplified, even automated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Answer the following questions in a short report.
Give some references and use a style which includes the paper titles and
both starting and ending page numbers,
(just to get used to the fiddly style used by some journals which
waste your time if you loose the end
page number!).
Many Web and CD journals use this style as they are not wasting
paper but it actually does make the
reference list easier to navigate.
&lt;/p&gt;
(Q1) Report the first non-zero moment of these molecules &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;
if the molecule has a dipole moment, the dipole,
if it has a no dipole, the quadrupole. Two of these molecules are so
symmetrical that
they have no dipole or quadrupole.  What is the name of the next moment,
(rather obscure).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that for the dipole moment of XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O it is not
obvious which direction the dipole
will point as both fluorine and oxygen are electronegative and the
O-Xe-F angle is close to 90 degrees.
However as there is no symmetry along the O=Xe bond so there must be a
non-zero dipole.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Q2) What effect does the lack of a dipole or quadrupole have on the
physical properties of these
molecules?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Q3) If there is no dipole moment what forces cause the molecule to
condense from gas to a liquid,
(or in the case of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; straight to a solid at 1 atmosphere).
What is the relevance of this to the separation of the isotopes of Uranium?
Which two factors fortunately make this extreemly difficult,
(hint. &lt;i&gt;somebody's&lt;/i&gt; Law  is important in one, how you make Uranium a gas
in the other)?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The orbital energies are an approximation to the ionization  potential.
(Technically
this is known as Koopmans' Theorem.) The orbital energies are usually
in atomic units,
but experimentalists use the electron volt (eV).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Q4) See which electron
comes out first in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, HCl, IF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
Comment on what you expected and what actually happens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Q5) SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is 23900 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Calculate its infrared spectrum and look at the orbital energies to see how
the binding of electrons influences the molecule's reactivity.
Examine the vibrational &lt;i&gt;normal modes&lt;/i&gt; with respect to the group tables
in a book such as Atkins &lt;i&gt; Physical Chemistry&lt;/i&gt; or
Cotton &lt;i&gt; Group Theory&lt;/i&gt;. See how the
degeneracies in the group table correspond to both the vibrational
degeneracies
and the degeneracies in the ionization potentials and
therefore the photoelectron spectrum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Confirm the VSEPR rules by starting BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  and
AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from trigonal geometries like
ammonia. Hopefully this optimization will go planar!
Calculate the vibrational spectrum of these molecules in their
correct geometry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(Q6) Calculate the vibrational spectrum of flat ammonia and see what happens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are methods of estimating the moments of these molecules from
electronegativity and shape alone.

In general there are two geometries of the molecule we are
interested in. The experimental
equilibrium geometry and the optimised geometry of the
biggest calculation we can afford.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Q7) Calculate the proton and fluorine shieldings in the molecules which
have F and H.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Q8) Calculate the  (H,H) spin-spin coupling constant in NH3 and the (F,F)
constant in XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,
using the SCF wavefunction (as standard). If  you have the computing capacity
you could
calculate the  (H,H) spin-spin coupling constant with an
expensive electron correlated calculation,
which is actually necessary to get good answers for this
exotic property.

The Vim Tipbook is a collection of tips, hints and HowTos for using the [http://www.vim.org/ Vim text editor]. It is an outgrowth of the [http://vim.wikia.com/ Vim tips database] in a more flexible format, and also includes some helpful posts from the [http://www.vim.org/maillist.php Vim mailing lists].

For information on the general use of Vim, please see the [[Learning the vi Editor/Vim]].

== About this Book ==

=== Tips for Editing ===

* Where possible, extensive personal configurations should be avoided. Keep suggestions within the scope of a single tip. You may wish to link to several other tips that might be used alongside, much in the same way a food cookbook would suggest dishes that go well together.
* Always provide enough information so that a tip can be used from Vim's default &lt;tt&gt;compatible&lt;/tt&gt; settings.

=== Conventions Used ===

{{:Learning the vi Editor/Conventions}}

Where a series of commands are required to be entered, these might be listed in a preformatted block:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 {{Vi/Ex|set}} {{Vi/set|number}}
 {{Vi/Ex|set}} {{Vi/set|textwidth=70}}
 {{Vi/Ex|set}} {{Vi/set|wrap}}
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

Which will produce the following formatted text:

 {{Vi/Ex|set}} {{Vi/set|number}}
 {{Vi/Ex|set}} {{Vi/set|textwidth}}=70
 {{Vi/Ex|set}} {{Vi/set|wrap}}

== Vim Help ==

If you are new to vi, try the &lt;tt&gt;vimtutor&lt;/tt&gt; command. It's an excellent guide for the beginner.

Vim has an extensive help system. EVERYTHING is covered. This system is so extensive, however, that finding the needed information is sometimes akin to finding one's own little needle in a huge stack of hay. But even for that, there are Vim tools:

* (assuming &lt;tt&gt;'nocompatible'&lt;/tt&gt; is already set)

 {{Vi/Ex|set}} {{Vi/set|wildmenu}}

* Help tag completion: if you think 'foo' is part of something which has a hyperlink in the help system, use

 {{Vi/Ex|help}} foo{{Vi/key|Tab}}

:where &amp;lt;Tab&amp;gt; means &quot;hit the Tab key&quot;, and if there is only one possible completion Vim fills it in for you; if there is more than one the bottom status line is replaced by a menu which can be navigated by hitting the &amp;lt;Left&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;Right&amp;gt; arrow keys; accept a selection by hitting &amp;lt;Enter&amp;gt;, abort by hitting &amp;lt;Esc&amp;gt;.

* The &lt;tt&gt;:helpgrep&lt;/tt&gt; function: if you think that some regular expression describe text you want to search for in the text of all the help files, use

 {{Vi/Ex|helpgrep}} &amp;lt;pattern&amp;gt;

:where &amp;lt;pattern&amp;gt; is a Vim regular expression, like what you can use after / or ? . It may take some time for Vim to look up all its help files, and it may or may not display interim information which may require you to hit Enter to clear the &lt;tt&gt;|more-prompt|&lt;/tt&gt; (q.v.) When the blinking cursor reappears in your editfile, it means Vim has compiled the list of all help locations where your regexp matches. See them by means of the following 

  {{Vi/Ex|cfirst}} or :cr
  {{Vi/Ex|cnext}} or :cn
  {{Vi/Ex|cprevious}} or :cprev or :cN
  {{Vi/Ex|clast}} or :cla
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Inserting Text From a File or Register ==

If your text is in a file on its own, you can use &lt;tt&gt;:r&lt;/tt&gt; with a line number (the number of the line after which to insert, or &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; for &quot;before first line&quot;, or &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt; for &quot;after cursor line&quot;, or &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; for &quot;after last line&quot;; default is after cursor line) in the &quot;range&quot; position, i.e. just before the &lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt;. The file name comes as an argument at the end.

Example (after line 5):
&lt;pre&gt;
  5r ~/template.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;
If your text is in a register, you can use &lt;tt&gt;:put&lt;/tt&gt; with a line number (again) in the range position and the register name (including &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, which must be escaped as &lt;tt&gt;\&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, for the default register; or &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; for the system clipboard) after the &lt;tt&gt;:put&lt;/tt&gt;.

Example (before cursor line):
&lt;pre&gt;
  .-1put \&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can also insert a string directly using &lt;tt&gt;:put&lt;/tt&gt; and direct assignment:
&lt;pre&gt;
  :put ='This is text to insert.'
&lt;/pre&gt;
See
&lt;pre&gt;
  :help :read
  :help :put
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Full Screen Mode ==

To achieve a full screen editing window on any version of gvim you can do:

&lt;pre&gt;
  :set go-=m go-=T go-=l go-=L go-=r go-=R go-=b go-=F
  :set lines=999 columns=999
&lt;/pre&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;'guioptions'&lt;/tt&gt;: We remove the flags one-by-one to avoid problems if they appear in the option in a different order, or if some of them do not appear at all. By choosing which ones to remove (or not) you can customize your own flavour of &quot;full-screen Vim&quot;.
&lt;pre&gt;
  m   when present, menu bar is present
  T   when present, toolbar is present on versions which support it (W32, GTK1, GTK2, Motif, Photon, kvim)
  l   when present, left scrollbar is always present
  L   when present, left scrollbar is present if there is a vertical split
  r   when present, right scrollbar is always present
  R   when present, right scrollbar is present if there is a vertical split
  b   when present, bottom scrollbar is present
  F   when present, gvim (Motif) will display a footer
&lt;/pre&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;'lines'&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'columns'&lt;/tt&gt;: setting them to a large value will maximize the window.

For more, see:
&lt;pre&gt;
  :help 'guioptions'
  :help 'lines'
  :help 'columns'
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Ways of Farming &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Farming can be divided into two main sections, crop farming and animal husbandry. Both have been a major part of human development over last few thousand years. 

The first farming began in the Fertile Crescent located in present day Iraq and Syria, with wheat harvesting and the husbandry of sheep and goats around 8000BC. Agriculture was also developed independently in China and the New World at later dates.


==Animal Husbandry==
Organic farming according to Köpke (1990) comprises the principle of a precise organisation of an agronomically appropriate ( A. Young ), largely self-contained farm organisms. The overall concept makes the combination of plant production and animal husbandry, that is the traditional mixed farm or appropriate cooperations necessary.

Animal husbandry an important financial pillar of organically producing farms. Usually they earn more than 50% of their turnover with animal husbandry.

==Environmental Considerations==

===Soil Stability===

Soil erosion is a very important problem for agriculture today; it is caused by overgrazing and also by land clearing. 

To solve this problem trees can be planted on steep slopes, or in some cases types of grass such as Vetiver (a grass that grows on my types of soils).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Urdu there are only two genders: masculine and feminine. It is very difficult for a new user to differentiate between the two genders easily. There are some tricks to find out about them

Masculine Nouns:
Nouns ending in ''aa'' are normally masculine 

*دادا /Dadaa : Grandfather
*ابا/Abaa : Father
*بکرا /Bakraa : Male Goat

Feminine Nouns:
Nouns ending in ''ii'' are normally feminine

*دادی/dadii : grandmother
*بچی /bachii: girl

There may be some exceptions to these rules. For e.g friend or ''dost'' could be a girlfriend or boyfriend although the other part of the sentence may disclose the gender.

It is also possible to make a noun out of a verb. All verbs are normally masculine where used as infinitives. Some endings may be used to derive a noun from them

1. ''ii'', ''n'', ''hat'' and ''waat' may be used to make a feminine noun of a verb

*مسکرانہ/muskaraana : muskrarahat


2.  ''oo'', 'pan',  may be used to make a masculine noun of a given verb  

===Explanation===
In Urdu, there are only '''two''' genders. All male human beings and male animals (or those animals and plants which are perceived to be &quot;masculine&quot;) are '''masculine'''. All female human beings and female animals (or those animals and plants which are perceived to be &quot;feminine&quot;) are '''feminine'''. Things, inanimate articles and abstract nouns are also either masculine or feminine according to convention, which must be ''learnt by heart'' by Urdu speakers. The ending of a word, if a vowel, usually helps in this gender classification. Words if they end in ''ā'', are normally masculine. If a word ends in ''ī'' or ''in'', it is normally feminine. 

Urdu is a weakly inflected language; the relationship of a noun in a sentence is usually shown by '''[[postposition]]s''' [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositional_case]] (i.e., prepositions that ''follow'' the noun). Urdu language has three cases for nouns. The '''[[direct case]]''' [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_case]] is used for nouns not followed by any postpositions, typically for the subject case. The '''[[oblique case]]'''  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_case]] is used for any noun that is followed by a postposition. Some nouns have a separate '''[[vocative case]]'''.  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocative_case]]  Urdu has two numbers: singular and plural — but they may not be shown distinctly in all declinations. Note that some people nasalize the case ending of the vocative plural case too. The following patterns are perceived from Tiwari ([1966] 2004).

====1. Masculine nouns ending in ''ā''====
This category includes masculine nouns ending in ''ā'', 
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
!
!colspan=&quot;4&quot;| لڑکا / ''larkā'' — a boy
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| ||colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Declined form ||colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Case suffix
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| ||Singular||Plural||Singular||Plural
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''Direct'''|| لڑکا / ''larkā'' || لڑکے / ''larke'' ||- ||''e ''
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''Oblique'''|| لڑکے / ''larke'' || لڑکوں / ''larkoⁿ'' ||''e''  ||''oⁿ'' 
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''Vocative'''|| لڑکے / ''larke'' || لڑکو / ''larko'' ||''e''  ||''o''
|-
|}

this is very trustworthy
====3. Feminine nouns ending in short ''i'', long ''ī'' and ''iyā''====
This pattern includes all feminine nouns that end in short ''i'' (جاتی / ''jāti''), long ''ī'' (بیٹی / ''betī'') and ''iyā'' (چِڑِیا / ''chiriyā'')

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
!
!colspan=&quot;4&quot;|  &lt;br&gt; بیٹی / ''betī'' — a daughter, &lt;br&gt; چڑیا / ''chiriyā'' — a small bird
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| ||colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Declined form ||colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Case suffix
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| ||Singular||Plural||Singular||Plural
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''Direct'''|| جاتی / ''jāti'', &lt;br&gt; بیٹی / ''betī'', &lt;br&gt; چڑیا / ''chiriyā''|| جاتیاں / ''jātiyāⁿ'', &lt;br&gt; بیٹیاں / ''betiyāⁿ'', &lt;br&gt; چڑیاں / ''crṛiyāⁿ''||- ||''yāⁿ'' 
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''Oblique'''|| جاتی / ''jāti'', &lt;br&gt; بیٹی / ''betī'',  چڑیا / ''chiriyā''|| جاتیؤں / ''jātiyoⁿ'', &lt;br&gt; بیٹیؤں / ''betiyoⁿ'', &lt;br&gt; چڑیؤں / ''chiriyoⁿ''||-  ||''yoⁿ'' 
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''Vocative'''|| جاتی / ''jāti'', &lt;br&gt; بیثی / ''betī'', &lt;br&gt; چڑیا / ''chiriyā''|| جاتیؤ‎ / ''jātiyo'', &lt;br&gt; بیٹیؤ / ''betiyo'', &lt;br&gt; چڑیؤ / ''chiriyo''||-  ||''yo'' 
|-
|}

Note:
#Except for the null case-suffix, the ending vowel long ''ī'' changes into short ''i'' before adding the case-suffix, as the case may be. This is reflected both in pronunciation and in spelling.
#Except for the null case-suffix, the semivowel ''y'' is inserted after the short ''i'' of the primary morpheme and before the case suffix for ''i''- and ''ī''-ending nouns. This is reflected in spelling clearly, though in pronunciation, the ''y'' may vanish to give a gliding diphthong instead.
#Except for the null case-suffix, the ending syllable ''yā'' is dropped before adding the case-suffix in ''iyā''-ending nouns.

alot of exceptions do require to this rule
====5. Nouns from Persian====
An example of a Hindustānī (Hindī-Urdū) masculine word of Persian origin is given below. By the Hindustānī speakers, it is usually declined like any other consonant ending masculine noun.
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
!
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Masculine (''Persian'')
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
|
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;| کاغذ / ''kāġaz''&lt;br&gt; a paper
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| ||Singular||Plural
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''Direct'''|| کاغذ / ''kāġaz''|| کاغذات / ''kāġazāt''
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''Oblique'''|| کاغذ / ''kāġaz''|| کاغذاتوں / ''kāġazātoⁿ''
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''Vocative'''|| کاغذ / ''kāġaz''|| کاغذاتو / ''kāġazāto''
|-
|}

Some other plural-forming suffixes include -ान / ان- / ''-ān'' and irregular plurals (especially from Arabic), etc. E.g.,  صاحب / ''sāhib'' (&quot;boss or sir&quot;) →  صاحبان / ''sāhibān'', حاکم / ''hākim'' (&quot;officer&quot;) →  حکام / ''hukkām''.

      <comment>/* Some common Greetings */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Normally when one refer to an unknown person or an elder one, one always says ''aap'' the formal ''you''. On the other hand, ''tum'' is used as an informal 'you'. ''Tum'' is also used for friends, intimate relationships and also for children and other people who may be younger than the speaker. Sometimes other words also may be used to refer to people like 'Sahab Jii(Male)', ''Bhai Sahab(Male)'', ''Bhai Jee(Male)'', ''Bahan Jii(Female)'', ''Aunty(Female)'', ''Nana(Old Male)'' and ''Sir Jii(in office for Male)''.

Greetings in Urdu are either related to religion or otherwise non-religious. Normally 'Assalam-o-alakium', a religious greeting, is still the most common greeting for all age groups, ''kya haal hay(how are you?)'' is also commonly used among the new generation. 

Normally Greetings have a great difference in East and West. In west, ''good morning'', ''Bon Appetit'', ''Thank You'', ''Sorry'', ''You are welcome'' have become mandatory. As Allama Iqbal said, the West is nothing but Tukaluf(Greetings), East is just the opposite. In Eastern Culture, if you will say ''Thank you'' unnecessarily, they may be become angry. Normally if a person is mute, it means that you are affirmative to the situation. In Pakistan, if somebody will feel bad, he will say it of course. 

''Accha'' and ''Haan'' is the most commonly used word for affirmation or confirming that one is understood with the situation. The older generation who migrated from India to Pakistan uses mostly 'Thiik Hay''.

Since there is no equivalent of AM or PM in Hindi we have to mention the time of the day along with the specific clock time. For example if we have to say 3 AM, the Hindi equivalent will be रात के/में तीन बजे which literally means 3 o'clock of/in night.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Urdu is a very soft spoken language.  It is not very difficult to learn its Grammar.  Many foreigners pick up simple sentences very fast.  The only difficulty is to learn new vocabulary and pronounce words clearly.  Lists of vocabulary have been sorted by subject to make it easy for a new Urdu speaker to learn the most common words.  One should try to speak as often as possible.  German, Russian and Chinese speakers will find it difficult to pronounce the words correctly.

== General Overview ==

'''''Knockturn Alley''''' is a street of shops and vendors specializing in the darker forms of magic. The one shop named on this street is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin and Burkes]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

As there is a part of London where regular wizards can go to buy magical equipment, namely [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], so must there be a place where dark wizards carry out their business. Knockturn Alley (pun: &quot;nocturnally&quot;) is that place. Shunned by all right-thinking wizards, Knockturn Alley is the place where you would go to buy a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hand of Glory|Hand of Glory]], Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent, or &quot;things that looked alarmingly like whole human fingernails&quot;. It holds a certain illicit glamour for young wizards, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]], who (once they set up shop) likely use certain ingredients available only there for some of the magic that they sell in their store. 

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo powder]] to get to Diagon Alley, he apparently travels &quot;one grate too far&quot;, accidentally turning up in Borgin and Burkes, on Knockturn Alley. He is led out of Knockturn Alley and back to Diagon Alley by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who had gone to get some flesh-eating slug repellant. Later, when the party breaks up to do their separate shopping errands, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] feels she has to warn the twins not to go into Knockturn Alley.

At one point when the Weasley family are preparing to visit Diagon Alley to buy school supplies, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] again explicitly warns [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]] not to enter Knockturn Alley.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] sneak off from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] and follow [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] into Knockturn Alley. They then eavesdrop on him as he talks to Borgin about something he is buying, using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ears]]. Hermione's subsequent attempt to determine what it was that Draco was interested in fails, as she is not good at that kind of subterfuge.

== Analysis ==

Many readers must wonder why such a hot-bed of Dark magic is allowed to remain so close to the main mercantile center of Wizarding London. Would it not be better to eliminate it and the associated Dark enterprises? Likely it has not been cleaned up for the same reason that spymasters are allowed to stay in business when they are known &amp;mdash; if you keep all your evil-doers in one place, it is much easier to keep track of them.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Though we only enter Knockturn Alley twice, we visit Diagon Alley in five of the seven books. (Mrs. Weasley does the school shopping in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' and ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''.) With the ascendancy of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], Diagon Alley gets successively less cheerful. By the time of our visit in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', there seems to be little difference between Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley, and by the time of our visit in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], the only difference seems to be that there are more shuttered or boarded up places of business in Diagon Alley.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ukrainian dance is an art form practiced and performed both in Ukraine and throughout the Ukrainian diaspora.  In spite of its widespread popularity, there are few English-language resources available to guide dancers and assist instructors.  The few that do exist, while good, lack photographs of dance steps being performed and other features that would help explain how a step is to be performed.  Added to this, English-speaking Ukrainian dancers lack a common dance vocabulary.  A single step may be referred to by more than one Ukrainian term (with various anglicized spellings), and by various English-language names.  

The aim of this book is to provide a resource for Ukrainian dancers and instructors.  It will complement and expand on the work of other authors by including both textual descriptions of steps and photographs illustrating how a step should be performed.

Descriptions of dance steps will use the following template: [[/Template:Steps/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Indonesian/Lessons/Introductory/Header}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;


=== Examples ===
Three ways to pronounce ''e'':
# bel ( = bell )
# lebih ( = more )
# beda ( = different )

Two ways to pronounce ''o'':
# toko ( = shop )
# [[media:indonesian-bola.ogg|bongkah]] ( = lump )

== Catatan ''(Note)'' ==
The Indonesian language lacks the letters ''q'', ''v'', ''x'', and ''z''. These letters were incorporated to accommodate foreign words. Even ''f'' is due to the influence of the Arabic alphabet.

A pair of the same vowel in succession are pronounced differently than just prolonging the vowel sound; rather, there is a slight pause between the vowels. For example: The word [[media:indonesian-maaf.ogg|''maaf'']], which means ''sorry'', is pronounced as ''ma'' (slight pause) ''af''.

There are four compound consonants (diphthongs): ''ng'', ''ny'', ''kh'', and ''sy''. Although they do not constitute new letters, they are pronounced differently:

&lt;table class=wikitable align=top&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Compound''&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;''Pronunciation''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;''IPA''&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;''Sound''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[media:indonesian-ng-sound.ogg|ng]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;eng&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[&amp;#331;] (not[&amp;#331;&amp;#609;])&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Like the soft ''ng'' in English, e.g. ''banging'', ''singing''. It is incorrect to pronounce it like ''bingo'' or ''mango'' (i.e. the ''hard ng''). To pronounce the ''hard ng'', we would use ''ngg'' instead (which are not considered as compound by itself).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[media:indonesian-ny-sound.ogg|ny]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;nye&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[&amp;#626;]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Like the ''ny'' in ''canyon''. Much like the &amp;ntilde; sound in Spanish.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[media:indonesian-kh-sound.ogg|kh]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;kha&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[x]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Like the ''ch'' in ''Lochness'', or soft ''g'' in Spanish: ''gente''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;sy&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sya&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[&amp;#643;]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Like the ''sh'' in ''shoe'' or ''ship''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As is the case with the standalone letters, only ''ng'' and ''ny'' are native to Indonesian. Both ''kh'' and ''sy'' only appear in words with Arabic origin.

=== Examples ===
[[media:indonesian-sungai.ogg|Sungai]] (= River) &amp;rarr; ''Soft ng''&lt;br&gt;
[[media:indonesian-bangga.ogg|Bangga]] (= Proud) &amp;rarr; ''Hard ng'', note the ''ngg''&lt;br&gt;
[[media:indonesian-banyak.ogg|Banyak]] (= A lot)&lt;br&gt;
[[media:indonesian-akhir.ogg|Akhir]] (= End)&lt;br&gt;
[[media:indonesian-khalik.ogg|Khalik]] (= The Creator/God, mainly used in poems)&lt;br&gt;

[[Indonesian/Lesson 0 Exercise|Go to Exercise: Indonesian Rhymes]]


==Tahu &amp; tahu==

Tahu meaning ''know'': the h is silent, and the word is pronounced to rhyme with ''bau'' (smell) (i.e. similarly to the English word Tao (Chinese philosophy).)

Tahu meaning ''tofu'' is pronounced &quot;tah-who&quot;

You can practice saying &quot;Saya tidak tahu. Saya bukan tahu.&quot; The pronunciation should be different in the two cases.

==Final ''ai''==

In everyday Indonesian, the &quot;ai&quot; at the end of a root word is pronounced as e or ek (the k being a glottal stop, not an aspirated k). In informal writing (e.g. email) Indonesians sometimes spell this way as well, e.g. ''capek'' instead of ''capai''.

==Teacher's notes==
It is advisable to distribute this material through other lessons, rather than learning all these exceptions at once.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Abstract types and abstract data types=

The title of this page was named (I corrected it) &quot;Pure abstract classes (interfaces or ADT's (abstract data types) )&quot;

Pure abstract classes are the way to implement &quot;abstract types&quot; not &quot;abstract data types&quot;. The two concepts are extremely different. Lets see what says the google bot with the define keyword:

;Abstract type:

A type declared using the reserved word abstract. Only abstract types can have abstract operations. You cannot declare objects belonging to an abstract type; the purpose of an abstract type is to act as the parent for a class of derived types.
www.it.bton.ac.uk/staff/je/adacraft/glossary.htm

;Abstract data type:

A type whose implementation details are hidden and can only be handled using the publicly accessible operations provided for it. Not to be confused with abstract type.
www.it.bton.ac.uk/staff/je/adacraft/glossary.htm

Moreover an interface is not the same to abstract type, they are implemented in the same way in c++, but the two concepts differ.

=Mandating base classes to be Pure=

Im not at all sure about this assertion:

&quot;Note that there is a great temptation to add concrete member functions and data to pure abstract base classes. This must be resisted, in general it is a sign that the interface is not well factored. Data and concrete member functions tend to imply a particular implementation and as such can inherit from the interface but should not be that interface. Instead if there is some commonality between concrete classes, creation of abstract class which inherits its interface from the pure abstract class and defines the common data and member functions of the concrete classes works well.&quot;

There are two reasons why I disagree with this advice:
* There are plenty if design patterns that require implemented functions within the base class, for example the Template Method pattern - f() is non virtual, but uses virtual g() and virtual h() to do work, the user is responsible for deriving a class and implementing these virtual functions; and
* There are plenty of libraries out there that buck this advice - for example, the QObject in Qt is actually quite heavy weight and provides a lot of facilities for both derived objects and clients of the object. There would be all kinds of use cases that wouldnt be possible if QObject was pure.

This advice makes perfect sense when you are describing something akin to a callback interface, or when implementing something following the Strategy or State patterns. Its just that a blanket statement that &quot;Its bad, do do it. Ever&quot; doesnt work.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ukrainian dance is believed to have originated out of the religious and cultural beliefs, and social customs, of the early Slavic peoples who lived in what is now Ukraine.  In the Twentieth Century, it evolved from a form of social dance into a staged form.  A more detailed account of the development of Ukrainian dance can be found on [[w:Ukrainian_dance|Wikipedia]], or in the books listed in [[../Other Resources/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
This section defines basic dance terms that will be used to describe dance steps.  Most of these terms are derived from French ballet terms.  A good reference book on ballet barre routines will provide additional information.


== Placement ==
'''Supporting Leg''' - this is the leg which is bearing the dancer's weight.  May be abbreviated '''SL'''.

'''Working Leg''' - this is the leg that is not bearing weight, and which is used to perform a movement while the dancer's weight is on the supporting leg.  May be abbreviated '''WL'''.


== Foot Positions ==
'''First Position''' - feet are placed with heels touching and toes extended outward (turned out) forming an angle.  Weight should be balanced evenly between toes and heels.

'''Second Position''' - feet are placed shoulder-width apart, with the feet turned out so that the heels are closer together than the toes.  Weight should be balanced evenly on both feet.

'''Third Position''' - feet are placed so that the heel of one foot is touching the instep of the other foot.  Toes should be turned out.  Weight should be balanced evenly between both feet.  Usually, the right heel touches the instep of the left foot, but the position may be reversed.

'''Fourth Position''' - feet are placed so that one foot is extended forward and slightly in front of the other foot.  The gap between the feet is roughly the length of the dancer's foot.  The feet should be turned out.  Weight should be balanced evenly between both feet.  Usually, the right foot is extended forward, but the position may be reversed.

'''Fifth Position''' - feet are placed so that the heel of one foot is touching the outside of the big toe of the other foot.  The feet should be turned out.  Weight should be balanced evenly between both feet.  Usually, the right foot is in front, but the position may be reversed.

'''Sixth Position or First Position Parallel''' - feet are placed next to one another, with toes and heels touching.


== Arm Positions - Individual ==
'''Hands or fists on hips -''' Hands or fists are placed on the waist, resting just above the hip bones.  Elbows are pushed slightly forward.  For hands on hips, fingers should be held tightly together, and should be pointing towards the belly button.  The thumbs extend backwards, behind the waist.  Hands on hips is the default hand position in Central Ukrainian dances.  Fists on hips is typical of Western Ukrainian regions.

'''First Position -'''Both hands and arms are positioned in front of the body, level with the waist.&lt;br&gt;
* '''Open variation -'''  Arms are straight and extended directly in front of the body, forming a slight angle.  Hands are level with the waist.  Palms are turned up, and elbows are turned under.  Hands should be open and flat, with fingers held tightly together.  This is the most commonly used form of first position in Ukrainian dancing.  It is usually used by girls.
*'''Closed variation -''' This variation is similar to first position in ballet.  Arms are rounded (elbows slightly bent), and elbows are turned outward from the body.  Hands are turned so that the palms face the body.  Fingers should come close to meeting.  Dancers may want to visualize holding a large sack of potatoes in their arms.

'''Second Position -''' Arms are extended to the sides of the body, slightly below shoulder level.&lt;br&gt;
* '''Open variation -'''  Arms are straight and extended outwards to the sides.  Hands should be open and flat, with fingers held tightly together.  Palms are usually turned up.  This is the most commonly used form of second position in Ukrainian dancing.
*'''Closed variation -''' This variation is similar to second position in ballet.  Arms are rounded (elbows bent), and elbows are turned towards the back.  Hands are turned so that the palms face forward.  

'''Second Position with arms at waist -''' Arms are extended to the sides of the body, at waist level.  Arms are straight and palms face upwards.  This position is usually used by boys.

'''Third Position -''' One arm is extended forward in front of the body, while the other arm is extended to the side.  Both arms are held level with the chest, or slightly below shoulder level.  The arms should be placed in reverse of the feet, so that, if the right foot is in front of the left, the left arm is extended in front and the right arm is extended to the side.&lt;br&gt;
* '''Open variation -'''  The forward arm (left arm) is straight and extended directly in front of the body.  The other arm (right arm) is straight and extended to the side, slightly below shoulder level.  Palms are turned up.  This position is seldom seen in Ukrainian dance.
*'''Closed variation -''' This variation is similar to third position in ballet.  Arms are rounded (elbows bent) and palms are turned inward.

'''Third Position with palms up -''' One arm is extended forward in front of the body, while the other arm is extended to the side.  Both arms are held level with the chest, or slightly below shoulder level.  Both arms are slightly bent, with the elbows pointing downward.  Palms are raised, and turned away from the face.  The dancer should appear as though shying away from someone or pushing away from something.  This position is used only by girls.

'''Fourth Position''' - One arm is raised over the head, while the other arm is extended to the side.  In Ukrainian dance, the arm that is raised is usually on the same side as the supporting leg.  The arm that is extended to the side is on the same side as the working leg.&lt;br&gt;
* '''Open variation -'''  One arm is straight and extended upwards towards the ceiling, at an angle slightly more than 90 degrees.   Palm is turned in.   The other arm is straight and extended to the side, slightly below shoulder level.  Palm is turned up.  
*'''Closed variation -''' This variation is similar to fourth position in ballet.  Arms are rounded (elbows bent).  The palm of the raised arm is turned inward, while the palm of the other arm is turned forward.  In ballet, the raised arm is usually on the same side as the forward foot.

'''Fourth Position with hand in front - ''' One arm is raised over the head, while the other arm is extended forward, as in first position.  The raised arm is straight and extended upwards towards the ceiling, at an angle slightly more than 90 degrees, and the palm is turned in.  The forward arm is straight and extended forward at chest level with the palm turned up. The arm that is raised is usually on the opposite side as the supporting leg.

'''Fourth Position with hand on hip -''' One arm is raised over the head, while the hand of the other arm is placed on the waist (see &quot;hands on hips&quot; above).  The raised arm is straight and extended upwards towards the ceiling, at an angle slightly more than 90 degrees, and the palm is turned in.  The arm that is raised is usually on the same side as the supporting leg.  

'''Fifth Position''' - Both arms are raised above the head.&lt;br&gt;
* '''Open variation -'''  Both arms are straight and extended upwards towards the ceiling, at a slight angle.   Palms are turned in.    
*'''Closed variation -''' This variation is similar to fifth position in ballet.  Arms are rounded (elbows bent).  Palms are turned inward and fingers should be almost touching above the head.

'''Arms crossed -''' Arms are crossed in front of the chest.  They may either be held up and away from the body, or rest against the chest.

'''Hands on beads -''' One or both hands is placed over the dancer's necklace.  Hands should be flat.  Elbows should be held away from the body and pushed slightly upward.  This position is used only by girls.
* If only one hand is being placed on the necklace, the other hand is usually place on the waist (see &quot;hands on hips&quot; above).  Usually the hand placed on the necklace is on the same side as the working leg, while the hand placed on the waist is usually on the same side as the supporting leg.

'''Chin on hand -'''  The left arm (same side as supporting leg) is bent and hand is placed to support the head, either with the chin resting on the back of the fingers, with the chin resting in the palm of the hand, or with the hand closed and one finger extended up against the cheek.  The right arm (same side as working leg) is bent and placed so that the back of the hand supports the elbow of the other arm.  The positions of the arms may be reversed if the right leg is the supporing leg and the left leg is the working leg.  This position is used only by girls.

'''Hands on belt -''' Hands are positioned to hold onto the front of the &quot;poyas&quot; or belt.  Elbows are pushed slightly forward. If only one hand is placed on the belt, the other should be placed in a fist in the small of the back. This position is used most often by boys.  It may also be used by girls in dances from Hutzulshchyna.

'''Hands behind back -''' Hands are placed behind the small of the back, with one hand holding the other hand.  Alternatively one hand could hold the wrist of the other arm. The hand of the second arm should be placed in a fist.  

'''Hands behind head -''' One or both arms are raised with the elbows bent.  Hands are placed behind the dancer's head, at the base of the head (where it meets the neck).  Elbows should be held out, away from the head.  This position is most often used by boys. It is seldom used by girls.
* If only one hand is placed behind the dancer's head, the other hand should be placed on the waist (see &quot;hands on hips: above).

'''Hands hooked on vest -''' There are two common variations of this position.  In the first variation, the dancer hooks his or her thumbs into the armholes of his/her vest.  In the second varation, the dancer uses the index finger of each hand to grab onto the inside of the lapel of the vest, usually just above the ties that close the vest.  In both variations, elbows are held away from the body, at shoulder height or just below shoulder height.  This position is used most often in dances from Hutzulshchyna, although the first variation is also found in dances from Bukovynia.  If the dancers are not wearing a vest, they can tuck their thumbs into their armpits.

== Arm Positions - Couples and Groups ==
'''Hands crossed in front - couple''' - Two dancers stand next to one another, both facing the same direction.  The dancers join right hands, holding hands in front of the person to the right.  Then the dancers hold on to each other's left hand, holding hands in front of the person to the left.  The left arm is crossed over the right arm.

'''Hands crossed in front - three or more''' - Three or more dancers stand in a line, all facing the same direction.  With the right hand, each dancer holds on to the left hand of the person two over to the right.  With the left hand, each dancer holds on to the right hand of the person two over to the left.  Left arms are crossed in front of right arms.

'''Hands crossed in front - turning''' - Two dancers stand facing one another.  Each dancer holds her arms out in front of her and crosses the right wrist over the left wrist.  The dancers then join hands, joining right hand to right hand and left hand to left hand.  The dancers perform dorizhka or kolomyikovi podskok (hops) to the right while leaning away from one another.  This position is usually performed by two girls.

'''Holubchyks - clockwise''' - Two dancers stand slightly to the right of one another, facing one another.  Each dancer places his or her right arm across the front of the other dancer, and places his/her hand on the other dancer's waist.  The left arm is held in fifth position.  The two dancers look at one another.  This position is typical of Central region dances.  The dancers will usually perform bihunets, and turn in a clockwise direction (moving forward).

'''Holubchyks - counter-clockwise''' - Two dancers stand slightly to the left of one another, facing one another.  Each dancer places his or her left arm across the front of the other dancer, and places his/her hand on the other dancer's waist.  The right arm is held in fifth position.  The two dancers look at one another.  This position is typical of Central region dances.  The dancers will usually perform bihunets, and turn in a counter-clockwise direction (moving forward).


== Movements ==
'''Grand Plié''' - The dancer bends his or her knees and decends towards the floor.  If performed in any foot position except second position, the dancer lifts the heels off the floor.  The calves and thighs should not touch.  In second position, the dancer decends as far as possible without lifting the heels from the floor.  Back should remain straight throughout the movement.

'''Demi-Plié''' - The dancer bends his or her knees and decends towards the floor.  In any foot position except second position, the dancer decends as far as possible without lifting the heels off of the floor.  In second position, the dancer decends half-way to the point where it is not possible to go any further without lifting the heels off of the floor.

'''Spotting''' - A dancer &quot;spots&quot; while performing a turn.  The basic technique is to turn the head and fix the eyes on a spot on the wall, and then turn the body to meet up with the head.  This prevents the dancer from moving in the wrong direction on stage, and prevents dizziness.  The following bullets describe how spotting is used with various stationary turns.
* '''Quarter turns''' -- before the first count, the dancer turns the head to the side (looking over the shoulder), and fixes his or her eyes on a spot on the wall.  On the count, the dancer turns his or her body to meet up with the head.  The dancer has performed one-quarter of a rotation.  The dancer repeats this movement three more times to complete one rotation.
* '''Half turns''' -- before the first count, the dancer turns the head towards the back and fixes his or her eyes on a spot on the back wall.  On the count, the dancer turns his or her body to meet up with the head.  The dancer has performed one-half of a rotation.  The dancer repeats this movement one more time to complete one rotation.
* '''Full turns''' -- before the first count, the dancer turns the head towards the back.  At the point where the dancer can look no further, the dancer begins to turn both the head and the body (the head leads the body).  As the head comes around to the front, the dancer fixes his or her eyes on a spot on the front wall.  The dancer then completes the turn on the count, bringing the body in line with the head.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===

===Mouth===
The mouth, also known as the buccal cavity or the oral cavity, is the orifice through which an animal takes in food and water.

Chewing is the first step in digestion:
*Lips
*Teeth  (Incisors, Canines, Molars,Premolars etc.)
*Jaw (Mandible)(Maxilary) 
*Hard Palate/ Soft Palate 
*Saliva (contains the enzymes salivary amylase, lysozyme, and lingual lypase)
*Pharynx


Most animals have a complete digestive system, with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. Which end forms first in ontogeny is a criterion used to classify animals into protostome and deuterostome. In arthropods, they are external modified legs; in gnathostomata vertebrates they are internal.

===Oesophagus===
Made of three different types of muscle

===Stomach===
*Cardiac region
*Fundus
*Body
*Pylorus
*Cardiac Sphincter
*Pyloric Sphincter

===Small Intestine===

*Duodenum
*Jejunum
*Ileum

===Liver===
*Produces bile by hepatocytes

Hepatocytes will then secrete the bile to the canaliculi of the liver. The flow of bile will continue to the right and left hepatic ducts which will meet at the common hepatic duct -&gt; cystic duct -&gt; gallbladder for storage. Then when bile is needed for digestion of fats, bile will empty from the gallbladder through the cystic duct -&gt; common bile duct -&gt; sphincter of oddi -&gt; duodenum
Bile helps in the digestion of fatty acids in food

===Gall Bladder===

*Stores bile which is made by the liver. Patients who undergo cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) will have normal digestive function as bile drains through the common bile duct into the duodenum.

===Pancreas===
Located near the duodenum to empty pancreatic enzymes, and bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid from the antrum.

Histology

Islets of Langerhan have alpha and beta cells that are responsible for maintaining the glucose concentration in the plasma. Alpha cells secrete glucagon and beta cells secrete insulin. These hormones are involved in the endocrine system.

Acinar cells will secrete enzymes that will help with digestion. These enzymes are released in an inactive form.

===Large Intestine===
*Cecum
*Verminform appendix
*Colon
Ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoidal
Also contains epiploic appendanges and taenia coli - bands of muscles
Note the haustra - individual pouches formed by the taenia coli
*Rectum 
*Anus

===Anus===
It is the last portion of digestive system. Disposes solid wastes.

''If you can, please help by adding Thai script to the table below.''

==Learn by association== 
Here are some Thai words that sound something like English words, and so can be easy to remember. It helps if you create a vivid image in your mind connecting the meaning of the word with the sound. Concentrate on it for a few seconds, and test yourself or at least revise it later on, to fix it in your memory. It may help if you [[#Use stories|use stories]]. 

Some of the associations presented are slightly 'off the wall'. Some have a lavatorial humor to them. This is not intended to offend. For me such things make the learning 'more fun' ( ''mor fun'' = DENTIST ).

This will give you a head start, but you still need to learn pronunciation and tones.

When considering a link between meaning and trigger images within your mind, do note that recalling human faces, animals of all kinds and sometimes plants is far easier than remembering inanimate objects such as table, stone, bed etc. So when you create an association, do include something living with notable physical features (doesn't have to be grounded in reality!) in the scene. Doing this will enable you to achieve at least 90% instant two way (from definition or from pronunciation) recall from a list of 1,000 common words, and more. 

The Thai language contains a few alphabet letters which sound basically the same. Consequently, words with different spelling but with the same vowel length and tone may be pronounced the same way while having a different initial consonant. Fortunately, in Thai every letter has a word associated with it and these are depicted on all Thai alphabet tables. To differentiate the words in your mind, simply add the meaning of the initial consonant to something in your association. For example: 

- ท or ''toh'' is called ท ทหาร or ''toh tahaan'' and ทหาร means soldier or army. To know the word you are creating a link for begins with ท, simply add something of a military nature to your scene. This could be anything associated with soldiers such as uniform, rifle, vehicle, warrior, medal etc. This categorization process will serve you well in terms of ease of recall down the road, regardless of word similarity, once you have over 500 words memorized. 

The reason for this is because categorization = organization. Your mind can be the most organized filing cabinet or the most untidy one. Imagine you are a clerk at an office and your job is to fetch files from a huge cabinet and put others back for your boss 8 hours a day. If the files are not stored systematically, you will eventually find the file you require but it may take you all day to find that one file your angry boss told you to find in the morning. 

It is therefore recommended that for every word you create an association for, you should embed the meaning of the initial consonant into the scene in a subtle fashion. When it is time to recall a meaning or a pronunciation, your mind will be able to immediately eliminate all the irrelevant files and concentrate on searching more efficiently through relevant information only.

When a word with the same initial and final consonant sounds similar to another but has a different meaning because there is a long vowel instead of a short vowel, you may distinguish the two in your mind by thinking of a long path, long rope or long anything to depict a longer sound and vice versa for short vowels.

==Notes on spelling== 
These are given in romanised spelling, but it is recommended that you learn to read and write Thai using Thai characters. 

There is no official standard way to write Thai in Roman characters. Pronouncing Thai correctly can be a challenge. As in most languages pronunciations vary regionally. One of the most common confusions arises, because many Thais find it difficult to pronounce the 'R' sound and pronounce 'L' instead. This page tries to present actual English words which sound as close as possible to how the Thai word sounds. 

Most dictionaries and language courses provide some very contrived 'Romanised' spellings. These are groups of Roman characters, which are supposed to represent a Thai sound. Since these groups of Roman characters often don't appear as real English words anyway, the student is still left trying to puzzle out how they should sound ( hence the great value of taped conversations which accompany some language courses ).

These are only suggestions - take what works for you, and make new ones, as long as it works.

(*1) Ba Mee are egg noodles, as opposed to plain noodles, which are called Kwae Teow among other things.

(*2) In reality the Thai for armpit sounds more like Chuckerlair, but until you get used to the nuances of Thai, it will sound much like chocolate with the 't' slightly softened. Chocolate is also easier to remember than chuckerlair. 

(*3) Some Thai words are repeated for emphasis. So for example if  'go' is 'bye', then 'go away' is 'bye, bye'. Usually this is not an unfriendly 'go away', but if the person you are with is trying to get you to get a move on, they may say 'bye, bye'. note I have put a comma between the first bye and second bye, this is because there is a slight pause between them. Also the word for 'many' is 'muck', if there are really a lot, then a Thai may say 'muck muck'.

(*4) I will admit that the 'Room' bit of 'Wrong Room' is stretching it a bit, but it is easy to remember as a start point for learning, and who knows how to pronounce 'Raem' anyway, if they've never heard it spoken.

==Use stories==
Making up little stories can help you remember the words. At first this takes a little thought, but later becomes second nature, especially where the association has a touch of humor to it.

Here are some examples of the kind of story you can make up to help you remember.

'His old CAR was beginning to ROT'. 

'She decided to exercise her LEGS, instead of taking the CAR'. 

'There was no need to order them to &quot;COME HERE&quot;, they came as soon as they saw the MONEY'. 

'The Chinese love to BET, their lucky number is EIGHT'.

'You can SEE FAR when the sky is BLUE'.

The pronunciations are approximate and it takes practice to get them right. Although dictionaries show both 'DOG' and HORSE' as sounding like 'MA', they are in fact pronounced differently (different tones), hence the Thais know which one is being referred to.

==Remembering tones==
[[Thai/Tones|Tones]] are often difficult to learn for Westerners. There are several ways to help remember the tones:
* If it's too difficult, try your best but don't worry too much. Context will help people understand which meaning you intend. 
* With constant practice and exposure to the language you may start to imitate the tones subconsciously.
* If you have trouble remembering which tone has which meaning, you might like to try using visualisation - imagine the thing high in the air, or falling or rising, or eye level (medium) depending on the tone. 

Suggested images:

{| class =  &quot;wikitable&quot;
!Thai word &amp; tone !! Image (meaning in bold)
|-
|glai (falling tone) || Visualise a model plane. The plane ''glai'' (glides) down to crash '''near''' my feet. 
|-
|glai (medium tone) || The plane ''glai'' (glides) '''far''' away from me at eye level.
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

The '''quadrature amplitude modulation''' (QAM) system of modulation is the most popular [[Communication Systems/M-ary Modulation Schemes | M-ary scheme]].

&lt;!--
that perform better then other M-ary schemes for the same SNR.

''Really? I doubt it. I've heard that &quot;hexagonal&quot; constellations theoretically give superior SNR ... but the extra complexity is usually not worth it. Should I write up a digression into hexagonal constellations? Or just leave them out, since no one really uses them?''

hexagonal constellations are fine to talk about, but they are just a special case of QAM with a hexagonal constellation plot. We might as well mention any cases that offer increased performance --Whiteknight
--&gt;

== Definition ==

Consider the case of a system with two carrier waves instead of a single carrier wave as we have considered with modulation schemes so far. One is a sine wave, and the other is a cosine wave of the same frequency. Since these two waves are orthogonal we can use them simultaneously in a single channel without losing the information of either. If both waves have the same frequency ''f'' we can write out the equation for a generic symbol, ''s'':

:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = A_k \sin(f t) + B_k \cos(f t)&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, we can create multiple symbols by simply changing the values of ''A'' and ''B''. This equation can be broken up into two parts:

*&lt;math&gt;A_k \sin(f t)&lt;/math&gt; Which is called the &quot;in-phase&quot; component of the equation.
*&lt;math&gt;B_k \cos(f t)&lt;/math&gt; Which is called the &quot;quadrature&quot; component of the equation. 

An equation which is written as a sum of a sine plus a cosine is said to be in &quot;quadrature form&quot;. If we combine the two components into a single waveform as such:

:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = \sqrt{A_k^2 + B_k^2} \cos (f t + \tan^{-1} (B_k/A_k))&lt;/math&gt;

This form is called the &quot;Polar Form&quot; of the equation.

{{Info|56K modems and Digital TV use QAM}}

== Constellation Plots ==

If we make a graph with the X axis being the values for ''A'', and the Y axis being the values for ''B'', we get what is called a '''Constellation Plot'''. These plots are called constellation plots due to the similiarity in shape and layout with astronomical star charts. The ''A'' and ''B'' values for each symbol are plotted (the &quot;stars&quot;) and various measurements between them are used to determine information from the system. On a constellation plot, we can see a number of rules:

#The further apart the points are on the constellation plot, the less likely they are to be mistaken for each other in the presence of noise.
#The closer the points are to the origin, the less power it takes to send.
# The more points there are, the faster the data rate (bit rate) at a fixed symbol rate (more symbols)
# The fewer points there are, the simpler and cheaper the hardware necessary to distinguish between them (fewer symbols, fewer thresholds in the receiver).

For these reasons there is no single &quot;best&quot; constellation plot, but it is up to the engineer to pick the points that are best for the system. In other words, trade offs need to be made between speed, performance, and cost of hardware. These tradeoffs can be made by placing the constellation points at different locations on the constellation plot.

== Benefits of QAM ==
Increase the efficiency of transmission by utilising both amplitude and phase variations.

Reducing or eliminating intermodulation interference caused by a continuous  carrier near the modulation sidebands.

The '''quadrature amplitude modulation''' (QAM) system of modulation is the most popular M-ary scheme.

&lt;!--
that perform better then other M-ary schemes for the same SNR.

''Really? I doubt it. I've heard that &quot;hexagonal&quot; constellations theoretically give superior SNR ... but the extra complexity is usually not worth it. Should I write up a digression into hexagonal constellations? Or just leave them out, since no one really uses them?''

hexagonal constellations are fine to talk about, but they are just a special case of QAM with a hexagonal constellation plot. We might as well mention any cases that offer increased performance --Whiteknight
--&gt;

== Definition ==

Let us say that we have 2 carrier waves.
One is a sine wave, and the other is a cosine wave. Since these two waves are orthogonal, we can use them simultaneously, without losing the information of either. If both waves have the same frequency, f, we can write out the equation for a generic symbol, s:

:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = A_k \sin(f t) + B_k \cos(f t)&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, we can create multiple symbols by simply changing the values of A and B. This equation can be broken up into two parts:

*&lt;math&gt;A_k \sin(f t)&lt;/math&gt; Which is called the &quot;in-phase&quot; component of the equation.
*&lt;math&gt;B_k \cos(f t)&lt;/math&gt; Which is called the &quot;quadrature&quot; component of the equation. 

An equation which is written as a sum of a sine plus a cosine is said to be in &quot;quadrature form&quot;. If we combine the two components into a single waveform as such:

:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = \sqrt{A_k^2 + B_k^2} \cos (f t + \tan^{-1} (B_k/A_k))&lt;/math&gt;

This form is called the &quot;Polar Form&quot; of the equation.

== Constellation Plots ==

If we make a graph with the X axis being the values for A, and the Y axis being the values for B, we get what is called a &quot;Constellation Plot&quot;. If A and B have discrete values, then the constellation plot will show dots at points that correspond to values for A and B coordinates. It is called a constellation plot because the layout of the different points can look very similar to the layout of stars in the sky.

On a constellation plot, we can see a number of points:

#The further apart the points are, the less likely they are to be mixed up
#The closer the points are to the origin, the less power it takes to send.

# The more points there are, the faster the data rate (bit rate) at a fixed symbol rate.
# The fewer points there are, the simpler and cheaper the hardware necessary to distinguish between them.

For these two reasons, there is no single &quot;best&quot; constellation plot, but it is up to the engineer to pick the points that are best for the system. By placing the points manually, the engineer is able to make trade-offs between the power of the system, and the number of bits per symbol (and therefore the bitrate).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Adverbs===
Normally, the adverbs in Urdu are indeclinable. However, when present and past participles are used as adverbs, they must be declined like adjectives to agree with the number and gender of the subject. But when long-a ending adjectives are used as adverbs, the standard usage is that they must not be declined. 

Pre-adjectives (adverbs that qualify adjectives and adverbs) are sometimes treated as a separate category. Such common words include {{IPA|/bohot/}} (''very''),  {{IPA|/zyadaa/}} (''much''), {{IPA|/kuch/}} (''a little''), etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two kinds of Adjectives in Urdu
* Those who end end in consonant or any vowel excluding ''a''
* Those who singular form for masculine ends in ''a''

The first (those ending in consonants or &quot;a&quot;) does not inflect where as the second one inflects with respect to gender and the number of the qualifying noun.

This inflection for the second case is shown below (Tiwari, [1966] 2004).

Note:
#If the noun to be qualified consists of multiple words of different numbers and genders, then the adjective must agree with that particular noun which it immediately precedes or follows.
#Some long ''ā'' ending adjectives do not undergo any inflection with respect to gender or number at all. These exceptions include adjectives ending in ''yā'' (e.g.,  / گھٹِیا / ''gʱaṭiyā'' — poor,  دُودھِیا / ''dūdʱiyā'' — milky), ''vā'' (e.g., سوا / ''savā'' — quarter,  بھگوا / ''bʱagavā'' — saffron), Sanskrit ''tatsam''s (e.g.  مہا / ''mahā'' — great), Persian-Arabic words that originally ended in ''ah'' but as Hindī loanwords end in long ''ā'' (e.g.  سالانا / ''sālānā'' — annual, تازہ / ''tāzā'' — fresh,  مُردا / ''murdā'' — dead,  مردانا / ''mardānā'' — manly etc.), and certain other adjectives (e.g.  چؤکنّا / ''caukannā'' — alert,  تنہا / ''tanhā'' — lonely etc.).


There is '''no''' definite article (''the'') in Urdu. The numeral  ایک / ''ek'' (one) may be used for the singular indefinite article if it needs to be stressed.

There are many ways of making positive–comparative–superlative forms of adjectives:
#By using comparing phrases such as 
* سے / ''se'',  
* کے مُقابلے / ''ke muqābale''
* زیادہ / ''zyādā'' + adj. 

#For Superlative
* سب سے / ''sab se''
* سب سے زیادہ / ''sab se zyādā''
* سب سے کم / ''sab se kam''

#Persian’s inflectional way, by suffixing - تر- / ''-tar'' for comparative and - ترین- / ''-tarīn'' for superlative.

There are pronouns in the first, second and third person, '''all''' for one gender only. But they are not categorized in to Masculine and Feminine as in other languages.More strictly speaking, the third person of the pronoun is actually the same as the demonstrative pronoun (this / that). The conjugated verb may denote the difference with respect to gender. There may also be multiple ways of inflecting the pronoun, which are given in parentheses. Below is the second person('you') explained in three levels of honorifics

*''' آپ / ''āp'':''' 
This is the most common used form. It represents respect in a way. Normally speaking most people converse with each other using this word. Even people who may be termed as intimate may feel OK, if they are addressed with it. 
Plural could be stressed by saying  آپ لوگ / ''āp log'' (&quot;you people&quot;) or  آپ سب / ''āp sab'' (&quot;you all&quot;).

*''' تم / ''tum'':''' Informal form of &quot;you.&quot; Has no difference between the singular and the plural. Normally they are spoken to young people or in house hold. Plural could be stressed by saying  تم لوگ / ''tum log'' (&quot;you people&quot;) or  تم سب / ''tum sab'' (&quot;you all&quot;).

*''' تو / ''tū'':''' Extremely informal form of &quot;you,&quot; as &quot;thou.&quot;  Strictly singular, its plural form being  تم / ''tum''. It may be used to represent personal relationship with an object or person and nowadays used in Films in conversation among bad guys. Highly controversial, the usage should be deeply thought.

In the columns for the Third Person, the first word indicates the usual form used in ''literary written Hindī or Urdū'', while the second form (after the slash) indicates the form used in normal spoken Hindī or Urdū (Hindustānī). The hyphen indicates that while writing, the postposition (if any) may be included within the word as a case marker. It suffices to say that the genitive case behaves like an adjective and has to be declined as such to match with the possessed noun. The Accusative is formed by adding the object marking को کو postposition to the oblique form, for मुझको / مجھکو / ''mujʰko'', हमको / ہمکو / ''hamko'', etc. Displayed in the Accusative row are the more common/colloquial but equally valid shortened को / کو / ''ko'' forms of मुझे / مُجھے / ''mujʰe'', हमें / ہمیں / hameⁿ'', etc.

For those persons for whom one would normally use आप / آپ / ''āp'' if referred to as the second person, it is popular by convention to use the plural form (both pronoun and the verb) of the third person demonstrative. In [[North India]] and [[Pakistan]], the हम / ہم / ''ham'' form is popularly used for the first person singular too. The 3rd person pronouns can be used independently or as [[adjective]]s qualifying a noun. In the latter case, if the noun is not followed by a postposition, the pronoun-turned-adjective will be in the Direct case, else in the Oblique case.

When preceding the postposition ने / نے / ''ne'', the 1st person singular and 2nd person very informal form must be in the direct case, while the rest of the pronouns and nouns need to be in the Oblique case. The forms इन / اِن / ''in'' and उन / اُن / ''un'' further change to इन्होंने / اِنہوں نے / ''inhoⁿne'' and उन्होंने / اُنہوں نے / ''unhoⁿne'' (some people do use the non-standard alternatives इनने / اِنّے / ''inne'' and उनने / اُنّے / ''unne''). Some postpositions use the genitive case; the rest use the oblique case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Urdu uses postpositions that follow the noun (rather than prepositions of English that precede the word). Some postpositions are compound ones. Some of them can be incorporated within the noun (usually, the pronoun) while writing, where they then act as a case marker. Some of them are listed below; those using the genitive case of the pronoun are indicated with &quot;gen&quot;.

''Koo''

1. May be used as as indirect object of transitive verbs&lt;br&gt;
امیر کو پیغام کس نے لکہا؟&lt;br&gt;
Aamir koo paygham kiss nay likha?&lt;br&gt;
Who wrote message to Aamir &lt;br&gt;

2. As a direct object of a verb &lt;br&gt;
امیر کو ٹانگ نا کرو؟&lt;br&gt;
Aamir koo taang na karoo &lt;br&gt;
Don't disturb Aamir &lt;br&gt;



In addition, certain indeclinables can be used to denote specific location with के / کے / keː /, equivalent to ''under, above, against, below'' etc. Standard Urdu uses many '''prepositions''' directly borrowed from [[Persian language|Persian]], and also some from Arabic; e.g., '''-e-''' (of), as in  सदा-ए सर्हद / صداۓ سرحد / ''sadaa-e-sarhad'' (lit., voice of the border—the name of the Bus service from [[Amritsar]] to [[Lahore]] and back). Few other postpositions may come either before or after the noun. E.g., सिवा {{IPA|/sivaː/}} — ''other than'', बिना {{IPA|/binaː/}} — without.

Tiwari ([1966] 2004) lists some common compound postpositions according to their roles:
*Related to time (Temporal): के पहले {{IPA|/keː pɛhleː/}}, से पहले {{IPA|/seː pɛhleː/}}, के पूर्व {{IPA|/keː puːrv&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;/}}, से पूर्व {{IPA|/seː puːrv&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;/}} — all for ''before''; के उपरान्त {{IPA|/keː upraːnt̪/}}, के बाद {{IPA|/keː baːd̪/}}, के आगे {{IPA|/ keː aːgeː/}}, से आगे {{IPA|/seː aːgeː/}} — all for ''after''; के पीछे {{IPA|/keː piːtʃʰeː/}}, के पश्चात {{IPA|/ke pəʃtʃaːt̪/}} — all for ''after / back''.
*Related to place (Locative): के पहले {{IPA|/keː pɛhleː/}}, से पहले {{IPA|/seː pɛhleː/}} — all for ''before''; के आगे {{IPA|/keː aːgeː/}}, से आगे {{IPA|/seː aːgeː/}} — all for ''in front of''; के भीतर {{IPA|/keː bʱiːt̪ər/}}, के अन्दर {{IPA|/keː ənd̪ər/}} — all for ''inside''; के बीच {{IPA|/keː biːtʃ/}} — ''between/among''; के ऊपर {{IPA|/keː uːpər/}} — ''above''; के नीचे {{IPA|/keː niːtʃeː/}} — ''below''; के पास {{IPA|/keː paːs/}} — ''near''; के पीछे {{IPA|/keː piːtʃʰeː/}} — ''behind''.
*Directional: के प्रति {{IPA|/keː prət̪i/}}, की ओर {{IPA|/kiː oːr/}}, की तरफ़ {{IPA|/kiː t̪ərəf/}} — all for ''towards''.
*Instrumental: के द्वारा {{IPA|/keː d̪vaːraː/}} — ''by/with''; के सहारे {{IPA|/keː səhaːreː/}}, की मार्फ़त {{IPA|/kiː maːrfət̪/}}, के बल-बूते {{IPA|/keː bəlbuːt̪eː/}} — all for ''with the help of''.
*Causal: के कारण {{IPA|/keː kaːrəɳ/}}, के मारे {{IPA|/keː maːreː/}}, की वजह से {{IPA|/kiː vədʒɛh seː/}} — all for ''because of''.
*Dative: के लिये {{IPA|/keː lijeː/}}, के निमित्त {{IPA|/keː nimit̪t̪/}}, के हेतु {{IPA|/keː heːt̪u/}} — all for ''for''.

As mentioned in the table, the postpositions using के / کے /े (lit., ''of'') indicate that the second word in the compound is a ''masculine'' possessed item, and those using की indicate that the possessed item is ''feminine''. If nouns are used with such compound postpositions, they must come in the [[Oblique case]]. If pronouns are to be used, they must come in the [[Genitive case]] (further declined in the [[Oblique case]] like adjectives).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Word order===
The neutral order of the words in a sentence is SOV (i.e., Subject Object Verb). However, if the postpositions are properly attached with the nouns, the word order in Hindustānī becomes freer than in English, but not as free as in Latin or Sanskrit. Altering the word order serves (in conjunction with tone of speaking) to shift the emphasis of the sentence elsewhere. If the subject is a noun, the adjective may come before the noun (in the attributive position) or between the noun and the verb (in the predicative position — but only if the main verb is होना {{IPA|/hoːnaː/}} ''to be''). If the subject is a pronoun, the adjective comes in the predicative position. The space between the subject and the verb may be filled by adverbs, instrumental phrase, dative phrase, locative phrase, etc. The interrogative particles normally come right before the word it is asking about. The word order, unlike in English, need not be reversed in a question. Yes/no questions can be formed by placing the interrogative pronoun क्या {{IPA|/kjaː/}} at the very beginning of the sentence. Question tag can be formed by placing the negative particle न {{IPA|/nə/}} at the end of the sentence. It often indicates making a polite request (without explicitly using ''please''). The negative particle otherwise normally comes before the verb. Certain particles stress the word that follows them immediately. E.g., ही {{IPA|/hiː/}} (''only'', as a particle of emphasis), भी {{IPA|/bʱiː/}} (''also''), तक {{IPA|/t̪ək/}}, तो {{IPA|/t̪oː/}}, भर {{IPA|/bʱər/}}, etc. For meaningful sentences, the various units of the sentence must have proximity with each other; otherwise the sentence would become ludicrous. E.g., if the noun is a genitive phrase, the attributive adjective must come immediately before that component it wishes to quality, and not necessarily before the entire phrase. 

Noun/adjective/adverb phrases are common in Hindustānī. The head of the phrase normally comes after the phrase’s compliment. In a noun phrase, the possessed item comes after the possessor. Embedded [[clauses]] are also common. For adjective clauses whether the clause is restrictive or non-restrictive, the embedded clause is joined with the main clause by j-beginning relative pronouns (E.g., ''jo'', ''jahān'', ''jaise'', etc.) and never by the corresponding[interrogative pronouns (as it happens in English). Subordinate noun clauses are often linked by the conjunction कि {{IPA|/ki/}} (lit., ''that'', of Persian origin). 

Compound sentences (those with two or more equally important simple clauses) are usually linked by conjunctions such as और {{IPA|/ɔːr/}} — ''and'', या {{IPA|/jaː/}} — ''or'', लेकिन {{IPA|/leːkin/}} — ''but'', इसलिये {{IPA|/islijeː/}} — ''therefore'', वरना {{IPA|/vərnaː/}} — ''otherwise'', etc. Sometimes double conjunctions are also used wherever needed. E.g., न … न {{IPA|/nə/ … /nə/}} — ''neither…nor''.

===Agreement===
Tiwari ([1966] 2004) lists the following rules of agreement:
*Between the subject and the verb:
#If the subject is not attached with a postposition (this condition is included in the ff. rules too), then the verb must agree in person, gender and number with the subject. Suffices to say that according to the condition, the verb is not affected even if the places of the subject and the object are reversed. E.g., मोर (''peacock'', masc. sing.) बाग़ में नाच '''रहा''' है । मोरनी (''peahen'', fem. sing.) उसे देख '''रही''' है ।
#If honor is to be expressed for the subject, then the verb is conjugated in the plural number even if the subject is singular. The same is the case for the honorific 2nd person pronoun आप. E.g., महात्मा गान्धी एक महान व्यक्ति '''थे''' ।
#If the subject of the sentence consists of several words in the same gender, number and person, linked with ''and'', then the verb is in the plural form of the same gender as the subjects. But if such words point to a single idea, then the verb will be in singular. E.g., एक कुत्ता (''dog'', masc. sing.) और एक भेड़िया (''wolf'', masc. sing.) ग़ोश्त के लिये लड़ '''रहे थे''' । But, कुत्ता या भेड़िया ये ग़ोश्त खा '''सकता था''' ।
#If the subject consists of multiple words of different genders but all singular, then the verb will be in the masculine plural form. E.g., मोर और मोरनी बाग़ में '''रहते थे''' ।
#If the subject consists of multiple words of different genders and different numbers, then the verb will be in the plural form, but of the gender of the last subject. E.g., एक राजकुमार (''prince'') और कई राजकुमारियाँ (''princesses'') मैदान में '''खेलतीं थीं''' ।
#If the gender of the subject is unknown, the verb is in masculine. E.g., कोई (''someone'') आ '''रहा''' है ।

*Between the object and the verb:
#If the subject is attached with any postposition (includes the accusative case for pronouns), then the verb does not agree with the subject. The verb rather agrees with the gender and the number of the object. This kind of phenomenon is called [[split ergativity]]. E.g., कुत्ते (''dog'', masc. sing.) ने रोटियाँ (''breads'', fem. pl.) '''खाईं थीं''' । मौसी (''aunt'') को अख़बार (''newspaper'', masc. sing.) '''पढ़ना होगा''' ।
#It is compulsory in prec. that the object must not have any postposition. If the object also has a postposition (includes the accusative case for pronouns), then the verb will not agree with anything, but simply come in the 3rd person masculine singular form. मोरनी ने उस रोटी (''bread'', fem. sing.) को '''खाया''' ।
#The postposition ''ne'' is used if and only if the verb is in one of the perfective forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hindustānī has a peculiarity that not only the number, but also the gender of the noun or the pronoun may be shown by the verb. The infinitive form of any verb ends with ना / نا / ''nā''. As in many other languages, this form can be used as a noun (masculine gender, and declined likewise). There are three main tenses: present, past and future. Hindustānī uses both end-inflections in the verb-stem and auxiliary verbs for conjugation. It is interesting to note that like English, but unlike Sanskrit, Latin, French, German, Russian, etc., Hindustānī possesses the '''continuous tense''' for all—present, past and future. Similarly, the perfect tense can be formed using a number of auxiliaries. The present and the past participles can be used as adjectives (they undergo declination). The imperative mood and equivalents for English '''can / should / must / have to''' can also be found. Verbs can be transitive or intransitive. Hindustani demonstrates very regular verb conjugation, with the only major irregular verb being होना / ہونا / ''honā'' &quot;to be.&quot; Three other verbs, करना / کرنا / ''karnā'' &quot;to do,&quot;  लेना / لینا / ''lenā'' &quot;to take,&quot; देना / دینا / ''denā'' &quot;to give,&quot; break from the pattern only in the perfect aspect. Aside from these, however, conjugation is very regular, with rules even governing conversion of a verb into its causative and double causative. But on the whole, the verbal conjugation can be very, very complicated for English speakers.

====Conjugation====
The following table gives the conjugation for the verb करना / کرنا / ''karnā'' &quot;to do&quot; —indicative mood. The root morpheme of करना / کرنا / ''karnā'' is कर / کر / ''kar''. The second column gives the conjugation in the 2nd person with तुम / تم / ''tum''. To conjugate the verb with तू / تو / ''tū'', use the 3rd person singular form. To conjugate the verb with आप / آپ / ''āp'', use the 3rd person plural form.

The present participle here is करता {{IPA|/kərtɑː/}} and the past participle is किया {{IPA|/kijɑː/}} (with variant in this case as करा {{IPA|/kərɑː/}} — not considered as standard) — both must be declined like adjectives when needed (see ff.). The Imperative Mood is an exception for all verbs because it has entirely different conjugal forms for {{IPA|/tuː/}} and {{IPA|/ɑːp/}}. For the former, it is कर {{IPA|/kər/}}, and for the latter, it is कीजिये {{IPA|/kiːdʒijeː/}} (with variations in this case as करिये {{IPA|/kərijeː/}} and करें {{IPA|/kərẽː/}} — not considered as standard). The future also has two other conditional forms, not listed here.

Hindustānī has two voices—active and passive.

A stem change in the penultimate syllable of the infinitive form can lead to a semantic change in many verbs. e.g., बनना {{IPA|/bənnɑː/}} (to be made, to become) → बनाना {{IPA|/bənɑːnɑː/}} (to make) → / बनवाना {{IPA|/bənvɑːnɑː/}} (to cause to be made). See ff.

In much of Punjabi-influeneced region of north west India, Pākistān, and the Indian state of Rājastʰān, the pronoun आप / آپ / {{IPA|/ɑːp/}} is used with verbs conjugated for the तुम / تم / {{IPA|/tum/}} form. e.g, आप / آپ / ''āp'' .... करोगे / کرو گے / ''karo ge'', आप करो / آپ کرو / ''āp karo''.

There is another class of perfectives unique to Hindustānī. These are used if the noun or pronoun is followed by the subject-case postposition  ने / نے /े {{IPA|/neː/}} (and rarely in the absence of ने / نےे too). For करना / کرنا / ''karnā'',  these would be :
*किया {{IPA|/kijɑː/}} (Simple perfective)
*किया है {{IPA|/kijɑː hæː/}} (Present perfective)
*किया था {{IPA|/kijɑː tʰɑː/}} (Past perfective)
*किया होगा {{IPA|/kijɑː hoːgɑː/}} —expressing doubt or possibility in the future.

Other equivalents with English areː
*should : infinitive + चाहिये {{IPA|/tʃɑːhijeː/}} (The subject must be followed by the postposition को . If the subject is a pronoun, then the accusative case for it without any postposition is also allowed.) E.g., मुझे .... करना चाहिये or मुझको .... करना चाहिये .
*may / can: root-morpheme + सकना {{IPA|/səknɑː/}}—conjugated in the Simple Present tense. e.g., मैं .... कर सकता हूँ .

====Some facts about Hindustānī verbs====
The root morpheme of any verb can be made by removing the suffix {{IPA|/naː/}} from the corresponding infinitive form. The imperative form for {{IPA|/tuː/}} will also give the same root morpheme. The number of single-word root morpheme is very few in Hindustānī, and so a lot of the so-called ''compound roots'' are used. Note that the existence of the so-called ''compound verbs'' in Hindustānī has been denied by some eminent linguists like Prof. Rajendra Singh (Université de Montréal). 

The auxiliary verbs in Hindustānī can be listed under the following six categories (Tiwari [1966] 2004):
#Tense marker. (i.e., है {{IPA|/hæː/}} and था {{IPA|/t̪ʰaː/}} — the present and past tense markers; forms of the verb होना {{IPA|/hoːnaː/}} — to be). These come at the end of the verbal phrase. E.g., मैं जाता '''हूँ''' । तुम खा रहे '''थे''' |
#Voice-marking verb. E.g., the verb जाना {{IPA|/dʒaːnaː/}}; किताब पढ़ी '''जाती''' है, indicating the passive voice.
#Aspect-marking verb. The verb रहना {{IPA|/rɛhnaː/}} indicates the continuous or progressive aspect. It comes just before the tense marker. E.g., आप लिख '''रहे''' हैं ।
#Modal verb. These include a variety of verb to express the mood or viewpoint of the speaker. E.g., पड़ना {{IPA|/pəɽnaː/}} and होना {{IPA|/hoːnaː/}} denote compulsion or requirement, चाहिये {{IPA|/tʃaːhijeː/}} (not conjugated) denotes advice or need, चुकना {{IPA|/tʃuknaː/}} indicates completeness of action — the perfective, पाना {{IPA|/paːnaː/}} and सकना {{IPA|/səknaː/}} indicate capability. E.g., उसे एक लाख रुपये ख़र्च करने '''पड़े''' ।
#Explicator/vector/intensifier. Such auxiliaries colorize or intensify the main verb. E.g., लेना {{IPA|/leːnaː/}}, देना {{IPA|/deːnaː/}}, मारना {{IPA|/maːrnaː/}}, etc. For instance, मैंने काम कर '''लिया''' । मैंने पत्र लिख '''दिया''' | Such verbs sometimes additionally denote the perfective aspect. 
#Verbalizer. This kind of auxiliary creates a verb from a noun or an adjective that precedes it. करना {{IPA|/kərnaː/}} is the most important such verb. Most verbs listed under intensifier may also act as verbalizer, and so does होना {{IPA|/hoːnaː/}}. E.g., मैं तुमसे प्यार '''करता''' हूँ ।

The root of the first causative verb can be made from the basic verbal root morpheme by adding the suffix {{IPA|/aː/}} or {{IPA|/laː/}}. The root of the second causative verb can be made from the basic verbal root morpheme by adding the suffix {{IPA|/vaː/}} or {{IPA|/lvaː/}}. Both cases may additionally involve ablaut gradation in the root morpheme's vowel or even a change in the consonants. E.g., बोलना — बुलाना — बुलवाना.

Hindustānī participles and verbal derivative forms (कृदन्त):
#Present participle: It is made by the ''root morpheme'' + {{IPA|/t̪/}} (present suffix) + {{IPA|/aː/}}. The word must be declined properly as given below. It is also called the imperfective derivative. E.g., करता, चलता, etc. It is used as a noun, verb (including as a part of the conjugation), adjective and adverb.
#Past participle: It is made by the ''root morpheme'' + {{IPA|/aː/}}. The word must be declined properly as given below. It is also called the perfective derivative. E.g., मरा, चला, etc. It also has numerous exceptions. It is used as a noun, verb (including as a part of the conjugation), adjective and adverb.
#Verbal noun or infinitive: It is made by the ''root morpheme'' + {{IPA|/n/}} (infinitive suffix) + {{IPA|/aː/}}. When used as a noun, it must be declined as the long-a ending adjectives. It also comes in verbal conjugations and imperatives. E.g., करना, चलना, etc.
#Pluperfect: It is made by the ''root morpheme'' + {{IPA|/kər/}} or {{IPA|/kərkeː/}} or ''null''. If the root morpheme itself is {{IPA|/kər/}} (but not otherwise), the form is {{IPA|/kərkeː/}}. E.g., खाकर, दौड़कर, etc. It is used as a verb and adverb.

The declension/conjugation for the Present and past participles is given below along with the suffixes for the verb root चल {{IPA|/tʃəl/}} — ''to go''.

== Overview ==

'''''Howlers''''' are messages that are carried by Owl Post, like letters. They are distinctively red-colored, and are used to carry urgent and angry messages.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Howlers appear several times in the series. The first one we see is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 6|sent]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|his mother]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]. The next is sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] by his grandmother. Finally, one is sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Harry's Aunt Petunia]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]. 

A Howler is not used for just any message, as true to their name, they are extremely loud – according to the text, a hundred times as loud as one's natural voice, though that could be simply the apparent effect. Additionally, if not opened promptly, they tend to explode: though we do not see that happening,  Neville advises Ron that it is better to open one immediately and take the amplified scolding, rather than leaving it unopened and letting it explode; and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] comments in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]] that exploding Howlers have been scorching his desk.

=== Description ===
# Before the first beat, sweep right foot in an arc from left to right.
# On '''one''' step onto the right foot, as though stepping your foot over a low picket fence.
# On '''two''' sweep the left foot in front and across the right foot, as though bringing the left foot over the fence.  Lead with the heel to maintain the turn-out.  Raise the right foot slightly.
# On '''three''' step back on to the right foot, placing it back in its original position.
# On '''pause''' prepare to repeat the step to the left.

Repeat counts 1,2,3 and the pause, alternating sides.  Repeat on the next beat, beginning with the left foot.

Some authors distinguish different versions of tynok, based on the height of sweeping motions.  A low sweeping motion, where the feet are kept close to the ground, is called &quot;small&quot; or &quot;maliy.&quot;  A medium sized sweeping motion, where the feet are brought about mid-calf height is called an intermediate tynok or &quot;tynok seredniy.&quot;  A large tynok, where the feet are brought to about knee height, is performed only by men and boys and referred to as &quot;tynok velykiy.&quot;

When performed as a travelling step, most of the forward movement occurs during the initial sweep before the count of '''one'''.  The motion is to leap forward onto right foot, cross the left foot over, and step again onto the right foot; then, leap forward with the left foot, cross the right foot over, step onto the left foot.

=== Arm Movement ===
Tynok may be performed with hands on hips, or by opening the arms to second position on the odd-numbered counts, and then closing them to the waist on the even-numbered counts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have changed the TOC2. Please everyone contribute to fix the links. I am new to wiki and not very good in wiki editing. 

[[User:Jayaram Ganapathy|Jayaram Ganapathy]]

'''discuss changes to the table of contents here'''

TOC 1 seems to have the most activity. Perhaps, this should and all other TOC's should be merged with it. However, since so much work has been done on TOC1, perhaps all others should just be deleted. Does anyone know if Wikibooks/Wikipedia has policies are forking modules? --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 12:00, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

:TOC1 makes really sense to me [[User:170.148.10.46|170.148.10.46]]

::I'm not opposing in having 2 or more TOCs (this is a virtual environment) unless there is duplication of content several structures could exist in parallel, that is why I supported the creation of TOC2, we can even have several navigational schemes (that would take lots of work) all this would indeed improve the usability of the content, the problem that exist today is only on selecting what should be the main TOC (at least that is how I see it), I'm not asking for TOC2 to be deleted if the users continue to update it (sadly that seems not to be happening).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:43, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

Hellow friends,
I have a suggestion. To improve TOC2 take the Introduction from TOC1. Include all the chapters except the comparison with C# JAVA etc without subheadings  visible in the TOC2 page. Then merge the first two chapters Introduction and compilers you have now to that material. 
Change the Langage Essentials to C++ Language essentials

Regards,

[[User:Jayaram Ganapathy|Jayaram Ganapathy]]

== Print Version of TOC2 ==
I have [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming%2FEditor%27s_TOC&amp;diff=828225&amp;oldid=808988 Commented out] the print version of TOC2 from the Editor's TOC, the actual print version has several divergences from what is on TOC2 some pages are on it others aren't and TOC2 has some pages that are on TOC1 missing, if someone should like to work on it add the option for printing on TOC2 and then revive the same option on editor's TOC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Signature of lookup==

The signature of function lookup is given as:
 lookup :: a        -- a key
        -&gt; [(a, b)] -- the lookup table to use
        -&gt; Maybe b  -- the result of the lookup

I don't want to be picky here, but perhaps it could be pointed out that 'a' actually has to be an equality type.
Furthermore, a simple implementation of lookup could serve a better understanding of that particular example. --[[User:Xian|Xian]] 15:43, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

==List monad example==
I think there is something wrong with this example:
 getNextConfigs :: Board -&gt; [Board]
 getNextConfigs = ... -- details not important
 
 tick :: [Board] -&gt; [Board]
 tick bds = concatMap getNextConfigs bd
 
 find3rdConfig :: Board -&gt; [Board]
 find3rdConfig bd = tick $ tick $ tick bd
First, tick has an argument &quot;bds&quot; but uses &quot;bd&quot;. Second, find3rdConfig calls tick with a Board, but tick needs an argument of type [Board]. Or am I missing something here? --[[User:Stw|Stw]] 21:21, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

=== Possible answer ===

I would guess that that the example should be corrected as follows:

 tick :: [Board] -&gt; [Board]
 tick bds = concatMap getNextConfigs bds
 
 find3rdConfig :: Board -&gt; [Board]

==Problem with list monad example do-notation implementation of find3rdConfig?==
Something doesn't feel right with the do-notation implementation of find3rdConfig.  It seems like after each call to getNextConfigs, some kind of flattening (e.g. using concatMap) is necessary.

That is exactly what the list monad does:
  instance Monad [] where
    return a = [a]
    xs &gt;&gt;= f = concat (map f xs)

== State Monad ==

This page implies both that the State monad has &quot;side effects&quot; (which I suppose it does, but not in the traditional sense) and that IO is a special case of State (which, of course, it is not.  IO can't even be expressed properly in Haskell, because it has actual, classical side-effects)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What are the basic roles that a new team leader needs to know? ==

Four of the key roles that a new manager must master are that of planning, organizing, directing and controlling.  Especially when the new supervisor is being promoted from team member to team leader, the new supervisor will be forced to learn these roles in order to be successful in his new role.

=== Planning ===

First, it is essential that the new manager become proficient in planning for his team.  Failure to effectively plan can create problems that require a great deal more time and effort to correct than would have been required to develop a good plan.  

To plan effectively, the new manager must address the following questions: 

# What is the task?
# Who will perform the task?
# How should the task be performed?
# When must the task be completed?

In considering the above questions, the new manager must take the time to identify and evaluate all of the possible alternatives before making a decision.  Involving team members in this part of the planning process can yield a greater variety of possible solutions and factors that need to be considered.

Once the manager has developed the plan by answering the above questions, it is critical that the manager effectively communicate the plan with the team members.  No matter how well thought out and perfect the plan, it must be understood by the team. 

=== Organizing ===

In order to accomplish the goals and objectives set forth in the planning stages, the new manager must learn to effectively establish the structure of the team and the people that are part of the team.

In organizing the structure of the team, the manager must determine how to best align the resources at his disposal to reach the team’s goals.  The manager must make good decisions in creating formal job descriptions and accountabilities for his team members and develop processes that can be improved upon.  By giving team members enough structure to help them understand their roles and accountabilities, team members are clear on what is expected of them and understand how to be successful at their jobs.

Secondly, the new team leader must organize the people within his team.  Some of the important steps in organizing the people on the team include:

# Understanding the factors that make a team member successful in his job
# Interviewing to find the right candidate to join the team
# Establishing and providing effective training for new team members
# Ongoing training and development of team members

By providing sufficient structure to team members, selecting the right members for the team and training team members, the new manager can effectively organize the team and increase the probability of success.

=== Directing ===

The most difficult and complicated role that a new supervisor must learn is that of directing.  Once the manager has planned for his team, set forth structure within the team, and selected and trained team members, he must then develop the skill necessary to direct his team in the work.  The main skills that must be mastered are leading, communicating, and motivating.

Although leading is a difficult skill to teach, there are several skills that a manager can develop to become a better leader.  Some of the key skills that can be developed are:

# Empathy and the ability to listen and understand others point of view
# Understand own strengths and weaknesses and how they affect the team
# Show team members a willingness to work
# Show and spread excitement within team
# Show willingness to take on responsibility

Another key skill that a new manager must develop to become proficient at directing his team is communication.  Effective communication is centered on the receiver of the communication receiving the same message as was intended by the sender.  A new manager must take initiative ensure that the communication within the team is achieving the necessary results.

=== Controlling ===

The final role that a new team leader must learn to perform is controlling the team.  Once the roles of planning, organizing and directing have been fulfilled, the manager must be able to control the work to be completed by the team.  The steps that are involved in establishing control over a team are:

# Establish a means to measure performance
# Measure results against established metrics
# Make corrections to performance to meet established performance goals

By following the above steps, the new manager can gain a means of understanding the team’s strengths and opportunities for improvement, as well as identify best practices within the team that can be shared with the other team members.  Along with following these steps, it may become necessary to discipline employees who are unable or unwilling to change their behavior in order to meet established requirements.

By learning the roles of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling, a new manager can acquire the skill necessary to quickly become effective at his new and important role.

== What Are the Best Options for Arranging a Team and Assigning Team Role? ==

A primary reason for forming and working in teams is that the combined skills and expertise of the full group can be more effective than the contributions of individual members. The team needs to act in tight coordination with each member performing his or her task correctly and at the right time. When it works, it is easy to forget the team leader’s role in making it happen.  

Team leaders have many challenges to overcome before the team can fulfill its purpose.  Before a team can start work toward reaching its objective, the team leader must identify shared goals and outcomes and align a group of individuals them, identify the resources that the team needs and make arrangement to provide these resources, make assignments that help improve the skills of each individual while still benefiting the team, help the team run smoothly, and ensure that the team accomplishes the task at hand.

It is like the old adage that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You have to get the right mix of people.  To do this you have to understand what each person brings to the group and match those people to the right roles. Once this is accomplished, the leader’s job is to help the assigned individuals function together as a team. It is important not to have too many or too few member. To be effective, there needs to be a balance between the number of member and the number of role and responsibilities assigned by the team leader. Too many members can result in a team that is hard to manage, too few members and there may not be enough resources to complete the task.

Before building a team you must define the capabilities your team will need to be effective. The team leader must be clear on the objectives that need to be met. Start by identifying the type of work the needs to be performed. Define the team’s objectives. Then look at those goals and desired outcomes and list the skills, certifications, expertise, and talents that will be needed to accomplish those goals. Some of these may be very specific while others are of a more abstract nature.  

The following five-step analysis, as outlined in the book “Building Effective Teams”, Duke Corporate Education, can be very beneficial when trying to identify the resources available and the roles where individuals may be most effective. 

# Define your team’s current responsibilities. Make note of what skill sets are utilized to make the team work now.
# Define the tasks that the team will be responsible for a year from now. Make note of the skill sets that will be needed.
# Take an inventory of the team members and the skills that they have. Make note of any dormant skills that team members have the potential to enhance and bring to the group.
# Compare the tasks in step one and step two with the skills that your team has. Are there any gaps? Do you have back-up for each person? Where can cross functional roles help provide redundancy?
# Consider readjusting the team. Are there areas that need development? How quickly do they need to be developed? What capabilities should you look for in seeking new members?

When assigning roles you must also look at how the members work together. Personal challenges can have a definite affect on how the team works and how quickly tasks are completed.  Make a list of the norms that you want for your team.  If you want everyone to finish work at 4:30 the night before a meeting, don’t look to someone who is a last minute type of person. If you want a casual working relationship where ideas are shared easily, don’t look to a person who always wants sole credit for work done. Look for and find people who can fit into your list of norms.

Members of the team need a clear understanding of what is being asked of them. They need to know that if they are unclear they have someone to go to. They need support and direction at every step.  It is the leader’s job to find out the goals of each team member.  If a team member feels that their personal goals are being met they work harder for the team. There is no “I” in team but there is a “Me.” Team members want to continue to grow and will grow with the team if they feel like their goals are being recognized.

The following is a checklist, again derived from “Building Effective Teams”, to help identify the roles each member may be capable of performing.

* Make sure you start with a clear understanding of the work to be done.
* Complete a gap analysis as previously described to identify individual talents and how best to employ them. 
* Learn your team members’ aspirations as well as their current skill sets and align their roles to support these objectives whenever possible.
* Understand your organizations strategic direction and structure the team so it has the flexibility to make any changes necessary to stay aligned with corporate objectives.
* Determine your overarching priorities. Make sure the objectives of the individuals are not allowed to interfere with the objectives of the team. Individual roles may have to be adjusted over time to help keep the team priorities at the forefront.
* Scope the work to match the capabilities of the team members you have to draw from as much as possible. This often involves negotiation to shape the roles to the members and the members to the roles.

Keep in mind that there are a number of roles that can be formally assigned within teams in the interest of helping workflow proceed as effectively and efficiently as possible. It is the team leader’s responsibility to perform an inventory of the resources they have to draw from and align those resources with identified team roles. While there may be some roles that are fundamental to most teams, each objective is different and therefore each team is unique. It is the process of identifying which roles are necessary in a given situation and which individuals are best suited to perform those roles that determines the effectiveness of a team leader.

== What Relationship Aspects Can Be Defined in Advance to Assure Success? ==

When given an opportunity to grow within the company, there are challenges that come with the excitement of moving up the corporate ladder.  These challenges are centered in the relationship “baggage” that one can bring with them into their new position.  So what aspects of this baggage can be defined early so as to avoid any problems and assure the type of success that brought you into this new position? John C. Maxwell, in his book, The 360 degree Leader, suggests that the aspects fall into two categories.  First, there are leadership principles that one must develop while still part of the body of the team before the promotion.  These are 1) avoid office politics, 2) let the best idea win and 3) don’t pretend your perfect. (Maxwell, 2005, Thomas Nelson) Second are a group of principles that need to be developed after the upward move is made.  These are 1) develop team members as people, 2) place people in their strength zones and 3) model the behavior you desire.  (Maxwell, 2005, Thomas Nelson)
	
Maxwell feels that the development of leadership from inside of a team can be a very difficult challenge.  Mostly the relationship baggage the new leader brings is the months or years of established interaction with co-workers.  This baggage can be minimized with some concerted effort when interacting as a team member.  
	
First, Maxwell defines playing politics as “changing who you appear to be or what you normally do to gain an advantage with whoever currently has power.”  (Maxwell, 2005, Thomas Nelson)  Many organizations drive people to feel that they must play these politics to get ahead.  The suggestion made by Maxwell is that once a person participates in these politics, their reputation among their peers is one of trying to get ahead without merit.  As this person moves into leadership roles, based on performance or not, that reputation among his peers will follow him and his leadership will be largely ineffective.
	
Second, in competitive corporate environments many middle managers are fighting to have their ideas heard and recognized.  Many will do so at the expense of the larger company or at the expense of others around them.  As a team member, before promotion, a reputation of fairness and open mindedness needs to be developed so that once the promotion does come that reputation will be useful.  This is done by listening to all ideas, don’t take rejection personally, don’t let personality overshadow purpose and finally, protect creative people and the ideas they generate.  (Maxwell, 2005, Thomas Nelson)  
	
Finally, while working within a team, one should never put on the air of superiority, even in success.  The way to combat this is to be real when dealing with oneself.  Be quick to admit faults, ask for advice and worry less about what others think.  People who are real draw others to them and are easily trusted.
	
Once the transition has been made to the leadership role, the relationship baggage is still there and still needs to be dealt with.  The person in this role is no longer seen as a team member but an ex-team member.  With that said, there are still the relationships that one has brought with them.  These relationships can continue to develop on a personal level.  First, each team member must feel that the leader is interested and willing to help them continually develop. The leader must understand that each team member is different and needs to be dealt with differently.  Additionally, by establishing organizational goals that help each person develop outside of the work environment they will feel that the leader is helping them move toward personal progression.  (Maxwell, 2005, Thomas Nelson)
	
Second, many leaders fail in finding the “sweet spot” of each team member is essential as a team leader.  Many people feel under utilized when they are performing tasks that do not challenge them.  By spending the time to understand strengths and then allowing team members to maximize those strengths, new leaders can develop successful teams.
	
Finally, good leaders will always lead by example.  Leaders that move up through the corporate ladder by performing at high levels, achieving goals and being real can then expect the same behavior from the teams they now lead.  This principle may be the most important.  (Maxwell, 2005, Thomas Nelson)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Is Motivation? ==

In the most general of terms, motivation is the psychological feature that arouses an individual to action toward a desired goal.  Motivation can also be the reason for an individual's action or that which gives purpose and direction to behavior.  In other words, motivation is an incentive that generates goal-directed behaviors. 

=== Motivational Theory ===
Motivation comes in many forms and what motivates one individual is not necessarily the same for their team members.  Therefore, it is important to understand how motivation differs among individuals and how these differences affect the overall drive and determination of a team toward a goal.  To better understand the complexities of motivation researchers over the years have developed a number of theories to try to explain why people behave in the ways that they do and to try to predict what people actually will do, based on these theories.  These theories, called motivational theories are often split into two categories –content theories and process theories.

'''Content theories''' are centered on finding what makes people tick or appeals to them.  These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires which have been internalized as they mature to adulthood.  These theories look at what it is about certain people that make them want the things that they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.  Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory. 

'''Process theories''' focus on how and by what goals people are motivated.  Process theories of motivation look at what people are thinking about when they decide whether or not to put effort into a particular activity.  There are of a number of this type of approach to motivation theory one of which is Adam’s Equity Theory.

Industrial psychologists have used these ideas on motivational theory to develop management theories based on what we have learned motivates individuals.  Nearly all motivational theory, regardless of the approach outlines significant differences in how individuals are motivated on their own and how they are motivated when being part of a team.  Team motivation tends to be much more difficult.  There are more possibilities to motivate a team, yet at the same time there are more motivational factors to fulfill for a team in order to gain motivation.

=== Team Motivation===
Motivational factors differ since the goals of the individual and the team are often not on the same level.  The individual will always fight to fulfill their higher level needs.  These needs are often not consistent with the needs of the team and of the individual.  The motivation of the individual is essential for successful motivation of the team.  Team members must be able to fulfill their higher level needs to be motivated and team members must be committed to the team.  Along with good leadership that enables team members to fulfill their goals all of these qualities will motivate a team.  
These motivation factors that drive a team can be divided into four categories– task, structure, goals, and members.  By realizing other factors besides intrinsic rewards that will motivate individuals, the team will also be motivated.  The sharing of knowledge, support, solidarity and communication are all highly effective in motivating a team.  All in all, a team that exists within a collaborative, structured and communicative environment will be highly motivated.  

Overall, there are consequences when teams lack motivation. By examining the consequences in the areas of task, structure, goals, and members, we are able to recognize how motivation is lost and proactively address any issues in the future.

== Lack of Motivation in Teams ==
Teams that lack motivation will rarely reach their full potential or perform to the best of their ability. In most cases, it is not the entire team that lacks motivation, but individuals on the team that lack motivation.

== Motivation and Team Dynamics ==

Almost all teams have members who are changing or transitioning in and out of the team; and requirements and tasks within the team are constantly modified and becoming more focused on the goal.  In fact, teams that never change can become stagnant; this leads to decreased motivation within the team.  Therefore, monitoring the motivating factors within the team is vital to team success and increased motivation for the future.  The keys to successfully managing these motivating factors in an environment of constant team dynamics require understanding the team members, understanding the team goals, and providing consistent leadership throughout the project or life of the team.

=== Understand Team Members ===

When the team is first formed, the team leader needs to pay careful attention to the type of person that is selected in the team.  Selecting two individuals, who may be similar in many aspects yet are motivated by two contradictory methods, may make it impossible to motivate one while not offending the other.  Then trying to determine the individual that is less likely to be either unmotivated or un-offended by the motivation techniques employed may cause additional problems, such as perceived favoritism or dislike towards certain team members.

Even if the initial team members are perfectly chosen, taking all motivation requirements into account, new members will probably be added later to either provide additional support or to take the place of a departing team member.  Understanding the current team members' motivation requirements and those of potential team members may be even more important at this time because the current team is already progressing and the motivation techniques required to motivate new team members may be detrimental to the current team members’ efforts and goals.

Understanding the team members' motivation needs both at inception of the team and also throughout the ever-changing environment of the team will result in proper motivation techniques and greater success for the team.

=== Understand Team Goals ===
Team goals can be short-term task-specific goals, long-term organizational goals or any combination thereof.  In addition, these goals may be constantly updated or changed, especially short-term task-specific goals, as the business environment changes or as tasks and goals are accomplished.  

Different types of goals may require different types of motivation.  For example, a team might be motivated to work hard on a project for an extra couple of weeks if they are rewarded with a three or four-day weekend once it is completed; or maybe if the company has no work-related accidents for the year everyone receives an extra percentage bonus during the holiday season.

An understanding of the team goals, in all varieties, is neither more nor less important as understanding the team members who are trying to accomplish these goals.  These two factors are interdependent in determining the motivation tactics that should be employed to maximize success within the team.

=== Provide Consistent Leadership ===
Because there is so much change with team members and associated team goals, providing consistent leadership is essential to motivating team members.  If possible, keeping the same individual in charge will keep the team members focused on their goal rather than on determining what a new leader expects of them.  Team members may be motivated to make their new boss happy rather than being motivated to achieve the team goals.  

Additionally, with constantly changing leadership, many team members may assume the team they belong to is undesirable to leaders.  Team members may think leaders are &quot;jumping ship&quot; because they know they will not succeed; and in turn, managing a poorly achieving team puts a black mark on own leadership abilities. 

No matter how hard individual team leaders try to stay with a team, change is inevitable for team leaders as well.  To mitigate the problems mentioned above, two strategies can be employed: 

# Maintain consistent expectations from the former to the new team leader  
# Utilize the current motivational techniques that work.  

Both of these strategies require as much communication as possible between the former and the new leader.  In addition, communication to the team members throughout the transition process provides motivation to the team because they will understand what is expected of them, and they will feel like they are part of the process.  This communication between the leaders and to the team members is the responsibility of the team leaders, but team members should try to make sure they are available and receptive to this communication.

An appreciation for the subtleties that exist in human behavior and team dynamics will better enable the understanding of team motivation. Understanding team members, understanding team goals, and providing consistent leadership should help provide the motivation required to achieve success.

== Motivating Team Members ==

Many top managers assume that the key to motivation is the proper use of the available motivational ''&quot;tools.&quot;''  This is making an enormous assumption that some magical tool actually exists that will motivate an individual.  This is one of the common myths regarding motivation.  According to Authenticity Consulting LLC advisor Carter McNamara, tools are not what motivate individuals.  Motivation is a process, not the end result of a task.  Specifically regarding the question posed to our team, motivation is not catered to an individual because of their experience or position.  It is catered to an individual because they '''ARE''' an individual.  This goes for the long-tenured employee as well as the newest member of the team.

=== Motivational Myths ===

McNamara discusses three motivational myths that can help us better understand the process of motivation.  The first myth is that one person can motivate another.  This is simply not true.  An employee has to motivate themselves.  As a manager you have to establish an environment that will cultivate and bring forth the personal motivational factors of each individual.  This can be accomplished through establishing team goals based on the goals of the individuals.  If an individual is motivated towards a goal and the goal has no relation to the team goal, they will not continue to motivate themselves because their results will have no real team value.  This is why it is important that managers fully and frequently discuss the organizational goals with their employees.

The second myth is that money and fear are good motivators.  According to McNamara, money can only help people from being less motivated.  It does not typically increase motivation in an individual.  Fear, like money, is only useful in the short term.  The same repeated criticism or threat from a manager can negatively impact the motivation of the employee.

&quot;I know what motivates me, so I know what motivates my employees,&quot; is the third myth.  Everyone is different.  Motivational factors can vary to every extreme.  However, what can be uniform for everyone is the goal they are trying to reach.  Managers need to identify and understand what motivates each employee to reach the common organizational goal.  This can be done by asking, observing and listening to your employees.  They will give tremendous insight into their motivational factors through their daily, menial conversations.  Often what motivates an individual is what they show the most enthusiasm for.  This needs to be followed up with sincere one-on-one meetings to discuss accomplishments and to modify goals based on evolving motivational factors.

=== Steps to Employee Motivation ===
Finally, McNamara recommends some steps that managers can take to better support their employees in motivating themselves.  First, managers need to write down what they think motivates each of their employees and ask the employee to do the same.  They then compare results with the employee and discuss the differences and misconceptions. Next, the results are used to establish a reward system based on self-stated motivational factors.  Finally, managers need to reward and acknowledge positive behaviors.  Employees need to know when an organizational goal has been met as a result of their actions.  They need to clearly understand their specific action or actions that led to the goal being met.  Once this is done it is a time to celebrate.  Celebration among the team of a job well done is the first step in accomplishing the next organizational goal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Section 10.1 - Introduction to &quot;Polygons&quot; ==
Walking around a city, you can see polygons in buildings, windows, and traffic signs. In general a polygon is a closed plane figure with at least three sides. Those sides intersect only at their endpoints and no adjacent sides are collinear. Examples of polygons include triangles, trapezoids, and hexagons.

== Section 10.2 - Definition of &quot;polygon&quot; ==
A '''polygon''' is a two-dimensional, closed plane figure that has at least three sides, all of which are straight.  Polygon lines cannot intersect other lines of a polygon. All polygons have the same number of angles equal to the number of sides and vice versa.

== Section 10.3 - Regular polygons ==
A '''regular polygon''' is a polygon that is equiangular, equilateral, and the vertices of which are all equidistant from a common center.  Simply put, a polygon is considered to be regular if all of its sides have equal length, all of its angles have equal measure, and there exists an imaginary point that is equally distant from each of its corners.


Despite the fact that the uniform side length of any regular polygon has an infinite amount of possible values, the uniform angle measure can be defined by the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;\,\theta = 180(n - 2)&lt;/math&gt;

where θ is the angle measure and n is the number of sides the polygon has. This will give the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. It is important to note that this formula is not specific to regular polygons. This formula will give the sum of the interior angles for any polygon.


If a polygon is regular, then the measure of each individual angle is given by:
&lt;math&gt;\,\theta = \frac{180(n - 2)}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

An example of the use of these two formulas would be finding the measure of each interior angle of a  regular pentagon.  To find the sum of the interior angles we would use the formula:


&lt;math&gt;\,\theta = 180(5 - 2)&lt;/math&gt;

Because a pentagon has five sides. This yields an answer of 540 degrees.  Dividing this answer by 5 -- because that is the number of sides -- gives an answer of 108 degrees. In an equilateral pentagon, each interior angle has a measure of 108 degrees.

==Exercises==
# Are all isosceles triangles also equilateral?
# Is there such thing as a right triangle that is also isosceles?
# What is the sum of the interior angles in an octagon?
# What is the measure of an interior angle in a regular hexagon?
# Draw an equilateral quadrilateral that is also equiangular. Can there be an equilateral quadrilateral that is not equiangular?
# How many lines of symmetry are there in a regular ''n''-gon?

I see you've been doing alot of work on the [[Reverse Engineering]] book. I wanted to personally thank you for the help: That book needs a lot of work. The book does need alot more content, but it also needs grammar and spelling help that our other authors don't always catch. If you need anything, don't hesistate to let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:20, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

=== ARB Compressors ===

The ARB CKSA12 was designed solely to operate ARB Air Lockers.  It has an integrated air tank and two solenoid ports on the manifold.

=== Viair Compressors ===

=== Factory A/C Compressor ===

The factory A/C compressor in the Jeep Liberty is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_compressor centrifugal compressor] and therefore its use as an onboard air compressor would be impractical.  Centrifugal compressors are meant for high volumes at low pressure, whereas the preferred [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocating_compressor reciprocatimg compressor] is meant for low volumes at high pressures.  When used in conjunction with an air tank a reciprocating compressor can supply air at high volumes and high pressure, which is better suited for powering air tools.

=== York A/C Compressor ===

=== CO2 Systems ===

CO2 systems can be used to fill tires and control lockers, just like air compressors.  However, when used with lockers, they must be properly regulated and release no liquid.  While CO2 systems, such as the Power Tank, are portable, fast, and have a high duty cycle, they don't provide the unlimited pressure of air compressor systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Introduction =

Whenever starting a new semester, it's always a good idea to have your events planned out. If you have every detail of your day planned out, you'll become less susceptible to the planning fallacy.(1) 

Supplies needed:

# Watch (Wristwatch or clock)
# Writing instrument.
# Paper or other surface for writing on.
# Grasp of division. Ex: [(140/7) = 20]
# Computer
# A spreadsheet program: Openoffice.org, Microsoft Excel, Google account, etc..

== Creating a Class Schedule ==

# Obtain your class schedule.
# Create a spreadsheet document.
# Wikibook not complete.....

== Preparing to avoid the planning fallacy ==

The planning fallacy occurs when you think you know how long something will take. However, a more mathematical approach to planning out your day would be better than an assumption. Typically the best way to figure out how long it will take to read 20 pages of a textbook is to time one's self. If a person were to stay keep the environment around her or him consistent, maintain the same speed of reading and comprehension, and keep on task, then he or she would have variables to help determine how long it took to read 20 pages. This may not be the best statistical way to prepare, but it is better than nothing or assuming.

Ex:

You sit in a quiet library with a pair of AoSafety headphones on. You keep your eyes on the book and maintain a steady rate of reading. In two hours you have read 20 pages of your textbook. If you were to continue going through your textbook--proceeding to a different text after the 20 pages and returning back to the preceding text--and reading 20 more pages, then you can view how long it took you to read 20 pages again.

Analyzed version:

# Read 20 pages of a book. (Book 1)
# Log the amount of time it took to read 20 pages.
# Read 20 pages of a different book. (Book 2)
# Log the amount of time it took to read 20 pages.
# Read 20 pages of a different book. (Book 3)
# Log the amount of time it took to read 20 pages.
# Read 20 pages of a different book. (Book 4)
# Log the amount of time it took to read 20 pages.
# Read 20 pages of a different book. (Book 5)

----

:* If you have fewer than five books, go back to book 1.
:* If you have greater than five books, alternate the time accordingly to whatever heuristic thought you have.

Ex:
# Read 15 pages of a different book. (Book 5)
# Log the amount of time it took to read 15 pages.
# Read 15 pages of a different book. (Book 6)

----

Continue reading and logging time for a week (7 days).

By the end of a week, you should have the amount of time it took you to read 20 pages of each book per day.

Example: Book 1 (Su: 2 hours; M: 1 hour 30 mins; T: 2 hours 15 minuts; ...)
Add up the amount of time from each day for book 1; divide by 7.
* This is typically how long it takes you to read 20 pages of book 1.
Do the same for every other book.
* This is typically how long it takes you to read 20 pages of that book.

There may be problems with the first few days in which you become acquainted with a textbook. These problems should be totalled into the equation.

After doing this for a week, you have a better understanding of how long it takes you to read a certain book. It is advised that you switch between books.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Announcing: Communicating on Broadcast Media'''  is an open-content textbook on the profession of announcing.  It is a free online book anyone can read, write, or edit.

Broadly defined, announcing is the professional practice of vocally communicating messages to an audience through broadcast media.  Those who practice this profession are called [[w:Announcer|announcers]], although most announcers prefer to use a more descriptive title to describe what they do.  Some announcers work in radio as &quot;disk jockeys,&quot; radio journalists or program hosts.  Some announcers work in television as newscasters, sportscasters or &quot;booth announcers.&quot;  Some announcers are [[w:voice acting|voice actors]] who specialize in doing commercial &quot;voice overs,&quot; narrating documentaries or providing voices for animated films.  Still other announcers communicate using public address systems, such as those found at sports stadiums, racing tracks and &quot;disco&quot; nightclubs.  Although there are many different kinds of announcers, a common thread through all of these occupations is the central importance of using one's voice to effectively communicate a message.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Announcing/Preview|This chapter provides an introduction to the profession of announcing.  We'll develop a working definition of announcing, describe the major types of announcers, and discuss the occupational outlook for announcers.}}


'''On Air.'''  Two simple words.  Just five letters.  But to the thousands of people who work in the broadcast media, those two simple words can mean a lot, not the least of which is &quot;it's show time!&quot;

[[Image:on air.gif|250px|right]]

'''On Air. ''' The words flash in red lights outside of the broadcast studio, indicating to the outside world that something special is happening inside, so please don't interrupt.  Inside the studio, behind a microphone and sometimes in front of a camera, professionals communicate messages to an unseen audience.  They may even appear to the casual observer to be talking to themselves, yet with all the animation and expression one might expect when speaking to a good friend.

'''On Air. ''' Two words that are seen every day by announcers, people engaged in the professional practice of vocally communicating messages to an audience through the broadcast media.  Many people want to become announcers.  Some realize their dreams.  And a few make it to &quot;the top&quot; of the profession, achieving fame and possibly fortune.

What about you?  Do you want to be on air?  Do you have what it takes?  I believe that if you truly want something badly enough, and you are determined to work hard, you're more likely to achieve your goals.  But it helps to know more about what you are aiming for.  

That's what this book is all about: an introduction to the field of announcing.  It won't tell you everything you might want to know about the field, but it will give you a start.  It might even be the start of something great, your own successful journey to be among those On Air.

== What is announcing? ==
Before we can clearly discuss any concept, we need to define it.  That sounds easier than it actually is.  Defining any concept involves some risk that someone might disagree with your definition.  Define a term too narrowly, and you're likely to miss something important.  Cast your net too widely, and you're likely to include things that probably should be considered something else.

So it is with the terms &quot;announcer&quot; and &quot;announcing.&quot;  What is the first thing you think of when you hear the term &quot;announcer?&quot;  A disc jockey on the radio?  Perhaps a television news anchor?  Maybe a sportscaster calling the play-by-play of an athletic competition?  Or someone providing the &quot;voiceover&quot; for a commercial message?

I would include all of these--and more--in my definition of announcing.  But whether everyone I would call an announcer would call themselves an announcer is another matter.  Indeed, most people who work in the profession of announcing, at least in the broad sense I use here, would prefer to be know as something other than an announcer.  
{{Announcing/Keypoint|Announcing is ''the professional practice of vocally communicating messages to an audience through broadcast media.''}}

So for what it's worth, here's my definition of announcing:  '''Announcing is the professional practice of vocally communicating messages to an audience through broadcast media.''' And by extension, an announcer is someone engaged in this profession, for love or for money (and hopefully both). 

Let's expand upon the seven components of this definition: 
#...professional...  Announcing is not just a &quot;job&quot; that anyone can do. Announcing is a profession: an occupation that demands specialized skills and unique talents. Indeed, it's not uncommon to hear people in the industry refer to announcers as &quot;talent.&quot; For that's what the announcer has that others are willing to pay for: talent. That doesn't mean announcers make a lot of money (although a few make quite a bit). But it does mean that announcers are able to do something others are willing to pay for. And as in other professions, announcing has its own associations and unions dedicated to protecting and enhancing the profession, like AFTRA, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Some announcing specialties have professional ethical codes that seek to establish professional standards, such as the Radio and Television News Directors Code of Ethics. So while announcing can be fun, it's not something people usually do just for the fun of it. Announcing is a career choice that most announcers take quite seriously. 
#...practice...  Because skillful announcing requires talent, announcing is a practice as well as a profession. Announcers are continually practicing their craft, trying to make the most of their talents. Although some announcers may be blessed with a naturally pleasant voice or an attractive appearance, most announcers find they must work hard to develop and maintain their &quot;on-air presence.&quot; A nice smile and &quot;good pipes&quot; won't get you very far if you don't know how to use them. So announcers practice; they practice how they sound on a microphone, how they appear on a camera, and how they interpret and deliver messages. Announcing is a very competitive field; only a few make it to the top of their profession. Those that do, know that becoming a successful announcer takes practice, and typically, a lot of it. 
#...vocally...  The voice is perhaps the announcer's most valuable asset. It is the primary &quot;tool&quot; announcers use to convey messages to an audience. While announcers don't necessary have to have a &quot;beautiful&quot; voice, announcers must be able to effectively use their voices, sometimes for long stretches at a time. The voice is important for performing on both radio and television: whether an announcer is behind a microphone or in front of a camera, it is the voice that carries most of the &quot;content&quot; of a message. That doesn't mean that announcers don't need to know how to communicate in other ways; some announcing jobs require writing as well as speaking skills, some give considerable attention to physical appearance, and some require specialized knowledge in a particular area, like popular music, current events, or sports. But all announcers use their voices, and vocal quality is often what distinguishes the most successful announcers. 
#...communicating...  Fundamentally, an announcer's job is to communicate. Announcers just doesn't read words out loud; they use their skills and talents to effectively communicate the meaning of those words. If the message an announcer is trying to convey isn't successfully communicated, the announcer has failed to do what he or she is being paid to do. Announcers should thus possess a solid understanding of the process of communication in order to organize, synthesize and present information in a compelling manner. Many announcers have advanced training in public speaking, rhetoric and communication studies.  But regardless of their academic credentials, successful announcers demonstrate they know how to effectively communicate.  Because communication is the fundamental purpose of what they do.
#...messages...  The meaningful content of what announcers seek to communicate is embedded in the messages they communicate. Sometimes announcers are directly involved in the writing of scripts, commonly called &quot;copy&quot; in industry lingo. Sometimes announcers are asked to &quot;ad lib&quot; a message for a specific purpose.  And sometimes announcers are asked to quickly create messages that capture the essence of a news story or a sporting event.  But regardless of whether they are involved in creating the messages they convey, announcers must be able to interpret, understand and communicate the meaning of those messages. Announcers &quot;breathe life&quot; into these messages, using their talent to convert simple words into an engaging message. 
#...audience...  Ultimately, the success of an announcer is dependent on the audience. You can't communicate a message if no one listens to it. And announcers typically don't have captive audiences; they rely, at least in part, on the power of personality to attract listeners and gain and maintain their attention. Put another way, announcers try to be people other people want to listen to (and perhaps look at). Announcers are often assessed by how well the audience responds to them, which is typically measured in audience ratings. It may seem unfair, but many announcers live or die by the ratings. They must use their talents to attract and &quot;connect&quot; with the target audience...and keep them coming back for more. 
#...broadcast media.  [[Image:Microphone_électrostatique.jpg|thumb|220px|right|One of the announcer's primary tools is the microphone.]]Most people equate the term &quot;broadcasting&quot; with &quot;over the air&quot; radio and television. Certainly the term &quot;broadcast media&quot; includes radio and TV. But in a more general sense, broadcast media can include any technology that extends the power of the human voice to &quot;cast broadly,&quot; that is, to &quot;cast&quot; (convey) messages to a &quot;broad&quot; audience. That could include technologies for sending audio and video signals over cable systems, via satellite, or over the internet. It could include technologies used to record and playback prerecorded messages.  I would even include public address systems, such as that used by announcers at sports stadiums, race tracks and night clubs. Of course, using the term &quot;broadcast media&quot; in such a general fashion does stretch its meaning a bit, but does so in a way the more completely captures the variety of technologies used by announcers. 

Should this definition include television actors, since they also are professionals communicating messages to an audience through the broadcast media?  Probably not.  In general, actors focus on communicating fictional narrative messages while announcers focus on communicating non-fictional expository messages.  But that's a rather &quot;fuzzy line&quot; that doesn't always clearly distinguish acting from announcing.  Suffice it to say that there is a lot of overlap between these two professions. Many announcers would also consider themselves to be actors, and many hold membership in an actors union, like the Screen Actors Guild (SAG).  But probably fewer actors would consider themselves to be announcers.

== Announcing specializations ==
 
While people who practice this profession can be called announcers, most prefer to use a more descriptive title to describe what they do. As a result, not everyone in the announcing profession likes to be called an announcer. There are some good reasons for this. One reason is that the term &quot;announcer&quot; is often associated with radio and television, and not everyone in the announcing profession works in radio and television (although most probably do at some point in their careers). Another reason is that the term &quot;announcer&quot; has come to be associated with the reading of scripts, and not everyone in the announcing profession reads scripts. Another reason is that the term &quot;announcer&quot; sounds rather dated and &quot;old-fashioned.&quot; But perhaps the biggest reason is that some people hold a somewhat negative stereotype of announcers. For some, the term &quot;announcer&quot; implies a person who is in love with the sound of their own voice, is probably a bit pompous, and uses an overly polished and somewhat artificial tone of voice. Even though the vast majority of those who work in the announcing profession don't fit this unfair stereotype, there is just enough of a subtle stigma attached to the word &quot;announcer&quot; that most professionals prefer to use a more specific term.

And there are plenty of more specific terms to go around. Here are a few: 
*'''Disc Jockey''' Many announcers prefer to use the term disc jockey, especially if they primarily announce recorded music on radio. The term reflects the adroit handling of phonographic discs that once was a required part of the job. 
*'''Radio Personality''' Some disc jockeys specialize in providing entertaining and often humorous banter between selections. Sometimes called &quot;radio personalities,&quot; these announcers often talk more than they play music. 
*'''Radio Journalist''' Those who work in radio news often must wear multiple hats, serving as field reporter, news writer, audio producer and studio anchor. 
*'''Television Newscaster''' Television journalists tend to have narrower job descriptions than do their counterparts in radio news. The title &quot;newscaster&quot; is typically reserved for those who routinely appear on a news program. The primary newscasters on a program are typically called &quot;anchors.&quot; 
*'''Voice Artist''' These announcers often specialize in providing character voices, such as the voices for characters in animated films. However, many people use the term &quot;voice artist&quot; in a more general sense to apply to anyone who uses their voice in an &quot;artistic&quot; manner. 
*'''Voiceover Talent''' Many announcers work at providing the voices you hear on commercials, station promos and public service announcements. The term comes from the fact that only the announcers' voices appear &quot;over&quot; the video. If an announcer appears on camera, the term &quot;on-camera talent&quot; or &quot;spokesperson&quot; might be used. 
*'''Sportscaster''' An announcer who specializes in sports broadcasting is often called a sportscaster, although there are a number of more specialized titles as well. An announcer who &quot;calls the action&quot; of a sporting event is typically called a &quot;play-by-play announcer,&quot; while an announcer who provides commentary between plays is called a &quot;color commentator.&quot; 
*'''Club DJ''' This is a general term for an announcer who primarily works at a nightclub, dance hall or disco. Because most radio announcers no longer play discs, the terms &quot;Disc Jockey&quot; and &quot;DJ&quot; are increasingly used to refer to announcers who primarily &quot;spin music&quot; in a public setting. 
*'''Public Address Announcer''' Most public sports venues, including baseball parks, football fields and racetracks, hire announcers to make announcements during an event. Sometimes these announcements are also broadcast (such as the racing call of the &quot;track announcer&quot;). 
*'''Program Host''' Many programs, like game shows, talk shows and some &quot;reality TV&quot; programs, use announcers as hosts or to supplement the hosts. Most game shows, for example, include both on-camera hosts and off-camera announcers. 
*'''Narrator''' Some announcers specialize in providing narrations for documentary films and educational videos. Some specialize in reading literary texts as audiobooks.  Here's one area of announcing that clearly bridges that &quot;fuzzy line&quot; between announcers and actors noted above.

== How many people work as announcers? ==

The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Outlook Handbook provides a lot of useful information regarding the size of the Announcing profession, at least in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition, Announcers, http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos087.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2008-2009 edition of the Handbook, the BLS estimated the number of Americans working in the &quot;Announcers&quot; category at about 71,000 people.  However, the BLS defines announcing more narrowly than I do here, identifying &quot;news analysts, reporters and correspondents&quot; as a separate category.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition, News Analysts, Reporters, and Correspondents, http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos088.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the individuals in this second category, at least those employed in the broadcast media, would be included in the profession of announcing as I define it here.  There may also be some people counted by the BLS in the categories of &quot;Actors, Producers and Directors&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition, Actors, Producers, and Directors, http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos093.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, &quot;Writers and Editors,&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition, Writers and Editors, on the Internet at http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos089.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Broadcast and Sound Engineering Technicians and Radio Operators&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition, Broadcast and Sound Engineering Technicians and Radio Operators, http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos109.htm&lt;/ref&gt; whose work includes some announcing duties.  

So while the BLS counts 71,000 Americans in the Announcer category, I think a more complete count can be achieved by including the 16,000 people the BLS identifies as working in broadcast news and sportscasting.  This would mean that about 87,000 Americans are employed in the broader definition of the announcing field that I'm arguing for here.  

Since the population of the United States is about 300 million, that means that about 1 out of every 3,300 people in the USA are announcers.  To be fair, however, one should compare the number of announcers to the actual number of people employed in the US (excluding children, retired people and those who are unemployed).  As of August 2008, the BLS estimates the US labor force at 155 million, which means that about 1 out of every 1700 jobs are in in the announcing profession. 

{{message box| image=quiz.png | backgroundcolor=beige| heading=Did you know...?| message=In the USA, approximately 87,000 people work in the announcing profession, including about 16,000 broadcast journalists.  That's about the same number of people employed as casino dealers in this country.  Are you feeling lucky?}}

This suggests that announcing is a very competitive field, and indeed it is.  In general, more people want to work in this field than there are jobs in this field.  It's not uncommon for people in the business to feel that there are a thousand people waiting to have their job if they leave.  That may be an exaggeration, but not a gross one.  This is one reason why entry-level announcing jobs tend to not pay well (more on this in a moment).  But keep in mind that those who have polished their skills and demonstrate considerable talent will find it much easier to find work than those who don't seriously devote themselves to excellence in announcing.  Perseverance and practice can go a long way.

== How much do announcers make? ==

[[Image:couric_headshot.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Katie Couric is one of the highest paid women in the Announcing field.]]Some announcers make very good money, because they have talents that are in great demand, and people are willing to pay handsomely for them.  The very few announcers who have reached the top of their profession, such as network news anchors, can earn millions.  When Katie Couric accepted the job of anchor of the ''CBS Evening News'', she reportedly agreed to a salary of $15 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;CBS fought to keep the exact terms of Couric's salary confidential, but most sources agree that it is at least $15 million per year for five years.  See http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-05-12-hollywood-pay_x.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps even more amazing was that Couric may have turned down NBC's offer of $20 million per year to continue hosting ''The Today Show'' in favor of the prestige of being the first sole female anchor on a major network evening newscast.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,185380,00.html.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Of course, it should be pointed out that the ''CBS Evening News'' is a half-hour program, while ''The Today Show'' is four hours long.  So on an hourly basis...well, let's just say Katie is doing quite well for herself.

Unfortunately, most announcers don't make nearly that kind of money.  It is not uncommon for entry-level radio announcers to make minimum wage or just slightly more, especially in smaller towns and for those employed on a part-time basis.  While most announcers earn more than minimum wage, many people are surprised to discover that the average salary is not that much higher.

Again, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) offers us some insight.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag515.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the BLS reports that the average hourly wage for announcers was $18.44, and the average annual salary was $38,360.  Those working in broadcast news made a bit more, with $25.69 as the average hourly wage and $51,350 as the average annual salary.  It's interesting that in both categories, the median wages and salaries were considerably lower than the averages.  For announcers, the median figures were $12.38/hour and $25,740/year, and for broadcast journalists the medians were $17.79/hour and $37,010/year.  The median is the &quot;middle point&quot; in the pay range; in other words, half make more than the median and half make less. The disparity between the averages and the medians suggests that there are a few people who make well above the average (like Katie Couric), and these top-earners consequently &quot;stretch&quot; the industry average well above the middle point of the pay scale.  In statistic-speak, announcing salaries reflect a skewed distribution.

Such salary figures may seem discouraging.  But keep in mind that most announcers earning salaries at the lower end of this range are probably either just starting their careers or working part time (or both).  Also, there tends to be considerable employee turnover in announcing jobs at the lower end of the pay range.  It is fairly common for announcers to move from one job to another many times in the early stages of their careers, as they &quot;work they way up to the top.&quot;  Within a few years of working in the profession, young announcers find that they either &quot;have what it takes&quot; to reach the top, or they don't.  There are many people who work as announcers in their 20s, only to move on to more lucrative careers in their 30s.  For those who stay in the profession, most find they are eventually able to make at least a modestly comfortable salary.

== What kind of training do announcers need? ==

Some people who work in the announcing profession do not have any formal training in the art of effective communication.  A college degree, or for that matter, a high school diploma, is not a requirement for many announcing jobs.  It is quite possible that a person who has a good voice, an engaging style and a persuasive personality can succeed in the announcing profession regardless of academic credentials.

Nevertheless, most announcers have completed at least some post-secondary work.  A college education can greatly increase one's chances of success in the profession, and provides a foundation for a wider range of career opportunities.  This is especially true of those who work in news; nearly all broadcast journalism positions require a bachelor's degree.  Serious journalists often pursue a master's degree in journalism or communication. 

College-level announcing courses are typically offered by departments of communication, broadcasting, or journalism.  Such courses can be found under various titles, like &quot;Broadcast Announcing,&quot; &quot;Communicating on TV &amp; Radio,&quot; and &quot;Performing for the Mass Media.&quot;  Sometimes announcing skills are taught as a part of a broader course, like &quot;Introduction to Broadcasting,&quot; or &quot;Radio Station Operation.&quot;

Sometimes courses in announcing are combined with other courses in a curriculum designed specifically for those pursuing a career in broadcasting.  An aspiring announcer should consider coursework in audio and video production, journalism, broadcast management, voice and articulation, acting, script writing and mass communication.  Depending on one's particular interests, courses in music, sports officiating, marketing, film, advertising and public relations can also be helpful.

Many announcers get their first real &quot;job&quot; at college radio or television stations.  College stations, especially radio stations, are typically operated by students and advised by a faculty member, graduate student or staff person.  The role of the advisor varies greatly from station to station, but most stations fall into one of two categories: faculty-supervised stations that are funded by an academic unit and operated as part of a broadcasting curriculum, and student-managed stations that are funded by student government and operated as a student activity organization.  Both kinds of stations can provide valuable opportunities for learning practical broadcast skills.

== What is the future of the announcing profession? ==

It is likely that there will continue to be a need for announcers.  As long as there are messages that people want to be communicated, there will be those willing to pay for those who can communicate those messages effectively.

Having said this, it is also likely that technological, cultural and economic forces will change the nature of the announcing profession in the coming years.  Radio is changing as people gravitate to iPods and satellite audio delivery services.  Television is changing as people increasingly download videos from the internet.  News is changing as the traditional gatekeeping function of the &quot;mainstream media&quot; is being challenged by the &quot;blogosphere&quot; and alternative media.

Yet while change may be inevitable, the fundamental skills that talented announcers possess will always be in demand.  Formats may change, news values may change, media may change.  But people who can use their voices to convey meaningful messages effectively, persuasively and passionately will rarely be out of a job.  At least not for very long.

The bottom line: not everyone who seeks to be successful in this profession will be successful.  But if you polish your communication skills, sharpen your vocal talents, continually seek to learn more about as much as you can, possess a strong and abiding work ethic, and are willing to be flexible, you can and should go far in this field.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Announcing/Preview|This chapter discusses one of the most important announcing skills: reading copy.  It includes three essential principles for &quot;breathing life into copy.&quot;}}

== Breathing Life into Copy ==

One of the most important skills announcers learn is how to read copy.  The term &quot;copy&quot; refers to the script of an announcement: the words the announcer is expected to say.  Sometimes announcers write their own copy, but more often than not an announcer reads copy written by others.  Announcers do more than simply read words printed on a piece of paper or displayed on a [[w:teleprompter]] screen.  They must be able to &quot;breathe life&quot; into those words.

Think back to your earliest memories of reading words out loud.  For many people, it was in elementary school.  Your teacher may have asked you to read a paragraph out loud from a book.  Perhaps you had to read a nursery rhyme or a portion of a story.  You probably had to read out loud in front of your classmates, some of whom may have been better readers than you were.  How did that make you feel?  What was your reaction to hearing others read out loud?

For many people, reading words out loud in a classroom setting is not their most pleasant childhood memory.  It's not as bad as having to give a speech in front of your peers, perhaps, but it probably was not as fun as other things you did in school.  Especially if you were not very good at it.  And most people weren't.

When you hand a sheet of paper to someone and ask them to read it out loud, it typically sounds a bit boring.  Rather dull.  Lifeless.  That's because when most people read out loud, it sounds like they're reading out loud.  As an announcer, you don't want to sound like that.

An announcer doesn't read words out loud.  An announcer communicates.

When you read out loud, your mind is thinking about the words on the page.  When you communicate, your mind is thinking about the meaning of those words.  When you read out loud, your eyes focus on print.  When you communicate, your eyes focus on the audience.  When you read out loud, your goal is to read the words correctly.  When you communicate, your goal is to get your message across.  And perhaps most importantly, when you read out loud, you sound like you are reading out loud.  When you communicate, you sound like you are communicating.

== Three steps to communication ==

In order to move from simply reading words out loud to communicating a message, it helps to understand the process of communication.  Now while much has been written about that process, I'm going to simplify things greatly for purposes of this discussion.  Focus for a moment on the following three essential steps to communication.

First, you think about what you are going to communicate.  This is the &quot;thinking stage,&quot; where you use your brain to analyze and synthesize the key ideas you wish to convey.  Sometimes this is referred to as [[w:intrapersonal communication]], since it is a form of communication (or &quot;pre-communicative activity&quot;) that occurs inside of you, inside of your head.  It's important that you try to understand what it is you are going to say before you actually say it.  That means that you do more than just keep in mind the meaning of each word that you say.  It means that you think about the meaning behind the message you are going to communicate.

Second, you &quot;capture&quot; that thought into language in order to create a purposeful, meaningful message.  This is the &quot;encoding stage,&quot; where you use your linguistic abilities to put your thoughts into words.  You try to find the right words, and put them in the right order, so that they make sense.  The goal is to form a message that has both meaning and purpose, one that you can communicate effectively, and others can understand easily.

Third, you deliver that message to the audience.  This is the &quot;speaking stage,&quot; where you project the words into sounds intended for others to hear.  You use your voice to add impact and vitality to the words of your message, and you aim your voice to the listener.  You aren't just talking out loud, but rather, you are directing your thoughts, your words, and your voice to your intended audience.

Most of the time, when an announcer is reading copy, the first two steps have already been done.  The ideas in the copy were someone else's ideas.  The words in the copy were someone else's words.  But it is your voice--your speech--that is trying to convey those ideas and breathe life into those words.

That's the key challenge of announcing: to take copy that someone else has written and make it sound like the ideas you are conveying are '''your''' ideas, that the words you are using are '''your''' words.  And that's not easy to do, in part because the only step in this process where you have full control is in the final step, where you speak the words out loud.

In order to meet this challenge, let me share with you what I have found to be three essential qualities for breathing life into copy.  Each of these qualities reflect one of the three steps to communication mentioned above.  While an announcer's involvement in the communication process may seem limited to the &quot;speaking stage,&quot; a talented announcer will sound like he or she was involved in the thinking and encoding stages as well.  How?  By clearly visualizing the message, expressing it with enthusiasm, and delivering it with a popular aim.

== Visualization ==

The first quality is visualization.  An announcer must be able to visualize, to &quot;see&quot; the message clearly.  Like the &quot;thinking stage&quot; in communication, visualization occurs inside of you, inside your mind.  To visualize effectively, an announcer needs to have a good imagination, and the ability to keep their mind focused.  That's not as easy as you might think.

Here's a little experiment I'd like you try.  Below is some broadcast copy for a thirty second radio commercial.  What I want you to do is first read it--out loud--all the way through once.  Then scroll down the page right after you read it, and avoid looking back at the copy.  I've put some space above and below the copy to help keep you honest.

When you're ready, scroll down the page, read the copy out loud, and then scroll down some more to continue the experiment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


----
Remember: just read it through out loud once!
----


'''On a cold, winter day, there’s nothing quite as delicious as a bowl of Campbell’s Tomato Soup ... The wonderful aroma ... the delightful taste ...Mmmm ... Campbell’s Tomato soup really satisfies a winter hunger.  And Campbell’s is good for you: a hearty lunch of Campbell’s soup, a sandwich and a glass of milk provides a wholesome balanced meal.   So the next time you’re looking for something good to warm up a winter day, remember — Campbell’s Tomato Soup is good food!'''


----
Scroll down please!  No looking back (at least not yet).
----

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

   
OK, now try to put the message you just read out loud in your own words.  Write down what you think you just said.  Now scroll back up and compare what you wrote with the copy you read.  What ideas did you recall?  What ideas did you omit?  What ideas, if any, did you express that wasn't in the copy?

Perhaps you recalled the name of the product.  Perhaps you recalled a slogan or catchy phrase.  Perhaps you recalled a word or two that &quot;stuck out&quot; while you were reading the copy.  But none of those things represent the meaning of the message.  They are just words, and if all you remember are words, you have yet to &quot;see&quot; the message behind the words.  Remember, as an announcer, you want to focus on meaning, not words.

Now let's read the copy again.  This time, let's begin by reading just the first phrase:

'''On a cold, winter day...''' 

Stop and think for a moment what that phrase means.  Now try to picture that meaning.  That is, try to vividly imagine a cold, winter day.  Get it clearly fixed in your mind.  Close your eyes and &quot;look&quot; at that picture for a moment.

Did you close your eyes?  C'mon now.  Do it with me.  Close your eyes.  Practice &quot;seeing&quot; with just your mind.

Now try to answer these questions:

* How cold is it?  
* Is it snowing?  
* Is it icy?  
* Is it sleeting?  
* Is it windy?  
* Is it sunny or cloudy?  
* Are you outside in the cold, or inside a warm house?  
* What are you wearing?
* What color clothes are you wearing?
* What state are you in?
* What month is it?  
* What time of day is it?  
* Are you with someone else, or by yourself?
* Is it the present, are you in some other time?
* If it isn't the present, what year is it?
* How do you feel?
* Do you like cold, winter days?  Why or why not?

I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea.  Were you able to sustain in your mind a clear and detailed picture of &quot;a cold, winter day?&quot;  Were you able to not only describe it, but see it with your &quot;mind's eye?&quot;  Was what you saw in your mind a fuzzy, general image or a clearly detailed image?

Practice doing this with the other phrases in the copy.  Read a phrase, then stop and imagine it in your mind before moving on.  Probe your &quot;mental picture&quot; for details.  Try to get as specific as you can.  '''Visualize.'''

== Enthusiasm ==

The second essential quality is enthusiasm.  Announcers do more that just talk out loud.  They communicate messages with genuine enthusiasm.  They may not always get to choose the words they are saying, but they make it sound like those words are their own, that they are a natural expression of a real desire to share something special with the audience.

The word &quot;enthusiasm&quot; has an interesting background.  For most of human history, the word had a religious connotation.  An &quot;enthusiast&quot; was a person inspired by God (or Gods, as in the case of Greek Mythology).  The word itself is of Greek origin, formed by combining the root words ''en'' (in) and ''theos'' (God).  In essence, if you had enthusiasm, God was in you.

Of course, today the word has lost much of its religious significance.  We typically use the word &quot;enthusiasm&quot; to describe an intense interest or enjoyment.  Perhaps it might be used to describe a zest for life, or a zeal for a worthy cause.  But while the word may not be used in the same way as it used to be, it still has, at its core, a touch of the Divine.

Whether you believe in God or not, consider for a moment what it would be like to have God inside of you.  At the very least, you would probably say it would make you feel different, a bit out of the ordinary.  Some might say it would make them feel inspired.  Perhaps even ecstatic.  A few might even say that it would make them feel like they had achieved their &quot;highest destiny,&quot; a state of supreme fulfillment.

Now I'm not suggesting that announcers should try to read copy as if they were divinely inspired to deliver a message from on high.  But I am suggesting that effective announcers convey with their voices a remarkable aura of passion and conviction.  They are able to captivate an audience with their words, almost as if they had some kind of mystical inner power of persuasion.  They are able to communicate a message in such a compelling and irresistible manner that people can't help but listen.

Let me ask you a few question about your personal experiences with communication...

* Have you ever been able to talk so deeply and intimately with someone else that it seemed like you had known them all your life (even if you had just met them)?
* Have you ever met someone that seemed to understand you better than you understood yourself?
* Have you ever felt someone was able to &quot;break down&quot; your defensive psychological &quot;walls&quot; and speak to the &quot;real you&quot;?
* Have you ever had the sense that someone knew what you were going to say before you said it, almost as if they could read your mind?
* Have you ever had the feeling that you could communicate with someone without using words...just by a look, a knowing glance, a wink and a nod?
* Have you ever known someone who was a &quot;born communicator,&quot; seemingly able to connect with anyone, at any time, at any level?

If you answered yes to any of the above, perhaps you can appreciate what I'm about to say next.  Communication doesn't just occur at the level of words, and it doesn't just occur at the level of our minds.  The most powerful communication occurs at the level of our innermost beings, our souls, if you will.  The most effective communicators speak from the heart...directly to your heart.

When I say that an essential quality of breathing life into copy is enthusiasm, what I'm trying to say is that you need to breathe some of your own life into the copy.  You need to en-thuse your copy, to inject a piece of your innermost self into your reading.

How do you do that?  Well, it's not a skill that is easily taught.  Everyone is different, and what works for me might not work for you.  But I believe everyone can learn this skill.  

In fact, I believe you already have this talent inside of you, but you might not choose to use it very often.  Maybe you feel that it's risky to talk &quot;from your heart.&quot;  And indeed it can be risky.  People might see the real person inside of you.  But it can also be risky to not put your heart and soul into what you say.  People tend to resist listening to someone that doesn't sound like &quot;the real thing.&quot;  If your announcing lacks genuine enthusiasm, most people will simply tune out.  And if they tune out-- no matter how good you think you may sound--you've failed to communicate.

Perhaps the first thing one must do to be genuinely enthusiastic is to be genuine.  Be honest with yourself.  Take a good, long, hard look in the mirror.  Don't focus on your flaws; we all have imperfections.  Nobody is perfect.  You aren't perfect.  But inside of you is something good.  Something potentially great.  Something that, if you just &quot;let it out&quot; and polish it a bit, can shine brightly.  So let it.  Look deep into those eyes in the mirror, gazing through the clouds of artificiality to get inside to your natural beauty.  Lock onto it, and with as much determination as you can muster, decide today to never keep it hidden again.

If that sounds like a pep talk, well, it is.  But if you are ever to achieve a knack for injecting natural enthusiasm into your copy, that's the kind of pep talk you need.  And you need to be able to give that pep talk to yourself every time you get behind a microphone or in front of a camera.  Whatever words, thoughts, ideas, images, or sayings that work for you--do what it takes to help yourself reach the point where you just naturally believe in yourself.  All the time.

When I was a young man attending broadcasting school, one of my instructors said something to me that I will never forget.  It's something I would like to share with you now.  It's not exactly a pep talk, but for me, it was what I needed to hear.  In a sense, it was my &quot;announcing epiphany,&quot; the &quot;ah hah!&quot; moment when I finally saw the &quot;light&quot; of how to read with natural enthusiasm.

I was ''woodshedding''--reading a piece of copy out loud, over and over and over again, trying to get it just right.  But each time, my instructor said, no, do it again.  So I would try to read it a slightly different way.  Then another way.  They still another way.  &quot;No, not there yet,&quot; he would say.  

Finally, after trying what seemed like a hundred different approaches, I said to him, &quot;I've tried it every possible way I've can!&quot;  

He replied, &quot;Precisely.  And THAT'S the problem.  You're TRYING.  I can hear that in your read...I can hear that you are TRYING.  I don't want to hear someone trying to talk to me.  I want to hear someone who IS talking to me.  So DON'T TRY.  JUST DO.&quot;  

At first I thought he was crazy. But I decided to gave it a try.  Or should I say, I decided to stop trying.  

So I just looked at him, then looked at the copy, and just read it, without trying to do anything special.  And I nailed it.  We both knew instantly that It was much better than any read I had done previously. 

He just smiled and said, &quot;See, that wasn't so hard.  You had it in you all the time.  But all that TRYING was getting in way.  All I could hear was the effort, not the real you communicating to me.  So remember: DON'T TRY. JUST DO.&quot;

== Audience Focus ==

When most people read out loud the words on a piece of paper, they typically don't think too much about who may be listening.  They focus on the words, not the message.  They focus on the reading of those words, not the hearing of them.

But the words in a piece of copy are much more than just the words an announcer reads.  They are the fundamental tools for communicating a message effectively to as broad an audience as possible.  When a skillful announcer communicates a message, the focus is very much on those who are listening, and how they hear that message.  Announcers strive for an '''audience focus.'''  

Now perhaps you were born with perfect 20/20 vision, and you can see the world around you in sharp focus.  I'm not so lucky; I've had to wear glasses most of my life.  I'm very nearsighted.  That means when I'm not wearing glasses, anything that isn't within a few inches from my eyes is blurry.  If I want to see something in focus, I either have to bring them right up to my face, or I have to put on my glasses.

[[Image:Bifoklabrille_fcm.jpg|thumb| Just as wearing glasses can help one see the world in better focus, announcers develop techniques for seeing the audience in better focus.]]There are some announcers who have perfect 20/20 &quot;audience vision&quot; as well.  They can clearly focus on the unseen audience that is hearing their message.  They just naturally sound like they are connecting with the audience, speaking as if they can see the people they are speaking to.  Maybe some announcers are &quot;born&quot; with such perfect audience focus.

But I think most announcers must work hard to bring their audience in focus.  A clear focus on an unseen audience doesn't come easy for most people. Sure, beginning announcers may be able to imagine the audience, but not with a very sharp focus.  Like the world I see without my glasses, the audience may seem rather blurry.  So while it may be relatively easy for you as a beginning broadcast performer to imagine that someone is in the audience, listening and perhaps watching you as you deliver your message, it will take time--and a lot of practice--to develop the ability to develop a clear, sharp focus on the audience.

There are a number of strategies

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Announcing/Preview|This chapter discusses one of the announcer's most valuable assets: a pleasant voice.  It identifies five &quot;building blocks&quot; to help you develop a more polished voice.}}

One of the most valuable assets of an announcer is a pleasant voice.

== Breathing ==
Your voice is a wind instrument: It’s made from the air you breathe.   A polished voice is supported by a firm foundation of air, resting on a flexible membrane below your lungs called the diaphragm.  The diaphragm is like a &quot;shelf&quot; of muscles and tendons near the bottom of your rib cage that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity.

Your lungs are shaped like triangles, with a narrow point at the top and a wide base at the bottom.  Because the lungs are narrower at the top and wider at the bottom, your lungs hold most of the air you breathe near the bottom.  At least that is the case if you fill your lungs by breathing from the diaphragm.  But over time, people develop poor breathing habits.  Rather than fill their lungs to capacity by breathing from the diaphragm, they use only a portion of the lung's capacity.  They become &quot;shallow breathers,&quot; using only a small portion of their lungs' capacity.

Breathing from the diaphragm helps you maximize your lungs' capacity.  It can fill up your lungs fully and quickly.  For good breathing, think about how a person breathes when they are sleeping. If you watch a person sleep, you will notice that their belly expands, rather than their chest. This is because of the action of the diaphragm.

It can also help reduce the sound of your breathing, which is an important consideration when you are using a microphone.

Diaphragmatic breathing can also help relax you.  Taking a deep, deliberate breath from the diaphragm is an excellent way to reduce &quot;mic fright&quot; or &quot;stage fright.&quot;

But perhaps most importantly, breathing from the diaphragm can help you achieve a dramatic improvement in the quality of your voice.  It is the foundation upon which rests all of the other &quot;building blocks to a polished voice&quot; discussed below.

== Posture ==

Keep your upper body straight. Think about a string pulling up the top of your head as if you were a marionette. If your upper body is not straight, it will restrict your breathing and the action of your diaphragm. 

You do not want to cave in you chest as that restricts that area. Think about pushing your shoulders back. On the other hand, do not be straight and stiff as a board. You should be relaxed. Find a happy medium that works.

== Resonance ==

== Vocal Variety ==

== Style ==

      <comment>/* Four Vocal Components */ a bit of formating</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Announcers need to speak clearly in order to communicate effectively.

== Four Vocal Components ==

Your voice is made up of four parts:

* Breathing
* Phonation
* Resonance
* Articulation

A skillful announcer will learn to effectively use all four.

===Breathing is the Foundation===

Fundamentally, your voice is made up of exhaled air. When you are relaxed and quiet, the time you spend inhaling and exhaling are about equal. When speaking, inhalation is much quicker, and exhalation is sustained and controlled.

===Phonation===

As you exhale, air passes through the larynx (voice box). Stretched across each side of the larynx are thin flexible muscle tissues called vocal folds (cords). During phonation, the vocal folds are brought close together, so air pressure causes them to vibrate.

===Resonance===

The sound produced from phonation is weak…no more than a whisper. Resonance amplifies and enriches the weak phonated sound, by extending the vibration of the vocal folds to surrounding body tissues in the throat, chest and head.

===Articulation===

The critical final step in voice production is articulation, the “packaging” of individual sound segments into meaningful utterances. The three primary articulators — tongue, lips, and jaw — shape and delineate the phonated tones into distinct speech sounds.

== Three Types of Speech Sounds ==
There are three types of sounds in Standard American English speech:
Vowels (pure phonated sounds)
Diphthongs (vowel combinations)
Consonants (phonemes)

=== Vowels ===
You may have been taught that there are five vowels: A, E, I, O and U.
Actually, there are at least twelve distinct vowel sounds in Standard American English speech.
The differences between vowel sounds is largely due to the placement of the tongue.

==== Front Vowels ====
	Five vowels are produced with the tongue toward the front of the mouth:
EE (beet, eat, see) [high, tense]
IH (bit, did, sit) [high, lax]
AY(ate, bait, pay) [mid, tense]
EH (bet, get, end) [mid, lax]
AAH (at, bat, cat) [low, tense]

==== Back Vowels ====
	Five vowels are produced with the tongue toward the back of the mouth:
AH (alms, bomb, on) [low, lax]
AW (bought, off, saw) [mid, lax]
OH (boat, oak, own) [mid, tense]
OOH (book, cook, foot) [high, lax]
OO (boot, oops, move) [high, tense]

==== Middle Vowels ====
	Two vowels are produced with the tongue in the middle of the mouth:
UH (bun, sun, the) [low, lax]
ER (bird, her, sir) [mid, tense]
The unstressed UH, or schwa sound, is one of the most common vowels in American English Speech.

Making the most of Vowels
A vowel sound is the only kind of speech sound that can be held indefinitely without changing.
Vowel extension refers to the elongation of vowel sounds, especially in the final syllable of words and sentences.  A bit can be pleasing; too much is distracting. 

=== Vowel Deviations ===
Lazy tongue placement can lead to vowel deviations, where one vowel sound is used in place of another.
Many common mispronunciations are due to vowel deviations.
Consider whether you may be guilty of the following vowel deviations…

'''EH for AY'''

For some, the AY sound is difficult to say when it is before an UL sound.
&lt;pre&gt;Try saying PAY and PAIL. 
Then say PAY and PELL.
Does the AY sound in PAIL sound closer to the sound in PAY or PELL?
Practice JAIL, FAIL, MAIL, WAIL. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''EH for AAH'''

Many will substitute EH for AAH, especially in unstressed syllables.
&lt;pre&gt;Try saying BAT and SHALL.
Then say BAT and SHELL.
Does the AAH sound in SHALL sound closer to BAT or SHELL?
Practice MARY, PARIS, TARRY.
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''EH for IH'''

A fairly common vowel deviation is EH for IH.
&lt;pre&gt;Try saying BIT and MILK.
Then say BIT and ELK.
Does the IH sound in MILK sound closer to BIT or ELK?
Practice SINCE, FILL, THINK.
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''AH for AW'''

Some people fail to distinguish the sounds AH and AW.
&lt;pre&gt;Say ON and BOMB.
Then say ON and BAUGHT.
Does the AH sound in BOMB sound closer to ON or BAUGHT?
Practice DON and DAWN.
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''IH for EE'''

Like AY, the EE  sound is difficult to say when it is before an UL sound.
&lt;pre&gt;Try saying WE and MEAL.
 Then say WE and MILL.
Does the EE sound in MEAL sound closer to the sound in WE or MILL?
Practice REALLY, DEAL, HEAL.
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Diphthongs ==
A diphthong is a sound positioned between two vowel sounds, where one vowel sound glides into another.
Some speakers with lazy articulators (jaw, lips, tongue) fail to make a distinctive glide between vowel sounds in diphthongs.

'''EYE'''

The EYE sound, or long I, is a glide formed from the AH and IH sounds.
&lt;pre&gt;Practice these sentences:
Try my fine pie.
I like my bike.
Why try to lie?
My sly guy cries at night. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''AU'''

The AU sound, as in how, is a glide between the AH and OOH sounds.
&lt;pre&gt;Practice these sentences:
How can a brown cow be loud?
A mouse is now in my house.
Our town’s gown is around a pound.
The outside outlet is grounded. 
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''OY'''

The OY sound, as in BOY, is a glide between the OH and IH sounds.
&lt;pre&gt;Practice these sentences:
His toy made Roy a noisy boy.
I employ an oily coin.
I like soy on my boiled oysters.
I annoyed Floyd by joining Troy. 
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''YOO'''

The YOO sound is a glides formed from the IH and OO sounds, typically with a soft Y sound at the beginning.
&lt;pre&gt;Practice these sentences:
I refused to use or abuse the few.
Tuesday’s news was useful.
The beautiful view imbued with hue.
You can tune some new music in June.
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Consonants ==
	While vowels and diphthongs carry most of the sound in language, consonants carry most of the meaning of language.  It is thus important for announcers to clearly articulate consonant sounds to ensure the meaning of copy is clear.

=== Voiced vs. Unvoiced ===
Consonants can be classified as either voiced or unvoiced.
Voiced consonants are always combined with a vowel sound, like B, D, G, V, Z and hard TH.
Unvoiced consonants are distinct interruptions between vowel sounds, like P, T, K, F, S and soft TH. 

=== Plosives and Fricatives ===
Plosives are formed by the sudden release of air. Plosive consonants include P, B, T, D, K, and G.
Fricatives are formed by the friction of air flowing through restricted air passages.  Fricative consonants include F, V, TH, Z, S, SH and ZH.

=== Nasals and Affricates ===
Nasals employ resonance in the nasal cavities.  The nasal consonants include M, N and NG.
Affricates combine a plosive with a fricative.  The affricates include the unvoiced CH and the voiced J.

=== Extreme Consonants ===
Announcers need to be careful of the extreme consonants that can be distorted by microphones:
The “popping plosives” P and B
The “clicking plosives” K and G
Excess sibilance from S and Z
Excess nasality from M, N and NG

Steeling Consonants
Most people are sloppy articulators of consonant sounds, especially the final T and D sounds of unstressed syllables and at ends of sentences.
Announcers should practice “steeling consonants”—striving to make them crisp, clean and clear.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Windows dialogs are useful when you would like to retrieve information from the user, as in asking where to save a file, letting the user to choose a color or font and what settings to use when printing (copies, what printer to use, ect.). This saves you from a lot of  unnecessary work reinventing the wheel - as redesigning and making dialogs can be quite time-consuming - but is also essential in establishing a standard user interface across applications. Standardization of different aspects of the user interface, both in terms of normal [[Wikipedia:widget_(computing)|widgets]] as well as common ways of combining them, ensures that applications are intuitive - i.e. that once someone has learned to use an application, this knowledge can be employed to other applications as well.

The easiest way to access these controls is to use a component called ''Microsoft Common Dialog Control 6.0''. To add this component to your project, choose ''Project - Components'', and mark it in the controls list. Subsequently, a new control should appear in your control toolbox. Choose it, and place the control onto your form (note it's only visible in design time).

The control allows the use of the following dialogs. The flags mentioned is different values that can be set to the Flags property, changing the behaviour or design of the different dialogs.

==Open and Save dialogs==
''ShowOpen'' shows a dialog that lets the user choose a drive, directory, file name and file extension to (presumably) open a file.

The save dialog is identical in apperance and function, with the exception of the caption. At run time, when the user chooses a file and closes the dialog box, the ''FileName'' property is used to get the selected file name.

[[Image:OpenDialog.png|300px|]]

===Before displaying the dialog===
Before you can use these dialogs, you must first set the Filter property to allow the user to select a file extension (set default extension using ''DefaultExt''). The filter property is a string with the following structure:
    description1|filter1|description2|filter2|

Here, the description is the string that shows up in the list box of all the available filters to choose from. The filter is a file glob expression (otherwise known as a wild card expression) that does the actually filtering, for example, ''&quot;*.txt&quot;'', which disallows any file extensions but TXT.  It is important to recognize the difference between expressions of this kind and regular expressions which are much more powerful but also more complicated, see [[../Regular Expressions/]].

===Code example===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    On Error Resume Next
    
    ' Clear errors
    Err.Clear
    
    ' Use this common dialog control throughout the procedure
    With CommonDialog1
        
        ' Raises an error when the user press cancel
        .CancelError = True
        
        ' Set the file extensions to allow
        CommonDialog1.Filter = &quot;All Files (*.*)|*.*|TextFiles (*.txt)|*.txt|Batch Files (*.bat)|*.bat&quot;
         
        ' Display the open dialog box.
        .ShowOpen
        
        ' Ignore this if the user has canceled the dialog
        If Err &lt;&gt; cdlCancel Then
    
            ' Open the file here using FileName
            MsgBox &quot;You've opened '&quot; &amp; .FileName &amp; &quot;'&quot;
            
        End If
    
    End With
&lt;/source&gt;

==Color dialog==
The color dialog allows the user to select a color from both a palette as well as through manual choosing using RGB or HSL values. You retrieve the selected color using the Color property.

[[Image:ColorDialog.png]]

===Code example===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    ' Don't raise errors normally
    On Error Resume Next
    
    ' Clear errors
    Err.Clear
    
    ' Use this common dialog control throughout the procedure
    With CommonDialog1
    
        ' Raises an error when the user press cancel
        .CancelError = True
        
        ' Set the Flags property.
        .Flags = cdlCCRGBInit
        
        ' Display the Color dialog box.
        .ShowColor
    
        ' Ignore this if the user has canceled the dialog
        If Err &lt;&gt; cdlCancel Then
    
            ' Set the form's background color to the selected color.
            Me.BackColor = .Color
            
        End If
    
    End With
&lt;/source&gt;

==Font dialog==
The Font dialog box allows the user to select a font by its size, color, and style. Once the user makes selections in the Font dialog box, the following properties contain information about the user's selections.

[[Image:FontDialog.png]]

===Properties===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!Property:
!Determines:
|-
|Color
|The selected color. To use this property, you must first set the Flags property to cdlCFEffects.
|-
|FontBold
|Returns whether the bold checkbox was selected.
|-
|FontItalic
|Returns whether the italic checkbox was selected.
|-
|FontStrikethru
|Returns whether the strikethrough checkbox was selected.
|-
|FontUnderline
|Returns whether the underline checkbox was selected.
|-
|FontName
|Returns the selected font name.
|-
|FontSize
|Returns the selected font size.
|}

===Before displaying the dialog===
To display the dialog, you must first set the Flags property either cdlCFScreenFonts or cdlCFPrinterFonts (or cdlCFBoth, if you intend to let the user choose between both screen fonts and printer fonts). 

===Code example===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    ' *** This example require a textbox called ''txtText'' to execute properly. ***
    On Error Resume Next
    
    ' Clear errors
    Err.Clear
    
    ' Use this common dialog control throughout the procedure
    With CommonDialog1
    
        ' Raises an error when the user press cancel
        .CancelError = True
        
        ' Show printer and screen fonts, as well as a font color chooser.
        .Flags = cdlCFBoth Or cdlCFEffects
        
        ' Display the font dialog box.
        .ShowFont
    
    End With
    
    ' Ignore this if the user has canceled the dialog
    If Err &lt;&gt; cdlCancel Then
    
        ' Set the textbox's font properties according to the users selections.
        With txtText
            .Font.Name = CommonDialog1.FontName
            .Font.Size = CommonDialog1.FontSize
            .Font.Bold = CommonDialog1.FontBold
            .Font.Italic = CommonDialog1.FontItalic
            .Font.Underline = CommonDialog1.FontUnderline
            .FontStrikethru = CommonDialog1.FontStrikethru
            .ForeColor = CommonDialog1.Color
        End With
        
    End If
&lt;/source&gt;

==Print dialog==
The print dialog box allows the user to select how output should be printed. Options and properties accessible to the user includes the amount of copies to make, print quality, the range of pages to print, ect. It also allows the user to choose another printer, as well as configure different settings regarding the current printer.

[[Image:PrintDialog.png]]

===Properties===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!Property:
!Determines:
|-
|Copies
|The amount of copies to print.
|-
|FromPage
|The starting page of the print range.
|-
|ToPage
|The ending page of the print range.
|-
|hDC
|The device context for the selected printer.
|-
|Orientation
|The page's orientation (as in portrait or landscape).
|}

===Before displaying the dialog===
Before showing the dialog, feel free to set the appropriate print dialog properties to set the default values to use.

===Code example===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    On Error Resume Next
    
    ' Variables that holds information regarding the print setup.
    Dim BeginPage As Long, EndPage As Long, NumCopies As Long, Orientation As Long, Tell As Long
    
    ' Clear errors
    Err.Clear
    
    ' Use this common dialog control throughout the procedure
    With CommonDialog1
        
        ' Raises an error when the user press cancel
        .CancelError = True
         
        ' Display the printer dialog box.
        .ShowPrinter
        
        ' Ignore this if the user has canceled the dialog
        If Err &lt;&gt; cdlCancel Then
    
            ' Retrieve the printer settings the user has chosen.
            BeginPage = CommonDialog1.FromPage
            EndPage = CommonDialog1.ToPage
            NumCopies = CommonDialog1.Copies
            Orientation = CommonDialog1.Orientation
            
            ' Start printing
            For i = 1 To NumCopies
                ' Put code here to send data to your printer.
            Next
            
        End If
    
    End With
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic context in which evolutionary biology works is phylogeny, a system of classification based on evolutionary relationships rather than phenotypic similarity.
The central tenet of evolution is that all life is derived from a single common ancestor, and all life is therefore related.  The process by which living things have diverged to the staggering diversity on this world is through the divergence of populations into separate species, which in turn give rise to more distant cousins through time.

We express the relationships among groups of organisms through diagrams called cladograms. If the common ancestor is known and included in the depiction and the depiction includes an axis of time, it is referred to as an evolutionary tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{useful|WB:CAT}}

'''Wikibooks''' uses several methods of page organization, the easiest of which are '''Categories'''. This page discusses how to categorize pages properly.

[[File:Wikibooks structure.svg|right|The structure of Wikibooks: Category and subjects contain books, which themselves contain pages and modules.]]
{{TOC|float=left}}
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

== Categories ==
Categories achieve three main goals in the organization of books. 

#Categories serve as &quot;book binders&quot;. Holding all pages or chapters of a book together in their own category.
#Categories sort books by subject matter. Thus, the &quot;book binders&quot; of all books on a subject will appear in a particular category. This allows navigation through all books from general to the most specific subjects.
#Categories serve to identify problem areas so that people can help improve books and the Wikibooks project.

Categories also allow automated lists of related pages to be compiled, because any changes to a category will cause any lists depending on the category to be updated as well. The most common example of this is in the construction of [[SUB:SUBJECTS|subject pages]].

The sections below explain how to categorize books using the different methods to ensure books can be easily found.

=== Books ===
A '''book category''' is a category that indexes all pages, templates and media of a single book. Each book should have its own book category. Book categories should use the same name as the book itself. For example, the book category for &quot;My Book&quot; book should be &quot;Category:My Book&quot;. Books and book categories should be categorized by subject using all the same subject categories (see below).

A common practice is to place {{tl|BookCat}} inside any template intended to be used on all pages of a book or directly at the bottom of all pages in a book. In this way, pages can be added to a book category simply by adding the appropriate template.  {{tl|BookCat}} will file the page it is placed on into the book's category and sort the pages inside that category by the portion of the title following the book's name.  As a result, an alphabetical index of all a book's pages can be obtained.

=== Subjects ===
A '''subject category''' is a category that groups together books on a related topic. Subject categories should use [[w:sentence case|sentence casing]] to prevent conflict with book categories. For example the subject category for fine art is [[:Category:Fine arts]]. Subject categories should only be created when there are multiple books that can be added to the category.

To add a book to one or more specific subject categories you can use the {{tl|subjects}} template on a book's main/title page. Books should only be added to subject categories as subject specific as possible. For example the book [[Music Theory]] is located in [[:Category:Music theory]], but not in [[:Category:Music]], because  musical theory is a more specific topic than music. Cross categorization should only be used to aid in finding books that are legitimately important to several subject areas and not used to simply advertise new books. Sub-pages of books must never be included in subject categories (if you use {{tl|subjects}} on sub-pages, the book category will be added, but subject categories won't).

Subject categories are used in conjunction with [[Wikibooks:Subject pages|subject pages]] to help make finding books easier, so proper categorization is important. For instance [[Subject:Mathematics]] lists all books located in [[:Category:Mathematics]].

=== Projects ===
A '''project category''' is category for associating several related books with a particular project. For instance, all books written for a single course curriculum (science, math, and language books). For these situations, you should add all the related books into the necessary project categories.

=== Organizational ===
Wikibooks uses a number of other organizational schemes such as an [[WB:ABC|Alphabetical]] listing and a [[Wikibooks:Reading Levels|Reading Levels]] system. Each of these organization systems use categories to produce lists of books.

=== Subcategories ===
A '''subcategory''' is a category that links to one or more other categories through the use of the category system, effectively creating a parent-child relationship. All categories should be a subcategory of one or more other categories, except for the [[:CAT:CATS|root category]]. By using subcategories, we can all navigate through the category system faster and more effectively find the book, page, image or template we are looking for.

Subcategories should only be created as needed, such as dividing a large subject or book category in order to find books or pages quicker. Any new categories created for this purpose should have a good descriptive name that shares some common characteristics with the larger category name. For example [[:Category:Music theory]] is a subcategory of [[:Category:Music]] and effectively describes a common relationship between the two categories. Another example is [[:Category:Algebra]] and [[:Category:Mathematics]]. 

Book subcategories are also sometimes used; for instance, if a book is not using a flat structure and consists of several chapters with many subpages in each one, {{tlx|BookCat|filing{{=}}deep}} can be placed on the pages of the book or in a template placed on those pages to create subcategories of the form {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Category:Book Name/Chapter Name&lt;/tt&gt;}}.  Then simply add {{tl|BookCat}} to those subcategories to automatically place them in the root book category of the book.

=== How categories work ===
Pages are listed in categories by adding a category link on pages (usually at the bottom). For example, this project was listed in [[:Category:Categories]] by adding:

:&lt;pre&gt;[[Category:Categories|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]&lt;/pre&gt;

The subpagename magic word helps organize category pages by sorting pages by name. This can be particular useful for books since all pages begin with the book name.

Now say you were looking for information on animal behavior. In this case, there is only one distinct path to find books on the subject:

* [[:Category:Categories]]  (organizational category)
** [[:Category:Books by subject]] (organizational category)
*** [[:Category:Science]] (subject category)
**** [[:Category:Biology]] (subject category)
***** [[:Category:Zoology]] (subject category)

If you wanted [[Animal Behavior]] to be found here, you would need to add {{tl|BookCat}} to the bottom of each page, and add {{tlx|subjects|zoology}} to [[Animal Behavior]] and [[:Category:Animal Behavior]]. By now you should be starting to understand how Zoology is added to Biology, and so on.

In general, categories go from the most general to most specific category. You can link to a category by adding:

:&lt;pre&gt;[[:Category:Category Name|display text]]&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transliteration is a mapping from one system of writing into another. Transliteration attempts to be lossless, so that an informed reader should be able to reconstruct the original spelling of unknown transliterated words. To achieve this objective transliteration may define complex conventions for dealing with letters in a source script which do not correspond with letters in a goal script. Romaji is an example of a transliterating method.

      <comment>/* How nature will force this kind of ethics? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Basics of an ethic for nature'''

==Introduction ==
Nature is rather immoral from a human view, since it worries little about our conceptions of good and bad.     

If one wants to set up such a thing like an ethics for nature, then this is a cultural achievement. The term ethics for nature is used thereby equivalently to ''' ecological ethics ''' or ''' environmental ethics '''.   The ethics for nature tries to specify the correct way of human acting in relation to nature.     

How can an ethics for nature look like ?    

==Basics of an ethic for nature==    

Basis of each ethic for nature must be the survival of nature and mankind. If humans become extinct, also each ethics is redundant. Therefore the most important set of an ethics for nature are the following:    

*'''You must support survival of life on earth '''.   
*'''You must support survival of mankind on earth. '''   
*'''You should avoid everything, which makes survival of life and mankind more difficult.

If you do not want to follow these rules, you do not have to. But sooner or later you will notice, that it is easier to live with nature rather than against it. 

Laws of nature can be bent only with difficulty. If one fires for example enormous quantities of fossil energy, how we do that today, one does not need to be surprised, if the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere rises and it becomes warmer and warmer. 

A change of the goals in order to save fossil energy and for the use of renewable energy sources is thus inevitable.     

The ethics for nature are not a “natural right” or a “natural moral”. The rules come from humans. Humans and life will die out anyway sometime. The concern is to keep this unevitable end as far away as possible. Exactly like each one of us should live in good friendship with his body in order to live as long as possible without unnecessary diseases. Although nobody can escape from death as good and healthy he tried to live.

The ethics for nature should not be an exaggerated love for nature. A “general love for all creatures” like Albert Schweitzer demanded it, is not possible. Where do the loved creatures begin and where do they end. Albert Schweitzer surely exterminated malarial parasites with large devotion, although they are organisms too. Reasonably he did not love them, but fought against them, even though  this contradicted his own ethical principles.    

==How nature will force this kind of ethics? ==    

The conception of a punishing nature is scientifically unreasonable. There are however consequences of human acting, which work like punishments, because they bring substantial and predictable disadvantages with itself.   

Thus the population growth will be stopped by different factors:  

*Mankind will run out of food
*Mankind will run out of water
*The dense population leads to aggression and war.   
*Diseases lead to premature death. They are easily spread by worldwide travel.
*Ecological damage leads to a fast or creeping death by poisoning.    

The waste of energy will be reduced by the following factors.   

*The carbondioxid production leads to a rise of the carbon dioxide level in the air.  *Die atmosphere heats up. Storms and inundations increase.      

On the other hand many disasters have an natural cause and are not man made. The Tsunami in Southeast Asia in the year 2004 was a natural catastrophe. Naive humans may regard therein the punishment of a higher instance of nature or an angry God. Scientifically these opinions are unreasonable.

==Why is an ethical behavior to nature important for us? ==  

The necessity of ethics for nature is quite clear today. From the long list of the environmental problems there are mentioned some:   

*Ecological damage by industrialization, traffic, tourism and agriculture,   
*Growth of garbage, exhaust gases and waste water,   
*Sound - and light contamination   
*Radioactivity by atomic energy and nuclear weapons,   
*Climatic change, ozone hole   
*Loss of species and habitat destruction  
*Monocultures, pesticides, overfishing, 
*Waste of energy and resources

Already in the interest of the today living persons, and even more in the interest of the coming generations  the long list of these negative consequences of todays ''developed'' life will force a change and will limit the human freedom of action.    

==Ethics for nature practical view ==  

From the rather generally formulated principles of the ethics for nature the practical application leads us to environmental protection. By appropriate laws, their control and forced application ethics for nature will become a part of the general system of necessary laws. The most difficult laws will handle global environmental problems for example the carbon dioxide problem, because it is not so easy not enforce them. In addition, here the increasing heating up of the atmosphere forces all states to introduce obligatory volume controls in order to achieve the generally accepted goals.    

*environmental protection   
*nature protection    

Many environmental organisations help to contribute their part to the preservation of our natural environment and help to implement environmental policy.    

==Citations==  
*Georg Picht, the 1982 deceased religion philosopher: 
''If you recognize the ecological function of the ethical and moral values, then you cannot hang on to the illusion, that humans have the liberty, to set their own values. They are forced to these values to a very broad extent by the structure of an ecological system, whose limits cannot be crossed unpunished. ''  

*Friedrich Engels: 
''We can not be too proud of human victories over nature. For every such victory will come back on us again. Every victory has primarily the consequences, which we expected, but in the second and third line it has completely different effects, which way out those first gains again. The people in Mesopotamien, Greece and small Asia , which exterminated their forests, in order to win land for agriculture, did not dream that they would thereby cause the current depopulation of those countries… And in such a way we are reminded of the fact that we do not control nature, how a conquerer controls a strange people - We are reminded of the fact that with our body, blood and brain we belong to nature. The only thing that gives us an advantage above other creatures is our knowledge of these laws of nature and the necessity of their correct application.''

== One-Liner Guidelines ==

Here are some things that aren't necessarily policy, but that I think are as good as policy:

#The books are the most important thing.
#People are here to write books, not to deal with drama or bullshit. See #1.
#You may be responsible for more drama and bullshit then you realize. See #2.
#Don't start fights, see #2.
#If it isn't broken, don't fix it.
#If it is broke, fix it.
#If it can't be fixed, toss it out.
#Keep things simple
#Wikibooks isn't all things for all people. We are making no attempts to correct this.
#Sometimes, the best thing you can do is leave.
#If you don't know, ask. If nobody knows, draft up a version.
#We aren't on a schedule. If you are, there will be stress. We make no apologies for this.

Hello! My name is Andrew Whitworth, although most users here on Wikibooks will better know me as [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]].  

This username represents a legitimate front to my Wiki persona. My main account, [[User:Whiteknight]] will be used for the bulk of my edits and contributions. My puppet account, [[User:wknight8111]] will be used primarily in conjunction with my bot to perform automated cleanup tasks. This username, while used rarely, will likely be used on other projects such as the new [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_New_York_City New York City Chapter] and the Wikimedia [[meta:Chapters committee|Chapters committee]]. I also use my real name on mailing lists and other forms of extra-wiki communications.

== About Me ==

[[Image:User Whiteknight.jpg|thumb|right|This is me.]]

I am (under my other user name) a '''bureaucrat''' and '''checkuser''' here on en.wikibooks. I have accounts on other wikis as well (see the list below), but they are all mostly inactive. 

I graduated in May 2006 with a BS in Electrical/Computer Engineering, and in May 2008 with an MS in Electrical Engineering from Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. My research interests include embedded systems, digital signal processing, computer architecture, and digital control.  As a former TA, I have teaching experience in the areas of [[Communication Systems]], [[Circuit Theory]] [[Embedded Systems]], [[Robotics]] and [[C Programming]]. I have worked with the [http://www.temple.edu/csnap CSNAP Laboratory] on research projects ranging from satellite control systems to data fusion and image processing and the [http://www.temple.edu/scdc/ SCDC Laboratory] working on System-on-Chip and PGA design.

:I do like the text of this, but I worry that some of the language is almost too convoluted to understand. However, i note that there probably isn't an easy way to describe what you are trying to say. You might want to include mention of some categories, such as the root category ([[:Category:Main Page]]), the category for things specific to wikibooks ([[:Category:Wikibooks]]), and some other categories of note. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:09, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
::No, it's definitely explainable in easier language, I'm just using a mathematical shorthand to describe the structure before translating it to plaing English.

== Case against categories ==

I want to re-establish my case against broad wholesale categorizing of all pages on Wikibooks.  For me, I think it is foolhardy at best and damaging to absurdity at its worst.

Mind you, I am not against the use of categories ''within'' a given Wikibook, as a tool for the authors of that Wikibook, but I am against working to make sure that each and every page of every Wikibook is put into some category page.  The main reasons are as follows:

*It is a waste of time.  Not only to category arrangements change over time, so do structures of the book itself.  Active Wikibooks users who want to go through the 20,000+ pages could be more useful doing things like culling orphaned pages, fighting vandalism, and other more useful tasks.  While my priorities might not be yours, this certainly can be considered quite a low priority item by most objective views.
:*It might be a waste of time for your particular purposes, but not for others, such as keeping track of things. If [[Special:Uncategorizedpages]] is kept empty, it would then provide a good place to go for those seeking to make sure new modules are well-seated and easy to find. Working through the backbone structure of wikibooks might not have the thrill of marking things for deletion and stomping on vandals, but there are ''constructive'' ways to improve what's here, as opposed to the destroying of clutter. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
*Categories encourage &quot;Wikipediazation&quot; of Wikibooks.  There already is a strong criticism that many Wikibooks end up being merely collections of articles, or that there is a strong &quot;look and feel&quot; from Wikipedia here on Wikibooks.  While I don't have a strong objection to two different Wikibooks &quot;sharing&quot; the same chapter to be developed concurrently, it is an exceptionally rare practice.  I will repeat the often said mantra:  '''Wikibooks is not Wikipedia'''.
:*That's not a mantra, it's a truism. Wikibooks doesn't need to go out of its way differentiate itself from other wikimedia projects ('''Wikibooks is not commons, either'''). Rejecting every idea that might incorporate wikimedia technologies in a way similar to wikipedia does nothing other than give the project a hostile feel for any well-meaning wikipedian who might want to contribute (and by the way Robert: I reverted your rather nasty edits to the wikibooks-related templates on wikipedia... I would have brought you up on [[w:WP:ANI]] (for trolling and violating [[w:WP:POINT]]) but you seemed to have disappeared so I let it go). It's time to lose the attitude: the sky is not falling. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
*Category maintainence eventually fails.  Almost all classification and ontological schemes eventually break down, regardless of how you deal with them.  The category system of MediaWiki software certainly is a little more useful than some other systems, but it still has problems in trying to find content.
:*Of course :). The only way to describe a book fully is to photocopy it (or in our case print it out or mirror it). Perfection is an ideal goal to aspire towards, but not a realistic goal to set. It's a step in the right direction though. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

While I am against categorizing each and every page, I do support placing the &quot;Main Page&quot; of each Wikibook into a category so you can try to locate related Wikibooks of similar topics.  It is just that once you have already been to that main page, the navigation of content in that Wikibook should be sufficient to then get to wherever you need to go from there and further categorization is no longer necessary.

And example of how categorizations are useful ''within'' a Wikibook, the [[Cookbook]] is clearly a very good example.  But in this case it is more an execption than a classical case of a book with an orderly table of contents or index.

I am not talking about &quot;turning off&quot; categorizations of Wikibooks pages, just that it should be done judiciously and not on absolutely everything in sight.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:50, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

:The point of this proposal is to come up with a reasonable and systematic way to categorize. I'm not proposing that things that aren't categorized should be deleted (the more acclimated I've become to the delete buton, the less I like it's existence in some ways), but rather adopting a systems of standards for categorization so that it doesn't end up getting done in 20 different ways. If you don't care about categories, then they won't cause you any harm by being there. If individual users go about categorizing everything without a systematic approach, than the categories will be useless: it's a meta-language for describing books (and therefore doesn't detract from the freedom of authors to write in their chosen style), and since it's a &quot;system-wide&quot; conversation being held in this language, it seems a good idea to talk about ways to adapt it to wikibooks, rather than using it in the wikipedia way. Unless you're willing to ''ban'' categorization of every page, it's probably a good idea to come up with a good system for doing it, because sometimes [[Special:Uncategorizedpages]] comes in handy (I'm currently trying to empty it far enough so that the last remaining uncatted wikiversity pages will appear, since those that were imported already were auto-categorized through {{tl|M2wv}} and its related templates). 

:The last person to try to do this (Jguk) did not discuss it, and ended up employing some unnecessarily convoluted systems that made it very hard for me when I was trying to track down, organise, and in some cases cull the material in the how-to category. The system I came up with took some trial, some error, and a lot of thought about how the category system could be adapted to wikibooks, and how it could be structured in a sensible way that makes it easy to get around both within a particular book as well as between pages of related books... the latter use could be a good path for sweeping up the small stubs into semi-organized books or scrap collections that will be ready for the day that a knowledgeable author comes by who will be able to restructure it and make something great. If there's no way of structuring the stubs, they might as well just be deleted, because no-one will ever find them as they are now. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

====(arbitrary section break)====

I agree with both statements here, to some degree. I do agree with Rob that a haphazard, whole-sale categorization of all pages is not necessary. We do not need to apply categories to pages just so they won't be listed as &quot;uncategorized&quot;. However, I also agree with Johnny that categories are used, and when they are applied to pages, they should be applied correctly. Applying categories in a non-helpful way is actually counter-productive, and we are better off not categorizing pages then to categorize them incorrectly or sloppily. With that in mind, I would like to see this proposal become a ''guideline'', as opposed to a policy: Pages do not need to be categorized, but when they are categorized, it should be performed correctly.  --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]

:Oh definitely a guideline... I don't think people should be forced to categorize, I just want to have a good category structure defiined so that if people want to categorize, it can be done in a consistent way throughout the project. 
:I do think just adding an unobtrusive category tag is much [[Wikibooks:Be nice|nicer]] than adding the big &lt;big&gt;'''&quot;WHY DIDN'T YOU LIST THIS ON A BOOKSHELF? WHAT ARE YOU, STUPID???&quot;'''&lt;/big&gt; tag :-). Categories are a lot easier, and if there's a good systematic structure, it will provaide a way for more experienced wikibookians to help do some of the organizational work for the new authors. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:54, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
::The bookshelf system has broken down somewhat, and is not being as actively maintained in part because it isn't nearly so prominent of a feature on the main page of Wikibooks any more like it was eariler.  There was a presumption that the author of the Wikibook would be best suited to determine where the book ought to be classified with in terms of what bookshelf.
::There are merits for categories because of the self-organization aspects of them.  At the same time (and a major drawback of the category system) is if you want to &quot;push down&quot; a bunch of pages that have been categorized on one level but you want to reorganize them into subcats, it takes an edit on each and every page to make that change.  Something like the bookshelf system only takes a half-dozen edits to make the full change, even if you put the &quot;sub-cats&quot; onto completely different pages.  In extreme situations like I've seen on Commons where I've seen hundreds or even thousands of pages on an overstuffed cat, pushing content into subcats can be the equivalent of a major Wikiproject, with even whole teams of helpers working on it.  And this is something that is difficult or even nearly impossible to automate with a bot.
::One of the advantages that Wikibooks has in this regard is that the categorization heirarchy is a very late addition to Wikibooks, so there is much more content to try and assess in order to come up with the initial heirarchy.  The bookshelf system needs an overhaul, but competing proposals have all but shut down any attempts to realistically fix the situation.  I am, however, trying to point out that the bookshelf and category methods of classifying content are essentially two versions of the same basic idea:  Trying to find some content within Wikibooks that you want to locate.  This was one of the goals I had in mind when I set up [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]].  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:56, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

:::You know what? I didn't even know we had a card catalog office :). I guess that's just part of why I like the categories: they're ''familiar'', coming from a wikipedian history. I don't think the 10,000 members of a category is much of a problem for us... the only book coming anywhere near that is the cookbook, and the category system of the cookbook is doing exactly what it should, and is actually quite useful (I've used it a couple times when looking for recipes... I don't write there much, but I certainly read there!)
:::I'd really like to redo the bookshelf system too... I'm planning to do an experimental version on the how-tos category one of these days, but I seem always to be otherwise occupied (primarily with writing). I'd like to see them presented in more of a narrative, annotated structure, that asks the reader what they're interested in, and gives them a &quot;blurb&quot; about books that might fit the bill (many of our books have front covers, but when I'm in the bookstore, I look at the back cover and the inner flaps). 
:::The how-tos bookshelf is a good example of how I'd like the cats to work: use the categories to organise the materials and make an &quot;outline&quot; for the overall structure of wikibooks, and then go back to the bookshelf and create the narrative. I understand to an extent the resistance to categories: pigeon-holing in some ways seems a mean-spirited approach to such a serious endeavor as a book, and categorising here on wikibooks is not at all the same thing as categorising on wikipedia. But I think the baseline of my suggestion (having the entire book in one category, or for larger books a collection of subcategories within one large category) makes it easy to ''think'' about what the book is about, and how it relates to other books. I'm currently having a very hard time deciding how to categorise the various books and stubs related to camping, fishing, wilderness first aid, wilderness survival, etc..... but the important thing is that it's making me ''think'' about how all these things fit together, and in the end that will help me write the good narrative on the bookshelf. But the first step is to actually categorise, and I think it's important to have a &quot;baseline standard&quot; for categorising wikibooks as a whole (subcategories ''within'' a book category should be left to the authors, and it should be made clear that people who aren't contributors to a particular book shouldn't go around messing with a book's subcategories. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:28, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;Tag a Book&quot; ==

If all that is needed to categorize all pages in a book is to categorize the cover page/TOC, why are pages like [[Algorithms/Find_maximum]] considered uncategorized when [[Algorithms]] is? [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 16:32, 17 May 2008 (UTC)

: That is a bit confusing, isn't it?
: Each book has its own special, unique category -- a category that has the same name as the book.
: For example, the special category for the Algorithms book is [[:Category:Algorithms]].
: The page you pointed out is considered &quot;uncategorized&quot; because it has not yet been tagged with the category that tells us which book it is in. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:56, 12 September 2008 (UTC)
:: Fixed by adding &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Algorithms]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to [[Algorithms/Find_maximum]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:56, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

== Categorization of book categories ==

The text currently says &quot;Book categories should be categorized by subject using the same subjects categories as the book (see below).&quot; On the other hand there are also categories such as [[:Category:Languages textbook pages]], [[:Category:Computing textbook pages]], [[:Category:Engineering textbook pages]], and [[:Category:Science textbook pages]] for this purpose. Moreover, [[User:Adrignola]] suggested a classification of book categories using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:X|*{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; where X is the subject category to separate book categories from subject subcategories. Thus, there are currently three different approaches. Which of them should we use? Do we need consistency at all? Who cares? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 16:05, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:I realized that I actually don't understand the current text. Does it mean that each book category should be categorized in &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; subject categories of the corresponding book title/cover page? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 16:18, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:: Yes that is what it means. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:33, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

::: But it doesn't include organizational categories such as [[:Category:Featured book]], [[:Category:Books with print version]], etc., does it? Looking at featured books such as [[Ada Programming]], [[Arimaa]], [[Chess]], [[Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience]], [[Communication Theory]] etc. it appears to be current practice to categorize the book category only in one subject category even if the book is categorized in multiple categories. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 17:04, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:::: Those title pages are all overcategorized compared to the title categories, placed into categories that aren't part of the subject hierarchy or that might need to be added to the subject hierarchy, or filed into both a higher level and lower level category in the same branch of the tree.  That's yet another thing I was working on correcting. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:48, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:::: Featured books, Books with print version, etc. aren't subject categories though. I don't think categories were considered when deciding to make any of those books featured. How things are categorized is constantly evolving as well. If we stick with how things were rather than focusing on how things should be, the category system will be slow to improve. As things are people do end up working against each other, so writing things down and trying to be consistent can help bring some focus to what the goals are for the category system. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:03, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

::::: Talking about how things should be: I think categories of the kind &quot;X textbook pages&quot; are a good idea for book categories because they avoid that book categories &quot;pollute&quot; the hierarchy of subject categories. When browsing the category hierachy, it is difficult to distinguish between book categories and subject categories. Putting all the book categories away into a few high-level categories of the type &quot;X textbook pages&quot; would avoid this problem. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:00, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

:::::: I disagree. I think &quot;X textbook pages&quot; should continue to be eliminated. The names are grammatically incorrect and isn't what is categorized anyways, should be named &quot;X books&quot;, &quot;List of X books&quot;, or &quot;X by book categories&quot; at least, but than there are already categories like [[:Category:Library of Congress]] and [[:Category:Dewey]] that are more helpful for that purpose. If all book categories are hidden away, then people would be wasting there time searching through related categories only to find what they were looking for wasn't there or where they expected them to be. Categories like [[:Category:Languages]] would be pointless to have because they would contain a bunch of categories that lead people nowhere. I know that would annoy me and piss other people off. People would fix the situation so that the categories don't lead to dead ends and other people could find what they had difficulty locating, and that is exactly what people have done and what people continue to do. Also when browsing through categories why would anyone really care if a category is a book category, a subject category or something else? I don't think there is any difficulty in distinguish categories anyways because most book categories use title case, while most other categories use sentence case, and there is information like &quot;x cats, y pgs, z files&quot; included with each category. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:59, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

::::::: Subject categories should certainly include the corresponding books, i.e., cover pages. Thus, they are never empty. (I'm not sure I understand what you tried to say. Actually, I'm not sure whether we refer to the same thing when talking about &quot;book categories&quot;. See [[Wikibooks:Categories]] for the definition I am using.) I usually get to book categories by finding the corresponding cover page in one of the subject categories and then clicking on the book category, which should be listed on the cover page. This should always be possible. When browsing through the subject hierarchy I usually look for books and that means I'm not at all interested in clicking on a book category, which just gives me a list of pages of a specific book. Also, when I look for a book in a subject category, I'll have to look through the list of cover pages of this subject category and all its subcategories. This search is just slowed down when I have to skip all the book categories while going through the subcategories. I assume that many users have difficulties to distinguish book categories from subject categories based on their names. You cannot say whether [[:Category:English]] is the name of a book category or a subject category. The information about the number of subcategories, pages and files might give you a hint, not more since there are many books which consist of just one page and there are book categories with subcategories for templates etc. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 14:34, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

::::::: I am using the same definition for &quot;book categories&quot; as you are. If I am browsing the category system without being aware of what books exist I am more likely to see the categories before I see what else else is in the category, so I am more likely to find the book that way. If the book isn't in the category than I would have to scroll down to see what pages (book title/cover pages) are in the category, click and load a page and than click and load another page just to look at the corresponding category. Two clicks instead of one, and two pages loaded instead of one. I am not at all interested in having to browse to a book first just to find its book category and there are likely other people who feel the same as both of us. If book categories were kept in separate categories people would not only need to remember to change the categories a book and book category uses, but any book lists as well. For people who have a slow Internet connection, who use a PDA or who use a cell phone to browse Wikibooks, looking at long lists of book categories or having to load multiple pages instead of one, would be a waste of time and bandwidth. If book lists were further divided to keep categories small there would be those to maintain as well. I don't think Wikibooks has enough people willing to maintain such a system to bother with that. I think Wikibooks has enough people willing to use and maintain a simple organizational approach though. Some categories can be renamed to remove the ambiguity associated with it. Like there is [[:Category:English language]] which has more in it so Category:English can be removed to reduce confusion about which category to put books in. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:09, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

:You ask if we need consistency and if anyone cares. I've seen book/title categories filed under certain subjects and their title pages filed under other subjects. I've seen subject categories under [[:Category:Main page]] and under other top-level categories different from where their corresponding Subjects are filed. It wasn't until I pointed out the issue that all the items shown in [[Subject:Major Subjects]] were actually filed together under [[:Category:Books by subject]]. Many subject categories are still filed they way they were organized on the deprecated bookshelves rather than how they're organized in the new Subjects. It's true that a Subject can pull from any Category and the subjects can be organized completely differently than categories and most of the time title case versus sentence case is a moot issue, but I was of the mind that consistency in general is beneficial. I saw book categorization at [[Wikibooks:Maintenance_Projects]] as a sign that it was a priority, regardless of how we eventually decide to handle the issue you've brought up above. My comment on that issue is in the next paragraph.

: I was using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:X| {{PAGENAME}}]] or [[Category:X|*{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; where X is the parent subject category to separate ''subject'' subcategories from ''book/title'' categories by placing them first in the listing. Book/title categories were being tagged with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:X]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to be sorted on first letter as normal.  Thus, only subject categories need special code added upon first creation and new book creators can use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:X]] or {{Subject|X}} as usual on their title pages and book/title categories.&lt;/nowiki&gt; See [[:Category:Fine arts]] for a demonstration.  On the issue of &quot;X textbook pages&quot;, the guideline you mentioned in your follow-up would contradict the existence of &quot;X textbook pages&quot;.  Someone filing their title page in [[:Category:Languages of Africa]] would likewise file their title/book category in [[:Category:Languages of Africa]] and not [[:Category:Languages textbook pages]].  Thus, I am against &quot;X textbook pages&quot; because they cause inconsistency with the current guidelines at [[Wikibooks:Categories]] and [[Wikibooks:CCO Resources]].  It's a &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot; situation right now.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:49, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

:: Adrignola, please make yourself familiar with [[Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines]]. As far as I know, neither of the pages you cited is a guideline nor a policy. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:06, 3 May 2009 (UTC)
::: While its true there not guidelines or policies, the same is true for any argument for the &quot;X textbook pages&quot; approach. In the absence of a policy or guideline there is being bold, compromise and consensus. There are more book categorized in subject categories then there are &quot;X textbook pages&quot; type categories. Only a small percentage of book categories even use the &quot;X textbook pages&quot; approach when they do exist. Any &quot;X textbook pages&quot; categories that do exist are several years old, all created and categorized by one person from what I've seen, and no new ones have been created. I think consensus through people's actions have shown a clear demonstration that the &quot;X textbooks pages&quot; approach is ignored and therefore unwanted. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:59, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

 * InstaView - a Mediawiki to HTML converter in JavaScript
 * Version 0.6.1
 * Copyright (C) Pedro Fayolle 2005-2006
 * http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Pilaf
 * Distributed under the BSD license
 *
 * Changelog:
 *
 * 0.6.1
 * - Fixed problem caused by \r characters
 * - Improved inline formatting parser
 *
 * 0.6
 * - Changed name to InstaView
 * - Some major code reorganizations and factored out some common functions
 * - Handled conversion of relative links (i.e. [[/foo]])
 * - Fixed misrendering of adjacent definition list items
 * - Fixed bug in table headings handling
 * - Changed date format in signatures to reflect Mediawiki's
 * - Fixed handling of [[:Image:...]]
 * - Updated MD5 function (hopefully it will work with UTF-8)
 * - Fixed bug in handling of links inside images
 *
 * To do:
 * - Better support for &lt;math&gt;
 * - Full support for &lt;nowiki&gt;
 * - Parser-based (as opposed to RegExp-based) inline wikicode handling (make it one-pass and bullet-proof)
 * - Support for templates (through AJAX)
 * - Support for coloured links (AJAX)
