      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Screen printing''' is a relatively simple and inexpensive way to make detailed prints on a diverse set of substrates including cloth, paper, bumper stickers, and posters. The process involves creating a stencil on a piece of polyester material stretched over a frame, and then  transferring ink through the open mesh openings onto the substrate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Organic Chemistry/Amine]] ==

I noticed that you copied [[Wikipedia:Amine]] to [[Organic Chemistry/Amine]]. It seems that you wanted to help Wikibooks create a free [[Organic Chemistry]] textbook.

However, [[Organic Chemistry/Amine]] currently has three problems:
# It gives no credit to Wikipedia contributors for being the author. I fixed this by adding a History section, making clear that the page is based on a Wikipedia article, as the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] section 4 asks me to do.
# It has a large number of red links that do not point to any textbook. I fixed this by changing them into Wikipedia links, like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:organic compound|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for [[w:organic compound|organic compound]].
# It reads like an encyclopedia article, not a chapter of the [[Organic Chemistry]] textbook. ''This third problem continues.''

Our textbooks are not collections of encyclopedia articles; we already have Wikipedia for that! Unless you want to rewrite [[Organic Chemistry/Amine]] as a textbook chapter, it might be better to delete it and provide a link to the Wikipedia article. It is easier to have only one version of the encyclopedia article, not two. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:10, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

==Follow-up==
I noticed the notice that was placed on the page in question.  I have begun the process of turning the encyclopedia article into more of a &quot;learning style&quot; form of writing.  The encyclopedia article was a good start, and I'm going with it (mostly) but it will need to be tweaked even after I finish de-encyclopedizing it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose and mission==
This book should become the gold standard of organic chemistry texts in the areas of accuracy, usability, flexibility, and connection with its audience. As this text is developed it will always be available online, be printable, and freely distributable. This text should eliminate all or much of the cost for owning an up-to-the-minute, top-quality college-level organic chemistry text, as it and all its derivative works will remain free: free as in speech as well as free as in beer. Although you could pay for a printed version if you wanted to. 

==Content and Contributions==
This is, to the best of our knowlege, the world's first and only [[w:Open_content|open content]] '''organic chemistry textbook'''. Its users will tweak and refine this book until there is no better book. We are confident that this will happen because the process has already been seen to work many times on the [[Wikipedia]] site.

==How to study organic chemistry==

One of the main difficulties students have with organic chemistry is organizing the information in their minds. By the second semester of organic chemistry, students will learn over 100 chemical reactions. Consequently, it is vital that students take time to not only organize the information, but also to understand it. Indeed, excellent organic professors will tell you, contrary to popular belief, that you do not really need to memorize anything for organic chemistry, instead you simply need to understand it. By truly learning something, rather than memorizing it, you will be able to apply concepts beyond what you are memorizing. 

When you see something in the textbook, always ask why something is the case. Do research, try to find out the answer. By taking this approach you will enrich your learning experience, and the information will be &quot;locked&quot; in your mind. 

Each person may have a slightly different method that helps him or her learn organic chemistry the quickest and with least pain. The basic rule of thumb is to use a method that you find most helpful and stick with it. Various study methods include flash cards,  [[../Places to buy organic chemistry models|molecular model kits]], group study, writing chemical reactions on blackboards, others just take the class over and over until they &quot;get it&quot;. 

The writers would recommend to [[../Places to buy organic chemistry models|buy a molecular model kit]] so you can hold in your hand and visualize in your mind how the molecules look in three-dimensional space. If you can't get access to models or can't afford them, look online for sites that use the [http://jmol.sourceforge.net/websites/ Jmol] application or other rendering software that allow you to virtually rotate molecules.

It cannot be stressed enough that you must be able to visualize molecules in organic chemistry. The 3 dimensional structure of molecules often plays a crucial part in reactions. It can be the deciding factor in whether a reaction even happens, it can decide how fast it happens, and it can decide what the product(s) of the reaction is going to be. If you can't visualize the 3D structure, you won't be able to understand what's happening.

===Sports analogy===
You can think of the different [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Element elements] and [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group functional groups] as players in a game and the [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_reaction organic reactions] as the plays. Just as each player or team has different strengths or characteristics and uses strategies to achieve what they want, organic chemists use the properties of each chemical to play off the others in order to achieve a desired end result.

===Language analogy=== 
You can also think of organic chemistry like learning a foreign language. The atoms, for example, carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen, are the letters of the alphabet. The structural theory of organic chemistry, namely, the tetravalencey of carbon, may be considered the essential underlying grammatical rule. All organic compounds are assembled under these grammatical rules, and may be considered words. The reactions of organic compounds may be perceived as the assembly of these words into sentences. A language analogy is also useful at this point, because the grammatical rules that control the assembly of sentences (formation of the products of organic reactions!) may be found in the study of organic reaction mechanisms.


Therefore, it is not necessary to memorize individual reactions.  Overall patterns of reactivity become obvious when the mechanism of the reaction is investigated. Moreover, like any language, you have to practice it constantly. The more you &quot;read&quot; and &quot;speak&quot; chemical reactions and understand the mechanisms by which they proceed, the more fluent you will become. When you finish organic chemistry, you will literally be able to read, write, and speak in a foreign language. However, it is important to note that the language of organic chemistry is far simpler than any language people use for general communication!  The words mean exactly what they mean, and the basic rules almost never change. But organic chemistry is far from a dead science. In fact, it is one of the most active and rapidly advancing areas in modern science today.

Research produces new knowledge, and the potential to formulate new rules.  Perhaps you will make some of these discoveries, and future students will refer to your rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Screen Printing}}

The stencil, which is created on polyester mesh, defines the art to be printed. The stencil consists of a solid area that will not allow the ink to pass and an open area that will allow the ink to be deposited on the substrate.

There are a variety of ways to create stencils suitable for screenprinting. The following sections briefly summarize some of these processes, and the associated sub pages go into more elaborate detail and how-to information.

==[[Screen Printing/Making the Stencil/Photo Emulsion|Photo Emulsion]]==
The use of a photo emulsion allows the creation of a stencil with near photographic quality. It is perhaps the easiest way in which to make a stencil at a very low cost of approximately USD$0.25 per square foot of stencil area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Screen Printing}}

Printing is a pretty simple procedure though it takes some practice to really master it. With the frame turned upside down (flat side down) you add a line of your printing ink to one edge of the screen. Using a rubber squeegee, you smooth the ink over the entire stencil. This is called the flood stroke and the purpose is to fill the stencil with ink. Next you place the stencil on the item you`re printing on, still flat side down, and use the squeegee again, this time moving in the opposite direction, to spread the ink over the stencil and force it through the screen. That's all there is to it. Most ink should just wash off the screen with tap water without disturbing the stencil. Once it's dry you're ready to print again. Or if you're using the same color, you can print right away, just don't let the paint dry too much on the stencil, it could be difficult to wash out without destroying the stencil.</text>

Different inks and materials will require different treatments after printing. Most fabric ink require you to use a clothes iron on the printed fabric after the ink dries, in order to heat set the ink so it won't wash out in the washer. Read the instructions for your ink to see what is required.

==Reclaiming==

After you've printed, you can save your stencil indefinitely, but obviously you can't reuse the same screen for another stencil, without first removing the old stencil. The process of removing a stencil from the screen is called reclaiming the screen, and it's usually just a matter of applying a special chemical to remove the photo emulsion. Remember that once exposed, water alone is not enough to wash out the emulsion. Fortunately, a number of different solutions are available that will wash out exposed emulsion. Check the instructions for your emulsion to see what it recommends, but usually a low strength paint thinner will work, or you can buy a solution called Stencil Remover quite cheaply and this does the trick well. You simply pour a small amount of the solution over the stencil, rub it in, and then wash it out. The emulsion should wash out with it.

As an alternative, it is possible to remove a screen from the frame, so you can save the stencil and still have the frame available for new stencils. Stretch another screen over the frame and you're good to go. If you're careful removing the stencil, you should be able to reapply it to a frame at a later time if you decide you want to print it again. This way, you only need a few frames, but you can create a veritable library of stencils which you can reuse whenever you want.</text>

I think there is a mistake in the numbers apendix.

quote:
Numbers eighty-one to ninty-nine are configured in the form of quatre-vingts-[01-19]. For example eighty-one is quatre-vingt-un (4*20-one), ninty is quatre-vingt-dix (4*20-10), and ninty-four is quatre-vingt-quinze(4*20-14).
unquote

quinze is fiften not fourteen as stated in the last sentence

      <comment>/* Over Exposure */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Screen Printing}}

==Over-Exposure==
Over-exposure causes a loss of detail in your image area. When photo emulsion is exposed to UV light, it polymerizes or will crosslink, making it more difficult to wash out. As UV light reaches the photo emulsion it becomes crosslinked, rendering it difficult or impossible to wash out during the development stage. This over-exposure happens when [[Screen Printing/Making the Stencil/Photo Emulsion|photo emulsion stencil making]] when the exposure is longer than it should be and the UV light begins to creep around the edges of the positive areas of your art, thus decreasing fine lines or completely obliterating them. Extreme over-exposure can &quot;burn&quot; through the opaque areas of the film positive rendering the stencil a solid block of hardened emulsion. 

===Common Causes of Over-Exposure===
An excess of UV light reaching the stencil causes over-exposure. This is often caused by the use of film positives that are not made of optically clear film. The use of semi-opaque positives such as vellum materials will require a longer exposure time, and thus the UV light may penetrate the opaque areas of the film positives much quicker. One should always be more concerned with the minimum density, i.e. the clear areas, of the film positive than the maximum density or solid areas of the film positive. The contrast between the clear and opaque area of the film positive must be extreme for the film positive / UV light / photo emulsion combination to work well.

Wide spread over-exposure is likely to happen if your positive material is not transparent enough to allow the UV light to harden the photo emulsion before the UV light has penetrated the maximum density areas of the film positive. Clear film positives allow 91-percent of the UV light to reach the stencil, where vellum allows only 54.5-percent of the light to pass. This amounts to a 36.5% difference in light transmission, thus a 5 minute exposure using film would increase to 6.825 minutes using vellum positive. This two minute difference in exposure can cause the UV light to completely pass through the opaque areas of the film positive.

===Loss of Detail===
All light will bend and thus an over-exposed stencil will result in the light bending around the edges of the details in the film positive. Thin lines will be decreased or be completely obliterated. Utilizing the correct exposure time will lessen the loss. Also, assuring that details are sufficient for the mesh count used will achieve this goal. The finest detail that one should attempt to print with a specific mesh count will be equal to the width of one mesh opening and two threads. The size of mesh openings and thread width, stated in microns, is readily available from all mesh manufacturers.

If you made the film positive by hand [[Screen Printing/Making the Stencil/Photo Emulsion#Double Siding|double siding]] you should use a clear film positive with an opaque ink. If you printed or copied directly onto the transparency, try increasing the darkness of the image. It is possible to use two copies sandwiched together, as long as the clarity of the minimum density areas are not affected. Reread the [[Screen Printing/Making the Stencil/Photo Emulsion#Positives|section on making positives]] for more information.

Widespread over-exposure can also happen if you allow the photo emulsion to receive too much exposure. Light will pass through the maximum density areas of the film positive given enough time, thus exposing the emulsion. Reread the [[Screen Printing/Making the Stencil/Photo Emulsion#Exposing the Screen|section on exposing the screen]] for more information.

Similarly, UV light that reaches the photo emulsion drying or storage stage could expose the emulsion. Screens may be coated in ordinary room light, but should be stored in an area that is devoid of UV light. Ordinary room light will cause the photo emulsion to harden in a matter of minutes, thus the stencil should be stored in a light-safe environment [[Screen Printing/Making the Stencil/Photo Emulsion#Applying the Emulsion|applying the emulsion to the screen]]. Reread [[Screen Printing/Making the Stencil/Photo Emulsion#Drying the Screen|&quot;Drying the Screen&quot;]] for more information.

Local over-exposure is evident when small sections of your pattern won't wash out, but everything around it does. This probably just means that there's a flaw in your positive that let the light through in that spot, and you need to go back and touch up the positive for next time.

===Solving Over-Exposure===
Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot you can do once you've over exposed a screen except deal with the imperfection (in the case of local over-exposure) or [[Screen Printing/Finishing Up#Reclaim|reclaim]] the screen and try again with the above things in mind. Don't give up right away though, over-exposure occurs by degrees, and just because it's harder than usual to wash out your pattern doesn't mean it's hopeless. Keep scrubbing and if it doesn't seem to be changing at all after a while, then you can probably assume it's over-exposed.</text>

== Orphaned fair use ==

Hi Cacace, I noticed that you have uploaded a PDF file of a thesis, and listed it under fair use ([[:Image:EconomicExpansion-Cacace-ss1-2b.pdf]]), and that it isn't linked to from anywhere. If you are the author of this thesis, I would highly suggest that you license it under a different license (a free license, like the [[GFDL]]) and link to it from somewhere in the project. If it is not, might I ask what permissions you have to post it here? If you don't have permissions this is probably not the best place to host the work. Please let me know. Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 23:26, 24 July 2007 (UTC)
: Hi Cacace, thank you for getting back to me. The recommendation is to dual-license it under the [[GFDL]] and a CC sharealike license (that's the first option on the drop-down list if I remember correctly). Your image was deleted since we generally don't like fair use files laying around (they're a legal liability especially if they're not being used). Just make sure you understand what the terms of the GFDL/CC are (basically, people can modify them and use them however they want, including selling it, as long as they give you credit; but you could do the same with anyone else's or with your own GFDL work as well) before deciding on this. Feel free to ask me or someone on the [[wikibooks:Reading Room|reading room]] (one of the assistance pages) who likely knows more about copyright than I do if you have any questions. Regards.

::Don't worry about creating orphan pages, I deleted the old one. Just upload it just like you did with the other file, except this time choose a different license. Be warned that it might get deleted anyways if it's original research (see [[WB:WIW|the page defining this]]); if it is perhaps you would do better uploading it to [[v:main page|wikiversity]] since they tend to focus more on that sort of thing.

      <comment>Changed Kronos to Cronos</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Poseidon (In Greek: Ποσειδῶν, known as Neptune to the Romans) was considered as the god of the sea. Born of Cronos and Rhea, he had Zeus and Pluto (Hades) for brothers. Poseidon also had three sisters: Hestia, Hera, and Demeter. When Zeus overthrew their father, and the three brothers divided the earth among them, Poseidon became the god of the sea and earthquakes. 

When Poseidon desired Demeter, she asked Poseidon to create the world's most beautiful animal in an attempt to cool off his advances. As a result, Poseidon created the first horse and also became the God of horses. In some versions of this story, several other types of animals were created before the horse as a result of Poseidon's several unsuccessful attempts. By the time the horse was created, Poseidon's passion for Demeter had waned.

The symbol Poseidon is associated with is the trident, a weapon which can shake the Earth and shatter any object. Poseidon is often depicted sitting next to his wife, Amphitrite, in his sea chariot pulled by sea creatures.

      <comment>/* Applying the Emulsion */ Correcting my own typo. :0)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Screen Printing}}

==How To==

One of the often preferred methods for making silk screening stencils is the photo emulsion technique. [[wikipedia:Photo Emulsion|Photo emulsion]] is thick liquid substance which reacts to light. Essentially, photo emulsion becomes &quot;tougher&quot; when exposed to light, making it more difficult to remove from surfaces. That's perfect for creating a stencil: we'll &quot;toughen&quot; up parts of the stencil that we want to keep solid, and then wash away the rest.

===Applying the Emulsion===
The way we do this is to spread a thin layer of the emulsion over both sides of our screen.  You can do this with either a &quot;scoop coater&quot; or a standard squeegee.

To clarify in this section, the &quot;top&quot; of the screen is the side that sits embedded in the wooden frame, and is the side from which you apply screen-printing ink. The &quot;bottom&quot; is the side where the screen is flush with the wood frame, and is placed side-down when printing.

Since you'll be applying the emulsion to both sides, you will need some temporary way of supporting the frame when it is side-down. Thumb tacks stuck into the corners of your frame work well for this. You could avoid this if you did the top first, and then the bottom, since the frame itself holds the top up off the surface, but  you'll also want to dry the screen with the bottom side down, so you'll need to support it then, anyway.

Lay the screen flat, right side up, and pour a thin line of emulsion along one edge of the top side of your screen. Use smooth, even, and fairly light strokes of the squeegee to apply a smooth and even layer. Once the top side is coated, flip it over and repeat on the bottom. You'll want to make sure, therefore, that your squeegee fits inside the frame on the bottom side. It is best if it will fit going both the long way and the short way, but as long as it at least fits the long way, you should be ok. Note that after doing the top side, you'll probably have quite a bit of emulsion already pushed through the screen on the bottom side. That's fine, but you'll probably want to add more to the bottom side, still, to get a good coat. 

Make sure to cover entirely both sides of the screen, any holes you leave will allow ink to get through. The edges are particularly prone to this, and will cause stray lines of ink to show up on your print. Do the best you can, and remember that on the top of the screen (the printing side, or flat side), you can extend the emulsion over the edge of the screen onto the frame, if that helps seal those edges.

===Drying the Screen===

Make sure you dry the screen in a dark location, exposing it to light now will cause [[Screen Printing/Common Problems#Over Exposure|over exposure]] and ruin your stencil. If you have a dark closet or drawer where you can lay it flat and it won't be disturbed, that's fine. Other alternatives are to fashion an opaque box big enough to fit the frame in. If you're handy with wood, you can make one yourself, or you can just get yourself some sort of rubber storage container big enough for the frame. Most such containers are fairly transparent, however, so you can get yourself some nice thick black paint and coat the thing in a few layers of that to black out the light. Coating the inside is the cleanest, but depending on the kind of paint, it might be prone to scratching from the frame. Basically anything that will allow it to lay flat without the screen coming in contact with anything, and will prevent light from getting to it will do. You should also make sure it won't be exposed to too much dust, dirt, etc. It'll probably be in there for a day or two, so keep that in mind, especially in closets and drawers.

Your screen will take varying amounts of time to dry, depending on the emulsion, the thickness of the coat you put on, and the air conditions. In general, you're probably looking at about one or two days. I can't imagine it being more than that. A small fan blowing gently across it can help speed things up if you can arrange that.

As long as you're careful not to let too much light in, you can check on it once in a while by peeking into the closet/drawer/box. If it ''looks'' dry, you can check it by very gently touching the screen. Do this on the edge where it's less likely to cause problems if it's not dry. If it's not dry, it'll be at least a little tacky. Once it's dry, it shouldn't feel sticky at all. Also keep in mind that the top of the screen will generally dry faster than the bottom; be sure to check both sides before removing.

===Exposing the Screen===
After we allow the emulsion to dry, we apply what's called a positive to the screen. That's positive, as opposed to a negative, like a camera negative. In a negative, all the colors are inverted, white is black, and black is white. For a positive, the colors are not inverted. For our purposes, it's a positive of the design we want to create the stencil for. In other words, we're creating a stencil which we will use to transfer a design onto our fabric (or whatever you're printing), so the positive should be dark anywhere you ''want the ink to be printed''. The idea of the positive is to block light from getting to certain parts of the photo-sensitized screen. You can do this in anyway that gets the job done; if you want to print a circle, you can stick an opaque bowl upside down on the screen. More often, though, the positive is created on clear plastic, like [[Wikipedia:acetate|acetate]] or a [[Wikipedia:Transparency (projection)|transparency]], with a good opaque ink. We'll go into more details in [[#Positives|&quot;Positives&quot;]].

With the positive in place, a large piece of glass that completely covers the pattern should be placed on top, to prevent the pattern from moving. Ensure there is no dust or dirt on the glass that may show up later as specks. Underneath the screen should be a black-non reflective material, or a piece of Styrofoam that will prevent light from bouncing up onto the underside of your screen, exposing the areas you don't want exposed. 

Expose the photo-sensitized screen to light. Different photo emulsions require different exposures, but most can be done under a typical 60 watt incandescent light bulb in a few hours, with a makeshift reflector made out of a 10 or 12&quot; pie pan. Stronger lights will require less time to develop, perhaps as little as 15 minutes depending on conditions. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Using unfiltered UV black lights, it only takes 5 minutes.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is the recommended exposure chart for Speedball brand photo emulsion. 
Both of these charts apply only if you cut a hole in the center of a pie pan and place it on the socket before the recommended bulb, forming a reflector to reflect the light down on the screen.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With a 150W Bulb, Clear Incandescent:&lt;br&gt;
Screen Size-------------Bulb Height---------------Exposure Time&lt;br&gt;
8&quot;x10&quot;------------------12 inches-----------------45 minutes&lt;br&gt;
10&quot;x14&quot;-----------------12 inches-----------------45 minutes&lt;br&gt;
12&quot;x18&quot;-----------------15 inches-----------------1 hr. 14 minutes&lt;br&gt;                
16&quot;x20&quot;-----------------17 inches-----------------1 hr. 32 minutes&lt;br&gt;
18&quot;x20&quot;-----------------17 inches-----------------1 hr. 32 minutes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With a BBA No. 1 Photoflood (250 watts):&lt;br&gt;
Screen Size-------------Bulb Height---------------Exposure Time&lt;br&gt;
8&quot;x10&quot;------------------12 inches-----------------10 minutes&lt;br&gt;
10&quot;x14&quot;-----------------12 inches-----------------10 minutes&lt;br&gt;
12&quot;x18&quot;-----------------15 inches-----------------16 minutes&lt;br&gt;               
16&quot;x20&quot;-----------------17 inches-----------------20 minutes&lt;br&gt;
18&quot;x20&quot;-----------------17 inches-----------------20 minutes&lt;br&gt;

===Developing the Pattern===
Once the screen is properly exposed, you can remove it from the immediate light source and remove the positive. As soon as the positive is removed, you should start washing it out (under normal indoor lighting conditions, most emulsions won't develop in a matter of minutes while you're getting to the sink, etc., but don't dawdle too much, and certainly don't remove the positive, and plan to come back to wash out the screen at another time). This is done under regular tap water, nothing special required. If the screen was exposed properly, the unexposed portions should begin to become visible almost immediately under a strong flow of water, and a little vigorous scrubbing with your finger tips will have it fully removed in 10 to 15 minutes, or so. Once the stencil is totally washed out and allowed to dry, you've got yourself a stencil, perfect for screen printing.

==Positives==
A good positive can be made with dark ink on a sheet of transparent plastic. The two basic methods for this are by hand, and by machine.

===By Hand===
====The Ink====
Doing it by hand is probably the most accessible, but it can also be a real head ache. One of the first issues you'll face is getting a good ink. It ''is'' possible to produce a viable positive with permanent marker, but it will probably require double siding (see [[#Double Siding|below]]) and it's more difficult to work with than some other alternatives, such as India ink. India ink is a rich dark ink, and is relatively quick drying. You can get India ink pens at most art stores in a variety of sizes, for probably around a dollar or two (US$) per pen. This is my preferred method for hand producing positives, but it's still a lot of work. I recommend you get yourself a bold pen, as well as a super fine. Different brands may mark this differently, but bold is generally about as thick as a standard Sharpie marker, and super fine is a about the size of mechanical pencil lead. If you're stocking up, you'll probably want more bold and super fine; if you're doing that much detailed work that you're going to go through the super fines fast, then you might want to think about skipping down to the [[#By Machine|next section]]. If it's available in multiple colors, black should be your first choice, since it will block the most light. You might also want to get one of each size in another dark color, such as dark blue or brown. This is useful for [[#Double Siding|double siding]], as I'll explain more below.

====The Transparency====
Once you've got the ink, you need something to put it on. I recommend acetate, which you can probably buy at an art store in a little pad, like a sketch pad except with acetate instead of paper. If it's not acetate, it shouldn't matter, the only real requirement is that it be transparent, and that you can write on it with your ink. Some materials may accept the ink better than others. In my own experience, I've found that India ink on acetate never fully dries, and is therefore prone to smudging and rub offs. On the other hand, this can be a good thing as it's relatively easy to erase with a the tip of your finger, maybe slightly moistened. You'll probably run into similar problems with pretty much any combination of drawing ink and plastic, but some may be better than others, just experiment as you prefer, or ask someone more knowledgeable about plastics and inks.

====The Pattern====
Ok, ink, transparency, check. But you still need to get the ink on the transparency, preferably in the shape of your intended pattern. The artistic type might choose to draw free hand on the acetate, but more likely you'll be tracing. Even if you want to draw the image yourself, it's probably better to do it with pencil on paper, first, then trace it onto acetate. For the non-artistic type, the image can come from anywhere you can think of. A simple graphics program (or a complex graphics program, if you prefer) can be used to generate some great mono color images that you can then print onto plain paper. Just remember, however many colors you print, each stencil is monochromatic, so your prints will be too. If you want to try multi-color printing, read [[Screen Printing/Advanced Techniques#Multi Color Printing | this section]], but I'd recommend you start with simple one-color prints first.

Also remember that you're going to be able to see right through the acetate onto the original image once you're tracing. This can make it difficult to see where you have and haven't already traced, especially if your image is the same color as your tracing ink (which is common if you're using black ink and printing images from a computer). To help this, consider making your images a different, probably lighter, color than your tracing ink. This will make it easier to tell the difference between your traced image, and the original image.

The only thing I have to say about getting the image is to keep copyrights in mind. If you're going to be [[Screen Printing/Selling your Prints|selling your prints]], don't use any copyrighted or trademarked material without permission of the owner. Even if you're not selling, you may want to check local laws about copyright infringement before using any such materials.

====Tracing====
Once you've got the image, tracing is simple (in theory) since the sheet is transparent, just tape the image you want to trace to the back of the transparency, and have at it. As I said, this can be a real headache. You don't have a very precise eraser while doing this, and making precise marks with a bold tipped wet-ink pen can be a challenge. Fine tipped pens may help you be more precise, but they also tend to not apply quite as well, the tip is usually more firm than with a bolder pen, and tends to rub off ink you've already put down (which, incidentally, is the same problem you might face with a permanent marker). But a fine tip is good for doing outlines and fine details, and use the bolder pen to fill in larger areas. If you really want to go all out, get yourself some in between sizes, as well to help fill in thick lines, or thin spaces. Just remember, however quick drying the pen claims to be, it probably isn't meant for plastic, and probably won't dry all that quick, if ever, so be careful about smudging. You'll typically want to work left to right for right handers (and right to left for left handers), and then top to bottom, so you don't accidentally smudge your earlier work with your hand, wrist, arm, or what have you.

====Double Siding====
When you've finished tracing or otherwise producing your image on the transparency, remove the original image from the back and hold the transparency up to the light. You'll probably notice that quite a bit of light still comes through the ink, and you may even notice places where you didn't trace at all, or where the ink got completely rubbed off. All of these little imperfections can cause trouble when you're exposing your screen, because if too much light gets through, the emulsion will set and you won't be able to wash it off, which means your stencil will have little marks where the ink doesn't go through when it's time to print. You can fix these up when you spot them, but it can be difficult to find them all, and there's always a chance that it'll get rubbed off again before you print. I've found that the best way to deal with this is a process I call double siding, which simply means you retrace the image on the reverse side of the transparency. The idea is that if there's a small imperfection in the image on one side, there's a slim chance that there will be one in the same spot on the other side, you at least you've got a good fighting change. Furthermore, double siding basically doubles the opacity of your image, blocking out more light. This is very useful if you've found yourself prone to [[Screen Printing/Common Problems#Over Exposure|over exposure]].

Of course, double siding does produce it's own little set of hassles. For one thing, all that work you did tracing the image, you've got to do it all over again. Second, you've get ink all over what is now going to become the back side of the sheet. You've got to be very careful not to smudge it too much, or rub it clean off. Remember, though, the image is already there, you don't have to trace from the original again, so a good defense against smudging is to tape a sheet of white paper ''over'' your first trace, so that as you're tracing the back side, the wet ink will be somewhat protected. It's not perfect, though, you can still smudge even like that. Fortunately, you're double siding so smudging isn't ''as big'' of a concern. Lastly, remember how I said it can be hard to distinguish the original from your trace if the colors are too similar? The same goes for double siding. If you're using the same ink on the back as you did on the front, it can be even more difficult to tell what you've already re-traced. holding the image up to the light can be helpful for seeing this, but what a hassle. An alternative, as I mentioned briefly above, is to use two different colored inks for the front trace and the back trace, this will make it easier to tell the difference but remember, the whole point of double siding is to block out more light, so you have to make sure both inks are relatively opaque.

====Saving Positives====
You may likely want to save your positives once you're done with them. Especially if you're planning to [[Screen Printing/Cleanup and Reclaiming the Screen|reclaim the screen]], you might want to recreate the stencil later, and you certainly wouldn't want to have to go through all that again. Unfortunately, the ink on plastic problem can get in the way of this, so just be real careful about storing them, don't put them somewhere that they're likely to be shuffled around a lot, or have things set on top of them. There are probably ways of treating them to make them more permanent, or even to coat them with something. Go to your local art store or hobby store and see if they have any suggestions. Just remember: the whole point is to block light from the inked spots, and let light through the rest, so don't do anything that's going to conflict with that, for instance some kind of varnish that clouds up when it dries and blocks a lot of light from getting through.

===By Machine===
This isn't as intimidating as it may sound. Machine in this case just means a computer and printer, or a photocopier. The idea is to simply use one of these devices to print your pattern directly onto a transparency. 

Office supply stores usually sell transparencies designed to work with various printers. You want to use the correct transparencies/acetate with laser printers, if you use a regular acetate, it will melt in the printer. This is a low quality method to create film positives. 

Good quality film positives can be obtained by using ink-jet printers. If you combine a dye ink Epson printer such as the Epson Stylus 2400 with the correct films such as AccuBlack or AccuArt the results are fine for commercial screen printing. For good results you are looking for high opacity and a high contrast between the film and the ink laid down. 

Alternatively, many copy shops should be able to copy a pattern onto a transparency. This may be quick but the opacity is low. Between laser printers or paying a copy house to do it, I don't know which is more expensive in the long run. 

Which ever you choose to use, make sure the image is going to block out enough light. Typically, this kind of printing or copying is intended for over head projectors which don't actually require very opaque images. You can try printing a sample to see how opaque it is. If you've done a lot of photo emulsion stenciling, you can probably get a good idea just by looking at it against the light of whether or not it's dark enough. If you're not sure, you can experiment with it, and just be prepared to waste the stencil if it's not dark enough, or you can maybe waste a little money and play it safe. There's a few things you can do to make it more opaque. First, if you're at a copy shop, ask the clerk for suggestions, they may have special toners that are more opaque, and they can probably increase the contrast to make a darker image. If you're printing at home, you can play with your printer settings to try making the image darker. An alternative for either copier or printer is to do double copies of all your positives, and just make sure they're well lined up before using them on your screen. You can use clear acetate desk tape to fold them together since it won't block any extra light. You just have to be real sure you get them lined up right or you're image will end up kind of funny.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Haphaestus was the god of fire and smithing, forger of great weapons and devices. 
Among these, the golden dogs of Alconoo, the Aetan bulls, the golden maidens that served him, and Pandora, the first woman. 

Haphaestus was lame and considered the ugliest of the gods, but his skill and prowess at the forge was renowned. Aprhodite became his wife, but she would often be unfaithful.

Hephaestus was the son of Zeus and Hera (of Hera alone according to some versions). The Roman equivalent is '''Vulcan'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hera was the sister and wife of Zeus. She was raised by Ocean and Tethys. Considered as a guardian of women and goddess of marriage, she was stern and jealous, and often angry because of her husband's numerous affairs with other women. Most stories about Hera describe her acts of revenge for her husband's infidelities.

The deceitful way Zeus tricked Hera into marrying him was an omen of the discord that continued throughout their marriage. After courting Hera to no avail, Zeus resorted to trickery by changing into a disheveled cuckoo. Hera took pity on the bird, holding it to her breast to keep it warm. Zeus then reverted to his normal form, and took advantage of Hera's surprise by raping her. Hera then married Zeus as a way to hide her shame. 

Hera's sacred animals are the cow and the peacock. Argos is Hera's favorite city.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pegasus was the winged horse on which Bellerophon rode when slaying the [[Greek Mythology/Beasts/Chimaera|Chimaera]]. It was said he could not be ridden without a special bridle, which Bellerophon acquired with the help of Athena. Before being tamed, Pegasus lived on Mount Helicon with the Muses.

Pegasus was the son of Medusa and Poseidon, springing fully-grown from his mother's neck after she was beheaded by Perseus.  Pegasus had been conceived before Medusa was changed into a Gorgon.

When Bellerophon tried to fly to Mount Olympus, Zeus caused Pegasus to rear back, throwing off its rider back down to Earth.  Zeus then used Pegasus to carry Zeus' thunderbolts, for which Pegasus was rewarded with a constellation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The minotaur was a monster half human (from the neck down), half bull (from the neck up). The minotaur was the son of Pasifae, wife of Minos, and a sacred white bull sent by Poseidon to Crete. When king Minos refused to sacrifice the bull to Poseidon, the god cast a spell on his wife, who consequently became enamored with the bull. Pasifae then had Daedalus construct an empty brass sculpture of a cow, so that she could hide inside and mate with the bull. 

Minos' shame had the minotaur thrown into the center of the labyrinth and out of sight. Eventually, as part of a treaty with Athens, the Athenians became forced to send seven young men and seven young women to Crete to be devoured by the minotaur, who was an angry, ferocious beast. 

The minotaur was eventually slain by Theseus,with help from Ariadne.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

File formats are the language of a computer's memory. Choosing the right format for the electronic information we want to store is one important step in making good use of computers and minimising problems.

This book tries to help you choose the file format best suited to its use. It concentrates on two purposes of storing your information (data).

* Portability and interoperability
* Digital Preservation

'''Portability and Interoperability''' is the ability of your data to be read (interpreted) by different software and hardware. The most common portable format in use now is the [[w:PDF | PDF]] (Portable Document Format) for sending documents over the internet. Somewhat more troublesome is the exchanging of address information between email software.

'''Digital Preservation''' can be defined as ''long-term, error-free storage of digital information, with means for retrieval and interpretation of needed files from the long-term, error-free digital storage, for all the time span that the information is required for''.

Planning for an unpredictable future is known as '''future proofing''', although you can't really know if you are future ''proof'' you can practice risk reduction and learn from the mistakes of history. This article focuses on future proofing of [[w:computer files|computer files]].
This article gives tips for creating files in a manner which makes them easy to preserve and later access, and for avoiding pitfalls that could make your files difficult to access later.
Looking after the files you already have is known as [[w:Digital-Preservation|digital preservation]].

Where future proofing and digital preservation deal with the rather etheric matter of electronic files and their [[w:File_format|formats]], then your next concern is the media on which your information is stored. That is an area of study in itself, and is not the subject of this article.

Both future proofing of information and the media it is stored on are vital in any thorough review of your IT systems. Will you be able to read the files you're working on now in 5 years time? Do you know if all the old files you have now are still readable?

The chance of electronic files being readable in 5 or 10 years is not something to leave up to chance. Active intervention is needed in most cases. Migrating to software/hardware that supports openly published standards is the most effective single step in any plan to future-proof.

'''Chocolate Chip Rolls''' - This is a recipe grown out of an experiment on my usual biscuit recipe; they're not extremely sweet, but fall closer to dessert than just rolls or biscuits.

== Ingredients ==

I tend to cook with half whole wheat flour and half white flour; the recipe should work fine with all white flour as well (probably a little less milk).

* 2c (280g) [[cookbook:Flour|whole-wheat flour]]
* 2c (280g) [[cookbook:Flour|white unbleached flour]]
* 1t [[cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3t [[cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 1/2c (360ml) [[cookbook:Milk|milk]] ([[cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] works fine, too, with no appreciable change in taste)
* 1/2c (120ml) [[cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
* [[cookbook:Chocolate Chips|Chocolate chips]] (or small chocolate pieces)

== Procedure ==

[[Image:Chocolate-Chip-Roll-Dough-With-Chips-2006Feb24.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A roll in progress.]]

# Preheat over to 425°F (210°C)
# Mix dry ingredients
# Add liquid ingredients to dry, mix
# Turn dough out onto floured baking cloth and knead slightly
# Roll dough into log, cut into 8-12 pieces
# Press pieces flat, sprinkle with chocolate chips, and roll
# Place rolls on greased baking sheet, cook 13-15min
# Enjoy! Best fresh.

Guyana is a country located on the northern coast of South America. It borders the Atlantic Ocean, and is the only nation in South America to speak English, due to its past history as a British colony. Because of this, it is culturally associated the Caribbean island nations than to the rest of South America, and is formally recognized as a Caribbean country.

Guyanese foods have a distinct blend of influences from East Indian, African, Amerindian, Chinese, Caribbean, and European cultures. Amerindian dishes like pepperpot, a stew that is cooked in cassareep and East Indian based dishes such as roti and curries are widely prevalent along with Chinese foods. Guyana is internationally known for its Demerara Sugar and its rum. Here is a comprehensive list of over '''400''' Guyanese recipes compiled from various sources:

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Mathematical Proof/navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The contrapositive of a statement negates the conclusion as well as the hypothesis. It is logically equivalent to the original statement asserted.  Often it is easier to prove the contrapositive than the original statement.  This section will demonstrate this fact.

== The Concept ==
The idea of the contrapositive is proving the statement &quot;There is no ''x'' such that ''P(x)'' is false.&quot; as opposed to &quot;''P(x)'' is true for every ''x''.&quot;  

This is not to be confused with a [[../Proof by Contradiction/]].  If we are trying to prove the statement &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, we can do it constructively, by assuming that ''P'' is true and showing that the logical conclusion is that ''Q'' is also true.  The contrapositive of this statement is &lt;math&gt;\lnot Q \Rightarrow \lnot P&lt;/math&gt;, so we assume that ''Q'' is false and show that the logical conclusion is that ''P'' is also false.  However, in a proof by contradiction, we assume that ''P'' is true and ''Q'' is false and arrive at some sort of illogical statement such as &quot;1=2.&quot;

=== A proof revisited ===
The most basic example would be to redo a proof given in the last [[../Constructive Proof|section]].  We proved Theorem 2.1.4 to be true by the constructive method.  Now we can prove the same result using the contrapositive method.  For ease of reading, I will change the wording of the theorem.

:'''Theorem 2.2.1''' (also Theorem 2.1.4).  ''If A and B are finite sets and &lt;math&gt;|A|\ne |B|&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A\ne B&lt;/math&gt;.''
The wording is probably more natural in the 2.1.4 version, but this shows how the proof is to be done.  We assume that we have two finite sets ''A'' and ''B'' and that they do not have the same number of elements.  So let &lt;math&gt; n = |A|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m = |B|&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, number the elements in ''A'' and ''B'', so &lt;math&gt;A=\{ a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B=\{b_1, b_2,\ldots, b_m\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;n\ne m&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;n&lt;m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  Without loss of generality, we assume that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  Consider the set &lt;math&gt; B-A&lt;/math&gt;.  Since ''A'' has only ''n'' elements, we can take out at most ''n'' elements from ''B'', leaving at least ''m-n'' elements in ''B-A''.  This shows that there is at least one element in ''B'' that is not in ''A'', therefore &lt;math&gt; B\ne A&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Arithmetic ===
I'm sure we all know how to do arithmetic already, but mathematicians like to be &quot;rigorous.&quot;  That means that we like to have clear definitions of everything we use.

:'''Axiom 7.'''  The numbers 0 and 1 exist.  
:'''Definition 2.2.2.'''  The operator + is defined so that 1+0=1 and &lt;math&gt;\{1,1+1,1+1+1,1+1+1+1,\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; is an infinite set.  We write the elements of this set as &lt;math&gt; 1,2,3,4,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; and define &lt;math&gt; n+m = (1+1+\cdots (n\mbox{ times}))+(1+1+\cdots (m\mbox{ times})) = (1+1+\cdots (n+m\mbox{ times}))&lt;/math&gt;.
:'''Definition 2.2.3.'''  The operator &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is defined so that &lt;math&gt;1\cdot 0=0,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;1\cdot 1 =1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n\cdot 1 = 1+1+\cdots (n\mbox{ times}).&lt;/math&gt;  We also define &lt;math&gt;n\cdot m = m+ m+m+\cdots (n\mbox{ times}).&lt;/math&gt;
The above definitions are just formalities.  We know what numbers are and how they work.  This is just a mathematical definition.  Notice that only integer multiplication has been defined.  Now we need one more definition to prove the following theorem.

:'''Definition 2.2.4.'''  An integer is said to be ''even'' if it is a multiple of two.  That is, 'n' is even if ''n = 2k'' for some integer ''k''.  If this is not true, then it is said to be ''odd.''  The property of whether a number is even or odd is its ''parity.''
:'''Theorem 2.2.5.'''  ''If x and y are integers such that &lt;math&gt;x+y&lt;/math&gt; is odd, then &lt;math&gt; x\ne y.&lt;/math&gt;''
To prove this by contrapositive, we assume that &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; and show that &lt;math&gt; x+y&lt;/math&gt; is even.  If &lt;math&gt; x=y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; x+y=x+x&lt;/math&gt;, which by Definition 2.2.3 is &lt;math&gt; 2\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt; x+y&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of 2 and is therefore even.

== Biconditionals ==
Proofs by contrapositive are very helpful in proving biconditional statements.  Recall that a biconditional is of the form &lt;math&gt;P\Leftrightarrow Q.&lt;/math&gt;  To prove a biconditional we need to prove that &lt;math&gt; P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Q\Rightarrow P.&lt;/math&gt;  However, if we use the contrapositive we can show &lt;math&gt; P\Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot P\Rightarrow \lnot Q.&lt;/math&gt;

=== More Arithmetic ===
Prime numbers are very interesting in number theory, but also in arithmetic.  In fact, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has to do with primes.  Here we will not give a proof, just a statement of the the theorem.

:'''Definition 2.2.6.'''  A ''prime number'' is a positive integer that has no multiple other than 1 and itself.  A number that is not prime is called ''composite.''
:'''Theorem 2.2.7 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).'''  Every integer has a unique factorization of primes, excluding reorderings.
This theorem will be very useful in the proof of the next theorem.
:'''Theorem 2.2.8.'''  ''An integer n is even if and only if its square &lt;math&gt;n^2 = n\cdot n&lt;/math&gt; is even.''
:: '''Proof'''
::* First we do a constructive proof.  Suppose that ''n'' is an even integer.  Then by defintion of even, &lt;math&gt; n = 2\cdot k&lt;/math&gt; for some integer ''k''.  Then &lt;math&gt; n^2 = (2k)^2 = 2k\cdot 2k = 2(k\cdot 2\cdot k)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt; k\cdot 2\cdot k&lt;/math&gt; is an integer because it is the product of integers, we see that &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; is even.  This shows the &quot;only-if&quot; part of the theorem.  
::* To show the &quot;if&quot; part, we use a proof by contrapositive.  Assume that ''n'' is ''not'' even, or that ''n'' is odd.  Let &lt;math&gt; n = a_1^{k_1}\cdot a_2^{k_2}\cdots a_m^{k_m}&lt;/math&gt; be the prime factorization of ''n''.  Then none of the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are 2 for any ''i''.  We consider the square &lt;math&gt;n^2 = a_1^{2k_1}\cdots a_m^{2k_m}&lt;/math&gt; and notice that there are no multiples that are equal to 2, so we conclude that &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; is odd.  This proves the theorem.

== Exercises ==
#Prove the following by contrapositive:
##An integer ''n'' is even if and only if ''n+1'' is odd.
##If ''n'' and ''m'' have the same parity then ''n+m'' is even.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Mathematical Proof/navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The method of proof by contradiction is to assume that a statement is not true and then to show that that assumption leads to a contradiction.  In the case of trying to prove &lt;math&gt;P\Rightarrow Q,&lt;/math&gt; this is equivalent to assuming that &lt;math&gt;P\land \lnot Q.&lt;/math&gt;  That is, to assume that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is false.  This is known by its latin ''reductio ad absurdum'' (reduction to absurdity), since it ends with a statement that cannot be true.

== Square root of 2 ==
A good example of this is by proving that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.  Proving this directly (via constructive proof) would probably be very difficult--if not impossible.  However, by contradiction we have a fairly simple proof.

:'''Proposition 2.3.1.''' &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2\notin \mathbb Q.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:''' Assume &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is rational.  Then &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime integers&lt;ref&gt;It is a simple exercise to see that any rational number may be written in this form.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.  So

&lt;math&gt;2=\frac{a^2}{b^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2b^2=a^2.&lt;/math&gt;

But since &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; is even, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; must be even as well, since the square of an odd number is also odd.  Then we have &lt;math&gt;a=2a_1&lt;/math&gt;, or

&lt;math&gt;2b^2=4a_1^2,&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;b^2=2a_1^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The same argument can now be applied to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to find &lt;math&gt;2b_1=b&lt;/math&gt;. However, this contradicts the original assumption that a and b are relatively prime, and the above is impossible.  Therefore, we must conclude that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.

Of course, we now note that there was nothing in this proof that was special about 2, except the fact that it was prime.  That's what allowed us to say that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; was even since we knew that &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; was even.  Note that this would not work for 4 (mainly because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 4 = 2\in \mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt;) because &lt;math&gt;4|a^2&lt;/math&gt; does not imply that &lt;math&gt; 4|a.&lt;/math&gt;

==More Thoughts==

In English, the procedure is this:  Assert that a statement is false, and then prove yourself wrong. (Thereby proving the original statement was true.)
This is a form of Modus Tollens.  


For many students, the method of proof by contradiction is a tremendous gift and a trojan horse, both of which follow from how strong the method is.  In fact, the apt reader might have already noticed that both the constructive method and contrapositive method can be derived from that of contradiction.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Assume
! Prove
! Contradiction
|-
| &lt;math&gt;P\land \lnot Q\ which\ implies\ P&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;Q\ (from\ P\ only)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;Q\land \lnot Q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;P\land \lnot Q\ which\ implies\ \lnot Q&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\lnot P\ (from \lnot Q\ only)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;P\land \lnot P&lt;/math&gt;
|}

However, its reach goes farther than even that, since the contradiction can be ''anything''. Even if we ignore the criticisms from constuctivism, this broad scope hides what you lose; namely, you lose well-defined direction and conclusion, both of which have to be replaced with intuition.

Lastly, even in nonconstructive company, using the method in the first row of the table above is considered bad form (that is, proving something by pseudo-constructive proof), since the proof-by-contradiction part of it is nothing more than excess baggage.

The beauty of induction is that it allows a theorem to be proven true where an infinite number of cases exist without exploring each case individually.  Induction is analogous to an infinite row of dominoes with each domino standing on its end.  If you want to make all the dominoes fall, you can either:
# push on the first one, wait to see what happens, and then check each domino afterwards (which may take a long time if there's an infinite number of dominoes!)
# or you can ''prove'' that if any domino falls, then it will cause the domino after it to fall.  (i.e. if the first one falls then the second one will fall, and if the second one falls then the third one will fall, etc.)

Induction, essentially, is the methodology outlined in point 2.

== Parts of Induction ==

Induction is composed of three parts:
# The Base Case (in the domino analogy, this shows the first domino will fall)
# The Induction Hypothesis (in the domino analogy, we assume that a particular domino will fall)
# The Inductive Step (in the domino analogy, we prove that the domino we assume will fall will cause the next domino to fall)

== Weak Induction ==

Weak induction is used to show that a given property holds for all members of a countable [[#inductiveSet|inductive set]], this usually is used for the set of natural numbers.

Weak induction for proving a statement &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; (that depends on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) relies on two steps:

* &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is true for a certain base step.  Usually the base case is &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;P(k)\Rightarrow P(k+1)&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, given that &lt;math&gt;P(k)&lt;/math&gt; is true, &lt;math&gt;P(k+1)&lt;/math&gt; is also true.

If these two properties hold, one may induce that the property holds for all elements in the set in question.  Returning to the example, if you are sure that you called your neighbor, and you knew that everyone who was called in turn called his/her neighbor, then you would be guaranteed that everyone on the block had been called (assuming you had a linear block, or that it curved around nicely).

The first example of a proof by induction is always 'the sum of the first n terms:'

:'''Theorem 2.4.1.'''  For any fixed &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb N,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:'''

* Base step: &lt;math&gt;1=\frac{1\cdot 2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the base case holds.

* Inductive step: Assume that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{n}{i}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Consider &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}{i}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}{i}=\sum_{i=1}^n i + (n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}+n+1&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=(\frac{n}{2}+1)(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

So the inductive case holds.  Now by induction we see that the theorem is true.

== Reverse Induction ==

Reverse induction is a seldom-used method of using an inductive step that uses a negative in the inductive step.  It is a minor variant of weak induction.  The process still applies only to countable sets, generally the set of whole numbers or integers, and will frequently stop at 1 or 0, rather than working for all positive numbers.

Reverse induction works in the following case.

* The property holds for a given value, say &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

* Given that the property holds for a given case, say &lt;math&gt;n=k+1&lt;/math&gt;, Show that the property holds for &lt;math&gt;n=k&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the property holds for all values &lt;math&gt;n\le M&lt;/math&gt;.

== Strong Induction ==

In weak induction, for the inductive step, we only required that for a given &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, its ''immediate predecessor'' (&lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;) satisfies the theorem (i.e., &lt;math&gt;P(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; is true).  In strong induction, we require that not only the immediate predecessor, but all predecessors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the theorem.  The variation in the inductive step is:

*If &lt;math&gt;P(k)&lt;/math&gt; is true for all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;n,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is true.

The reason this is called strong induction is fairly obvious--the hypothesis in the inductive step is much stronger than the hypothesis is in the case of weak induction.  Of course, for finite induction it turns out to be the same hypothesis, but in the case of transfinite sets, weak induction is not even well-defined, since some sets have elements that do not have an immediate predecessor.

== Transfinite Induction ==

Used in proving theorems involving transfinite cardinals.  This technique is used in set theory to prove properties of cardinals, since there is rarely another way to go about it.

&lt;div id=&quot;inductiveSet&quot; /&gt;
== Inductive Set ==
We first define the notion of a ''well-ordered'' set.  A set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''well-ordered'' if  there is a total order &lt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and that whenever &lt;math&gt;Y\subset X&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, there is a ''least-element'' in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, &lt;math&gt;\exists p\in Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;q \ \forall q\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.  

An ''inductive set'' is a set &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt; such that the following hold:

#&lt;math&gt;\alpha\in A&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the least element of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;)
#If &lt;math&gt;\beta\in A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\forall\gamma\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; \gamma, \gamma\in A&lt;/math&gt;

Of course, you look at that and say &quot;Wait a minute.  That means that &lt;math&gt;A=X&lt;/math&gt;!&quot;  And, of course you'd be right.  That's exactly why induction works.  The principle of induction is the theorem that says:

:'''Theorem 2.4.2.''' If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty well-ordered set and &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt; is an inductive subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A=X&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof of this theorem is left as a very simple exercise.  Here we note that the set of natural numbers is clearly well-ordered with the normal order that you are familiar with, so &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is an inductive set.  If you accept the axiom of choice, then it follows that every set can be well-ordered.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Mathematical Proof/navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A proof by counterexample is not technically a proof.  It is merely a way of showing that a given statement cannot possibly be correct by showing an instance that contradicts a universal statement.  For example, if you are trying to prove the statement &quot;All cheesecakes are baked in Alaska.&quot; and you did not know whether to prove it by contrapositive or contradiction, all I would have to do is bake a cheesecake right in front of you here in Texas and then you would know that your efforts had been in vain.


Consider the following statement:
&lt;!-- Original text was: Every uncountable set has cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.
This is not the best example as it was, since it's equivalent (to anyone who knows the definition of aleph null) to saying &quot;Every uncountable set is countable&quot; --&gt;

Every set is countable.

Of course a counterexample to this would be the interval from &lt;math&gt;[0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. To show that this interval isn't countable, we assume that it is, so then there is a bijective function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt; is bijective we may write the elements of &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; in a list here we write the numbers in &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; in their decimal expansions.  

&lt;math&gt;f(1) = .b_{(1,1)} b_{(1,2)} b_{(1,3)} b_{(1,4)} \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f(2) = .b_{(2,1)} b_{(2,2)} b_{(2,3)} b_{(2,4)} \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f(3) = .b_{(3,1)} b_{(3,2)} b_{(3,3)} b_{(3,4)} \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vdots &lt;/math&gt;

For the purposes of the proof, we need each real number to be uniquely defined by a decimal.  This is of course true in ''almost'' all cases (take .01, for instance... it's equal to .00999999999...).  In fact, the cases when it's not true are exactly the cases when the decimal ends in a string of zeros, or &quot;terminates&quot; (a separate proof would be needed for this, but for now accept it as true).  Therefore, let the decimals all be in &quot;nonterminating form,&quot; so that there's another bijection between the decimal expansions and the real numbers.   

Now let &lt;math&gt; a_i = 0 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; b_{(i,i)} &lt;/math&gt; is odd and 1 if &lt;math&gt; b_{(i,i)} &lt;/math&gt; is even.
Now I claim that &lt;math&gt; x = .a_1a_2a_3a_4 \ldots &lt;/math&gt; is not listed here. To show this suppose it were then for some &lt;math&gt; n \in \mathbb{Z}, f(n)=.b_{(n,1)}b_{(b,2)} \ldots b_{(n,n)} \ldots &lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt; a_n = 0 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; b_{(n,n)} &lt;/math&gt; is odd and &lt;math&gt; a_n = 1 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; b_{(n,n)} &lt;/math&gt;, this is not possible so we conclude that &lt;math&gt; .a_1a_2a_3a_4 \ldots &lt;/math&gt; is not in the list, this shows we may not have a surjection from &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; 

Although this is a counterexample, we still had to PROVE that it was in fact a counterexample and in doing so used both a proof by contradiction (this was the overall method of the proof)  by a construction (of &lt;math&gt; x = .a_1a_2a_3a_4 &lt;/math&gt;). Although there may be more then one counterexample to any given false claim, you must always provide by a proof or argument that your counterexample works.

I am the person who proposed &quot;ThinkStarship&quot;.

I did it short, sweet, and simple, because that is
what the window size screamed at me, and, because I
assumed that the idea was sound enough to state simply
and quickly, and that you folks are busy enough that
you would appreciate that.

Let me walk through the Narrative of my experience a bit. I can't find the original proposal, but I will
do my best to create it from memory;
--------------

Think Starship will have two main and distinctly different primary functions. The first will be to generate Textbooks on almost any given topic,
And the Second will be to design and Implement A
Space Colonization program with the goal of Colonizing
most of our solar system within 50 years.
---------------

Allow me now to add a bit to that.


Think Starships First function, to generate a batch of Textbooks, may admittedly be served better in some senses in wiki Books, and overall, I'm not opposed to that, it almost makes sense. However, lets be clear about what I am saying here. This means a list of Textbooks covering at my latest list about 70 Primary
Topics, and all of them inter correlated and inter-relative and interlinking. All of those Topics would be explored from the direction and perspective of pragmatic expediency to the topic at hand; Space Colonization. This is not the same, say for instance,

as a Physics Textbook, because a standard Physics textbook does not have as its underlying Theme Space Colonization. Were I to start contributing to a Physics Textbook Effort already in progress, I would bet some people would rightly point out that I was putting in strange and obtuse digressions that seemed
Extravagant and only vaguely relative. The Same thing applies for say, Sociology. This isn't a Textbook on the topic of Sociology, it’s a Textbook on the sociology of 4000 persons isolated from the rest of humanity- Permanently.
All of that may be somewhat moot, I am willing to admit that wikibooks may still be the place for those Textbooks, and I am comfortable with that as a final judgment, although I assume that Wiki Books would then have to make some effort to reasonably differentiate ThinkStarships' Texts from the Standard.


The second Function of ThinkStarship, (namely designing and implementing a 50 year colonization plan
for most of our solar system) Does not even slightly or sort of fit into a futurists WikiCity for a variety
of reasons.


The first is that ThinkStarship isn't Speculative,
and its only real concern with &quot;The Future&quot; as such
is the creation and management and implementation of its own plans. 



The second is that ThinkStarship is a very large umbrella, an umbrella so large that it might eventually open up to contain within it Futurist
Speculation, although at first for relevancies sake,
Futurism is well outside of the purview of think Starship.

Futurist explorations and Think Starships Explorations
are two completely different types of interests. One
has one foot firmly in the realm of science fiction,
speculation, and the realm of the hobbyist. The other
is a much more serious, much more pragmatic, much more
down to earth type of information, which will have to
have very high standards of reality check operating
inside of it. Both feet of ThinkStarship must be rooted in Science Fact, or at least, what we can reasonably assume will be Science fact in the very immediate Future. (There are some problems with Space Colonization which are yet to be resolved, the highest order of which are ecological. Given efforts like Wikis' own assorted other efforts, which I have taken a few days now to go look at, most of those problems are already well on their way to being solved if current Wiki trends continue. For instance, a very
large database will need to be created, listing all of the organisms that will need to be included in order to have a stable and self sustaining ecosystem, and then all of the chemical inputs and outputs of all of those organisms will have to be charted and mapped. It’s a very simple problem solving process, its just that the database is so huge it hasn't been resolved yet.)

I'd like to list the Topics that do fall under the umbrella of ThinkStarship.

Since this is my &quot;Write a detailed proposal&quot; prequel,
let me finish with selling the project.
What I am offering &quot;Wiki&quot; is essentially a public
NASA. The problems of Space colonization are sure
to generate remarkable solutions for other problems...This is already the case for the current
Space program

Think Starship will have to undergo several dynamicgrowth stages, including a lot of financial evolution and I do have several business plans cooked up to raise funds at that stage of the overall plan.

Obviously, in order to implement what is designed, mostly here on the Wiki, many other computer and software resources will need to be employed, and the Wiki adventure is a sort of infancy for the Think Starship Endeavor.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== History of Christianity ==

'''Christianity''' is the religion instituted by Jesus Christ that has defined an era in history continuously for the last 2000 years plus. It teaches that there is no salvation without Christ's atonement, without faith in God and a belief in the gospels. Though the great moral principles which it reveals and teaches and the main doctrines of the gospel have been preserved without interruption, the genius of the different nations and ages has materially colored its character. The first community of the followers of Jesus was formed at Jerusalem soon after the death of their Master in 30/33 AD. Another was formed at Antioch in Syria about 59/65 AD, where the followers of Jesus were first called Christians. The travels of the apostles spread Christianity through the provinces of the Roman Empire, Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, Greece, the islands of the Mediterranean, Italy and the northern coast of Africa, as early as the first century. At the end of the third century almost one-half of the inhabitants of the Roman Empire, and of several neighboring countries, professed this belief, and in the twenty-first century it is still spreading through missionary work. As a result of this missionary zeal, Christians have suffered persecution down through history, on the other hand, holy wars have been fought in the name of Jesus and free-thinkers have been subject to various inquisitions in the name of love, but the successes outweigh the setbacks and in the Christian viewpoint the world is a better place for the gospel outreach. Many offshoots sprang from the main trunk. The Gnostics who date from the days of the apostles professed a deeper knowledge of God’s hidden spiritual realities with a degree of asceticism, while incorporating Jesus in the system, but often combined this with a desire for moral freedom. The Arians of the fourth century believed the Son was created inferior to the Father. The Nestorians of the fifth century believed in two separate persons of Jesus, divine and human, in one personality. These early questions were representative of the dissonant voices which detracted from the message. The most important events in the subsequent history of Christianity were the division of the Roman Church in 1054 and the Western [[../Protestant churches/The Reformation|Reformation]] beginning in 1517. The number of Christians in the world in 1900 was computed at 477,000,000. Of these about 230,000,000 were [[../Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], 98,000,000 belonged to the [[../Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Church]] and 149,000,000 were [[../Protestant churches|Protestants]]. The figures for the year 2000 approximate 1,000,000,000 plus for Catholics, 240,000,000 for Orthodox, 590,000,000 for Protestants, and 275,000,000 for other Christian identity groups. Of the various churches of Protestants the most numerous are the [[../Protestant churches/Lutheran|Lutheran]] and the [[../Protestant churches/Calvinist|Calvinistic]] churches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Renaming Pages on Wikibooks ==

This is just a gentile reminder to not rename pages for a Wikibook that are just a simple name like [[Combat]].  There are some important differences between Wikibooks and Wikipedia, and we try to keep all of the content to a single &quot;book&quot; together under a single namespace, using some sort of standard naming convention.  The main reason for this is that it is easier for us (administrators and other people helping in general with Wikibooks) to find content, as well as spot vandalism and other nonsense that doesn't belong on Wikibooks.

I'm merging in some of the content you had put in earlier for the [[RuneScape]] wikibook, and I hope that you do come back and contribute some more to this content.  For some further details about this, see [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:29, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

== Thanks for RuneScape Price Guide work! ==

===Thanks!===
Thanks for working so much on RuneScape PRice Guide... A lot of valuable work has been done, it will help a lot! [[User:Geekygator|Geeky]] 15:59, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

== Vandal attack ==

I have no idea why you were the target of an attack here by a vandal, but apparently you were.  I'm sorry if you appeared to be the target of administrative actions, of which you weren't.  I also apoligize on behalf of the whole project and want to encourage your continued participation.  Consider this idiot like countless others who feel it is better to destroy than build.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:12, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Latvian is an Indo-European language, which belongs to the Baltic language family, the language itself emerged in the 16th century. It has many archaic features. It also has some striking similarities with Russian and Polish, with Germanic and Finnic-like pronounciation of words as well as loanwords from these language families.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ProEngineer Wildfire2 is a computer aided design (CAD) program that is
used to create models on a computer in three-dimensions. Since three
dimensions are used the models mimic real parts in the way that they are
constructed. The models are sometimes referred to as virtual parts since
at the design stage they only exist within the computer. Most of the models
made in ProEngineer Wildfire2 are termed solid models which implies that
the computer has a full understanding of the solidity of the part i.e. the
computer ‘knows’ where there is material and where there is empty space.
Solid modelers use commands to construct models that reflect
manufacturing techniques, such as extrude and cut, combining these to
make complex shapes.

ProEngineer Wildfire2 is a fully parametric CAD program. This means that
when a part is designed and modeled dimensions are assigned which
define the part. If, at a later time, these dimensions are found to be
unsuitable they can be easily changed and the modification will filter
through the system wherever the part appears. This is particularly helpful
when dealing with collection of parts (known as an assembly) since if a
modification is made to a single part, the modification is carried throughout
the assembly. A designer can also define relationships between parts. For
example, in an engine, if the diameter of the piston is increased or
decreased, the corresponding engine block can be defined such that it is
automatically modified to match the specifications of the modified piston.
Using any CAD system complex models need to be built by combining
simpler shapes. In ProEngineer Wildfire2 these simpler shapes are called
features. Several features are combined to form a part. Using Figure 1 as
an example the part shown diagrammatically is made up of four features
as follows:
# A rectangular block of material is created.
# Removing material from the block creates a slot.
# Finally material is removed to form a large hole.
# Material is again removed to make four small holes.

Later tutorials will explain how several parts can be combined to form
assemblies as shown in Figure 1.

==Creating a Part==
In this tutorial we will introduce you to some basic modeling concepts
including creating parts, creating basic features, sketching and saving
information. Before starting to work through this tutorial you need to be
sitting in front of a computer which has access to ProEngineer Wildfire2
and be logged on. You tutor should have advised you of how to log in
already.

Start ProEngineer Wildfire2 by double clicking on the icon on your
desktop or from the START menu. The main application window should
appear shortly.

You will see the normal Windows features – menus, toolbars, a main
graphics area and on the left side a browser window.
The next step is to create your first part. To do this use the menu FILE &gt;
NEW. As you click on this menu notice the small picture to the left of the
word New… This is the icon for the NEW command. You could choose
this icon from the toolbar below the menu if you prefer. Generally in this
tutorial the menu command is given but you will often find the icon more
convenient so look out for them.

After choosing the new command a dialog box will appear as shown in
Figure 3. Notice that the Part option is already checked and type in
calculator as the name of this part (Note : ProEngineer does not allow
spaces and other special characters in names).
A second dialog will appear offering different options for parts – in
particular different units of measurement. Choose mmns_part_solid which
means the units of length will be millimetres and units of mass will be
Newtons and click on the OK button.

Well done – you have made your first part! The part contains some
features already. The browser on the left of Figure 5 shows 3 datum
planes and a coordinate system. So what are datum planes? As the word
plane implies these are flat areas that can be used as references for
defining parts of your model. In some case you can define models without
any datum planes, in other cases they are essential. Many people choose
to always have a basic set of default datum planes (like the ones in your
model) defined as a starting point for their model. Datum planes are
displayed as rectangles that are just big enough to enclose the model.
They are given names by the system such as RIGHT, TOP and FRONT.
You will see datum planes drawn in either brown or black. This is to
distinguish between the two sides of the datum. If you looking exactly onto
the edge of a datum plane you will see two parallel lines drawn
representing the two sides of the plane

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to do good Improv, the first thing that you need to learn is the rules of Improv

= The Main Rules =
If you're just learning Improv, here are the main rules that you should be concerned about.

== Yes, and... ==
Often considered the main rule of Improv, all it says is that '''you are not allowed to negate other people's statements. Instead, add on to them.'''. For example, here is an example of a scene where &quot;Yes, and...&quot; is not used:

'''SUGGESTION:''' tournament

* '''1:''' Alright, are you ready to tee off?
* '''2:''' What are you talking about? We're not on a golf course, we're at a basketball court!

The scene is instantly killed by negating what player 1 said.  Here's an example of &quot;Yes, and...&quot; used correctly:

* '''1:''' Alright, are you ready to tee off?
* '''2:''' Yeah, but I'm pretty nervous. It's the last hole, and I'm ahead by 2 strokes.

Player 2 has now added on to the scene, and developed a problem and a place for the scene to go.

== Don't Try To Be Funny ==
Very important, especially for beginning improvisers. '''Don't try to be funny. Humor will come naturally out of the scene without any effort.''' Just try to act out the scene, and the game or elements will add humor. For example, which of these is funnier:

'''SUGGESTION:''' cheerleader and car

* '''1:''' Aw man, my car ran out of gas, and I'm all out of money.
* '''2:''' I'll give you a dollar if you make me laugh.
* '''1:''' Poop.

Both players 1 and 2 tried to be &quot;funny&quot;, and ended up making a stupid scene. Instead, look at the following scene, where people just act the scene out naturally.

* '''1:''' Aw man, my car ran out of gas, and I'm all out of money. I guess I'll have to dance for money at this bar.
* '''2:''' What are you doing?
* '''1:''' Alright? Ready? Okay! ''{does cheerleading routine}'' 
* '''2:''' What is going on?
* '''1:''' Alright! Anybody? Tips? Anybody?

The scene is funny because it's a situation that we don't normally see, and not because everybody was trying to be funny.

=='''Have Energy!'''==
Always put as much energy into a character as possible, even if it's a character which superficially lacks energy. Otherwise, the audience gets bored.

'''SUGGESTION:''' Boring Man
* '''1:''' ''(''Throws down arms'')'' I'm so boooooooored! I'm so boooooooored I could just die right now. You know, I haven't been this boooooooored since I looked for a needle in a haystack! ''(''mimes searching for needle'')''

Although boredom is characterized by a lack of energy in reality, by throwing his or her arms around and giving his or her sentences dynamic variety and accenting key words like &quot;bored,&quot; the audience is entertained by an engaging character. Note that having energy rarely equal yelling at the top of one's voice. 

== Playing Off Lines ==
'''Don't go into a scene with a set agenda. Instead, listen to what other people say, and base your next line off of that.''' Here's an example where people have gone into the scene with set agendas:

'''SUGGESTION:''' spies

* '''1:''' Alright, the Queen's given us her directions. Let's go.
* '''2:''' Let's go get the diamond!
* '''1:''' Uh oh, we need to go through a pit of snakes!
* '''2:''' I think I've got the diamond now.
* '''1:''' Ow, a snake just bit me!

It is almost like two scenes are going on at the same time, with neither person listening to each other. Here's an example of &quot;Playing Off Lines&quot; used correctly:

* '''1:''' Alright, the Queen's given us her directions. Let's go.
* '''2:''' I just need to know why the Queen needs this diamond.
* '''1:''' I don't think that it's important, it's just that she wants to mount it on her ring.

Now that the two actors are listening to each other, the scene takes shape, and humor.

== Make the Active Choice ==

Improv acting, like scripted acting, is about the doing. Audiences are drawn to action. When there is the opportunity to do something (show rather than tell) always go for the active choice.

Rather than talking about climbing a mountain...
* '''1:''' We should climb the mountain!
* '''2:''' Yes, we should climb the mountain so we can get the treasure.&quot;

Climb the Mountain....and see what happens next...
* '''1:''' (while climbing) Here we go...I love the fresh snow crunch (while climbing)
* '''2:''' (a minute later) We can see the entire town from here and...THERE the king's! ( while running to chest) just like in the legend (while opening chest)!&quot;

The action that goes on while climbing- the anchoring, tossing of the rope, trumping up, slipping and other actions are the scene...more so than the talk.

==Move Forward==

Always work to make a scene go forward; at the very least, one must always add information to the scene.
Never initiate argument with another improver, for argument immediately stops a scene from moving forward. Instead, strive to let the conflict manifest itself out of making active choices and saying &quot;yes&quot; to your fellow improviser, after first having listened. This conflict should unite the improvers. Thus, it is almost almost an external force.

Rather than argue...
* '''1:''' Oof, I fell on a crack!
* '''2:''' Ha ha!
* '''1:''' Hey, that's not funny.
* '''2:''' Yes it is!

Take advantage of an action to identify a common enemy of the improvisers...

* '''1:''' Oof, I fell on a crack!
* '''2:''' You fell?! We need to call a doctor!
* '''1:''' You're a doctor!
* '''2:''' Yes, of course! In my panic I forgot all about that.

By present account 1,407 pathogens can infect humans; pathogens defined here include viruses, bacteria, parasites protazoa and fungi. Infection results in contact between human cells and a pathogen.  Chemical interactiion occurs between the two and from the standpoint of the human cell can be categorized as non-self recognition, and defense.  This local encounter then gives rise to a systemic response to the infection which attempts to favor containment, eradication and elimination of the invader, or it may reflect the toxic effect of the pathogen on the organism as a whole. In some cases the immune response to infection results in late sequelae leading it seems to the development of auto-immune based diseases.

Here in the first decade of the 21st century we are 6.5 billion humans. Every second we add another 4.4, every minute 261,and if I keep ahead of the readers capacity to calculate that is 15,679 persons born each hour, and 137,350,692 born every year. 

Meanwhile 56,556,474 persons die each year world wide, so indeed we are growing our gene pool, and today our numbers amount to 6% of the persons who have ever lived that number being 106.5 billion.

Evolving in East Africa early protohumans migrated from east africa first  to south asia and australia. Secondary migrations occurred to central asia, dispersing then to europe and the americas.  We owe our knowledge of these events to the tracing of gene mutations in the y chromosome and the mitochondrial DNA of females.  There is some controversy  as would be expected and climatic events have played a role in the genesis of these migrations,with intervening calamity leading to periodic destruction of most of our numbers in the early millenia of our existence as a species we were left in scattered pockets numbering perhaps no more than 50,000 individuals world wide. Subsequently we have evolved from these pockets and as a result there is heterogeneity in our genetic makeup.
 
Orthopedic manifestations of our genetic heritage include risk factors for a number of disease processes which are genetically based. A list of hundreds of orthopedic conditions due to single gene mutations (mendelian diseases) is available from the NLM website.  These are mutations of genes coding for transcription factors, growth factor receptors and matrix macromolecules, to name a few examples.  Beyond this we are not genetically identical as the human genome contains an estimated 10 million cases of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP's).  

Variable patterns of gene expression rather than variation in the genetic composition itself has the greater impact on the phenotypic heterogeneity. The pattern of gene expression is to some degree programmed as in growth and development, however it is also readily influenced by exogenous factors, thus the distinction between a condition which is genetically based and one that is not may be more a matter of degree than of absolute category. Increasingly we recognize the influence of our environment on genetic expression on a day to day basis such that each day we are subtly changed by our experience of the world. In the brain a short term memory, based on the strength of a synaptic connection, may be fleeting but with reinforcement a transition occurs into long term memory by means of a change in gene expression within a particular set of cells in the brain likewise our musculoskeletal systems retain memories of our experiences, and these memories ar embodied in an altered pattern of genetic expression within the cells of our musculoskeletal aparatus.

Our economic and environmental circumstance is perhaps a better target for our efforts to improve our orthopedic well being than is our immutable genetic inheritance.  We can't choose our parents after all, and for the time being can do little to manipulate our gene expression at will. With the advent of erythropoietin, and BMP 2 and 7 we find the addition of genetically engineered products with which we can augment our native biological responses.  It has taken 30 years to reach the point where the first clinical applications of genetic engineering have been brought to bear and the growth of these applications is liable to follow an exponential curve in parallel with the growth in computing capability. Increasingly the analysis of the human genome, transciptome and proteome will converge with the science of informatics;  the science of analysing large volumes of data to identify meaningful patterns (Kurzweil, R 2005).

For the present it makes sense then to focus the majority of our efforts on improving our well being by impoving our diet, managing our exercise habits, coordinating our health care delivery, keeping environmental toxins in check, and avoiding killing each other all in the process of enhancing the economic potential for all in a stress free way that does not undermine our right to the pursuit of happiness. For that lucky minority who have all of these factors going for them, we can consider genes and gene expression with the goal of directly influencing the process to meet our goals.  While this may seem to hold the promise of highly personalized care for the most economically advantaged, the broader potential is for revolutionary advances which hold limitless possibilities for freeing our species from any of our major afflictions including many which affect our musculo-skeletal well being.

With the completion of the human genome project comes the recognition that humans have far fewer genes than once thought. With this realization comes the understanding that the genome is more flexible and more complicated than once imagined.  Instead of having 100,000 genes it turns out we have 25,000 genes.  The actual number of our genes puts us on par with some simple plants and worms so if the number of genes was the measure of sophistication of an organism then we should feel none too proud.  It seems however that our genome has evolved to make more efficient use of our genes and to employ variation in the spicing to enable more than one protein type to be produced by any given gene.  Knowing the code it seems leaves us with the more difficult process of understanding how gene expression is regulated, in development and in our adaptations to lifes vicissitudes.

It is estimated that it takes up to 50,000 years for a given adapation to become widely prevalent in the population. So we can consider that we are walking around in bodies that are well adapted to the life of a hunter gather living 50,000 years ago.  Of course some lucky members of the population will be quite well adapted to a relatively sedentary and longer life whereas most will find many aspects of modern existence as odds with their aparent constitutions.  While inactive physically we are subjected to quite a barrage of stimulation, and stress in the form of information and time management and automated forms of travel.  Emotional connection to the community and to the rest of nature is diminished as we become more surrounded by technologies of convenience the workings of which we dimly understand.   

When considering genetic disease it is important to begin with the distinction between genetic alteration in a somatic cell, which then results in a disease process, and our genetic make-up acquired from our parents which may encode a susceptibility or even be the direct cause of a disease as a result of an abnormal type or quantity of the particular gene product of function.  

The first case is best exemplified by the problem of cancer.  Cancer is already recognized of course as not one but many diseases, but this insight is now being carried to the molecular level whereby it is recognized that there are perhaps a dozen or so kinds of lung cancer, and not simply the three or four categories we thought of a generation ago.  It will soon be possible to specify the particular set of genetic anomalies that have produced the cancer in a given individual and by so doing know which particular kinds of therapy are best used.  

The knowledge of a genetic predisposition to a familial disease can include cancer whereby genetic testing may reveal a calculatable lifetime risk of acquiring ovarian of breast cancer of perhaps 85%.  This knowledge in the face of the notoriously difficult task of early detection may currently lead to a decision to consider prophylactic removal of the ovaries or breasts.  

As such information comes online we must anticipate an impact on our health care system.  Fortunately the costs gaining genetic information are coming down, and certainly the efficiencies gained by early recognition and preventative treatment will pay for themselves.  As individuals we will have to come to terms with this new form of self knowledge and its impications, and as a society consider the greater implication this may have in areas such as privacy and health insurance availability and cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Coding divert sockets take a lot of patience. If you have worked with kernels in the past, this is going to be a cakewalk for you. If not, well, you'll get a lot from the experience. But, we aren't working ''in'' the kernel, we're working ''next'' to it. Don't let yourself get fooled. Don't let yourself get confident, either. The slightest mistake in your code can set off a completely different, undesired function.

Now that you're scared, let's dig down into the meat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">First, there are a couple (hopefully nothing new) include files you will need to know about.

===sys/types.h and sys/socket.h===
This pair of header files is probably the most important one out of all the header files when coding any type socket. sys/socket.h contains several important constants (AF_INET? It's in here, as are all the other address families) and several less important constants, famous and infamous socket functions (socket() anyone?). The main structure worthy of note here is sockaddr.

===netinet/in_systm.h and netinet/in.h===
netinet/in_systm.h defines network times (which has nothing to do with divert sockets, but it is required by netinet/in.h to compile properly.) netinet/in.h is the more important header here. It defines all transport-level protocol numbers (as found in RFC 1700), sockaddr_in, fun IPFW defines, and more stuff you probably have dealt with in normal sockets.

===netinet/ip_fw.h===
This header defines some structures we will send to instruct the IPFW program, later on in the book.

===netinet/ip.h, netinet/tcp.h, and netinet/udp.h===
These files define protocol structures (as if you didn't know.)

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Introduction ==

Cocoon is a product of the Apache Software Foundation. It is a powerful server heavily based on Java and XML technology. While it does have a command line interface, most users will be able to do everything they need to with it simply through careful editing of a few configuration files, formatted as XML documents. If you want to see some examples of what Cocoon can do, go to http://MIST5730.terry.uga.edu:8080/cocoon/.

== Assumptions ==

This tutorial is set up based on the user having access to an installation of Cocoon on Terry’s Blaze server. If you do not have this access, simply replace file locations and access methods with those provided by your server administrator. Some programs described may be Windows-only; you will need to find out a suitable replacement if you are a Macintosh or Linux user, although these utilities are often included with the operating system. JEdit is a free text editor that can read and save files on an FTP or SFTP server as easily as on a hard disk, and properly manipulate many different types of files, with the proper plugins. It is available for Windows, Macintosh, some Linux distributions and as a platform-independent Java application at http://www.jedit.org/.

== The Sitemap ==

The primary Cocoon file to be concerned with is sitemap.xmap, located in the root Cocoon directory. It uses XML tags to define things such as different ways to present data, the location of important files, identification of browsers, and the most important aspect, pipelines. The default xmap will be fine for our purposes, and we will only need to look at the last few lines of it, where pipeline matches are defined. This section begins at the tag &lt;code&gt;&lt;map:pipeline&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. A pipeline match looks like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;map:match pattern=”test”&gt;
	&lt;map:generate type=”file” src=”content/test.xml”/&gt;
	&lt;map:transform type=”xslt” src=”stylesheets/test.xslt”/&gt;
	&lt;map:serialize type=”html”/&gt;
&lt;/map:match&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Let’s look at what each line does. The first line tells Cocoon to watch for someone browsing to http://blaze.terry.uga.edu:8080/cocoon/otc/test. When this happens, the actions on the next three lines take place. Cocoon will take the information from the file test.xml within the content directory, and apply the stylesheet test.xslt from the stylesheets directory. It formats this result as an html page, as specified on the fourth line. Cocoon can use different serializers to format data as an html or xhtml page, flash object, pdf, or even OpenOffice document. Unlike when working with XML for other purposes, no XSD schema is needed – simply create and populate fields in the XML file as necessary.

== Cocoon Forms ==

Cocoon forms, or CForms, are a way to use XML structure to create validating form field objects and then arrange them in a template for use. The primary advantage of CForms over using HTML forms is that fields can be validated either with built-in functionality or simple XML attributes. There are several elements required for this. A definition XML file, which holds the fields, called &quot;widgets&quot;: 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;fd:field id=&quot;email&quot; required=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;fd:label&gt;Email address:&lt;/fd:label&gt;
&lt;fd:datatype base=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
&lt;fd:validation&gt;
&lt;fd:email/&gt;
&lt;/fd:validation&gt;
&lt;/fd:field&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A template XML file calls on these widgets, adding HTML code to help with look and feel:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ft:widget-label id=&quot;email&quot;/&gt;
&lt;ft:widget id=&quot;email&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A Javascript file that controls the flow of data from one file to the next:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function registration() {
var form = new Form(&quot;registration_definition.xml&quot;);
form.showForm(&quot;registration-display-pipeline&quot;);
var viewData = { &quot;username&quot; : form.getChild(&quot;name&quot;).getValue() }
cocoon.sendPage(&quot;registration-success-pipeline&quot;, viewData);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Pipelines in the sitemap that also control flow:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;map:match pattern=&quot;registration&quot;&gt;
&lt;map:call function=&quot;registration&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/map:match&gt;
...
&lt;map:match pattern=&quot;registration-display-pipeline&quot;&gt;
&lt;map:generate type=&quot;jx&quot; src=&quot;registration_template.xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;map:transform type=&quot;i18n&quot;&gt;
&lt;map:parameter name=&quot;locale&quot; value=&quot;en-US&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/map:transform&gt;
&lt;map:transform src=&quot;forms-samples-styling.xsl&quot;/&gt;
&lt;map:serialize/&gt;
&lt;/map:match&gt;
...
&lt;map:match pattern=&quot;registration-success-pipeline&quot;&gt;
&lt;map:generate type=&quot;jx&quot; src=&quot;registration_success.jx&quot;/&gt;
&lt;map:serialize/&gt;
&lt;/map:match&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

An XSP can be used in this flow in order to pass submissions to a database.

== XSPs ==
XSPs function similarly to JSPs and servlets - they are server-side applications that can support many users at once. Unlike JSPs and servlets, XSPs can use XML tags to accomplish much of their functionality, although they can also use Java code between &lt;xsp:logic&gt;&lt;/xsp:logic&gt; tags. One good use for XSPs is passing information to a database or recalling and displaying stored data. While JSPs and servlets have to either call a specific database connector or contain all of the code for connecting within them, Cocoon has a configuration file which holds this information, and XSPs just call the name of the database as specified in WEB-INF/cocoon.xconf:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;esql:pool&gt;dbname&lt;/esql:pool&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

XSP code to enter data from a form might look like this:

   &lt;code&gt;&lt;esql:execute-query&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;code&gt;&lt;esql:query&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;code&gt;INSERT into otc_users (name,email,password,age,spam) values  ('&lt;xsp:expr&gt;esc_name&lt;/xsp:expr&gt;','&lt;xsp-request:get-parameter name=&quot;email&quot;/&gt;','&lt;xsp-request:get-parameter name=&quot;password&quot;/&gt;','&lt;xsp-request:get-parameter name=&quot;age&quot;/&gt;','&lt;xsp-request:get-parameter name=&quot;spam&quot;/&gt;')&lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;code&gt;&lt;/esql:query&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
   &lt;code&gt;&lt;/esql:execute-query&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

== Exercises ==

# Create a basic XML file and accompanying html stylesheet. Upload them into the proper folders (content and stylesheets respectively) on the Blaze server, and write a pipeline match that would enable you to view the XML content with your stylesheet applied in a browser. Files and match pattern should be named after your own name, for example Bob Jones would use “bjones.” It is not necessary to upload the pipeline code - simply browse to http://blaze.terry.uga.edu:8080/cocoon/otc/yourname and it should be visible.
# Follow along with the CForms example located at http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/basics/sample.html. Create and implement at least one widget of your own making. You can view this at work by browsing to http://blaze.terry.uga.edu:8080/cocoon/cforms/registration.
# Browse to opt/tomcat5/webapps/cocoon/cforms on Blaze. Examine sitemap-modified.xmap to see how the pipelines could be modified to pass CForm data to an XSP. Test.xsp shows how that data could be inserted into or called from a database.

== Appendix - Accessing the Blaze server ==

When you have an account set up on the Blaze server, there are several steps you will need to take in order to be able to work with files in the Cocoon directory. Generally, new user accounts are set up with the user’s UGA MyId as the username, and social security number as the password. This password must be changed at the user’s first login, which requires using an SSH client to accomplish. UGA students can download Secure Shell Utilities 3.1 at http://sitesoft.uga.edu/. Two programs are installed by this download, Secure Shell Client and Secure File Transfer Client.

Open the Secure Shell client and click the “Quick Connect” button located near the top of the window. In the resulting window, enter “blaze.terry.uga.edu” as the Host Name, and your specified username as User Name. Port Number should be set to “22”, and Authentication Method should be “Passworded”. Click “Connect”. In the resulting window, enter your given password and click “Ok”. You may see a window asking to save the new host key, click “Yes”. You will now be presented with a text box. It will notify you that your password has expired and must be changed. You will need to enter your given password once, hit enter, enter your desired new password, hit enter, and again enter your desired new password and hit enter. Be aware that nothing you type will show up for security purposes, and you will not be able to delete any typos - you'll have to log in and start over if you mess up. This is all we will be using the Secure Shell Client application for; you can click the “Disconnect” button in the row of small buttons at the top of the screen, and then exit the program.

In order to actually access files on the Blaze server, the Secure File Transfer Client is used. Open it and click the “Quick Connect” button located near the top of the window, entering the same Host Name as with the Secure Shell Client, your new password, and make sure the other settings are the same. Click “Connect.” You will be presented with a Windows Explorer-type screen where you can browse through the files on the Blaze server. To access our Cocoon installation go to the “opt” folder, then the “tomcat5” folder, then the “webapps” folder, then the cocoon folder. Most of our work will be done in the “otc” folder within. To download a file for editing, simply highlight it and click the “Download” button in the row of small buttons at the top of the screen. Once you select a download location and click “Download.” You can then open it in your editor of choice. To upload a file to the server, simply do the reverse – click the “Upload” button in the row of small buttons as the top of the screen, select a file to upload, and click “Upload,” which will put the file in the folder you are currently viewing on the Blaze server.

'''Normal Articular Cartilage'''
Articular cartilage of diarthrodial joints are covered by hyaline cartilage, which is in turn derived from the two words - ''hyalose'' a greek word for glass and ''cartilago'', a latin word for gristle. It is relatively acellular and has no vascular, neural or lyphatic supply. Articular cartilage by its rubber like resiliency, functions to reduce pressure and where it covers the end of a bone, its smooth surface minimises the friction effect of shearing stresses. The cartilage of our joints derives its nutrition from the movement and contact pressure of the joint for its effect on transmitting the larger solutes from the joint fluid to the cellular matrix of the cartilage; a process which is potentiated when there is slight incongruity of the opposing joint surfaces. Chrondromalacia, the softening which heralds early osteoarthritis is present in most humans after age 40 and usually starts in non-load bearing areas.

__TOC__
=Morphology of Articular Cartilage=
#Colour: Colour varies with age.
#*Children - transparent and white with a bluish tinge
#*Young adult - white and glossy
#*Middle aged - yellowish white
#*Advanced age - opaque and yellowish with brownish tinge
#Compressibility: Compressible under pressure but on removal of the deforming force, it springs back into its original shape (behaves as a ''shock absorber'').
#*Children - highly compressible
#*Young adults - compressible but less than in a child
#*Middle aged - firmer and less compressible
#*Advanced age - less resiliant and more resistant
#Thickness: Articular cartilage becomes thinner wtih disuse and in old age. In a given joint thickness varies from one area to another. In areas with concave surface, it is thicker at the periphery and thinner in the centre. Reverse is true for areas with convex surfaces. Thickness varies from joint to joint. It is thinnest in the interphalangeal joints and thickest in the patella.
#*Average thickness - 2-3 mm
#*Interphalangeal joint - 1 mm
#*Patella - 5-6 mm
#Surface: The surface appears smooth when viewed by naked eye. Microscopic examination particularly using electron microscope demonstrates surface undulations. The undulations entrap synovial fluid, facilitating the lubrication os the articular cartilage.
#*The most superficial layer of articular cartilage known as the lamina splendens is acellular measures 4 to 8 microns in thickness and consists of collagen, of a type more characteristic of synovium than articular cartilage.

=Composition of Articular Cartilage=
The articular cartialge is made of cells called chondrocytes which are embedded in an extracellular matrix.

#Chondrocytes: This is one of the cells found in articular cartilage. It contributes very little to the total mass of the tissues. In a human adult it forms only 1% of the total volume. Chondrocytes differ in size and shape and metabolic activity depending on zones in the articular cartilage. Chondrocytres take active part in the synthesis of and turn over of the extra cellular matrix and replacement of degraded matrix and its components. Adult cartilage derives its nutrition from the synovial fluid. Nutrition to reach the chodrocytes must go through double diffusion barriers.
#*synovial tissue and synovial fluid
#*cartilage matrix - this system makes the chondrocytes manage with low concentration of oxygen, hence they depend more on anaerobic metabolism.
#Extracellular Matrix:It has two main components.
#*Tissue Fluid: Water contributes to 70-80% of the net weight of the articular cartilage. This tissue also contains gases, small proteins, metabolites and a high concentration of cations to balance the negatively charged proteoglycans.
#*Structural Macromolecules: These form 20-30% of the net weight of the tissue. They in turn consist of:
#*#Collagen: It contributes 60% of the dry weight. It has many types of collagen. Collagen types II, VI, IX and XI are predominant.The main collagen is type II accounting for 90-95%. Types II, IX and XI form cross-banded fibrils which form a tight mesh work. THis provides the cartilage its tensile stiffness and strength and traps the large proteoglycan molecules to achieve cohesiveness. Type VI collagen is found immediately surrounding the chondrocytes assisting them to get attached to the matrix. Type X collagen is found mainly near the cells of calcified cartilage zone and suggests that it may have a role to play in the mineralization of the cartilage.
#*#Proteoglycans: These macromolecules are extremely important in affording the tissue its resiliency and in maintaining its water content. They have a linear protein core to which are attached at right angles long chains of polysaccharides known as glycosaminoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans found in articular cartilage include - hyaluronic acid, chondroitin-6 sulphate, chondroitin-4 sulphate, keratin sulphate and dermatan sulphate. Concentration of these molecules varies within the articular cartilage, and also with age, injury  and disease of the cartialge. Among the glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin-6 sulphate is the principal one accounting for over 50% of the sugar component. Keratin sulphate is present only in trace amounts in immature cartilage but with advancing age, its concentration increases. Larger aggregating proteoglycan monomers are called aggregans and they fill up most of the interfibrillar space of the cartilage matrix contributing to 90% of the total cartilage matrix proteoglycan mass.
#*#Non-Collagenous Proteins and Glycoproteins: Glycoproteins have a protein core to which are attached a few chains of monosaccharides and polysaccharides.
#*#*Anchorin C-II helps to anchor chondrocyte surface protein to the collagen fibril
#*#*Cartilage oligomeric protein is found in the territiorial matrix of the chondrocyte and has the capacity to bind to chondrocytes. It may have a value as a marker of cartilage turnover and may be useful in assessing the degree of degenration in osteoarthritis.
#*#*Fibronectin and Tenascin may have a role in matrix organisation, cell-matrix interaction and the response of tissue in inflammatory arthrits and osteoarthritis.

=Structure of Articular Cartilage=
# Zones: The morphological changes in chondrocytes and matrix from articular surface to subchondral bone make it possible to identify four zones.
#*Zone I – Superficial or Gliding Zone: This is the thinnest of all the zones. It has two layers. The most superficial layer is called the ‘’’Lamina Splendens’’’ which is totally acellular. Apart from mechanical function this dense collagen skin probably reduces leakage of proteoglycans from the articular surface and protects it from the effect of harmful enzymes. Deep to Lamina Splendens, flattened ellipsoid shaped chondrocytes arrange themselves so that their major axes are parallel to the articular surface. Chondrocytes of this area produce more collagen than proteoglycan. Concentration of fibronectin and water are also highest in this zone. Collagen fibrills in this zone are numerous and lie parallel to the joint surface in the superficial zone and gives this zone great tensile strength and stiffness than the deeper layers. It also helps them to resist shearing forces generated during movement in the joint. Alteration in this zone may contribute to the development of osteoarthritis. The densely packed collagen fibrills may also limit the ingress of large molecules such as antibodies and the egress of large cartilage molecules. By behaving as a barrier this zone may isolate the remaining part of the cartilage from the immune system. Hence disruption of this zone may not only alter the structure and mechanical properties but may also release cartilage molecules that stimulate immune or inflammatory response.
#*Zone II – Transitional Zone: The cells int his zone are spheroidal in shape and have a higher concentration of synthetic organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus than the cells in the deeper zones. The cells appear clumped into groups. They have the capacity to synthesise the matrix. The collagen fibrills in tis zone are placed tangentially and latter when they traverse to the deeper aspect they change their orientation and lie perpendicular to the articular surface.
#*Zone III – Middle or Radial Zone: This is the broadest zone. The total thickness of the cartilage is determined by this zone. When well developed, this zone contributes to two-third of the thickness of the entire articular cartilage. Collagen fibrills of this zone have the largest diameter and the water concentration is the lowest. The collagen fibrills run parallel to each other and are situated perpendicular to the articular surface.
#*Zone IV – Calcified Zone: This is a thin zone that separates the Radial zone from the subchondral bone. The cells here are smaller and fewer but arranged in rows. In some areas the cells are totally buried in individual '''Calcified Sepulchers''', suggesting that that they may have a very low level of metabolic activity. They may have a role to play in the development and progression of osteoarthritis.
#Tide Mark: The junction between the radial and calcified zones is distinctly visible as a basophilic line  in stained preparations of articular cartilage This faint but distinct bluish line is known as the tide mark. It is not seen in developing individuals but in the adult cartilage The number of tide marks may increase with advancing age. This may signify that the calcified zone undergoes periodic extensions into the non-calcified zones of the cartilage with advancing age.
#Articular Cartilage – Bone Junction: At its base, articular cartilage is bordered by subchindral bone. However there is no structural continuity between the two of them. The cartilage tissue is keyed into irregular surface of the the underlying bone like a jigsaw puzzle. The cartilage adjacent to the bone is calcified and has a similar rigidity like bone, hence the keying is rigid.
#Regions of the Matrix: Three distinct compartments can be delineated
#*Pericellular Region: This rim of pericellular matrix covers cell surface. It is rich in proteoglycans, anchorin C-II and non-fibrillar collagens such as Type VI collagen. Cytoplasmic extension from chondrocytes extend into this part of the matrix.
#*Territorial Region: Surrounding the pericellular region is the territorial matrix which encloses individual or clusters of   chondrocytes. In the radial zone it may even envelop each column of chondrocytes. It renders protection to the chondrocytes.
#*Interterritorial Region: It has the largest column of collagen fibres. Proteoglycans are embedded between their small little spaces.

=Interaction Between Chondrocytes and The Matrix=
Chondrocytes and the matrix are interdependent on each other for maintenance. Chondrocytes secrete the macromolecules that make up the matrix and the matrix in turn protects the ch0ndrocytes from mechanical damage helping them to maintain their shape and phenotype. Synthesis and degradation of matrix molecules by is a process continuous throughout life. The mechanism that controls this balance is poorly understood but cytokines with catabolic and anabolic effects appear to have important roles. Matrix also acts as a signal transducer for the chondrocytes. It transmits signals that result from mechanical loading to chondrocytes. They in turn respond to these signals by altering the matrix. Experiments have shown that a persistent decreas4 in joint loading or immoboilisation of the joint decrease the concentration of proteoglycan. Resumption of the usage of joint leads to normalcy. Hence repetitive loading and movement helps a great deal in maintaining the homeostasis of articular cartilage.

=Aging and Osteoarthritis=
 
Cyclic loading of the entire joint surface does not usually occur in the course of normal activities of daily living. The precursor lesion of osteoarthritis namely chondromalacia, or softening of the cartilage is observed to occur first in non-load bearing areas of the joint. Lacking the sustaining contact pressure which nutritionally replenishes the matrix and produces an anabolic mechanical stimulation,these infrequently loaded areas are depleted in sulfated mucopolysaccharides, thus they are less basophilic on haematoxylin eosin staining. As these nutritionally depleted areas from time to time do indeed sustain load they thereby break down,by a failure of normal remodeling processes, fibillation and progressive changes of osteoarthritis ensue. Secondary osseus changes then lead to increased joint congruity in the joint as a whole which lessens the nutrition enhancing effect of youthful slight incongruity in normally weight bearing areas.

Current research appears consistent with a hypothesis that applying load to these normally unloaded areas perhaps through a daily regimen of yoga or pilates may be a reasonable presciption for prevention of this ubiquitous degenerative process by enhancement of cartilage nutrition and anabolic mechanical stimulus through regular loading. In that cartilage has some inherent regenerative potential, a similar regimen could be helpful even once the pathologic changes have begun. Might it be that like the life forms in a tide pool, replenishment twice a day as from the rising tide may suffice to sustain our cartilage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rename proposal ==

I'd like to propose that the pages in this book are renamed so that they start with &quot;Animal Behavior/&quot;. This will allow readers to see easily that all pages in the book do in fact belong in the book and will be consistent with what most wikibooks do. I trust this proposal is non-controversial, and if it happens it will be by using a bot that preserves all internal links, but am leaving a note here in case anyone has something they'd wish to add, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 22:01, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

==Transclusion proposal==

i am proposing to ease into the section on neuroscience by building on the same section in the introduction to psychology book. the goal is to continue fleshing it out via the transclusion mechanism and to later fork it into 2 separate projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Cyclopes (''singular'' Cyclops) were the three sons of '''[[Greek Mythology/Titans/Uranus|Uranus]]''' and '''[[Greek Mythology/Titans/Gaia|Gaia]]''', the first king of the Titans. They were imprisoned by their father into the underworld, who feared their strength along with their three brothers, who had fifty heads and a hundred hands. Their names were '''[[Greek Mythology/Beasts/Cyclops/Brontes|Brontes]]''', '''[[Greek Mythology/Beasts/Cyclops/Steropes|Steropes]]''' and '''[[Greek Mythology/Beasts/Cyclops/Arges|Arges]]'''.

== Origin ==
The word Cyclops means ''one large eye. They were born of '''[[Greek Mythology/Titans/Gaia|Gaia]]''', creator of the earth and her husband '''[[Greek Mythology/Titans/Uranus|Uranus]]'''.

== Appearance ==
Cyclopes are usually shown as having one, round eye in place of where their two eyes should be, although sometimes they are depicted as having two empty eye sockets and an eye in the middle of their forehead. Sometimes they are depicted very ogre like,like other times depicted almost human.

== Abilities ==
The Cyclopes were known for their great strength, and also their ability of craftsmanship. They created  [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Zeus|Zeus']] lightning bolts, in return for freeing them, while he was fighting the Titans. They also forged [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Poseidon|Poseidon's]] trident. They were also known for going around eating humans. They worked as Hephaestus helpers under the volcano Etna making Zeus's lightnings, but were killed by Apollo as a revenge for Zeus's killing his son Aclepius.

== Other Information ==
One of [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Poseidon|Poseidon's]] sons, [[Greek Mythology/Beasts/Cyclops/Polyphemus|Polyphemus]], was a cyclops. Polyphemus plays an important part in the Odyssey, as one of the monsters that besets Odysseus and his crew on their way back to Ithaca. The Cyclopes were also the helpers of one of the gods after Zeus brought them out of the underworld.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mind reading is actually ''not'' reading a person's thoughts. It is about the performer forcing the spectator to choose a particular thing or readily determining (through a variety of potential avenues) which thing or things the person has chosen. Below are two brief examples:

&quot;Okay, you're thinking of a number between one and four. The number is three, right?&quot;

99% of people will choose the number 3 in that scenario. 

Next time when you meet a friend just show the back side of your palm and ask them to choose a finger - 99% of people would select the middle finger only.

===The Magician's Force Mental Effect===
The Magician's Force is a term used to describe a number of things mostly dealing with cards, but can be used in almost any form of mentalism. Simply put, the Magician's Force is a way of making the spectator choose or do something that they feel was of their own doing not the magician's. The most common for this takes is in card magic. There are many different types of card forces available; you can go to the section entitled Basic Card Magic for more on card forces. This section will be dealing with forces used in mentalist effects, although one of the examples will be a card trick.

====The Unknown Assistant====
This is the easiest miracle effect to learn. When performing for a group of people, have a card selected and lost in the deck. Instead of revealing the card yourself, have a friend of the spectator reveal the card for you. After you leave, they will compare notes and when they realize what just happened, they will think you are the most amazing person on the planet (well maybe not the most amazing, but at least in the top two billion or so…)

As with most tricks, the patter is very important. Probably more so in a situation like this where you have to lead someone to the conclusion without making it apparent that you are doing so. Everything must look like it is on the up and up. That is to say that you have to be subtle so as not to arouse suspicions about what you are doing or saying. Let us start with a synopsis of the trick we are about to discuss. First, a card is chosen by a spectator. This can be a free choice or a force depending upon exactly what you are trying to do as well as your skill level in handling cards. The chosen card is not looked at by the spectator, and not shown to anyone else. The spectator should hold on to the card so no one else can see it, and so that it can be compared to the revealed card at the end. Another spectator, preferably a friend to the first spectator is chosen to reveal the card by receiving psychic impressions (yeah right.) After the card is revealed by the second spectator, the card is shown to match.

As the magician is going to be leading the spectators through the trick, patter and gestures must be subtle and direct.  A good rapport is needed and should be established as soon as possible. This could have been done through the previous tricks done for the spectators, or through just simply talking to them to get to know them a little before beginning. Have your force ready to begin as soon as the rapport takes hold. Once begun, it is important to maintain control of the situation. If one or more of the spectators are unruly, do some other trick to gain their attention and more importantly their respect. As a performer you have a right to be respected or to choose not to perform. If your audience doesn’t give you their attention, you are better off not performing for them when the performance involves audience participation. If you get their attention and have their respect, then you can begin the presentation.

First you must have a card chosen. It is important to make the choice look like a free one, even if it is not. The only rule here is that after the choice you must know what the chosen card is. If you can give the spectator a free choice and then discern the identity of the chosen card, do so. It will make the trick seem that much more of a miracle. Otherwise you must force a card on the spectator, a card you already know the identity of. The patter used will depend on the method of card delivery. In my example, I will show doing it with a free choice of cards. This can be accomplished most easily by a stacked deck (See Basic Card Magic.) My delivery patter is as follows:

(To the first spectator) '''''As I go through the deck slowly, I want you to place your finger on one of the cards, which ever you choose, and leave it there. Do you understand?'''''(Asking if they understand is not always necessary, but helps you know that they are following your instructions properly.) Once the spectator places their finger on a card (you can ask them if they want to change their mind or if they are sure that is the card they want, but you must maintain their finger on the card with no apparent movement of the cards.) Once you are sure that is the card they want separate the cards above their choice and as they are taking the card place the cards above it on the bottom of the deck while you are giving them the following instruction:

'''''OK I want you to take the card and don’t look at it or let anyone else see it, simply put it up against you so no one, not even yourself can know what it is.'''''
When they have done this, you must find the identity of the card they have chosen. As I am doing this with a stacked deck, all I have to do is glimpse the bottom card (which was the card on top of the chosen card) and I will know the identity of their card. Once you have worked with a stacked deck enough you will be able to tell the next card without hesitation, which is what you must strive to do. Any hesitation will tell the audience that you are trying to remember the next card. If you need to stall long enough to figure out which card they chose, you can pick up the card box and insert the deck into the box. This gives you a little time to figure out their card while you fumble with the box, but don't take too long. Once you know the chosen card you then turn to the next spectator and begin the patter for their naming the card. I generally don’t let them know that they are going to reveal the card before the card is chosen. This doesn’t give them time to get nervous.

(To the second spectator and in the format of a setup for the reveal)  '''''Would you mind helping me with this trick?''''' (Before they can answer, continue with) '''''Have you ever been a magician before?''''' Once they agree to help, then begin with: '''''Well if I asked you to name their card, you would have a one in 52 chance, not very good odds. So let’s see if we can make those odds a little better shall we… In a deck of cards there are two colors, Red and Black. We can eliminate half of the cards by picking a color. So if you will please pick a color, Red or Black, Black or Red?'''''

(It is really important that you say it that way, as this shows that you are not trying to lead the spectator to make a particular decision. They don’t know how the trick works, but if you say one choice first all the time and that one happens to be the one that the spectator says then they think you led them to that decision. Saying both choices together and both first will eliminate this thinking.)

What you have done with this statement is setup the force. You already know the color of the chosen card. By making the statement above you have said you were going to eliminate half of the cards, but you didn’t say which half. Let’s say that the chosen card was the 5 of Diamonds. We know that it is a red card, so if the second spectator says “Red” then you simply turn to the first spectator and say '''''She says your card is a Red Card, let’s hope she is right or it isn’t going to be much of a trick''.''' However if the second spectator says “Black” then turn to the first spectator and say '''''She has eliminated the black cards, so your card must be “Red”''''' (see how easy that was)

Now turn back to the second spectator and say, '''''In the Red Cards there are two suits, Hearts and Diamonds, Lets see if we can cut our odds again. If you could please pick Hearts or Diamonds, Diamonds or Hearts.'''''

If the second spectator says “Diamonds” then turn to the first spectator and say, '''''Now that we know it is Diamonds let’s see if we can zero in on the value.''''' If the second spectator says Hearts, then go with '''''Ok, we eliminated the Hearts, so we know your card was Diamonds. Unfortunately we can no longer eliminate half of the cards, because we have thirteen left and that isn’t evenly divisible.''''' 

Turn back to the second spectator and say '''''There are however Face Cards and Spot Cards to chose from. Face cards being the Jack, Queen, and King. Spot Cards being all of the rest. So if you could please pick Face or Spot, Spot or Face?'''''
If the spectator says “Face” then you would say '''''That leaves the Spot Cards'''''. If the spectator says “Spot” then say, '''''Ok there are ten Spot Cards, let’s eliminate some more. There are High Cards and Low Cards, High being the Six, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Low being the Ace through Five, so please pick High or Low, Low or High?'''''

If the spectator says “High” then say '''''That leaves the Low Cards.''''' If the spectator says “Low” then say,  '''''There are five Low Cards, the Ace, Two, Three, Four and Five. Please pick any three of them.'''''

Since the Chosen card was the 5 of Diamonds, simply leave the five in play and eliminate the others. If the 5 was one of the chosen cards, then rename the three and say '''''please chose two'''''. If it wasn’t then you are down to two cards simply say '''''choose one of them'''''.  By manipulating the choices in this way you end up with the chosen card rename it and have the first spectator show their card for the first time.

The main thing to remember is that you must be in control at all times. You must keep the motion going not letting the spectators have too much time between choices to think about what you are doing. If they don’t get to think about it as you are doing it, they won’t know they are being manipulated. By the time they have a chance to think about what happened, they won’t remember enough of the details to put it together.

====Unpredictable Prediction====
This effect is also very simple yet very powerful. Start with a piece of paper on which you will write a prediction. Fold up the prediction and display it where everyone can see it. Pick about 10 to 15 everyday items and bring them to a table. Alternate with the spectator picking items out of the group until there is only one item left. When the prediction is read, it will match the item remaining.

With this effect there are only two things to remember. The first is what the prediction is, and the second is that the magician always picks on the even numbered picks. The easiest way to see how this trick works would be to work through a sample. For the sake of time we will start at the point where there is only six items left. We will assume that the items are a candle, a book, a pencil, a mirror, a comb, a photo, and a credit card. We will also assume that the mirror is the prediction.

The magician takes the comb and the credit card and places them at the center of the table. The spectator must eliminate one of these two items, let’s say the comb. The credit card goes back with the other five items and the spectator must now choose two items and place them at the center of the table for the magician to eliminate one. Let’s say the spectator chooses the mirror and the book. These are placed at the center of the table and the magician must eliminate one of these. The magician eliminates the book and places the mirror back with the other items. The magician now chooses the candle and the pencil to place at the center. The spectator eliminates the pencil and places the candle back with the others. The spectator picks the credit card and the candle and places them at the center. The magician eliminates the credit card and places the candle back with the other items. The magician picks the photo and the candle and places them at the center. The spectator eliminates the candle and places the photo back with the mirror which is the only item left. Since there are only two items left, the magician eliminates the photo. This leaves the mirror, which matches the prediction.

It works very simply, when the magician is giving the spectator two items to choose from, the prediction is never one of the items. If the spectator puts in the prediction item as one of the choices, the magician simply chooses the other item, leaving the prediction in play. One note though don’t have too many items to choose from, limit it to about 10 to 12. More than that gives the spectators a chance to see the pattern, and can figure out what is going on.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Adjectives|Les adjectifs}} ==

Like articles, French adjectives match the nouns that they modify in gender and plurality.

=== Regular formation ===
Most adjective changes occur in the following manner:

* Feminine: add an ''-e'' to the masculine form
*: ''un garçon intéressant'' → ''une fille intéressant'''e'''''
*: ''un ami amusant'' → ''une amie amusant'''e'''''
*: ''un camion lent'' → ''une voiture lent'''e'''''
* Plural: add an ''-s'' to the singular form
*: ''un garçon intéressant'' → ''des garçons intéressant'''s'''''
*: ''une fille intéressante'' → ''des filles intéressante'''s'''''

=== Pronunciation ===
Generally, the final consonant is pronounced only when it comes before an ''-e''. Most adjectives, such as those above, are affected by this rule.

* Masculine pronunciation:
*: {{French/Word|intéressant|IPA=/ɛ̃.te.ʁɛ.sɑ̃/|audio=Fr-intéressant.ogg}}
*: {{French/Word|amusant|IPA=/a.my.zɑ̃/|audio=Fr-amusant.ogg}}
*: {{French/Word|lent|IPA=/lɑ̃/|audio=Fr-lent.ogg}}
* Feminine pronunciation:
*: {{French/Word|intéressant'''e'''|IPA=/ɛ̃.te.ʁɛ.sɑ̃t/}}
*: {{French/Word|amusant'''e'''|IPA=/a.my.zɑ̃t/}}
*: {{French/Word|lent'''e'''|IPA=/lɑ̃t/}}

With plural adjectives, the ''-s'' ending is not pronounced, so the adjective will sound exactly the same as the singular form.

=== {{French/Section|Grammar|Exceptions and irregularities|supplementary-id=french-adjective-exceptions}} ===
&lt;div id='french-adjective-exceptions'&gt;
Adjectives that end in ''e'' in the masculine form do not change in gender. When an adjective, such as ''gros'', ends in ''-s'', it does not change in the masculine plural form. Sometimes the final consonant is doubled in the feminine form.

A frequently missed injury to the ligaments and central slip of the PIP joint this injury most often leads to some long term compromise in the function of the finger regardless of how it is treated. When it typically presents a few weeks after injury, presumed at first to be a &quot;jammed&quot; finger, the distiguishing feature is the flexed resting posture of the PIP joint which will likely still be passively correctible (extension lag rather than flexion contracture). This is seen in conjunction with a hyperextended resting posture of the distal interphalangeal joint.  

Closed treatment is by an alumafoam splint applied with coban to the PIP in full extension; then active flexion exercises of the DIP joint.  The PIP is splinted full time for 5 weeks then full motion is allowed. A residual flexion contracture or extension lag at the PIP is typical, but if it can be limited to 20 degrees generally does not interfere with function if active DIP flexion is near normal. Swelling of the PIP persists for the better part of a year.

If there is fixed contracture therapy is directed at achieving full extension by static or dynamic splinting or serial casting to gain full passive extension at the pip joint.  

Surgical treatments include efforts to reconstruct the central slip directly, or efforts to employ release of the terminal extensor tendon to diminish hyperextension at the DIP level and hopefully inprove the active extension at the PIP level as the extensor retracts and the slack pseudotendon over the PIP receives more tension via the confluent extensor hood.  

Lacerations and crush injury to the dorsum of the PIP can include central slip injuries which can also go unrecognized with resultant deformity apparent at time of follow up.  Usually exploration is pursued to obtain direct repair of the central slip.  A 1.3 suture anchor or a transosseus suture tied over a button on the palmar surface with a 3-0 proline are two common methods.  

In the case of crush injury there may be soft tissue defects to contend with, small defects are managable with random pattern flaps if a few millimeters of coverage over the repaired tendon is needed.  Alternatively a more elaborate axial pattern flap can be used where applicable.  Stable coverage is needed if tendon graft is used to reconstruct the central slip.  

Pinning of the PIP in extension has the advantage of lessened concern for early failure due to lack of compliance or loss of position in the splint.  Access to the hand to address or rehab other injuries may be enhanced.  The concerns with a transarticular pin include the prospect for excessive stiffness or pin failure requiring the problematic retrieval of the broken pin from within the bone.  It is helpful in such a case to have advanced the pin all the way through the bone on the opposit side of the joint so that if it should break a protruding end is available on both sides.

If a transosseus pin can be avoided well supervised rehab can be considered early allowing short arc active flexion with passive extension or a dynamic splint with a flexion stop.  In any case any pin should be removed by 4 weeks and active motion initiated.  Secondary capsulotomy and tenolysis after 4 months may be needed if the joint is very stiff in extension.

At times the patient will present with a laceration over the PIP which has been closed by the ER staff and the status of the central slip is uncertain.  It may seem to be in tact clinically but then, within a week or two, extension lag and a tendency to hyperextension at the DIP will indicate the true diagnosis.  Exploration within a four week interval from injury will usually allow for direct repair of the central slip which can then be managed as in the acutely recognized central slip injury.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Musical Intelligence
The theory of Musical Intelligence was introduced by Howard Garner as part of his theory of Multiple Intelligence.  Multiple Intelligence comprises 9 areas of intelligence that people have and Gardner believes that each Intelligence can be enhanced through learning experiences.  This article will look at Musical Intelligence in terms of what it is, how it is used and potential benefits within a learning environment.

Gardner’s defines Musical Intelligence as “Musical Rhythmic Intelligence, (music smart), is the capacity to think in music, to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, and perhaps manipulate them”.   

To explore Musical Intelligence further visit http://www.ibiblio.org/edweb/edref.mi.th1.html

Characteristics of musical intelligence may include someone who remembers and differentiates between tunes and sound patterns, have a good sense of tone, tap to or move rhythmically to sounds or music, and generally enjoy composing or performing music.

In a paper published by the British Journal of Music Education which looked at Musical Intelligence relating to practical aspects of musical education showed how Musical Intelligence can be incorporated into a school curriculum.  The study revealed that music adds value to both the school and the pupil.  Music can be included in a blend of skills and activities when performing, creating or inventing and listening or communicating.  To achieve success teachers must ensure students participate in all activities including listening skills and are given opportunities to try out different activities themselves.

Schools are further enhancing Musical intelligence with the aid of Digital technology .An article by Dee Dickinson for America Tomorrow shows how students can learn elements of music that are often difficult for beginners to understand by combining digital audio with visual input .  The article goes on to quote.. “One example is the Voyager Company's interactive multimedia compact disc of Beethoven's &quot;Ninth Symphony,&quot; which enables the listener to understand the piece musically, historically, culturally, and politically.” This technology is in it’s infancy of an exciting new era of innovation for learning about and producing music.

The benefits of musical intelligence can be spread across a wide area of people’s intelligence.  Gardner believes music can help people to develop in other areas such as maths, language and spatial reasoning.  Dr Arthur Harvey of the University of Hawaii has shown in his paper “An Intelligence View of Music Education” how Musical intelligence has impact on all intelligences.  One example of this is Hall’s study in 1952 on how musical intelligence impacts on Linguistic intelligence, the study showed that the use of background music in study halls resulted in substantially more improvement of reading comprehension than those that studied without music out of 278 eighth and ninth graders.  For further examples visit http://www.menc.org/publication/articles/academic/hawaii.htm.

In conclusion Musical Intelligence can play a significant part in the development of students once teachers are given the relevant training in all aspects of the music curriculum which includes assessments and music activities.

== Introduction ==

This wikibook is about how historians can leverage the technical contributions that the discipline of Knowledge Engineering has made to modern research in their own work. 

=== How We Got Here ===

* historians are trying to take advantages of the technologies that computers have, but they have no money to fund any research
* the Internet and its search engines are a great help
* in the early 80s, in the heyday's of AI, it looked like expert systems would be the way to go, but then the AI winter hit before the historians could really learn how to build or use them
* the &quot;Let's use Databases!&quot; movement fizzled in the late 90s because it was not immediately obvious how to address the issues of semantics underlying the coding of the data
* with OWL, the knowledge engineering is getting back into the swing of things
* ontologies such as the [[wikipedia:CIDOC| Council of Museum's conceptual reference model]] indicate that the time has come to learn this valuable tool
* one history ontology is already available, embedded in [http://www.vicodi.org/about.htm VICODI], see also the paper by [http://ahds.ac.uk/drh2005/viewabstract.php?id=29&amp;cf=1 Richard Deswarte and Jan Ooesthook] on their experience contributing to this effort, [http://herakles.fzi.de/vicodi/vicodi_20040402.html the ontology itself]

=== Where we are going to go ===

* in the primer, we are going to
**find out what the fundamental benefits derivable from knowledge engineering are
**get an idea of what the various (freely) available tools offer

* in the basic round, we are going to
**model some fundamental facts that historians need all the time
**model some intermediate concepts, like sources and point of view

* in the advanced round, we are going to
**model more difficult stuff, like temporal projections
**consider modelling problems that involve shifting the resolution of the knowledge we are reasoning over

== Modelling Historical Knowledge ==

Now that we are clear on the basics of knowledge modelling in general, we can turn to our task proper at hand and consider the tasks historians face in their research and how to deal with them appropriately. 

We first would like to look at a main concern of historians, the proper handling of ''sources''. Historians are nothing without their sources and they contain the knowledge we wish to represent and utilize. We then turn to the problem of how to deal appropriately with the work of their colleagues, another key element to historical research.

However, in order to discuss this topic we need to introduce some additional infrastructure, namely the notion of contexts. We will explain why we need these contexts, how they work, and what kind of problems their use poses.

==Sweyn Haraldssen (1013-1014)==
'''Sweyn Haraldssen''' was born in Denmark around the year 960. His nickname is &quot;Forkbeard&quot; which is a nickname that probably was used during his lifetime, and refers to a long, pitchfork-like moustache, rather than a full beard. Such a moustache was fashionable at the time, particularly in England. Sweyn succeeded his father, Harold I &quot;Blåtand&quot; (Bluetooth), as king of Denmark, probably in late 986 or early 987. Following the death of Norway's King Olaf I Tryggvason in the Battle of Svolder in 1000, Sven established Danish control over most of Norway. 

Sweyn was almost certainly involved in the raids against England in 1003 to 1005, 1006 to 1007, and 1009 to 1012, following the massacre of England's Danish inhabitants in November 1002 during the reign of Ethelred the Unready. Sven is thought to have had a personal interest in these due to his sister, Gunhilde, being amongst the victims. Sven acquired massive sums of Danegeld as a result of the raids, and in 1013 personally led the Danish fleet in a full-scale invasion.

The ''Laud Chronicle'' says that &quot;before the month of August came king Sweyn with his fleet to Sandwich. He went very quickly about East Anglia into the Humber's mouth, and so upward along the Trent till he came to Gainsborough. Eorl Uhtred and all Northumbria quickly bowed to him, as did all the folk of Lindsey, then the folk of the Five Boroughs. (...) He was given hostages from each shire. When he understood that all the people had submitted to him, he ordered that his force should be provisioned and horsed; he went south in full force, and entrusted his ships and the hostages to his son Canute. After he came over Watling Street, they worked the most evil that a force might do. They went to Oxford, and the town-dwellers soon bowed to him, and gave hostages. From there they went to Winchester, and did the same.&quot;

However, when he came to London, the Londoners destroyed the bridges that spanned the River Thames. It is this action that is referred to in the song ''London Bridge is Falling Down''. Sweyn suffered heavy losses and had to withdraw. King Sweyn then went to Wallingford, over the Thames to Bath, and stayed there with his troops. The leading noblemen there all bowed to Sweyn and gave hostages. London withstood the assault of the Danish army, but the city was now alone. King Ethelred the Unready fled to Normandy in late 1013. With the acceptance of the Anglo-Saxon council, the Witan, London finally surrendered to Sweyn, and he was declared &quot;king&quot; on Christmas Day.

Sweyn based himself in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire and began to organise his vast new kingdom, but he died there on 3 February 1014, having ruled England unopposed for only five weeks. His body was later returned to Denmark and buried at Roskilde Cathedral. He was succeeded as King of Denmark by his eldest son with his wife Gunhilde. The Danish fleet proclaimed his younger son Canute as King of England, but they and he returned to Denmark, and Ethelred the Unready became King of England again.

==Canute the Great (1014, 1016-1035)==
'''Canute''' (or '''Cnut''') '''I''', or '''Canute the Great''' was born in 994 or 995 in Denmark. He was King of England, Denmark and Norway and overlord of Schleswig and Pomerania. He was Sweyn Forkbeard's son. Canute accompanied his father on his invasion of England in August 1013, and Canute was proclaimed king by the Danish fleet on Sweyn's death the following February. However, he went back to Denmark in April 1014 once King Ethelred the Unready was restored by the Witenagemot. Canute invaded England again in August 1015, and after a series of inconclusive conflicts he won a decisive victory over the new English king, Edmund II, in October 1016. This led to a meeting with Edmund on an island in the River Severn, where they agreed to divide the kingdom, with the kingdom to be reunited again under the survivor when the first one of them died. When Edmund died in November 1016, this left Canute as sole ruler, and he was acclaimed as King of England by the Witenagemot in January 1017.

As King of England, Canute combined English and Danish institutions and personnel. His mutilation in April 1014 of the hostages taken by his father in pledge of English loyalty is remembered above all as being uncharacteristic of his rule. In 1017 Canute divided England into the four great earldoms of Wessex, Mercia, East Anglia and Northumbria, and he started the system of territorial lordships which would underlie English government for centuries. The very last Danegeld ever to be paid, a sum of £82,500, was paid to Canute in 1018. He felt secure enough to send the invasion fleet back to Denmark with a payment of £72,000 that same year. 

In order to associate his line with the overthrown English dynasty and to insure himself against attack from Normandy, where Ethelred's sons, Edward and Alfred, were in exile, in July 1017 Canute married Ethelred's widow, Emma of Normandy, daughter of Richard, Duke of Normandy. Canute later made his son by Emma, Harthacanute, his heir in preference to Harold Harefoot, his illegitimate son by Aelgifu of Northampton. 

===Denmark and Norway===

In 1018 or 1019 Canute succeeded his elder brother, Harold II of Denmark, as King of Denmark, and appointed his brother-in-law Ulf Jarl as the earl of Denmark. When the Swedish king, Anund Jakob, and the Norwegian king, Olaf, took advantage of Canute's absence and attacked Denmark, Ulf convinced the freemen to elect Harthacanute king, since they were miscontent with Canute's absenteeism. This was a ruse from Ulf since his role as the caretaker of Harthacanute would make him the ruler of Denmark. In 1026, Canute returned to Denmark and with Ulf Jarl's help, he defeated the Swedes and the Norwegians at the Battle of Helgeå. However, Canute had not forgiven Ulf Jarl for his earlier actions, and at a banquet on 24 December 1026, the two started arguing with each other whilst playing chess. The next day, Canute had one of his household troops kill Ulf Jarl in the church of Trinity. In 1028, Canute conquered Norway with a fleet of fifty ships from England, though his attempt to govern Norway through Aelgifu and his other son by her, Sweyn, ended in rebellion and the restoration of the former Norwegian dynasty under Magnus I. 

===Commanding the waves to go back===

He is perhaps best remembered for the story of how he commanded the waves to go back. According to the legend, he grew tired of flattery from his courtiers. When one such flatterer gushed that the king could even command the obedience of the sea, Canute proved him wrong by actually going into the sea at Thorney Island and proving that he couldn't; a king's powers have limits. This legend is now usually misunderstood to mean that he believed himself so powerful that the natural elements would obey him, and that his failure to command the tides only made him look foolish. Whether this event really happened or not is unknown.

===Death and legacy===

Canute is generally regarded as a wise and successful king of England, although this view may in part be attributable to his good treatment of the church, which controlled the history writers of the day. The image that has come down from them is that he was a religious man, despite the fact that he lived openly in what was effectively a bigamous relationship, and despite his responsibility for many political murders.

Canute died in 1035, at Shaftesbury in Dorset, and was buried at Winchester.  On his death, Canute was succeeded as King of Denmark by Harthacanute, who reigned there as Canute III. Harold Harefoot became King of England, then after his death in 1040, Harthacanute became King of England too.

==Harold Harefoot (1035-1040)==
[[Image:HAROLD_I_HAREFOOT.JPG|right|150px|thumb|Harold Harefoot]]

'''Harold I Harefoot''' was born in Denmark around the year 1012. earned the name &quot;Harefoot&quot; for his speed and skill at hunting. He was the illegitimate son of King Canute by his concubine Aelgifu. Harold's younger half-brother Harthacanute, the son of Canute and his queen, Emma of Normandy, was the legitimate heir to the thrones of both Denmark and England at Canute's death in 1035. However, because Denmark was threatened with invasion from Norway, Harthacanute was unable to travel to England and instead sent as regents Emma and Harold Harefoot. Harold took effective power in England and in 1036 secured recognition by Harthacanute as regent during the latter's absence in Denmark. Harold and Emma argued over who should govern the kingdom. The powerful Earl Godwin sided with Harold, and in 1037, after Emma had fled, Harold seized the treasury at Winchester and thus the throne, and was crowned at Oxford. 

In general little is known about his reign and he appears to have been a colourless and weak character. His period of rule is associated with the blinding and death of Alfred the Aethling, Emma's son by King Ethelred the Unready, following Alfred's return to the kingdom (possibly in an attempt to take the throne) with his brother Edward the Confessor. Harold never married, but he had an illegitimate son, Elfwine, who became a monk on the continent. Harold died in Oxford in 1040, just as Harthacanute was preparing an invasion. He was buried at St Clement Danes Church, Westminster, but Harthacanute later had his body dug up, beheaded, and thrown into a fen bordering the River Thames.

==Harthacanute (1035-1037, 1040-1042)==

'''Harthacanute''' (sometimes ''Hardicanute'' or ''Hardecanute'') was born in 1018 or 1019. He was the only son of Canute the Great and his queen, Emma of Normandy. His name means Canute the Hardy. He succeeded his father as King of Denmark in 1035, reigning as '''Canute III''', but conflict with Magnus I of Norway prevented him from sailing to England to secure his position there so it was agreed that his elder illegitimate half-brother Harold Harefoot would be regent in charge of England.

Harold, after Harthacanute's continued absence, took the English crown for himself in 1037. In 1038 or 1039 Harthacanute settled the situation in Scandinavia through an agreement with Magnus in which they agreed that if either of them should die without an heir, the other would be his successor. He then prepared an invasion of England to depose Harold, and in 1039 arrived in Bruges in Flanders (modern-day Belgium), where his exiled mother was. An invasion was not necessary though as Harold died in March 1040 before it could occur. According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Harthacanute then landed at Sandwich in June with a fleet of 62 warships. Being unable to exact revenge on Harold while he was still alive, he had the dead Harold dragged up and thrown into a fen.

Harthacanute was a harsh and very unpopular ruler. He severely increased the rate of taxation to pay for his fleet, and perhaps the most notable event of his reign in England was a revolt at Worcester in 1041 against these high taxes. This revolt was crushed, with the near destruction of Worcester. The story of Lady Godiva riding naked through the streets of Coventry to persuade the local earl to lower taxes may come from the reign of Harthacanute.

Harthacanute never married and had no children. In 1041, Harthacanute invited his half-brother, Edward the Confessor, who was Emma's son by King Ethelred the Unready, back from exile in Normandy to become his co-ruler and heir. In June 1042, Harthacanute died at Lambeth and was buried at Winchester. Edward became king on Harthacanute's death, thereby restoring the Anglo-Saxon royal line.

Hi,

Just trying to reorganize this page and provide more examples.  I think it would be better if we created an entire section within the applications of derivatives page for kinematics.

----

Just added a section about finding the nth derivative of x^m - font size is too small and I'm very tired. So, someone please increase the font size in that section, and check the math to make sure I didn't screw something up. -[[User:64.30.204.249|64.30.204.249]] 08:13, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

Is concave up really convex? [[User:Cyrus Jones|Cyrus Jones]] ([[User talk:Cyrus Jones|talk]]) 00:47, 16 May 2008 (UTC)

== Is it really Newton's notation? ==

From the page:
:With the Newtonian notation, the derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^\prime(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Isn't that Lagrange's notation (apparently from &quot;Théorie des fonctions analytiques&quot;)? ([[w:Notation_for_differentiation|Wikipedia]]) --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 02:46, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

==Removed text==

I removed the following text from the page:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One can derive a general expression for the ''n''th derivative of &lt;math&gt;x^{m}&lt;/math&gt; where ''n'' and ''m'' are integers and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

* &lt;math&gt;f (x)=x^{m} \ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f' (x)=(m)x^{m-1} \ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f'' (x)=(m)(m-1)x^{m-2} \ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime\prime} (x)=(m)(m-1)(m-2)x^{m-3} \ &lt;/math&gt;
...
* &lt;math&gt;f^{(n)} (x)=\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}x^{m-n}&lt;/math&gt;

Remember that &lt;math&gt;0!=1&lt;/math&gt;, by definition.

Power, MacLaurin and Taylor series make use of this expression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The current examples don't use this approach, so it seemed a bit out of place. Perhaps it could be expanded on or used in a later module. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 22:52, 12 September 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Calculus/Top Nav|Centre of mass|Parametric and Polar Equations}}

==Introduction==

Kinematics or the study of motion is a very relevant topic in calculus.

If ''x'' is the position of some moving object, and ''t'' is time, this section uses the following conventions:

*&lt;math&gt;x(t) \, &lt;/math&gt; is its position function
*&lt;math&gt;v(t) = x^\prime(t)&lt;/math&gt; is its [[w:velocity|velocity]] function
*&lt;math&gt;a(t) = x^{\prime\prime}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is its [[w:acceleration|acceleration]] function

==Differentiation==

===Average Velocity and Acceleration===

Average velocity and acceleration problems use the algebraic definitions of velocity and acceleration.

* &lt;math&gt; v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;

====Examples====

'''Example 1:'''

 A particle's position is defined by the equation &lt;math&gt; x(t) = t^3 - 2t^2 + t \ &lt;/math&gt;. Find the
 average velocity over the interval ''[2,7].

* Find the average velocity over the interval ''[2,7]'':

:{|
|&lt;math&gt; v_{avg} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \frac{x(7) - x(2)}{7-2} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \frac{252 - 2}{5} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 50 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}

 Answer: &lt;math&gt; v_{avg} = 50 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

===Instantaneous Velocity and Acceleration===

Instantaneous velocity and acceleration problems use the derivative definitions of velocity and acceleration.

* &lt;math&gt; v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

====Examples====

'''Example 2:'''

 A particle moves along a path with a position that can be determined by the function &lt;math&gt;x(t) = 4t^3 + e^t \ &lt;/math&gt;. 
 Determine the acceleration when &lt;math&gt; t = 3 &lt;/math&gt;.

* Find &lt;math&gt; v(t) = \frac{ds}{dt}. &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{ds}{dt} = 12t^2 + e^t &lt;/math&gt;

* Find &lt;math&gt; a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = 24t + e^t &lt;/math&gt;

* Find &lt;math&gt; a(3) = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2} |_{t=3} &lt;/math&gt;

:{|
|&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2s}{dt^2} |_{t=3} &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 24(3) + e^3 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 72 + e^3 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 92.08553692... \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}

 Answer: &lt;math&gt; a(3) = 92.08553692... \ &lt;/math&gt;

==Integration==

* &lt;math&gt; x_2 - x_1 = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t) dt &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; v_2 - v_1 = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} a(t) dt &lt;/math&gt;

==Introduction==

Optimization is one of the uses of calculus in the real world. Let us assume we are a pizza parlor and wish to maximize profit. Perhaps we have a flat piece of cardboard and we need to make a box with the greatest volume. How does one go about this process? 

Obviously, this requires the use of maximums and minimums. We know that we find maximums and minimums via derivatives. Therefore, one can conclude that calculus will be a useful tool for maximizing or minimizing (collectively known as &quot;optimizing&quot;) a situation.

==Examples==

=== Volume Example ===

A box manufacturer desires to create a box with a surface area of 100 inches squared. 
What is the maximum size volume that can be formed by bending this material into a box? 
The box is to be closed.  The box is to have a square base, square top, and rectangular sides.

* Write out known formulas and information

: &lt;math&gt; A_{base} = x^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; A_{side} = x \cdot h \ &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; A_{total} = 2x^2 + 4x \cdot h = 100 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; V = l \cdot w \cdot h = x^2 \cdot h &lt;/math&gt;

* Eliminate the variable ''h'' in the volume equation

: &lt;math&gt; 2x^2 + 4xh = 100 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; x^2 + 2xh = 50 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; 2xh = 50 - x^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; h = \frac{50 - x^2}{2x} &lt;/math&gt;

:{|
|&lt;math&gt; V \ &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; (x^2) \left( \frac{50 - x^2}{2x} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} (50x - x^3) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}

* Find the derivative of the volume equation in order to maximize the volume

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dx} = \frac{1}{2} (50-3x^2) &lt;/math&gt;

* Set &lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dx} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt; x \ &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} (50-3x^2) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; 50-3x^2 = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; 3x^2 = 50 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{50}}{\sqrt{3}} &lt;/math&gt; 

* Plug-in the ''x'' value into the volume equation and simplify

:{|
|&lt;math&gt; V \ &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} \left[ 50 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{50}{3}} - \left( \sqrt{\frac{50}{3}} \right) ^3 \right] &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 68.04138174.. \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}

 Answer: &lt;math&gt; V_{max} = 68.04138174.. \ &lt;/math&gt;

=== Volume Example II ===
[[File:Open-top box.svg|225px|right]]
It is desired to make an open-top box of greatest possible volume from a square piece of tin whose side is &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, by cutting equal squares out of the corners and then folding up the tin to form the sides. What should be the length of a side of the squares cut out? 

If we call the side length of the cut out squares &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, then each side of the base of the folded box is &lt;math&gt;\alpha-2x&lt;/math&gt;, and the height is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the volume function is &lt;math&gt;V(x)=x(\alpha-2x)^2=x(\alpha^2-4\alpha x+4x^2)=\alpha^2 x - 4\alpha x^2 + 4x^3&lt;/math&gt;.

We must optimize the volume by taking the derivative of the volume function and setting it equal to 0. Since it does not change, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is treated as a constant, not a variable.

&lt;math&gt;V(x)=\alpha^2 x - 4\alpha x^2 + 4x^3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V'(x)=\alpha^2 - 8\alpha x + 12x^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;0=12x^2 - 8\alpha x + \alpha^2&lt;/math&gt;

We can now use the quadratic formula to solve for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-(-8\alpha) \pm \sqrt{(-8\alpha)^2 - 4(12)(\alpha^2)}}{2(12)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{8\alpha \pm \sqrt{64\alpha^2 - 48\alpha^2}}{24}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{8\alpha \pm \sqrt{16\alpha^2}}{24}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{8\alpha \pm 4\alpha}{24}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{\alpha}{6}, \frac{\alpha}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

We reject &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{\alpha}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, since it is a minimum (it results in the base length &lt;math&gt;\alpha-2x&lt;/math&gt; being 0, making the volume 0). Therefore, the answer is &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{\alpha}{6}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Sales Example ===
[[image:Calculus Graph-Finding Maximum Profit.png|right]]
A small retailer can sell ''n'' units of a product for a revenue of &lt;math&gt;r(n)=8.1n&lt;/math&gt; and at a cost of &lt;math&gt;c(n)=n^3-7n^2+18n&lt;/math&gt;, with all amounts in thousands. How many units does it sell to maximize its profit?

The retailer's profit is defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;p(n)=r(n) - c(n)&lt;/math&gt;, which is the revenue generated less the cost.  The question asks for the maximum amount of profit which is the maximum of the above equation.  As previously discussed, the maxima and minima of a graph are found when the slope of said graph is equal to zero.  To find the slope one finds the derivative of &lt;math&gt;p(n)&lt;/math&gt;. By using the subtraction rule &lt;math&gt;p'(n)=r'(n) - c'(n)&lt;/math&gt;:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;p(n)\,&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;r(n) - c(n)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;p'(n)\,&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dn}\left[8.1n\right]-\frac{d}{dn}\left[n^3-7n^2+18n\right]\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 
| = &lt;math&gt;-3n^2+14n-9.9\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Therefore, when 
&lt;math&gt;-3n^2+14n-9.9\,=0&lt;/math&gt;
the profit will be maximized or minimized. Use the [[w:quadratic formula|quadratic formula]] to find the roots, giving {3.798,0.869}. To find which of these is the maximum and minimum the function can be tested:
 
&lt;math&gt;p(0.869) = - 3.97321, p(3.798) = 8.58802&lt;/math&gt;

Because we only consider the functions for all &lt;math&gt;n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., you can't have &lt;math&gt;n=-5&lt;/math&gt; units), the only points that can be minima or maxima are those two listed above. To show that 3.798 is in fact a maximum (and that the function doesn't remain constant past this point) check if the sign of &lt;math&gt;p'(n)&lt;/math&gt; changes at this point. It does, and for ''n'' greater than 3.798 &lt;math&gt;P'(n)&lt;/math&gt; the value will remain decreasing. Finally, this shows that for this retailer selling 3.798 units would return a profit of $8,588.02.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Composing the Basic Elements ==

So far we have been happily conflating a notion that we now need to tease apart. When we write &lt;CODE&gt;ConstantineTheGreat&lt;/CODE&gt;, we are of course not writing an ''entity''; the entity [[wikipedia:Constantine_the_Great|Constantine the Great]] is no longer among us and cannot be brought back by writing. Rather, we have been manipulating a ''term'', namely the term with the unique character string sequence &quot;ConstantineTheGreat&quot;, which is supposed to refer to [[wikipedia:Constantine_the_Great|Constantine the Great]]. 

This is not hair-splitting, because once one has terms, it becomes obvious that multiple terms can actually refer to the same entity. (This also gives us a chance to show an equivalence relation in action!)

 ;; some examples (the first is a classic)
 equals(MorningStar,EveningStar)  
 equals(FirstWifeOfHenryVIII,CathrineOfArragon)
 
=== Functions &amp;mdash; Dependent Terms ===

Sometimes an entity can be defined in terms of another entity. Indeed, if we look at the second example from the term introduction, it becomes pretty much clear from the term's name that this term is defined in terms of another: 

 equals(FirstWifeOfHenryVIII,CathrineOfArragon)

In knowledge engineering, this case is expressed via a ''function''. A function is a composite term that denotes an entity in terms of one or more other terms (including self-denoting ones such as character strings and numbers). For example, we could rewrite the above example as follows:

 equals(NthWifeOfFn(HenryVIII,1),CathrineOfArragon) 

Notice the notational convention of appending &lt;CODE&gt;Fn&lt;/CODE&gt; and capitalizing the expression. The advantages of this approach are several:

* We now have captured additional information (namely the ordinal position) represented in the function rather snuck away in the name of a simple term. This is good because the programs we employ for knowledge representation are challenged when it comes to getting things out of names, but they do pretty well with arguments!
* We can now type self-denotating terms (which will allow us to undo a little cheat we undertook earlier):
 ;; typing dimensionless scalars
 MeterFn(272)
 ;; or tying them to a convention 
 YearFn(272,CE)
 ;; we can now do a more proper rendition of old Constantine
 yearOfBirth(ConstantineTheGreat,YearFn(272,CE))
* Consider the alternative to having functional terms; if you were not happy with 272 by itself denoting both a distance and a year, then you would have to create simple terms for each one of them 

 ;; a pointless exercise
 ..., TheDistanceOf271Meters, TheDistanceOf272Meters, TheDistanceOf273Meters, ...
 ..., TheYear271CE, TheYear272CE, TheYear273CE ...

Not all representation languages support this feature, though, and here is why: The power of flexibility comes with the price of now having a humongous number of terms in the language. This can introduce problems for the underlying reasoning system. Consequently, some representation languages prefer to keep this problem at bay by not supporting this feature. There, you have to work around the issue with relations and more complex statements.

 ;; a more complex way if you dont have functions
 yearOfBirth(ConstantineTheGreat,?X) 
 &amp;&amp; typeOfScalar(?X,Year)
 &amp;&amp; valueOfScalar(?X,272)

=== Complex Statements ===

So far we had primarily looked at simple statements, but as the last example showed, by introducing some additional material, namely logical connectives and variables, we can say more complex things. The logical connectives that knowledge representation systems usually support are:

* the &lt;CODE&gt;and&lt;/CODE&gt; operation, denoted here as &lt;CODE&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/CODE&gt;
* the (inclusive-)&lt;CODE&gt;or&lt;/CODE&gt; operation, denoted here as &lt;CODE&gt;||&lt;/CODE&gt;
* the unary negation operator, denoted here as &lt;CODE&gt;~&lt;/CODE&gt;

We also need to briefly talk about ''quantifiers'', which specify constraints on variables. There are basically two flavors of quantifier: the ''existential quantifier'', which says that there is at least one of this kind (there exists one, therefore ''existential''); and the ''universal quantifier'', which says that the following is true for all entities that satisfy the properties. Let's briefly reconsider our non-functional birth year of Constantine example:
 
 ;; we had basically treated existential quantification as assumed
 thereExists(?X,
   yearOfBirth(ConstantineTheGreat,?X) 
   &amp;&amp; typeOfScalar(?X,Year)
   &amp;&amp; valueOfScalar(?X,272))
 ;; all birth years are years
 forAll(?X,
  forAll(?Y,
   yearOfBirth(?Y,?X)
   &amp;&amp; typeOfScalar(?X,Year)))  

=== Rules &amp;mdash; Patterns of Relationship  ===

Now that we know about complex statements, we can turn our attention to a whole variety of complex statements called ''rules''. Rules are like being able to say many things at the same time; they state a pattern for making statements of specific type. This is not only a notational convenience, but allows one to make statements about entities that one has not even encountered yet. For example, the statement that all people have a mother is true for people that are not even born yet. 

Notationally, we will use the &lt;CODE&gt;implies&lt;/CODE&gt; operator, which takes a precondition and a postcondition (or antecedent and consequent), and states that if the precondition is true, then the post-condition is true also.

 ;; all people have a mother
 implies(forAll(?X,person(?X)),
         thereExists(?Y,motherOf(?Y,?X))

Since the antecedent is implicitly universal, many languages permit to leave the &lt;CODE&gt;forAll&lt;/CODE&gt; off:

 ;; with functional speak we get the veryt terse
 implies(person(?X),motherOf(MotherFn(?X),?X))

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Basic Elements ==

Knowledge Engineering's basic tools are '''entities''' and '''relations'''. 

=== Entities ===

An '''entity''' is something like a concept &amp;mdash; e.g. the feudal system &amp;mdash; or an individual &amp;mdash; St. Peter's Cathedral, Charlemagne, etc. Some entities are timeless and self-denoting, like numbers or names; others have complex histories, like the two entities we just mentioned. 

Before we look at some examples, a brief comment on notation: For the purposes of the examples presented here, we will notate entities with capital letters and relations with initial lowercase letters. And we will use double-semicolons &amp;mdash; ;; &amp;mdash; to denote comments in our representation; so anything that follows a double-semicolon mark to the end of that line is a comment and can contain arbitrary characters.

That said, let's look at some examples:

 ;; a couple of entities from the 4th century AD
 Trier-RomanCity
 ConstantineTheGreat
 HelenaOfConstantinople

Here we have identified three entities: the Roman city of [[wikipedia:Trier|Trier, Germany]]; the 4th century AD Roman Emperor [[wikipedia:Constantine_the_Great|Constantine the Great]]; and his mother, the later Augusta [[wikipedia:Helena_of_Constantinople|Helena of Constantinople]]. 

=== Relations ===

==== Definition and Arity ====

A '''relation''' is an entity in its own right (or at least should be) and is used to connect (usually) two entities together. More precisely, the number of entities that a relation can connect together is called the [[wikipedia:Arity|arity]] of the relation. 

 ;; something about our entities
 yearOfBirth(ConstantineTheGreat,272)
 motherOf(ConstantineTheGreat,HelenaOfConstantinople)
 residence(ConstantineTheGreat,Trier-RomanCity)

==== Assigning Type Information ====

While one might suspect that relations that connect two entities (so-called ''binary'' relations) be the most useful, there are indeed interesting uses for relations with an arity of one (''unary'' relations), namely stating that an entity belongs to a specific class or type:

 ;; some type information about our entities 
 male(ConstantineTheGreat)
 female(HelenaOfConstantinople)
 city(Trier)

Notice that not all ontologies handle type information this way; indeed, we could treat &quot;maleness&quot; as an entity in its own right and then use a binary relation to attribute this to [[wikipedia::Constantine_the_Great|emperor Constantine]].

 ;; for those who dont like unary relations
 is-a(ConstantineTheGreat,Male)
 is-a(HelenaOfConstantinople,Female)
 is-a(Trier-RomanCity,City)

The advantage of doing things this way is that concepts like city really feel like they ought to be entities in their own right. However, this is not true for all types. Indeed, some types look odd when treated as an entity:

 ;; which looks better? many think the first one does
 red(MyFerrari)
 is-a(MyFerrari,RedObject)

Some representation languages choose to not treat relations as entities in their own right (e.g. frame-based systems), and this imputes a preference for assigning type information with binary predicates. However, as we stated above, there is really no excuse for not treating relations as entities in their own right!

==== Arity: How Much is Too Much? ====

For some representation languages, the maximum arity of its relations may be an implementation dependent choice. This is defensible insofar as, theoretically speaking, it is always possible to construct the equivalent of an &lt;CODE&gt;n&lt;/CODE&gt;-ary relationship using only binary relations provided on elevates ''the relationship itself'' to the level of an entity.

 ;; Henry VIII and his wives, using a 7-ary relation
 hadAsWives(HenryVIIIofEngland,CatherineOfAragon,AnneBoleyn,JaneSeymour,AnneOfCleves,CatherineHoward,CatherineParr)
 
 ;; gets away with just binary relations
 memberOf(TheWivesOfHenryVIII,CatherineOfAragon)
 memberOf(TheWivesOfHenryVIII,AnneBoleyn)
 memberOf(TheWivesOfHenryVIII,JaneSeymour)
 memberOf(TheWivesOfHenryVIII,AnneOfCleves)
 memberOf(TheWivesOfHenryVIII,CatherineHoward)
 memberOf(TheWivesOfHenryVIII,CatherineParr)

This approach is sometimes called &quot;Davidsonian Representation&quot; after philosopher [[wikipedia:Donald_Davidson|Donald Davidson]], an issue we will discuss in more detail later. Of course, one might have tried the following, but that does not capture the commonality that these ladies (somewhat inadvertantly) shared in quite the same way:

 ;; uses a another binary relations
 spouses(HenryVIII,CatherineOfAragon)
 spouses(HenryVIII,AnneBoleyn)
 spouses(HenryVIII,JaneSeymour)
 spouses(HenryVIII,AnneOfCleves)
 spouses(HenryVIII,CatherineHoward)
 spouses(HenryVIII,CatherineParr)

For it would not allow us to attribute any information to the relation as such:

 ;; this is only possible by making the relationship itself an entity
 nameOfTopic(TheWivesOfHenryVIII,&quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;)
 themeOfTVShow(TheWivesOfHenryVIII,TheSixWivesOfHenryVIII-PBSSpecial)

==== Types of Relations ====

Now that we have seen a couple of relations, it is clear that they come in rather different flavors. Let's put some really different kinds and discuss what makes their differences:

 ;; some place information -- true though maybe not a deep insight
 locationOf(Trier-RomanCity,Germany)  
 locationOf(Trier-RomanCity,Trier-RomanCity)

Relations like &lt;CODE&gt;locationOf&lt;/CODE&gt; are called ''reflexive''; they have the property that they also (usually trivially) relate the first argument to itself. Not surprisingly, reflexive relations are always binary (what's the point in relating a thing to itself more than once?).

 ;; a bit of dynastic knowledge
 childOf(HenryVIII,HenryVII)
 childOf(MaryI,HenryVIII) 

These dynastic relations are the opposite of reflexive, they are ''irreflexive''. 
 
 ;; more generally speaking
 descendant(HenryVIII,HenryVII)
 descendant(MaryI,HenryVIII) 

With this example, the interesting property of the relation is that &amp;mdash; without explicitly saying it &amp;mdash; we know that Queen Mary I is also a descendant of king Henry VII (he is after all her grandfather). Such relations are called ''transitive'', which means that the property that they are conveying can be transferred from one entity to another via an intermediary that they share relationship with. &lt;CODE&gt;childOf&lt;/CODE&gt; for example is not transitive, or more technically ''intransitive''.

 ;; more dynastic details
 spouses(HenryVIII,CatherineParr)
 
The relation &lt;CODE&gt;spouses&lt;/CODE&gt; is interestingly different from the other relations in that the argument order conveys no information. Such relations are called ''symmetric'' and that just means that one can write the arguments in either order without changing what one is saying. This is definitely not true for &lt;CODE&gt;childOf&lt;/CODE&gt; or &lt;CODE&gt;parentOf&lt;/CODE&gt; &amp;mdash; here the argument order is critical.

Interestingly, there is a small group of relations that combine these three features &amp;mdash; reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity &amp;mdash;  and these are called ''equivalence'' relations &amp;mdash; possibly because &lt;CODE&gt;equals&lt;/CODE&gt; is a classic example for one of these relations. 

The features that type relations are not restricted to considering the relation alone; one can also identify features that relate two relations to each other. 

 ;; another dynastic variation
 husbandOf(HenryVIII,CatherineParr)
 wifeOf(CatherineParr,HenryVIII)

This asymmetric variation on the marriage information is interesting because these two relations convey opposite views of the same information. We call such relations ''inverses'' of each other, because one needs to invert the argument position of the entities to say the same thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why a Marinette - The Forum's boat owners speak out.  http://www.marinetteboat.com/forum
[http://www.marinetteboat.com/forum]
The bad, the good and the ugly. 

I am assuming either you own a Marinette or are looking to buy one. 

From Fred 

I'm going to go out on a limb (I use to really catch hell on the Catalina 30 forum every time I criticized anything about the boat) and say if I had the money I'd trade my Marinette in for a fiberglass fast trawler in a heartbeat. It's not that I don't like the Marinette, but it has some characteristics that I'm not wild about: 

1) Trilux bottom paint (and all others safe for use on aluminum) sucks. I would give anything to be able to use VC17 on the bottom of the Marinette. A quick rinse and wipe with a scotchbrite pad and freshwater, let it dry and you're ready to paint (no sanding ever), dry time between coats less than 5 min instead of 12hrs, can paint in the fall and launch in the spring without losing effectiveness, and can paint 10 minutes before launch to touch up those areas under the boat stand pads, plus you get a little bit more boat speed compared to ablative paints - what's not to like? 

2) Compared to my sailboats the Marinette is not nearly as seaworthy. I'd never even consider taking the Marinette out in conditions even half as severe as what I didn't think twice about going out in my sailboat. Heavier (i.e. fiberglass) powerboats with a deep vee hull that I've been in, while still not as good in heavy weather as my sailboats have been, are noticeably better than my Marinette. It's without a doubt the worst handling boat I've been on or operated when it comes to rough water operation. Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying that its not seaworthy at all - just that I'm not impressed with its handling characteristics compared to other boats I've had experience with, and I pick my weather windows with far more care when cruising. 

3) Fuel economy on planing boats is awful compared to sailboats and trawlers. While Marinette's are better than fiberglass boats of the same size that's still not saying much. 

4) Fiberglass is easier to work with than aluminum (at least for me). Getting paint applied properly on aluminum is even more of an ordeal than on other materials and preparation is critical. 

That said, there are a lot of good things about these aluminum boats which is why I bought mine: 

1) They tend be priced a bit lower compared to fiberglass boats that I was considering at the time. 

2) No worries about core rot, blisters, etc. After having to recore the cockpit floor in one of my sailboats because some moron installed some hardware years earlier without caulking the mounting bolts, this is a feature that I really, really appreciate. 

3) A bit cheaper on gas because of the lighter weight and less vee in the hull compared to fiberglass planing hulls. 

4) Easy to work on as most things are accessible directly or by removing screwed on panels, which is a real blessing for those that do most maintenance themselves. I really don't get why most boat builders feel the need to install things in such a way that they are nearly impossible to service later. 

5) My Marinette is a far more spacious and comfortable boat for dockside living and cruising than any of my sailboats have been, although I don't have nearly as much storage space compared to my last 30' sailboat, but the storage space I do have is more easily accessed, e.g. you don't have to dig into lockers stuffed behind settee seat backs. 

6) My cruising speed of 18-20mph is wonderful when cruising. I no longer need a minimum 4 hour weather window to get from one port to another on Lk MI. On our cruise to Frankfort, MI this summer we encountered 6-8 ft very steep waves one morning. By 4 in the afternoon the waves had decreased to about 2 foot and by 5:30 we were two ports further down the lake. In a sailboat or trawler we would have lost the entire day. Plus the extra cruising speed extends my range considerably. Unfortunately with today's fuel prices I think twice (or more) before actually traveling the extra distance. 

7) The Marinette is built like a tank - its almost inconceivable that you could damage the hull beyond repair. We hit rocks in Lake Huron at the end of our first day with my Marinette in the thickest fog I've ever seen (first time I've ever seen fog combined with a thunderstorm). Both props and shafts were bent but had no damage to the hull. 

Fred

Other Comments : 

Fred: I agree with virtually every one of your points. 

From Fast Jeff 

Here's a few comments of my own:

Copper-based AF paints are in the bull's eye of environmentalists, so Trilux type paints may be the only ones avaialble in the future.  (That's good for us, for the price will come down.)

On rough sea keeping: My 1985 (28 foot) Bayliner (deep vee) handled rough water better, but removal of the flybridge did help.  The shallow draft and lightness of a 32 footer makes for a tippy boat in the big ones.  The 37 footers (like Louis') and larger handle much better.

On maintenance access:  I curse a blue streak anytime I have to work on the outside sides of the engine--God help me when the manifolds need replacing! But at least you can get ot things. On the old Bayliner (again) a Sawzall would be required to change out the fuel tank--it's stuck under the aft cabin! (What were they thinking?)

On spaciousness: A winner hands down when it comes to live-aboard space (and windows! I wouldn't own one of those plastic boat &quot;caves&quot;.)

Gas mileage--a real concern to all of us--is definitely better on a big M.   Been keeping an eye on what MPG newer boats get, and ours win hands down for an inboard.  Plastic boats with I/Os, and with dual props, are a bit better in many cases, though.

From phflaw
All are welcome. (Hell, even lawyers) 

I, for one would not trade my boat for anything other than a bigger Marinette. We use our 32' sedan bridge as a sort of floating summer cottage. Life seems to slow down when I've got my family with me on the boat. I've owned wooden, fiberglass and now aluminum boats and I'm sold on aluminum. My next boat will be a 37' or 39' aft cabin Marinette.

From Sick Leave 

I have a twin 28 footer only regret is wishing I had the 32 footer. I have so much time and energy in this one not sure I want to buy a 32 and start over. Almost bought 32 last fall from some one near here but could not get a commitment for bigger well at marina where I am. Did not want to change Marinas and still do not, the costs are cheaper in current marina.

From Yoobertube

Most of the comments you will get are about the 28' and 32'. These are great lightweight planning hull boats. 37' and 41' are very much larger and better in rougher conditions. All are very tough. 

From GB49 

To Hunter, 

Good move on thinking about Marinette. They are the most affordable, livable and seaworthy boat on the market, IMO.
My 3rd summer living aboard my 32 sedan is coming to an end and every year it’s a painful departure. I wish I could keep her in the water year round...but in a warmer climate. If you do get a Marinette I can tell from reading your history you will become attached to her in no time. I don’t know what the heck I'd be doing now if there was no boat in my life.
I would never trade my 32' for an equal size plastic boat. Partly because most 32' plastic boats don’t come close to offering the space a Marinette does and partly because of the fuel economy. Yes, you may trade a little comfort in foul weather for less weight and shallow draft but physics is physics and I have yet to hear of any Marinettes rolling over because they are &quot;top heavy&quot;. They can take a lickin and keep on tickin. 

Welcome to the forum,
Karl

More from GB

Fred, 

All valid points, but..
1) Bottom paint on any boat sucks. Until the day someone designs a boat rotisserie device like they use when rebuilding cars, applying bottom paint will always be a pain in the neck, butt, elbows, and knees. 

2) Sailboats to Power Boats are apples to oranges. Completely different hull characteristics and capabilities. 

3) Fuel econ, again apples to oranges. 

4) Fiberglass (FRP) is easier to work w/ but Aluminum you at least you have something work with if you happen to pile up on reef or ram into a lighted channel buoy at cruising speed and make it back home w/ no assistance. (Yes, someone I know did this w/ a 32’ sedan) Al has much better tensile qualities. 

Yes, Marinette has its share of foibles, but the fact that you can find 70s and 80s Marinettes in the classifieds of many boat magazines, most (some, ed)  of which I admit are in crap condition, but none the less are still in operational existence says it all. I don’t see many fiberglass boats of similar type from those years advertised anywhere.

From John Althouse

Info on Aluminum alloys used on Marinette's. 
The hull, deck and superstructure plating is 5086 aluminum (5086 was developed for salt water use, it can be used for both fresh and salt water applications) 

The extrusions on the boats are 6061 aluminum. Extrusions are anything other than flat plate, such as angles, flat bars, tubes, the air foil shapes used for the legs on the shaft struts, the keel and sheer extrusions, etc. 

5086 is difficult alloy to extrude, which is why 6061 is used. 

These two alloys were used together on all of the boats from the beginning in the early 50's. 

The filler metal to join the two alloys is 5356 alloy wire. 

All 5000 series alloys are not created equal, unlike 5086, 5052 alloy should only be used in fresh water, in salt water it will rapidly deteriorate. Many small aluminum boats and aluminum houseboats are made with 5052 and generally do not last long when left in salt water environments. 

A quick note on the history of the original company. In 1990 the airport in Louisville (where the boats were built from 1953 to 1990) was expanding and terminated the lease on the buildings that Aluminum Cruisers was using. The company had to move. Instead of moving, the company was sold to a frp (fiberglass) houseboat manufacturer in TN. While the new owners built a few Marinette (4-6), they never got a production line going again. Shortly after the purchase they became extremely busy with there houseboats as a result of the luxury tax killing the cruiser market and boosting the houseboat market. 

In 1996 the assets and manufacturing rights were sold at auction and a few months later I purchased everything.

From Joe JOE3656 (Marinette Forum Author)

I love the Marinette, but unlike some I upsized early (selling my 28 ft for a 37ft). A Marinette tends to be someone's second or third boat. The 37ft is far more stable.  I numbered the biggies on the negatives. 

See our aluminum page on this site. 

Aluminum and Metals

Negatives - #1 - The moronic use of the damn Goo that was used in the bilge. Bilges should be &quot;painted&quot; grey or white with epoxy or zinc chromate paint to see oil leaks and to protect the hull. You must keep the bilge clean of dropped metal parts. (Water is fine). #2 A seahorse in tutu logo. #3 You have to keep the wiring and corrosion system in shape. Keep power from going into the hull - bilge, keep the galvanic isolator in shape, and pay attention to the CAPAC meter. Dropped a penny or bolt into the bilge - go find it. #4 This boat's life span works against it in resale. It exceeds the NADA age curve, so there are a lot of them on ebay to compete with when you sell. Lot's of very good 60's 70's and 80's boats to buy lowers the resale value. (Good to buy, bad to sell). 

Trivial Negatives: Shallow draft - It's a river and lake boat, that needs modification for deep water (windows and cockpit  mostly). Generally undervalued - The long life of  Marinettes make them lower in resale value due to the comparison with similarly aged FRP boats. The quality is not well known. Some owners won't understand about what to put against aluminum (Stainless screws into the hull are a no-no), so you may have to fix some one else's fix. Antifouling paint is more expensive. You have to put anodes on the hull. Sedans and expresses - the plywood - Nautolex cockpit deck was OK for it's time, but damn, it could be better. Noise - Aluminum is noisier with wave slap and engines. You may have to insulate some of it.  Smaller Marinettes are light enough to bob. The original stainless railing attachment is just a corrosion pain. You have to pull these off and rebed them on most Marinettes with 3M 4200 and proper gaskets. Painting requires the right self-etching primer. 

Some parts of the appointment of a Marinette (the exterior plywood-Nautolex deck, carpet and some fiberboard interior panels) are of less quality than I'd like. These are generally upgraded by smart owners.  When possible - use teak or solid panels (King Starboard), or aluminum plate panels to replace parts and see our pages on deck replacement alternatives (plasteak, aluminum plating, et al). Think white or plate aluminum outside as nice looking brown or grey colors are burn your foot &quot;hot&quot; underfoot. The deck railing fittings should have been welded aluminum. 

Myths and half truths about Aluminum : There are myths about seawater corrosion which is not a problem with this boat, if basic common sense rules are used. You'll replace steel parts, the stainless steel rudders and the engines, but not likely the hull. (BTW Marinette Marine did not make the Marinettes, Aluminum Cruisers did.) You will have heard that aluminum fuel tanks made of Al (especially 60XX or 5052 series) do fail if improperly installed, but it's not the same issue. In FRP boats with Al tanks.  the foamed in aluminum tanks form a battery effect as the foam breaks down over time, acidifies and entraps moisture. This is not the case of this boat. Al tanks should be 5083 or 5086, not 5052. 

Myth: What you heard about on the Foaming of AL tanks. 

Foaming in any metal substance is a bad idea. All plastics permit some water to permeate them and foam allows water to pass through. The tank must be separated and have vented aeration. Even worse is stainless in Foam which suffers from in low oxygen dampness.  See http://www.yachtsurvey.com/fueltank.htm. The correct way is to paint the tank with zinc chromate or epoxy and use 3M 4200 or 5200 adhesive on the mount points as bedding compound. If you found that hard?... read at http://www.yachtsurvey.com David Pascoe's site about permanently fixing a blistered FRP hull. 

Myth : DC current (electrolysis) and Hulls 

In all cases, fiberglass, steel, plastic or aluminum, a bilge with DC power is in trouble. Yes, Aluminum is more susceptible, but bronze through hulls, out drives, rudders and shafts are also susceptible with the same problem. It takes a couple of days to weeks to destroy a through hull (See the 3 days it took for DC to eat a fitting at  http://webconsult.web.aplus.net/boating/pages/stray_AC_versus_DC.html), and also check the Quicksilver article at BoatUS  http://www.boatus.com/boattech/MarineCorrosion.htm article. It does not matter what type of boat it is, ensure live power does not get into the bilge. Pull any recreational boat periodically to check anodes, or install an impressed current system. Isolated bronze through hulls are not a problem, (but don't connect them together or to the hull). If the bronze is pinkish tinged, replace the fitting. 

Try Googling for Marinette Aluminum Hull failure and then google fiberglass FRP hull failure. A bit anecdotal evidence, but insightful. All Marinettes are generally protected by Zinc Chromate or Epoxy-based hull paint. Most Owners use 3M brand 4200 as a bedding compound. 

Forum Poll : What metal failed last on your Marinette boat? Steel - Rust/crack 9 votes (45%) Stainless Steel 6 votes (30%) Aluminum 3 votes (15%) Bronze 1 votes (5%) Brass 1 votes (5%) 

By the way:  For me, stainless failed at the rudder post. (Oxygen starvation corroded it). I am also going to have to replace steering cables (Steel). Chances are the bronze through hulls need to be checked or replaced. 

We asked - 2 of the members with aluminum used a $10-20 fix to patch a spot. 

[[Category:Positives]]

Positives - Cost - I've been able to spend less and get more. Oh my yes, A Marinette is the safest old boat to buy and fix up. (But get a survey.) You can get Chrysler engine parts and rebuilding a Chrysler or Crusader is cheap. Nothing that can't be replaced, rots out. No balsa or plywood strings. Keep the Chrylser engine, they are cheap to repower and rebuild.

Lifespan - these are 30+ year boats. They last. No bad years - though the Buick engines are a negative on early 60's boats. 

Owner and forum support - lots of people own these and the forum and Marinette company can support you on advice, parts and projects. It's a big positive not to be in an orphaned boat. Plus a lot of company sill make aluminum boats and their support is available. 

Price - Marinettes are deeply underrated on value by NADA, which makes them a bargain to buy. Really a bargain. 

Space - Huge interior space compared to most boats, well appointed. The beam of the boat gives lot's of space.

Cool deck - The deck stays cool in summer due to heat loss from the aluminum. 

Quality - The boat hull will not get old, blister or fail. General quality of construction is high, mostly solid teak or teak plywood interior and tank-like welded plate aluminum construction. It's a very good choice as a used boat and very fixable. You can fix almost any Marinette. 

Good in salt water - many are on the Chesapeake Bay. 

Safe - Very log and rock resistant for rivers and lakes with lots of floating logs. You will hit a log sooner or later in many rivers. 

Shallow draft - key to navigating some areas of water. Rivers, canals, bays (Cheasapeake and Florida are big areas for the Marinettes), and lakes with logs and shallows are a great spot for the boat. (And this is more a positive than a negative in the silting in of US lakes and rivers. 

Customizable - Owners add, lengthen, and remove parts. 

Surveyors like them - generally they can pass a survey. A surveyor can yea or nay a Marinette easy. (No weird moisture in the hull. Boating insurance companies like them. 

Welded not riveted - Long lasting monocoque hull instead of sectioned rivets. 

Seawater is OK- when properly painted and zinced, the boat will not fail in salt water (Coast guard boats are unpainted aluminum). 

Speed - It's fast for a cruiser. It's light and fast. 

No &quot;monkey arms&quot; required - most things can be reached to be fixed. The &quot;monkey arms&quot; issue is an important safety issue in a boat, as what I can't see or reach can sink me.  

No wood  in the hull not even glassed in plywood - won't rot. 

My family likes it - which means I can own this boat. 

Looks - Good classic boat-y look. 

Mounting - I can attach things anywhere, not just at mount points.

Every Marinette owner I know, paints their boat. Top and bottom.  Most prefer epoxy as a barrier coat while some use zinc chromate paint for barrier and patches. I last used Interlux 2000E with 5+ years and no problems. 

Must Read: Truths about all boats 

The most important question in owning a Marinette applies to all boats - Are you and your family ready to own a boat? Is the boat right for you and the waters in which you will boat?  A boat is like a car, you have to take care of it, and pay the costs on maintenance. Boats need repair and maintenance. Leave a car in the driveway for 1/2 a year and watch it deteriorate. 

Quality is important in boats and cars. There are cars that age faster than others and cars that last a long time. A older used good car is better than a newer used poor quality car (Compare a 1980 Volvo with a 1990 Yugo). This is even more true in boats. Today we see the warranty (5-10 years) on the hull of some large fiberglass (FRP) boats is less than any possible payoff time. Why pay 200K+ for a 32+ ft boat whose hull and interior won't last 20 years? Whether aluminum or FRP, there are good and poor quality boats. If you decide on fiberglass, please read David Pascoe's articles on fiberglass boats and hull defects (go to the forum's links page). Moreover, consider carefully buying any FRP boat that will or did stay long term in the water with a foam or balsa cored bottom (non-trailerable) or foam core. If you decide on a metal boat, see this site, our forum www.marinetteboat.com/forum , Marinette, Inc , the Metal Boat Society and Michael Kasten's web page. 

Expect to pay thousands of dollars in maintenance and parts on any boat of any size. It's the way it is. Do not buy any boat you can't afford costs and time for. If you are afraid of the expense, you cannot really own a boat. 

Truth is, the most likely reason for a boat to sink is the through hulls, cooling, bellows failure, and the hoses. Maintain them, replace plastic with Marelon (Forespar), and check them often. Plastic through hulls are a  hazard. Close the ones you don't need. Replace or repair your bilge pumps every 2 years, as a Rule, most of them are of poor quality. Pull the boat out at least every three years, as four years in the water is too long a time for my comfort.  Mine comes out every winter, as my marina has no one to watch it over the winter here. Visit the boat. Boats in the water need power for the bilge (a reliable self bailing boat is a myth). 

Decide how much of a project boat you are prepared for and always get a survey. Divide the time you expect to work on a boat by two. Buy a boat for the way you will be boating. Make sure you have a place for any boat and a place that will haul it out for maintenance. A boat's beam may be wider than your marina has a slip for.  Hint: Most wives insist on a head.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|From|De|review-id=french-from}} ==
&lt;div id='french-from'&gt;
The preposition {{French/Word|de|IPA=/də/|approx=duh|audio=Fr-de.ogg}} means ''from'':
: {{French/Word|Il est de Paris.|en=He is from Paris.}}

''De'' becomes ''d''' before a vowel, due to elision:
: {{French/Word|Nous sommes d'Orléans.|en=We are from Orléans.}}

The definite article is included with countries:
: {{French/Word|Vous êtes de la Suisse ?|en=Are you from Switzerland?}}

The contraction {{French/Word|du|IPA=/dy/|approx=dew|audio=Fr-du.ogg}} is used in place of ''de le'': &lt;!-- audio doesn't sound right --&gt;
: {{French/Word|Elles sont du Luxembourg.|en=They are from Luxembourg.}}

Likewise, the contraction {{French/Word|des|IPA=/dɛ/|approx=deh|audio=Fr-des.ogg}} is used in place of ''de les'':
: {{French/Word|Nous sommes des Pays-Bas.|en=We are from the Netherlands.}}

''De'' also has other translations, which depend on context. For example, it is used to indicate an amount:
: {{French/Word|5 kilos de pommes|en=5 kilograms of apples}}
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-from --&gt;

=== Usage ===
Possessive adjectives are used to express possession of an object:
: {{French/Word|C'est mon passeport.|en=It's my passport.}}

In English the possessive adjective agrees with the subject (''his sister'', ''her brother''). But in French, possessive adjectives act like all other adjectives: they must agree with the noun they modify.

{| {{French/Table|audio=French/Grammar/Possesive adjective usage.ogg|columns=4}}
! colspan=2 | Masculine noun&lt;br /&gt;le frère
! colspan=2 | Feminine noun&lt;br /&gt;la sœur
|-
| le frère de Marc&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marc's brother}} || '''son''' frère&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|his brother}}
| la sœur de Marc&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marc's sister}} || '''sa''' sœur&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|his sister}}
|-
| les frères de Marc&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marc's brothers}} || '''ses''' frères&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|his brothers}}
| les sœurs de Marc&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marc's sisters}} || '''ses''' sœurs&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|his sisters}}
|-
| le frère de Marie&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marie's brother}} || '''son''' frère&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|her brother}}
| la sœur de Marie&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marie's sister}} || '''sa''' sœur&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|her sister}}
|-
| les frères de Marie&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marie's brothers}} || '''ses''' frères&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|her brothers}}
| les sœurs de Marie&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marie's sisters}} || '''ses''' sœurs&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|her sisters}}
|}

Whether ''son'', ''sa'' and ''ses'' translate to ''his'' or ''her'' is indicated by context:
: {{French/Word|Oui, elle a son billet.|en=Yes, she has her ticket.}}

''Notre'', ''votre'', and ''leur'' modify singular nouns, regardless of gender; ''nos'', ''vos'', and ''leurs'' modify plural nouns:
: ''le chalet'' {{French/Section|(m)}}: {{French/Word|C'est notre chalet.|en=It's our chalet.}}
: ''la caravane'': {{French/Word|C'est notre caravane.|en=It's our caravan.}}

{{sectstub}} &lt;!-- add examples and other meanings from [[wikt:fr:rendre]] --&gt;

{{French/Word|Visiter|IPA=/vizite/|audio=Fr-visiter.ogg}}, meaning ''to visit'', is used for places (and not for people) :
: {{French/Word|Tu dois visiter Paris un jour.|en=You must visit Paris one day.}}
: {{French/Word|Je vais visiter mon frère.}} is not a correct sentence in french. It's a common (but understanble) mistake made by foreign people.

{{French/Word|Rendre|IPA=/ʁɑ̃dʁ/|audio=Fr-rendre.ogg}} or {{French/Word|rendre visite (à)|IPA=/ʁɑ̃dʁ vi.zit/}}, meaning ''to pay a visit (to)'', is used for people:
: {{French/Word|Je rends visite à mon père à Paris.|en=I'm visiting my father in Paris.}}
: {{French/Word|Amour viens rendre à mon âme.|en=Love comes to pay a visit to my soul.}}

{{French/Word|Rendre}} has other meanings, such as ''to produce'', ''to express'', ''to make'', and ''to give back'':
: {{French/Word|Tu me rends malade.|en=You make me ill.}}

=== Sentences placement ===
Most adjectives come after the noun they modify in French:
: {{French/Word|un homme intelligent|en=an intelligent man}}
: {{French/Word|des hommes intelligents|en=intelligent men}}

''Beau'', ''nouveau'', and ''vieux'', as well as some other common French adjectives, precede the noun:
: {{French/Word|une jolie voiture|en=a pretty car}}

''Des'' is replaced with ''de'' when an adjective comes before the noun:
: {{French/Word|de jolies voitures|en=pretty cars}}

In informal speech, ''des'' is often used in place of ''de''.

The Mexican dish picadillo is a popular filling for tacos.

==Ingredients==

*1 to 1 1/2 lbs (450g to 625g) of ground beef
*1 large yellow onion, chopped
*4 cloves of garlic, chopped
*2 14 1/2-ounce beef broth
*1 large green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and chopped
*3 large russet potato, cubed bite-sized
*1 14 1/2-ounce can diced tomatoes in juice
*2 tbsp of oil
*1/8 tsp. salt 
*1 teaspoon chili powder
*Black pepper, cumin, oregano and garlic powder to taste (about 2-2 1/2 tablespoons total)

==Procedure==
#In a large, heavy pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Dump onions, garlic, bell pepper and seasonings into heated oil.
#When the bell pepper starts to discolor, add to it ground beef, stirring to break up large pieces and brown evenly, about 7 minutes. 
#As meat is browning, add potato, beef broth and diced tomatoes. 
Simmer until picadillo thickens, stirring occasionally.

Serve hot with Spanish rice and tortilla.
Makes 6 servings.</text>

== {{French/Section|Grammar|''-enir'' verbs}} ==

''-enir'' verbs are irregularly conjugated (they are not treated as regular ''-ir'' verbs).

=== {{French/Section||To come|Venir}} ===
The most common ''-enir'' verb is ''venir'', meaning ''to come''.

When ''venir'' is used with the preposition ''de'', it means ''to come from'' or ''to be from'':
: ''Ces pommes viennent de l'Espagne.''  {{French/Section|(''These apples come from Spain.'')}}

When ''venir de'' is used with a verb, it states that you have recently accomplished an action.
: ''Je viens de me réveiller.'' {{French/Section|(''I have just got up.'')}}

=== Formation ===
In the present indicative, ''venir'' (and all other ''-enir'' verbs) is conjugated as follows:
{| class=wikitable
!'''venir {{fr/IPA|/vǝ.niʁ/ (''vuh-neer'')|audio=Fr-venir.ogg}} !! to come'''
|-
|je viens {{fr/IPA|/vjɛ̃/ (''vy&lt;sup&gt;uh&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} || I come

Canadian and Belgian French has an off-by-one behavior with meals : breakfast is called ''d&amp;eacute;jeuner'', lunch is called ''d&amp;icirc;ner'' and dinner is ''souper''.

# French butchers do not sell pork, pork products, nor horsemeat. For these products, go to a '''''charcuterie'''''.
# In France, bakeries only sell fresh bread. Places where they sell bread that is not fresh are called '''''dépôt de pain'''''.
# ''''''Charcuteries'''''' sell things besides pork products, including pâte, salami, cold meats, salads, quiches and pizzas.
# An alternative to an ''''''épicerie'''''' is an '''''alimentation générale''''' (a general foodstore).

== {{French/Section|Grammar|To want and to be able to|Vouloir et pouvoir}}==

=== Vouloir ===

The verb ''vouloir'', meaning ''to want'', is irregularly conjugated (it is not a regular ''-ir'' verb).
{| class=wikitable
!'''vouloir {{fr/IPA|/vu.lwaʁ/ (''voo-lwahr'')|audio=Fr-vouloir.ogg}} !! to want'''
|-
|je veux {{fr/IPA|/vø/ (''vew'')}} || I want
|-
|tu veux  {{fr/IPA|/vø/ (''vew'')}} || you want
|-
|il veut {{fr/IPA|/vø/ (''vew'')}} || he wants
|-
|nous voulons {{fr/IPA|/vu.lɔ̃/ (''voo-loh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} || we want
|-
|vous voulez {{fr/IPA|/vu.le/ (''voo-lay'')}} || you want
|-
|ils veulent {{fr/IPA|/vøl/ (''vewl'')}} || they want
|-
|voulu {{fr/IPA|/vu.ly/ (''voo-lew'')}} || wanted
|}

The related phrase {{French/Word|vouloir dire|IPA=/vu.lwaʁ diʁ/|audio=Fr-vouloir dire.ogg}} means ''to mean''. The idiom {{French/Word|en vouloir|IPA=/ɑ̃ vu.lwaʁ/}} means ''to be angry {{French/Section|(with)}}''.

=== Pouvoir ===

''Pouvoir'', meaning ''to be able to'', is conjugated similarly to ''vouloir''.
{| class=wikitable
!'''pouvoir {{fr/IPA|/pu.vwaʁ/ (''poo-vwahr'')|audio=Fr-pouvoir.ogg}} !! to be able to'''
|-
|je peux {{fr/IPA|/pø/ (''pew'')}} || I am able to
|-
|tu peux {{fr/IPA|/pø/ (''pew'')}} || you are able to
|-
|il peut {{fr/IPA|/pø/ (''pew'')}} || he is able to
|-
|nous pouvons {{fr/IPA|pu.vɔ̃/ (''poo-voh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} || we are able to
|-
|vous pouvez {{fr/IPA|/pu.ve/ (''poo-vay'')}} || you are able to
|-
|ils peuvent {{fr/IPA|/pøv/ (''pewv'')}} || they are able to
|-
|pu {{fr/IPA|/py/ (''pew'')}} || been able to
|}

The noun ''le pouvoir'' means ''power'' or ''authority'', and the term ''au pouvoir'' means ''in power''. The adverb {{French/Word|peut-être|IPA=/pø.tɛtʁ/|audio=Fr-peut-être.ogg}}, literally translated as ''could be'', means ''maybe'' or ''perhaps''.

|}

=== {{French/Section|Usage notes|''Pouvoir''|supplementary-id=french-pouvoir}} ===
&lt;div id='french-pouvoir'&gt;
''Pouvoir'' is not used with verbs relating to the five senses:
: ''I can see you.'' - ''Je te vois.'' (not ''Je peux te voir.'', which is ''I can '''meet''' you.'')

''Pouvoir'' is not used to mean ''can'' in the sense of ''to know how to''.  Use ''savoir'' instead.
: ''I can swim.'' - ''Je sais nager.'' (not ''Je peux nager.'')

In Belgian French, ''pouvoir'' is additionally not used to say someone is capable of something, ''savoir'' is also used for that.
: ''Je ne sais pas dormir.'' - ''I am not able to sleep.'' to a Belgian, ''I do not know how to sleep.'' to a Frenchman.
: ''Je ne peux pas dormir.'' - ''I am not allowed to sleep.'' to a Belgian, ''I am not able to sleep.'' to a Frenchman.

''Puis'' is the first person present indicative form used in inversion and as an archaic variant.

      <comment>Robot: Cosmetic changes</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Music after the Romantic era experienced a great deal of experimentation and change as many of the old methods that had formed the basis of classical music for centuries were challenged. Tonality, for example, was discarded entirely by many composers in the 20th century. Notably, a number of distinct movements in classical music developed as well.

== Impressionism ==
Impressionism is the name given to a movement in painting that emerged primarily in France during the latter part of the 19th Century. It featured visual renderings that were intended more for decoration than as records of the precise appearance of people or objects. 


The invention of photography provided a faster, cheaper means of recording appearances. Impressionism, instead, was a visual means of recording supposed &quot;impressions&quot; of the subject matter--emphasizing selected features while minimizing others. In practical terms, impressionistic effects were achieved by (1) reducing the detail in a picture, (2) eliminating subtle color mixtures, and (3) exaggerating proportions and perspective to convey motion or lassitude.


The composer Debussy is said to have resisted the comparisons of his music to the paintings of the Impressionists, but the vague melodic and harmonic structures of works such as &quot;L'après-midi d'une faune&quot;, &quot;Syrinx&quot; (for Solo Flute) and &quot;Nuages&quot; seem to be in much the same spirit as the blurred, sensuous visual images of the painters with whom he would have been familiar.


Again in practical terms, Debussy was able to differentiate his compositions from what had come before by deliberately writing music that was contrary to the norms that he and every other young composer were taught at the Conservatoire. He abandoned the major and minor scales for other combinations of pitches. He also abandoned 7-note scales for groupings of five notes (pentatonic scales) and six notes (whole-tone scales).


Debussy frequently based his harmonies on so-called &quot;parallel fifths.&quot; These were produced by simultaneous melodies that were always exactly seven semitones apart, and they were strictly forbidden by the common practice taught at the time.


Debussy's experiments with new ways of organizing music would not have been nearly as successful if he had not possessed true genius. Even his most vigorous critics were compelled to acknowledge his substantial talent.


He continued to exploit this style of music from 1891, when he introduced &quot;L'après-midi d'une faun&quot; until his death in 1917. He made such thorough and brilliant use of the &quot;impressionist&quot; techniques that other composers were hard pressed to successfully follow his lead.


Other notable composers who are usually categorized as impressionists include Maurice Ravel and the American composer Charles Tomlinson Griffes. In the generation that followed, Darius Milhaud, Selim Palmgren, and others were obviously influenced by Debussy's music but found their own paths by incorporating American jazz or German &quot;expressionist&quot; elements.

== Atonality ==

Atonal music is characterized by the absence of a key or tonal center.

== Serialism ==
Serialism, in its purest form, is a style of music in which each tone in the twelve note chromatic scale is used exactly once in succession until all twelve are used, at which time the cycle may be repeated using the same series of notes or a similar series derived from the original. The twelve note series is sometimes referred to as a &quot;tone row&quot;. From this initial row of tones, a matrix can be calculated by inverting the intervals of the row to form a column descending from the first note of the row and then creating new rows by transcribing the intervals of the original row beginning on each of the tones of the inversion. By aligning these rows and columns in a twelve by twelve grid, one derives a total of 48 variations of the row by beginning at any point on the outside of the grid and proceeding vertically or horizontally, as the case may be. A tone row from left to right is referred to as &quot;prime&quot; as it is the initial set of intervals. A column from top to bottom is referred to as an inversion. From right to left is called &quot;retrograde&quot;. Consequently, from bottom to top is &quot;retrograde inversion&quot;. Any one of these 48 rows may be used but only one row is typically used per part at any given time. However, two parts playing simultaneously - voice and piano, for instance - can use completely separate rows at the same time. At some time after the initial development of serialism composers began using &quot;subsets&quot;, or fragments of a row repeated. This allowed freedom to create compositions that were more pleasing to the traditional ear. 

This style of composition was initially developed in Austria by Arnold Schoenberg, and was further developed by students of his, including Anton Webern and Alban Berg.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Pronominal verbs}} ==
Pronominal verbs are verbs that include pronouns. These pronouns are ''me'', ''te'', ''se'', ''nous'', and ''vous'' and are used as either direct objects or indirect objects, depending on the verb that they modify. There are three types of pronominal verbs: reflexive verbs, reciprocal verbs, and naturally pronominal verbs.

=== Reflexive verbs ===
Reflexive verbs reflect the action on the subject.
: ''Je '''me''' lave.'' - ''I wash '''myself'''''.
: ''Nous '''nous''' lavons.'' - ''We wash '''ourselves'''''.
: ''Ils '''se''' lavent.'' - ''They wash '''themselves'''''.

Reflexive verbs can also be used as infinitives.
: ''Je vais me laver.'' - ''I'm going to wash myself.''
: ''Je ne vais pas me laver.'' - ''I'm not going to wash myself.''

=== Reciprocal verbs ===
With reciprocal verbs, people perform actions to each other.
: ''Nous nous aimons.'' - ''We like each other.''

=== Naturally pronominal verbs ===
Some verbs are pronominal without performing a reflexive or reciprocal action.
: ''Tu te souviens ?'' - ''You remember?''

|}

If the subject is performing the action on him or herself, the verbs are reflexive. However, if the subject were to act on someone else, the verb is no longer reflexive; instead the reflexive pronoun becomes a direct object.

: ''Je m'habille'' - ''I get {{French/Section|(myself)}} dressed.''
: ''Je t'habille'' - ''I get you dressed.''

In the ''passé composé'', the verbs use ''être'' and the participle must agree in gender and number with the subject.

: ''Pierre s'est habillé.''
: ''Alice s'est habillée.''
: ''Georges et Martin se sont habillés.''
: ''Lisette et Rose se sont habillées.''
: ''Marc et Claire se sont habillés.''
: ''Je m'appelle Lucie, et je me suis levée à six heures.''
: ''Jean et Paul, vous vous êtes levés assez tard.''

== {{French/Section|Grammar|''Devoir'', ''Falloir'', and ''avoir besoin de''}} ==

=== {{French/Section||To have need of|avoir besoin de}} ===

The word {{French/Word|le besoin|IPA=/bǝ.zwɛ̃/ (''buh-zwa&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')|audio=Fr-besoin.ogg}} means ''need'', and thus the expression {{French/Word|avoir besoin de|IPA=&lt;!-- IPA here --&gt;}} translates to ''to have need of''.

=== {{French/Section||To have to|Devoir}} ===
{| class=wikitable
!'''devoir {{fr/IPA|/dǝ.vwaʁ/ (''duh-vwahr'')|audio=Fr-devoir.ogg}} !! to have to'''
|-
|je dois {{fr/IPA|/dwa/ (''dwah'')}} || I have to

|-
|ils doivent {{fr/IPA|/dwav/ (''dwahv'')}} || they have to
|-
|du {{fr/IPA|/dy/ (''dew'')}} || had to
|}

The past participle drops the circumflex accent in its other forms: feminine singular ''due''; masculine plural ''dus''; feminine plural ''dues''.

Used as a noun, ''le devoir'' means ''duty'' or ''exercise''.

=== {{French/Section||To be necessary|Falloir}} ===

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Use of falloir.ogg}}
| falloir || {{audio|Fr-falloir.ogg|/fa.lwaʁ/ (''fah-lwahr'')}} || to be necessary

|-
| il faudra || {{audio|/fɔd.ʁa/}} || it will be necessary
|-
| il faudrait || {{audio|/fɔd.ʁɛ/}} || it would be necessary
--&gt;
|}

=== Comparison ===

The verb ''falloir'' differs from similar verbs such as ''avoir besoin de [faire quelque chose]'' (''to need [to do something]'') and {{French/Word|devoir|en=must, duty, owe}}. ''Falloir'' is always used with the impersonal ''il'' only in the third person singular, whereas ''devoir'' can be used with all subject pronouns in all tenses.  

''Falloir'' expresses '''general necessities''':
: ''To live, one must eat.''
: ''To speak French well, one must conjugate verbs correctly.''

''Devoir'' expresses more personally '''what someone must do''':
: ''I want to pass my French test, so I must study verb conjugations.''

''Avoir besoin de [faire quelque chose]'' expresses '''need''':
: ''J'ai besoin d'étudier pour mon examen, il est demain.'' - ''I need to study for my test, it's tomorrow.''

''Naître'' is the only ''-aître'' verb that takes ''être'' as its helping verb (and therefore agrees with the subject as a past participle in perfect tenses).

The verb {{fr|renaître|en=to be reborn|IPA=/ʀənɛtʀ/|audio=Fr-renaître.ogg}} is conjugated in the same way as ''naître''.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Pronominal verbs with perfect tenses}} ==
When pronominal verbs are conjugated in perfect tenses, {{fr|être}} is used as the auxiliary verb.

=== Reflexive verbs ===
In perfect tenses, the past participles agree with the direct object pronoun, but not the indirect object pronoun, in gender and plurality. Therefore it would only agree when the reflexive pronoun is the direct object. Also remember that the past participle does not agree with the direct object if it goes after the verb.

: {{fr|Elle s'est lavée.|en=She washed herself.}}
: {{fr|Nous nous sommes lavé(e)s.|en='We washed ourselves.}}
: {{fr|Elle s'est lavé les mains.|en=She washed her hands.}}
: {{fr|Nous nous sommes lavé les mains.|en=We washed our hands.}}

=== Reciprocal verbs ===
Like reflexive verbs, the past participle of reciprocal verbs agrees in number and gender with the direct object if it goes before the verb. It therefore agrees with all reciprocal pronouns that function as direct objects.

: {{fr|Nous nous sommes aimé(e)s.|en=We liked each other.}}

The reciprocal pronoun can also function as an indirect object without a direct object pronoun.

: {{fr|Nous nous sommes parlé.|en=We spoke to each other.}}
: {{fr|Elles se sont téléphoné.|en=They called one another.}}
: {{fr|Vous vous êtes écrit souvent ?|en=You wrote to each other often?}}

=== Naturally pronominal verbs ===
In perfect tenses, these verbs agree with the direct object if it goes before the verb. Otherwise, the past participle agrees with the subject.

: {{fr|Elle s'est souvenue.|en=She remembered.}}
: {{fr|Le chien s'est couché.|en=The dog lay down.}}

Note that ''assis(e)(es)'', the past participle of ''s'asseoir'' (to sit), does not change in the masculine plural form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introducing Contexts ==

Since this is a book for historians, we will mention that there is a [[Knowledge Engineering for Historians/History of Microtheories|a whole history]] of the concepts underlying the following discussions, that we will however not get into just now, because they do not contribute to an initial understanding.

The basic problem of knowledge engineering is that the logical theories that perform the actual reasoning cannot deal well with inconsistent or contradicting information (remember those exploding computers on [[wikipedia:Star Trek|Star Trek]]?). Unfortunately, the human theories that knowledge engineering models are often mutually inconsistent. 

Enter ''contexts'', which basically allow us to assign the individual statements to individual speakers. 

=== Contexts as additional Arguments ===

Speaking more as the knowledge engineers we are trying to become, we can best explain contexts by introducing a new relation: let &lt;CODE&gt;ist&lt;/CODE&gt; mean &quot;is true (in context)&quot;. 

 ;; the controversy surrounding [[wikipedia:Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart|Wolfang Amadeus Mozart]]'s relationship
 ;; with [[wikipedia:Antonio_Salieri|Antonio Salieri]] represented
 kills(AntonioSalieri,WolfgangAmadeusMozart)
 not(kills(AntonioSalieri,WolfgangAmadeusMozart))

 ;; contextualizing the claims via ist
 ist(Amadeus-TheMovie,kills(AntonioSalieri,WolfgangAmadeusMozart))
 ist(Austria18thCenturyContext,not(kills(AntonioSalieri,WolfgangAmadeusMozart)))

While the first representation will clearly cause a contradiction, the second need not; indeed, the claims are nicely segregated into the different contexts. However, contextualization is an all-or-nothing proposition; either every statement is &quot;curried&quot; with a context, or none are. Typically, this situation is handled by identifying a base or default context where those things that are not sensibly contextualizable (i.e. shared by all contexts) can be placed.  

=== Context Hierarchies ===

Contexts can be organized into subsumption hierarchies, just as we [[Knowledge Engineering for Historians/Primer_Additional_Infrastructure|saw]] that type hierarchies can be. 

Some of the background knowledge that our two contexts, &lt;CODE&gt;Amadeus-TheMovie&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;Austria18thCenturyContext&lt;/CODE&gt;, share could now be moved into a parent context, say, &lt;CODE&gt;GenericMozartFama&lt;/CODE&gt; or the like. Such movement of knowledge into other contexts is sometimes called ''lifting''. Such an approach makes developing a new context very affordable: Most of what needs to be known has already been said in other contexts, which can then be simply subsumed in the new context.

==== Contexts are not First-Order-Logic ====

* explain why the first-orderization using arguments does not work

=== Reasoning into Contexts ===

A side-effect of the &lt;CODE&gt;ist&lt;/CODE&gt; approach to context representation is that it is relatively straight-forwarded to reason into other contexts. For example the following query could be used to find all cases where the movie and the real life of [[wikipedia:Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart|Mozart]] differ:

 ;; get the points of contention
 ist(?CONTEXT-A,?SENTENCE) 
 &amp;&amp; subsumesContext(?CONTEXT-A,GenericMozartFama)
 &amp;&amp; ist(?CONTEXT-B,not(?SENTENCE))
 &amp;&amp; subsumesContext(?CONTEXT-B,GenericMozartFama)

Again, this is not a first-order logic query anymore, because we are no longer looking just at relations, but at whole sentences which include predicates. This is a higher-order query.

=== Some Notes on Implementation ===

Some representations languages, such as [[wikipedia:CycL|CycL]] are designed with strong assumptions about the availablility of contexts; there they are called ''microtheories'' and have special implementation support in [[wikipedia:OpenCyc|OpenCyc]] and other implementations for [[wikipedia:CycL|CycL]]. Many representation or reasoning systems unfortunately do not have explicit support for contexts. And because of the non-FOL needs, ''simulating'' contexts may turn out to be difficult.

== Conclusion ==

After this short overview of what contribution contexts make to the reasoning in knowledge engineering, we are ready to go into a large example that will highlight all of the features we have discussed so far. The hope is that this will draw the disparate pieces together and give you an idea of how knowledge engineering for historians becomes actionable.

Without further ado, let's look at our modelling example, [[Knowledge Engineering for Historians/Modelling Xmas Story|Modelling the Christmas Story]] (see also [[wikipedia:Christmas|Christmas]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Christians meeting together form a church.  Two or more churches joining together to form a common administration and teaching could be considered a denomination.

Denominations formed for various reasons, some for geographically reasons, some for political reasons, and others for differences in interpreting the Bible - that is doctrinal differences.

For discussion purposes these denominations are broken down into four basic groups

Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Protestant, and others.

[http://www.backstage.com Backstage West]

:When you first arrive in LA, buy a copy of Backstage West so see what is happening on '''non'''-union production, including all student films.  This magazine is published once a week and sold at most newstands in Hollywood.  It lists all the jobs available that week.  Note:  '''DramaLogue''' has merged into Backstage West.  Old guidebooks will mention DramaLogue rather than Backstage West.  DramaLogue was a wonderful publication.  Even if you are not an actor, you should read this regularly so you understand the life of the actor.  Never be without this.  For actors, Backstage West will tell you where to get head shots... which is your next step.


[http://www.backstage.com/bso/actorfest/index.jsp Actor Fest]

:If you are an actor, go to Actor Fest.  Run by the people from Backstage West who are appropriately called &quot;Back Stage&quot;.  


[http://www.uclaextension.edu UCLA Extension - Entertainment Studies]

:The UCLA Extension should never be confused with UCLA.  Two different organizations, almost same location.  Download the [http://www.uclaextension.edu/unex/entertainmentStudies/entertainment_catalog.pdf Class Schedule for Entertainment Studies].  While the classes are not as useful as they once were, they are still worth looking at... specially the first night if it is free.


When you become more sophisticated, you need to read:

[http://www.variety.com Variety]

:At one time, there were two semi-independant publications:  Daily Variety for people who are Studio Executives and Weekly Variety for people who want to become Studio Executives.  You can sign up for Variety at any of the tradeshows held in the LA area for film... usually for half price.  In the meantime, read it at the library of the Screen Actors Guild.


[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com The Hollywood Reporter]

:This print magazine is an alternative to Variety.  I have not tried the on-line magazine.  Variety and Hollywood Reporter have totally different feels to them.  Personal taste decides.


===Organizations===

[http://www.filmmakersalliance.com/ Filmmakers Alliance] A nonprofit collective providing support and resources to independent filmmakers in Los Angeles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Design Technology is a unique course in group 4. It is an ideal departure from the traditional science course, especially students who struggle with or dislike experimental science. The course focuses on teaching students the materials, processes, and roles of designs and designers. This includes teaching how designers must consider material, political, social, and economic factors which affect peoples’ priorities when designing a product. Students are taught how to evaluate existing products and analyze situations so that they can suggest appropriate improvements. &lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, Design Technology maintains a strong emphasis on giving students the experience of designers and as such an central part of the course is the design project where students collaborate to design and produce an object of their own design.&lt;br /&gt;
Design and Technology is a relatively hard course, at the respective levels of SL and HL. However, one should take particular care with the ''design project'', and other such projects that contribute to the marking criteria scheme.  Be sure that the influential capacitates of the detrimental effects on the individual of this course has not however changed the initial impact of this course.

==Structure==
There are 6 core topics studied by HL and SL classes:&lt;br /&gt;
:1.  The Design Process&lt;br /&gt;
:2.  Product Innovation&lt;br /&gt;
:3.  Green Design&lt;br /&gt;
:4.  Materials&lt;br /&gt;
:5.  Product Development&lt;br /&gt;
:6.  Product Design&lt;br /&gt;
:7.  Evaluation&lt;br /&gt;
HL classes cover an additional 5 topics:&lt;br /&gt;
:8.  Energy&lt;br /&gt;
:9.  Structures&lt;br /&gt;
:10. Mechanical Design&lt;br /&gt;
:11. Advanced Manufacturing Techniques&lt;br /&gt;
:12. Sustainable Development&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the optional section of the course, HL and SL students study two options from those available for their level.&lt;br /&gt;
Options A-G are available to HL and SL classes:&lt;br /&gt;
:A. Food Science and Technology&lt;br /&gt;
:B. Electronic Product Design&lt;br /&gt;
:C. CAD/CAM&lt;br /&gt;
:D. Textiles&lt;br /&gt;
:E. Human Factors&lt;br /&gt;
:F. Invention, Innovation, and Design&lt;br /&gt;
:G. Electronic Products&lt;br /&gt;
Options H-J are available only to SL classes&lt;br /&gt;
:H. Raw materials to production&lt;br /&gt;
:I. Microstructures and macrostructures&lt;br /&gt;
:J. Appropriate Technologies&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Design Project==
The design project is an integral part of the Design Technology course.

      <text xml:space="preserve">: &quot;'''Indonesian Philosophy''' is generic designation for tradition of abstract speculation held by the people who inhabit the region now known as Indonesia. Indonesian philosophy is expressed in living languages found in Indonesia (approximately 587 languages) and its national language ''Bahasa Indonesia'', comprising many diverse schools of thought receiving influences of Eastern and Western origins, besides its indigenous, original philosophical theme.&quot;
:: &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:Indonesian philosophy]]

This book introduces some philosophical themes occurring in Indonesian philosophical discussions and discourses. For the last two centuries, the ethnic group philosophies has been studied partially by some Western researchers (especially the Dutch ones). There are Javanese, Buginese, Batak, Minangkabau, or Balinese philosophies to be studied, but there is no effort to integrate them into a certain philosophy named with its regional origin, like what the philosophy historians call 'Western philosophy', 'Indian philosophy', or 'Chinese philosophy'. It has been high time to integrate all the ethnic philosophies into an 'Indonesian philosophy' nowadays. This is what this book engages: it integrates them into a particular philosophy called 'Indonesian philosophy'.

Readers will find it 'amazing' when seeing some elements of Indian, Persian, Arabian, and Western origin in some contents of the Indonesian philosophy, since Indonesian philosophers accept all the influence of the foreign philosophies of the foreign origin without being confused or cultural shock. This is the open-mindedness of Indonesians that make all these live in harmony. Pluralism, besides being the social fact, is the intellectual richness of Indonesia that Indonesians may be proud of.

'''Fiery Hot Habañero Pepper Sauce'''

Recipe from: Drabzz (augmented for Wiki).

Fiery hot sauces are legion in the Caribbean, most of which contain habañeros (Jamaicans call them 'scotch bonnets' for their bell-like shape).  

I find the best way to use habañeros is by making up a pepper sauce. This way you can accurately gauge how much heat you are adding to a dish. The heat of individual peppers can vary enormously (even those from the same plant), so a sauce tends to homogenize the heat; making it easier for you to assess the amount to add to any dish.

''Always wear latex or household gloves when handling the peppers and avoid touching your eyes. Chilli peppers are an irritant and even a tiny amount in your eyes can cause extreme pain.''

==Ingredients==

*16 whole habaneros (seeds and all)
*1 oz onion
*1 clove garlic
*2 tsp sugar
*4 Tbsp white malt vinegar (or white wine vinegar)

==Procedure==
#Blend all ingredients to whatever consistency you desire. I like to leave it still quite rough for adding during cooking and smoother for a table sauce.  
#Heat to boiling and simmer for 15-20 minutes. 
#Spoon the cooked sauce into a preheated preserve jar and seal. 
#Leave the jar in a cool, dark place for one month (at least) to develop a good flavour.

There are many variants on this style of sauce; habaneros or scotch bonnets are available in various stages of ripeness, from green through yellow to bright red, so you can control the colour of the sauce by selecting all single colour peppers. The addition of bananas, mangoes and other fruits enjoy an occasional foodie fad. I much prefer the original and undiluted version.

Some recipes involve mixing the type of peppers used; poblanos, jalapeño and chipotle are quite popular varieties. You can achieve widely varying sauces by altering the ratios of pepper types, so feel free to experiment.

Use in sauces, marinades and stews, or sprinkle sparingly on meats, fish and rice dishes.

I personally am not a huge expert on the use of these tools, but i will peice together this outline as I get more information, and would like to introduce this book by 2007. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Windows Programming|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:24, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

== Preface ==

This book is going to discuss the UNIX tools Lex and Yacc, and variants. While we will be touching on the subjects of lexical analysis and parsing, we will not cover all possible methods nor tools for these tasks. This book is going to focus strictly on Lex, Yacc, and tools which are similar in syntax and operation.

The results of scientific thought have played an important role in shaping the world into what it is today. This is true not only because of the influence technology has had in our lives, but also because of the change science has brought in the ''way'' we think. Scientific thinking has permeated all aspects of our lives, fundamentally changing the way we see the world. It is science's &quot;way of thinking,&quot; the '''scientific method''', that forms its heart. Although &quot;scientific thought&quot; or &quot;science&quot; is sometimes taken to refer to the entire body of scientific theories and knowledge including chemistry, biology, physics, and so on, the term '''science''' strictly only refers to the process by which these theories and ideas are examined.

[[Image:FlammarionWoodcut.jpg|thumb|200px|An image portraying some of the fundamental aspects of our world that have been thoroughly analysed by the hand of science.]]

The scientific method is fundamental to the investigation and acquisition of new knowledge based upon physical evidence. Scientists use observations, hypotheses, and logic to propose explanations for natural phenomena in the form of theories. Predictions from these theories that can be reproducibly tested by experiment are the basis for developing new technology.

Although scientific progress is often described as a linear scheme that allows a single scientist to proceed from a state of relative ignorance to a state of knowledge, the scientific method is really much more complicated than this. The scientific method is not a recipe. It requires intelligence and imagination. Science is not the lifeless execution of step-by-step instructions, but a creative and inspired process. Over the past half-century, philosophers, historians, and sociologists of science have established a more complete model describing the ways science is actually practiced.

[[Image:faraday_xmas_detail.jpg|thumb|300px|left|This nineteenth century engraving depicts Michael Faraday, an early experimenter in electricity, demonstrating an experiment in electrochemistry to a large audience of youngsters. As one of the first scientists in electricity, Faraday had little understanding of the phenomena he observed in his experiments. Because the principles of electricity were a mystery, Faraday and his colleagues had great difficulty interpreting the results of their experiments and designing new ones.]]

The modern description of scientific progress gives much more importance to the role of the scientific community. It is impossible for a single person working in isolation to engage in science. This is because of the central role of peer review as a means of correcting error, bias, and self interest. Human nature prevents even a well intentioned scientist from doing anything other than confirming preconceived ideas when working in isolation. Because science is closely tied to a community, progress is usually scattered, proceeding from many stages and different directions at once.

In a new area of scientific exploration, scientific progress is slow at first. Investigators grasp out in search of a basic description of how their area of inquiry works. This inquiry is motivated by observations of some interesting phenomenon manifested in reality. The observations and experiments undertaken by scientists in a developing field are typically dictated by the scientists' interests and by convenience. The scientists have not heritage of successful experiments and little common ground. Because of this, new pursuits in science lack direction and are wanting of a broad common ground that will unite scientists and prescribe the course of scientific research.

[[Image:James Clerk Maxwell big.jpg|thumb|220px|James Clerk Maxwell, one of Faraday's students, established the paradigm under which electricity is understood today. The theory of electromagnetism established Faraday's work on solid scientific ground and created a framework for future work in the study of electricity. Maxwell's theory also provided an explanation of light as an electromagnetic phenomenon.]]

As the new field advances, an underlying set of principles begins to take hold and gain widespread acceptance. These principles become the common ground of scientists in the new field, the basis of a '''paradigm'''. With a paradigm in place, researchers no longer need to start from scratch when interpreting the results of new experiments. Instead, they address a specialized audience that works under a common paradigm, and they describe their work in the context of that paradigm. They are no longer unguided in the direction of the work &amp;mdash; the paradigm dictates which experiments might be useful in further exploring the questions of their field. An established paradigm is therefore an extremely valuable asset in the pursuit of science.

In the presence of an established paradigm, the normal course of scientific research begins. Scientists seek to clarify the understanding of their area of research by formulating theories grounded in their paradigm and by making relevant observations that test the theories and further clarify the paradigm. The observations give greater insight into the paradigm and test the agreement of theories and paradigms with reality. The theories discern previously unseen details in the paradigm and in nature, and guide the method of new observations.

For the normal course of scientific progress, these methods are extremely efficient. In some cases, however, a scientific discipline might be founded on a paradigm that is fundamentally incorrect. This presents a problem, since the paradigm underlying a discipline is deeply valued by the practitioners in the discipline. Such was the case in astronomy during the scientific revolution of the Renaissance. From the times of Aristotle, it had been thought that the Earth was at the center of the Universe, with everything else moving around it in circles. Eventually, observations of the positions of the planets made Aristotle's model inconsistent with reality. As time passed, it became increasingly difficult to modify Aristotle's paradigm to agree with observations. The prospect of a new and completely different paradigm became ever more attractive, and the new idea of a Sun-centered universe took root.

It is almost always the case that some observations cannot be explained by existing scientific theories, but a gap between knowledge and theory is hardly sufficient to produce a paradigm shift. In ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn claims that scientific revolution is only possible when the dominant paradigm of a field is in a state of crisis. Only once it becomes apparent that the ideas tied to the paradigm are irreconcilable with observations does it begin to appear sensible to pursue completely new explanations.

When scientists consider theories, either as candidates for a new paradigm or as elaboration for an existing paradigm, they evaluate theories on the basis of a number of criteria that have proven over the years to be relevant indicators of usefulness. These criteria were described by the philosopher of science Karl Popper in his book, ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''.

The central goal of science is to produce theories that are consistent with reality. Science approaches this goal by testing a theory for validity, and discarding or modifying the theory if observations can't be shown to agree with it. The use of an approach like this requires that theories be '''falsifiable'''. In order for a theory to be scientific, it must be relevant to observable aspects of reality. It must be possible, at least in principle, to make observations that would be inconsistent with the logic of the theory. Said otherwise, the theory must make non-trivial predictions that can be tested by a set of observations. If scientists find that a theory's predictions are incorrect, the theory is falsified. ''A central property of scientific theories is that they can never be proven, but they can eventually be disproved.'' This fact makes it essential that a theory make specific, useful predictions before it can be examined scientifically.

[[Image:Fermilab.jpg|thumb|250px|left|One of the greatest triumphs of modern physics was the prediction and subsequent observation of the existence of subatomic particles called top quarks. Einstein's equations predicted that these particles should exist and described some the their properties. One of the goals of the Collision Detector at Fermi National Laboratories in Batavia, Illinois was to test the theory by searching for the top quark. In 1995, scientists at Fermi announced their successful observation of the top quark.]]

The need for falsifiability implies a need for theories that make clear predictions. Theories that make strong predictions are said to have a high '''predictive power'''. A theory with high predictive power makes bold, clear and testable predictions. Theories with high predictive power are more highly valued in science because they are more easily falsified. Scientists consider theories that have not been falsified despite strong predictions to be more reliable, whereas a theory that makes fewer predictions or less bold predictions tends to be received with more skepticism.

The requirement that scientific theories have strong predictive power leads to the surprising notion that an implausible theory should be preferred over a plausible theory. This is because the claims made by the implausible theory are bolder and more subject to being falsified. In order to succeed, a scientific theory must make a prediction that would not be expected otherwise. If a theory makes a seemingly wild claim that turns out to be correct, the theory is very well supported. This mechanism for developing scientific ideas by creating and testing the predictions of a model is the foundation of science.

A final requirement of scientific theories is that they be as simple as possible while still accurately describing nature. This requirement was famously stated by the English logician and Franciscan friar William of Ockham. He stated the requirement, in Latin, as
:''Numquam ponenda est pluritas sine necessitate,''
which translates roughly as
:''Assertions should not be multiplied unnecessarily.''
This maxim is widely known as '''Ockham's Razor'''. It is a very useful principle, but also one of the most misused doctrines in science.

Ockham's razor warns us that, when two theories make identical predictions, the theory that relies on fewer assumptions is more likely to be correct. The razor is based on the principle that reality is unlikely to conform to our presuppositions. In the absence of evidence, it's often wiser not to speculate.

[[Image:Inductive Deductive Reasoning.svg|thumb|400px|center|Scientists use both inductive and deductive reasoning to learn about nature. In inductive reasoning, one uses observations and the results of experiments to make generalizations about how nature works. These generalizations lead to new theories or new elaborations on a theory. In deductive reasoning, existing theories are subjected to rational consideration to produce logical consequences of the theory. These consequences may lead to new theories and predictions that can be tested through experiment.]]

When creating theories or distinguishing between competing theories, scientists rely on two distinct types of reasoning: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.

'''Inductive reasoning''' works from the specific to general. It involves making observations and building generalizations on the basis of observations. For instance, you might observe the sunrise every day for a year, and you notice that this Sun rises more or less in the east every time. You might conclude that the Sun always rises in the east. Inductive reasoning involves drawing conclusions from a limited sample of information. You have no way of knowing that the Sun won't rise in the west tomorrow. Still, a pattern will become apparent as observation continues, and year after year of observation makes it compelling to imagine that the Sun must always rise in the east. If the pattern remains very consistent, it can be considered reliable even if the underlying cause isn't obvious. Should a theory ever be presented that predicts that the Sun will always rise in the east, that theory will be well supported. On the other hand, if a theory predicts that the Sun will sometimes rise in the east and sometimes in the west, that theory will be disfavored by the observations even though it isn't disproved in a strict sense. Notice that it is possible, though unlikely, for inductive reasoning to discredit a correct theory or support an incorrect theory. Although it is a powerful and essential tool in science, inductive reasoning must be treated with skepticism when based on a very limited sample of observations.

'''Deductive reasoning''' works from the general to the specific. It is based on logical arguments (''syllogisms''). An example of deductions invented by the author Lewis Carroll is provided below:
:All lions are fierce.
:Some lions do not drink coffee.
::Therefore, some fierce creatures do not drink coffee.
Unlike inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning is perfectly reliable if you have made correct assumptions and applied correct logic. Because deductive reasoning is absolutely reliable when used with good assumptions and proper method, it is easy to place undue trust in claims made on the basis of deductive reasoning.  It is important to remember that these claims also require careful examination to check that the assumptions are good and the reasoning is valid. In reality, deductive reasoning is as much subject to error as inductive reasoning. Only the sources of error differ.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Employees in a medical office are knowledge workers. Motivation is not limited to pay scale alone but also to job satisfaction and challenge. A knowledge worker may well be more familiar with their job than their manager is. Indeed this knowledge is a commodity which may be in demand and which is portable. incentivizing the recognition and implementation of best practices at the level of the individual employee and employee categories, medical assistants for example, is the goal of management. 

Merit raises can be based on three basic criteria upon annual review:

'''process improvement'''

'''team spirit'''

'''brand enhancement'''

Fulfilling the basic job requirements in a timely manner and with an appropriate appearance is expected of any employee.  For a knowledge worker, merit implies an application of their innate intelligence toward the improvement of the defining processes of their job. It is the job of management to provide a mechanism by which  suggestions on process improvement can be brought to the attention of management by each employee and be considered for implementation, with due credit being given to the employee at the time of annual review. The mechanism for conveying such information should mirror that through which complaints can be raised and resolved through open conference with their fellow managers in instances where conflict between worker and their immediate supervisor seem to warrant arbitration.

For a knowledge worker merit implies an understanding that most achievement is a collective process and individal efforts interlace. Inequalities in effort and capacity are inevitable and some assymmetry in the rewards which accrue to the more spontaneously energetic and gratuitously helpful employee are not to be undermined by expressed resentment.  A team spirit builds with helpfulness especially when it is offered without obligation.

The orthopedic practice is a service. Like most service industries the &quot;product&quot; of the enterprise is less tangible than in a manufacturing enterprise.  Indeed in medicine, even the most optimal exercise of our most conscientiously applied art and science may not yield a net benefit to the patient. That patient would seemingly be quite justified in seeking care elsewhere if this were all they had to go on.  As it happens however with the help of merit worthy front office workers and back offic workers who also interact with patients on the financial aspect of their experience with the practice, the patient who has not met with a favorable result may yet return the next time if they were treated with courtesy and regard, with respect of their privacy and with a timely delivery of service, in which the patient is guided through the transitions from one venue to the next as they are readied for surgery and recovery.

      <comment>/* Advanced Win32 Sockets */ spelling</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Winsock is the name of the library in Windows that handles the Berkely Socket API. Technically, this library is not part of the Win32 API, although there are some windows-specific issues that need to be considered when programming a Winsock application. 

== Making a Winsock Project ==

You can add Winsock to your programming project by including the &lt;winsock2.h&gt; header file. This header file is for the 32-bit version of the library. For the 16-bit version, include the file &lt;winsock.h&gt;.

winsock.dll is the 16-bit version of the library, and ws2_32.dll is the 32-bit version. You must instruct your linker to link to the appropriate version of the library.

== Initializing Winsock ==

Before calling any of the Winsock routines, the library must first be initialized by calling the '''WSAStartup''' function. This function requires a pointer to the WSADATA structure. You do not need to initialize this structure, because the call to WSAStartup will fill in all the fields of the structure. You may, optionally, read the values from this structure, and use the results in your program. This is not necessary, however. WSAStartup also requires that you specify the version of winsock that you wish to use. The most current version of winsock is version 1.1, although the newest version of the library is version 2.0. To specify this parameter, pass the major and minor versions to the MAKEWORD macro. Here is an example:

 WSADATA wd;
 WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 0), &amp;wd);

Here is the definition of the WSADATA structure. From this data structure, you can determine some important system metrics, including the version of your library, the maximum number of simultaneous sockets available, etc.

 typedef struct WSAData {
  WORD wVersion;
  WORD wHighVersion;
  char szDescription[WSADESCRIPTION_LEN+1];
  char szSystemStatus[WSASYS_STATUS_LEN+1];
  unsigned short iMaxSockets;
  unsigned short iMaxUdpDg;
  char FAR* lpVendorInfo;
 } WSADATA, *LPWSADATA; 

The definition of WSAStartup is as follows:

 int WSAStartup(WORD wVersionRequested, LPWSADATA lpWSAData);

This function returns zero on success, and will return non-zero on failure. These error codes can be handled, or the program can abort. 

== Exiting Winsock ==

After a program has completed, it must call WSACleanup, to unregister itself from the listing, and to free any resources in use by the library. WSACleanup takes no parameters, and returns zero on success. A non-zero return value signifies an error in the cleanup process. 

== Sockets as Handles ==

It has been said that unlike UNIX, Win32 does not allow sockets to be read/written using the file I/O functions. This is only partially true. Sockets may not be accessed using the standard-library functions such as fread, fwrite, fprintf, etc. However, if we cast our SOCKET structures to HANDLE structures, we can use the Win32 File I/O API to interface with the sockets. For instance, we can now use ReadFile and WriteFile to write to sockets, and any routines that we have written around these APIs can be used when writing to the network.

Under Win32, do not attempt to cast a SOCKET to a FILE type, and use the stdio.h file functions. This will result in some sort of error (most likely a bad error). 

== Advanced Win32 Sockets ==

Win32 has a full complement of socket functions, including bind, accept, socket, listen and recv. However, Win32 also provides a number of advanced function varieties that allow for advanced operation modes. For instance, using the advanced socket functions allow Overlapped I/O mode, asynchronous modes, events, etc. These functions can be explored on [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/winsock_functions.asp MSDN].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Violet scatters the most, and red the least.

== Definition ==

'''Spectrum''' is a word that has taken on a broad meaning in English, first used by scientists such as Isaac Newton in the 1600s to specify the range of colors obtained by passing sunlight through a glass prism, or produce through the natural mechanism of a rainbow. Today it is applied in almost any situation for a broad range of values. Specifically in physics and astronomy it still denotes the range of colors of visible light, but also includes invisible forms of electromagnetic energy ranging from very long wavelength radio waves to the ultra short wavelength gamma radiation.

== Producing a Spectrum ==

Color is analogous to wavelength when we speak of visible light. There are relatively long wavelengths of red light and relatively short wavelengths of blue and violet light. These wavelengths are also indicative of temperature for a heated body; red is '''cooler''' while blue is '''hotter.''' White light, such as that from the Sun, is not composed of a single color or wavelength, but of a mixture of many colors or wavelengths, which the eye interprets as white.

While all wavelengths of light travel at the same speed through a vacuum, the speed of different wavelengths varies as light passes through a transparent medium such as glass, water or even air. As light passes from one medium (such as air) into another medium (such as glass), it's speed changes according to the '''index of refraction''' of the two media. In the case of this example, light slows down as it passes into the glass. Blue or violet light is slowed slightly more than red light as it passes from a medium of lower '''refractive index''' to one of higher '''refractive index.''' This, along with the particular shape of a glass prism, acts to bend or '''disperse''' light, spreading the colors out. Since blue light is bent more than red light, the original mixture of light is spread out into its constituent colors to form a spectrum, somewhat like an artificial rainbow.

“The brightness of a star is also dependent on its temperature, and the temperature will have an effect on the spectrum the star emits. If two stars with identical spectra are observed, and the distance of one of the stars through parallax measurement is known, their brightness can be compared. The variance in brightness is attributable to the difference in distance. Using the inverse square law, the distance of the star whose distance was previously unknown can then be determined. Stars can give off radiation not only in the visible spectrum but also as radio waves, x-rays, and gamma rays. All of these different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used in conjunction with the techniques already discussed to make astronomical measurements.”

== Types ==

Spectra types are 
* '''continuous''', which are broad bands created by a incandescent solid (such as the red hot element of an electric stove), liquid (such as molten lava) or a high-pressure gas (such as the surface of a star). 
* '''emission''', characterized by narrow bright lines, created by an excited, low-pressure gas. Examples of emission spectra sources are a comet's coma and tail, and the Rosette nebula.
* '''absorption''', characterized by narrow dark lines, created by a continuous spectrum that is passed through a low-pressure gas. This is seen in the spectra of the Sun and stars, and is caused by light absorption in the cooler, lower pressure gas atmosphere of the star. 

By studying spectra, astronomers can discover many things about stars, most specifically the chemical elements found in the star. “The record of wavelengths (or frequencies) of electromagnetic radiation absorbed by a substance; the absorption spectrum of each pure substance is unique.”

Most stars exhibit absorption line spectra, but a few rare stars show emission lines. Wolf-Rayet stars have emission spectra caused by UV (ultraviolet) radiation from a hot star passed through low-pressure gas. Certain nebulosity or gas clouds also exhibit emission lines. Spectral lines also are detectable in non-visible light such as ultraviolet and microwaves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy which forms part of the Local Group. Although the Milky Way is but one of billions of galaxies in the universe, the Galaxy has special significance to humanity as it is the home of the solar system. Democritus (460 BC - 370 BC) was the first known person to claim that the Milky Way consists of distant stars.

The term &quot;milky&quot; originates from the hazy band of white light appearing across the celestial sphere visible from Earth, which comprises stars and other material lying within the galactic plane. The galaxy appears brightest in the direction of Sagittarius, towards the galactic center.

Relative to the celestial equator, the Milky Way passes as far north as the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation of Crux, indicating the high inclination of Earth's equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic relative to the galactic plane. The fact that the Milky Way divides the night sky into two roughly equal hemispheres indicates that the solar system lies close to the galactic plane.

The Milky Way Galaxy is about 80-100 thousand light years in diameter, about 3,000 light years in thickness, and about 250-300 thousand light years in circumference. It is composed of 200 to 400 billion stars (exact number not yet known). As a guide to the relative physical scale of the Milky Way, if the galaxy were reduced to 130 km (80 mi) in diameter, the solar system would be a mere 2 mm (0.08 in) in width.

The Milky Way's absolute magnitude, which cannot be measured directly, is assumed by astronomical convention to be −20.5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Kuiper belt is an area of the solar system extending from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to 50 AU from the Sun.

The objects within the Kuiper Belt together with the members of the scattered disk extending beyond, are collectively referred to as trans-Neptunian.

The interaction with Neptune (orbital resonance) is thought to be responsible for the apparent edge at 48 AU (a sudden drop in number of objects, see Orbit distribution below) but the current models have yet to explain this peculiar distribution in detail.

==Origins==

Modern computer simulations show the Kuiper belt to have been strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune. During the early period of the Solar System, Neptune's orbit is thought to have migrated outwards from the Sun due to interactions with minor bodies. In the process, Neptune swept up, or gravitationally ejected all the bodies closer to the Sun than about 40 AU (the inner edge of the region occupied by classical Kuiper belt objects), apart from those which fortuitously were in a 2:3 orbital resonance. These resonant bodies formed the plutinos. The present Kuiper Belt members are thought to have largely formed in situ at their present position, although a significant fraction may have originated in the vicinity of Jupiter, and been ejected by it to the far regions of the Solar system.

==Hypothesis==

The first astronomers to suggest the existence of this belt were Frederick C. Leonard in 1930 and Kenneth E. Edgeworth in 1943. In 1951 Gerard Kuiper suggested that the belt was the source of short period comets (those having an orbital period of less than 200 years). The belt and the objects in it were named after Kuiper after the discovery of (15760) 1992 QB1.

==Name==

An alternative name, Edgeworth-Kuiper belt is used to credit Edgeworth. The term trans-Neptunian object is recommended for objects in the belt by several scientific groups because the term is less controversial than all others — it is not a synonym though, as TNOs include all objects orbiting the Sun at the outer edge of the solar system, not just those in the Kuiper belt.

== Pluto ==
The object Pluto, formerly considered a planet, is part of the Kuiper Belt. It has an orbital inclination of 17&amp;deg;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Lifted with permission from ''Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms'',  by Paul Stamets''

'''Cloning:''' Excising a piece of pure living flesh from a mushroom, under sterile conditions, and placing in sterile, nutrient rich medium, in order to capture the characteristics of that particular mushroom.

===Selecting and Preparing material to clone===
Choose young, fresh mushrooms, preferably in the button stage.
(Be careful that you are certain of the species, as many appear the same in the button stage.)
Cut away debris before bringing in front of the transfer unit.

Use a damp paper towel to clean off outside of mushroom.
Best areas for taking the tissue:
*Directly above the gills
*Directly above the disc of the cap
*Interior tissue at the base of the stem

===Procedure===
1. Loosen cap of clean tube and lean against frame of filter,

2. Lay the mushroom on a piece of paper towel in front of the sterile transfer      unit.

3.Flame-sterilize a sharp scalpel until it is glowing red.

4. Cool the tip by:
*touching the nutrient agar in the petri, dish or culture tube , or
*waiting a few seconds, or 
*dipping in alcohol bath and re-flaming to burn off the alcohol

5. Tear the mushroom from the base, up the stem and through the cap, revealing fresh, clean material.

6. Cut out a small section of flesh, (the size of a grain kernel).  Cutting out an inverted pyramid shape helps to free the piece of flesh with more ease. 

7. Quickly transfer the piece of tissue into the culture tube, which you are holding horizontally.
Scraping the piece off using the first inside fold of the tube may help.
Screw the lid on tightly and shake the tube gently until the tissue is in contact with the agar.
If transferring to a petri dish, place the tissue in the center, in the cut where you cooled the blade.
Re-flame the scalpel for each new tissue transfer.

Keep the area being transferred to closest to the filter, in the area that is “upstream”.
Downstream from that are the cultivator’s hands, down stream from that is the specimen on
the towel.

8. label the tube with: 
*date
*genus, species (P. ostreatus)
*your initials

9. Optional: 
log the above amount and comment on anything that happened that may affect the procedure .

===Preparation of Equipment===

====Set up====
*Laminar flow hood on the table with a clear workspace in front.
*Find extension cord and plug in unit.
*Remove front panel and wedge under squirrel cage to form a little overhang protecting the first few inches of space in front  of the filter. 

====Set out ====
Alcohol burner (denatured alcohol), lighter
Scalpel
Scalpel rack
Gloves
Alcohol
Paper towels
Sterile agar tubes 
Labels, pen
Parafilm or tape

====Clean====
Entire workspace. I.e., area in front of filter, and bottom of “roof” over area, and any implements that you are using in that area (outside of lamp, scalpel handle, tube rack or scalpel holder, pen) using a 10% Clorox /water solution, hydrogen peroxide, or rubbing alcohol.
Light the alcohol lamp and place at either side of the work area, inside the flow area. 
Put on gloves and place a little alcohol in your palm and rub over the surface of the glove.
(Be sure to keep your gloved hands away from the flame, if you have recently used the alcohol to clean.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Is there a problem? ==

If you are one of the many people who used to use [[w:WordPerfect|WordPerfect]] or [[w:WordStar|WordStar]] and have since switched to a different editor, you may already be familiar with the problem of retrieving your own information from certain types of files. Or perhaps you switched from one operating system to another, from Amiga to Windows, or Windows to Macintosh. Stated simply, file formats for different software far too often leave your information scrambled in a way you cannot decipher again years later.

If this seems a bit theoretical to you then here are some stories to illustrate the issue of choosing the right format for your information.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''The English Tourist'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A tourist walks into a very nice restaurant in a lovely village in the French countryside and mutters in English &quot;Are you still serving lunch?&quot; No one reacts, so he says louder, &quot;Do you have a TABLE where I might DINE?&quot; Recognizing a few words and realizing that the tourist must only speak English or isn't interested in trying his French, one of the employees goes off to find someone who might be able to help this ignorant tourist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After a long delay, someone comes, interprets his request and finds him a seat in the restaurant. The tourist is handed a menu. &quot;I can't read this! It is in French! What are Cervelles anyways?&quot; The helpful interpreter is called back and the tourist has the whole menu explained to him and is finally ready to order a meal. By now our hapless tourist is getting hungry and frustrated and, in just the way everyone gets when they are frustrated and hungry forgets their manners and blurts, &quot;By the way, I am going to order in English so I can be sure of what I am getting - and for the privilege of taking my order, I demand that you pay the Queen of England a small sum for the use of this language which you should really just learn to use like everyone else!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After this last sentence is finally translated back to the previously friendly proprietors, the kitchen is closed and the tourist is sent packing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In terms of file formats where this tourist has gone wrong is that although ''he'' is happy with the format he is using (unlike the Roman official in the next story) he has forgotten that different people do things differently. When in a different context his preferred format (English) is not supported. This is the situation if your favourite software company goes bust or stops supporting the software you bought. The files which once were so convenient can become useless with time.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''The Roman Official'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An official in ancient Rome by the name of Gallus hires a scribe called Taruna who understands Latin but can only write in a rare (and unrecorded) dialect of Sanskrit. After Taruna has been in the job for some years Gallus finds he is actually too slow and keeps losing important documents. Taruna is turned out into the street and goes back to his family in disgrace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The following day the official employed a highly regarded new assistant and sent him into the archive. A few minutes later the assistant came out in tears explaining that he only knows a few words of Sanskrit, can't find any references to the dialect used and could never hope to make sense of these documents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Frantically they search for Taruna. When they find him they ask him to come back to work, but he sees their problem. So he says with a smile &quot;I will happily come back to work, you just need to double my pay and holidays!&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern terms where the Roman official went wrong is to use an unpublished format (an unrecorded dialect of Sanskrit) to store his information. He was then trapped by this format and forced to keep buying the software (the scribes services) at ever increasing cost. He had lost control of his own information!

In a report written for The National Archives (UK) in 2003, Adrian Brown summarises how to proceed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The selection of file formats for creating electronic records should ... be determined not only by the immediate and obvious requirements of the situation, but also by longer-term considerations. An electronic record is not fully fit-for-purpose unless it is sustainable throughout its required life cycle. ... It is therefore highly desirable to identify the minimum set of formats which meet both the active business needs and the sustainability criteria below, and restrict data creation to these formats. [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/preservation/advice/pdf/selecting_file_formats.pdf] (PDF)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The approach of [http://www.gutenberg.org/ Project Gutenberg] to this challenge has been a strict criteria that all the 15,000+ books stored in their digital repository are stored in plain ASCII text.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever possible, Project Gutenberg distributes a plain text version of an eBook. Other formats, such as HTML, XML, RTF, and others are also welcome, but plain text is the &quot;lowest common denominator.&quot; We stress the inclusion of plain text because of its longevity: Project Gutenberg includes numerous text files that are 20-30 years old. In that time, dozens of widely used file formats have come and gone. Text is accessible on all computers, and is also insurance against future obsolescence. [http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Public_Domain_eBook_Submission_How-To#File_Formats]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Does that mean we cannot use word processors, if we want long term access to the information in our documents? Well, yes and no. If you want long term file readability (of Latin script languages) as Project Gutenberg does, then ASCII text is the way to go. This might be something to consider for financial records and other valuable information. If, as many people do, you have non-text information, like images and sounds, then this is the article to read. Either way there are ''a lot'' of common errors you can avoid which will ''at the very least'' make future migrations to the next generation of file formats much easier.

Let's now take a real world scenario. Many people use the Microsoft Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office package which includes the document application Microsoft Word (or just MSWord). The default file format of MSWord is DOC. So what's DOC like for long term storage?

MS Word is a proprietary program and the .doc file extension is a proprietary format. That means that how the software works and stores your information is secret - only Microsoft knows exactly how it all works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Formats for storing electronic information ==

At any one time there is an enormous variety of file formats in use for various purposes, so how do you choose which one is best? There are three type of file formats:
* Proprietary, closed specifications
* Proprietary, open specifications
* Non-proprietary, open specifications

'''Proprietary, closed specifications''' are used by some of the most common software, if you don't use them yourself you probably get sent them. However because these formats are not publically documented, you are held hostage to the company making the software. If they decide not to support old versions of their own format, suddenly you can't open your old files! Then your choice of software is greatly dependant on any new software ability to second-guess the format used by your old software. Examples of this type of format are those from the Microsoft Office Word doc format and Excels xls format, and Adobe Photoshop's Document (.psd).

'''Proprietary, open specifications''' are somewhat better in that although the format is still legally owned and developed purely for their commercial benefit by one company, they have undertaken to document the format openly. They can still choose to switch back to a closed specification, or they may make changes they choose not to document. In other words, a proprietary open specification is only open as long as the company wants to keep it that way. Examples of this type of format are Adobe's Portable Document Format (.pdf) (patented, although most of the patents are licensed on a royalty-free basis), Adobe TIFF format (.tiff) and Macromedia Shockwave Flash (.swf) (however, the documentation is under a non-disclosure agreement that requires readers not to contribute to any other implementations of Flash, so in practice it is still closed).

'''Non-proprietary, open specifications''' have been openly documented by some public body (or released to them) by developers. Once released these formats have a guaranteed reference point. Examples of this type of format are Portable Network graphic (.png) Joint Photographic Expert Group (.jpg / .jpeg) ( .mpeg2), eXtensible Markup Language (.xml) (the structure, more than the specific format), and Scalable Vector Graphic (.svg).

One special case is the '''Adobe Portable Document Format for archival''' (pdf-archive or PDF-A), a restricted application of the proprietary open specification [http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/pdf/index_reference.html#2 PDF 1.4] format. It is a published ISO International Standard from 2002 [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=34607&amp;ICS1=37&amp;ICS2=100&amp;ICS3=99] and developed by the [http://www.aiim.org/standards.asp?ID=25013 PDF-Archive Committee] in close partnership with the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts [http://www.fcw.com/article82304-03-14-04-Print]. I have not found any software which supports this format, so it is possibly only used in organisations where archival is their main concern.

One family of formats which could solve many issues is collectively called [[w:OpenDocument|OpenDocument]] developed by OpenOffice.org, OASIS, and many others in the industry (but not Microsoft). [http://www.openoffice.org/ OpenOffice.org] 2.0, recently released, uses the [[w:OpenDocument|OpenDocument]] family of formats.  Of the software supporting OpenDocument, OpenOffice, AbiWord and Google Docs are cross-platform, and KOffice will be as of KDE 4.1 (around July 2008).  Mac OS X 10.5's TextEdit can understand the format to some degree, and Microsoft states it will add native support for OpenDocument 1.1 (rather than plug-in converters) to MS Office, as of Spring 2009.

Unfortunately leading software often defaults to a format which is inherently unsuited to later retrieval. An example is Microsoft Word which defaults to their native .doc format rather than the better documented and more widely supported Rich Text Format (.rtf), Though you can [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HP052372851033.aspx change the default format]. Microsoft products are also notable for their use of what Marshall Masters of the [http://www.pma-online.org/ Independent Book Publishers Association] calls 'upgrade blackmail' and describes as &quot;Someone with a new version of your desktop application edits your file, and now your older version of the application cannot read it, which forces you to pay for an expensive upgrade if you want to continue working and playing well with others.&quot;[http://www.pma-online.org/scripts/shownews.cfm?id=1093] That's definitely something for anyone with a budget to avoid.

So, what's the next level of future-proofing? Read on...

=== Criteria in choosing future proof file formats ===
Formats for future proofing must:
* Be supported by comprehensively, public documentation
* Be stable, not under constant revision
* Be supported by several software providers
* Be supported on various hardware 
* Be supported by software on various operating systems (Windows/Macintosh/Unix/Linux)
* Be free of legal restriction in its use (see [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html PNG not GIF])

Additional consideration:
* Popular formats are more likely to remain supported

=== Criteria in choosing suitable software ===

There are some software implications of the format criteria. Not all software uses open specifications correctly, so they only appear to be using a particular format. This is most common with Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) editors and the [http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/word.html notorious] 'Save as html' option in Microsoft Word. So if you are buying software, make sure to check this. [http://www.opensource.org/ Open Source]/ [http://www.fsf.org/ Free] inherently tends to have strong support for open standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Text &amp; Documents ===
In most types of organisations text documents are their most important type of electronic information after financial accounts. Depending on what the document contains there are several types of format to choose from.

There are three types of text documents:
'''Plain text files''' - simple text, no formatting, no font choices.
'''Text documents''' - you can choose fonts, colors, text size, backgrounds and imbed images (sounds/video etc.).
'''Documents for presentation''' - all the options of Text documents, with restrictions on further editing.

For '''Plain text files''' the simplest, and most durable format is '''ASCII''' (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). It has been developed since 1963 and must be the single most supported format ever. However it is also very limited. The only formatting available is the selection of line breaks. There is no embedding of any images or colors, and there is no support for diacritic marks or non-Latin scripts. There are a variety of other encodings based on ASCII which add support for more characters. In the western world windows-1252 (which is closely related to ISO-8859-1) is the most common of these.  Other parts of the world will have other conventions. UTF-8, which can represent texts of all languages in real use, is becoming more common and may be the best choice for long term storage of text.

Text files using an encoding based on ASCII are usually represented with the .txt suffix, but it can be hard to determine which one automatically. So it is a good idea to try and find out what encoding you are using and record it. If you are really paranoid you may also want to find and store the authoritative tables for converting that encoding to unicode (try http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets and http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/).

For Windows users, Notepad is the default application for handling TXT files. Current versions of notepad assume UTF-8 if the file is completely valid UTF-8 or has a UTF-8 byte order mark, UTF-16 if they detect a UTF-16 byte order mark and the windows ANSI code page (1252 for western versions) otherwise. In a pinch it is often possible to use notepad and similar editors to get the raw text out of other types of files, and it can be informative to try this on other files you plan to store.

'''Text documents''' are what you produce most of the time on one of the many commercial or free [[w:List_of_word_processors|word processors]]. Most of the time you probably use it for writing basic text documents. Letters to friends and colleagues, project lists and so on. Applications for this type of text are found in popular office suites like [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx Microsoft Office], [http://www.apple.com/appleworks/ AppleWorks] and [http://openoffice.org OpenOffice.org].

For the purpose of durability of your documents it is important that the document you write today will still be readable next year. For a long time there has been no open standard for documents, so compatibility has been a constant problem. People have had different levels of success when they've chosen to migrate from one document editor to another, as each used its own format. The .doc format is now well supported by several editors.

Whichever word processor you use, it should support several formats, choosing the most durable format is very important. While work proceeds on the [[w:OpenDocument|OpenDocument]] standard (Version 1.0 was approved as an OASIS standard in May 2005), RTF (Rich Text Format) is the most widely supported and documented format available. You should be able to make this your default format so all future documents are in the RTF format. ([http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HP052372851033.aspx Tutorial] on changing the default format in Microsoft Word) If you choose not to do this because RTF does not support some feature you need, you should still consider using RTF as you archival format. Your formatting may not be represented correctly, but at least your content is there for posterity.

If you spend time making '''Documents for presentation''' you'll know that Word processors are limited in this area. You might be using programs like Adobe [http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/main.html Illustrator]/[http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/main.html InDesign], [http://www.sodipodi.com/ sodipodi] or [http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Corel3/Products/Display&amp;pfid=1047024307335&amp;pid=1047022690654 CorelDRAW]. These programs are great, but they can be tricky to successfully archive.

There are at least two competing options, [[w:Pdf|PDF]] especially [[w:PDF/A|PDF/A]] from Adobe and [[w:XML_Paper_Specification|XPS]] from Microsoft.

''The Portable Document Format ([[w:Pdf|PDF]]) is the file format created by Adobe Systems in 1993 for document exchange. PDF is a fixed-layout format used for representing two-dimensional documents in a manner independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system. Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a 2-D document (and, with Acrobat 3-D, embedded 3-D documents) that includes the text, fonts, images, and 2-D vector graphics that compose the documents.
PDF is an open standard that has been officially published on July 1, 2008 by the ISO as ISO 32000-1:2008.'' [[w:Pdf|&quot;The Portable Document Format (PDF)&quot;]] Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia, accessed July 4th, 2008

''[[w:PDF/A|PDF/A]] is described in ISO 19005-1:2005 ''Document Management - Electronic document file format for long term preservation - Part 1: Use of PDF 1.4 (PDF/A-1)'' that was published on October 1, 2005. This standard defines a format (PDF/A) for the long-term archiving of electronic documents and is based on the PDF Reference Version 1.4 from Adobe Systems Inc. (implemented in Adobe Acrobat 5). [[w:PDF/A|PDF/A]] is in fact a subset of [[w:Pdf|PDF]], leaving out [[w:Pdf|PDF]] features not suited to long-term archiving. This is similar to the definition of the [[w:PDF/X|PDF/X]] subset for the printing and graphic arts.'' [[w:PDF/A|&quot;PDF/A&quot;]] Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia, accessed July 4th, 2008

''The XML Paper Specification ([[w:XML_Paper_Specification|XPS]]), formerly codenamed &quot;Metro&quot;, is a specification for a page description language and a fixed-document format developed by Microsoft. It is an [[w:Xml|XML]]-based (more precisely [[w:Xaml|XAML-based]]) specification, based on a new print path and a color-managed vector-based document format which supports device independence and resolution independence.'' [[w:XML_Paper_Specification|&quot;The XML Paper Specification (XPS)&quot;]] Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia, accessed July 4th, 2008

One word of caution for using PDF files: do not use inbuilt compression of pdf files and if possible use the PDF 1.4 specification.

'''Recommendation'''
* Use plain ASCII text whenever possible
* Use ODT where formatting is important or where graphics need to be included
* Use PDF or XPS for documents which will not need to be edited in the future

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Web pages ===
'''Producing (X)HTML files''' can be done with a wide variety of software, and in general web browser are very forgiving of errors in HTML code. In most cases it would still be unwise to use office applications for creating (X)HTML documents. Although some office software applications are now quite good at generating clean (uncluttered) code, there are always some mistakes. Never under any circumstances use Microsoft Word's &quot;Save as HTML function&quot;. The code that will be produced is full of non-standard, Microsoft-specific extensions, and the files it produces are very large.

The '''advantage of (X)HTML''' is that it can always be read with your eye, whether you have a suitable browser or not. For example, the title of an HTML page (if you look at the code of the file) is surrounded by &lt;code&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/code&gt; so it looks like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;title&gt;A page about me&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This makes (X)HTML ideal for storing text files with structure. You are however limited by your ability to create (X)HTML files and (X)HTML's limitations on formatting

'''Recommendation'''
* Set the DTD and (X)HTML flavour your software uses before starting a new file
* Validate your code with W3C's online validator: http://validator.w3.org/
* Group or compress the (X)HTML and CSS files together in a folder so they do not become separated

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Images (Raster Graphics) ===
Most of your images are probably [[wikipedia:raster graphics|raster graphics]], as vector graphics are less common. Although there are hundreds of formats to choose from two of the most popular are [[w:Gif|GIF]] (Graphics Interchange Format) and [[w:TIFF|TIFF]] (Tagged Image File Format). Unfortunately these have been caught up in [http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/Gif/Gif.html legal issues] since 1994 over a Unisys patent on the LZW compression algorithm which both formats use. These patents have [http://www.unisys.com/about__unisys/lzw now expired] although there is still an [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4,814,746.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/4,814,746&amp;RS=PN/4,814,746 IBM patent] valid until August 2006.

Thus the GIF and TIFF formats do not ''currently'' meet the requirement of being 'free from legal restriction in their use'.

The [[w:Lossless_data_compression|lossless]] [[w:Png|PNG (Portable Network Graphic)]] format replaces GIF and has many advantages in quality, size and options (but lacks animation). Most importantly the PNG format is patent free and has been a [http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/ W3C Recommendation] and [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29581&amp;ICS1=35&amp;ICS2=140&amp;ICS3= ISO Standard] since 2003.

Another popular format for raster graphics is the [[w:Lossy_data_compression|lossy]] [[w:Jpg|JPEG/JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)]] format, which is specially suited to storing photographic images.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the JPEG committee have always tried to ensure in their standardisation work that the 'baseline' part of their standards should be implementable without payment of either royalty fees (volume related) or license fees (non-volume related).&quot; [http://www.jpeg.org/faq.phtml?action=show_answer&amp;question_id=q3f042a5e42fd8 JPEG Committee]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...there are many patents associated with some optional features of JPEG, namely arithmetic coding and hierarchical storage. For this reason, these optional features should not be used for long-term storage of valuable images. [http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/ W3C]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Remember that JPEG is a [[w:Lossy_data_compression|lossy]] format, meaning that each time the image is modified and resaved there is some irretrievable data loss. Therefore it should be avoided for archival use unless shortage of space requires that lossy compression is used.

(Windows users should read [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-028.mspx Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-028] and this [http://www.jpeg.org/newsrel10.html press release])

'''Recommendation'''
* Use the PNG format.
* Use the JPEG format, but avoid optional features.
* If your software supports it, you can save in TIFF format without compression.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Single layer images ====
Another application of 2D vector graphics are for images where the image itself is the final product. Commercial products doing this are Adobe Illustrator and Macromedia Flash.

Adobe uses their proprietary format AI (standing for 'Adobe Illustrator', one of their products.) Movement is being made on a platform and product independent format called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). The SVG format has much of the functionality of Macromedia's SWF format plus many others, including the ability to be searched for text by search engines. Although at the time of writing this article SVG was not a mainstream format, its use is growing and it seems likely to become a standard in wide use [2]. Development of the SVG format are carried out by the W3C and at present SVG version 1.0 is a W3C Recommendation.

==== Multiple layer images ====
For print shops and graphic designer it is often necessary to store the original working files. These may contain many layers of different images, as well as some record of previous changes made to the file.

The main players in this field are the PhotoShop Document (.psd) format and Corel PhotoPaint. The main OpenSource rival is GIMP Image File (.xcf) format. Because Gimp is an open source application the potential for its format becoming unreadable is low, however the two applications should not really be directly be compared.

'''TODO''': Research availability and licensing of .psd and .xcf format specifications

Adobe Acrobat Reader includes support for SVG, Adobe also has a standalone SVG viewer which can be imbedded easily into internet explorer browsers.

'''Recommendation'''
* Do not use vector graphics to store important information unless unavoidable.
* Keep original files on CD with copies in SVG format. Keep paper copies.

'''Recommendation'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Databases &amp; Spreadsheets ===
'''Databases''' are inherently good for long term storage of information. Because of the way they are constructed it is generally easy to extract information and reform it for restorage.

The backbone of standards compliant databases is Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is not a format for storing database information. It is a format for storing the requests made to a database. In other words a database stores your information and SQL is the language for retrieving that information.

For a long time SQL was being developed in different places by different people and for some time the 1999 version has therefore been widely used as a safe bet. Now SQL:2003 is an ISO/IEC standard and very wisely there are &quot;No changes or conformance requirements - Products conforming to Core SQL:1999 should conform automatically to SQL:2003&quot;[http://www.wiscorp.com/sql/SQL2003Features.pdf].

Part of the beauty of the SQL standard is that you can extract your information together with the structural information needed to put that information into another database. The resulting file is often called an 'SQL dump'.

'''Recommendations'''
* Do not use MS Access, it is not a fully functional RDBMS and does not support standards compliant SQL queries.
* Use a database which can import and export/dump in SQL
* Check that your SQL is standard SQL:1999 or SQL:2003
* Backup the information in your database regularly as a TXT file or SQL file

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Understanding Vector Formats ==

Vector Formats represent shapes by describing their geometric properties in points, lines, curves, and polygons. The difference between vector and raster images, and when to use each, is important, but outside the scope of this document.

Sadly there are no widely adopted standard formats for vector images. Part of the reason for this is the variety of uses for vector images. At one extreme of complexity is a DWG (pronounced drawing) file from AutoCAD which can represent a multi storey building in three dimensions. At the other extreme is an SVG (Structured Vector Graphics) file for the elegant graphics used in digital cartoons.

So which format one uses depends a lot on how long you will need the information to be stored and who will need to have access to it.

As a starting point here are some vector formats and things to consider:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Typical uses&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Formats&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Architecture, engineering and construction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DWG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Proprietary format of AutoDesk. The Open Design Alliance asserts that [http://www.opendesign.com/about/whtpaper/alwhtpap.htm DWG 2004 is partially encrypted].&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DWG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Also known as OpenDWG. The Open Design Alliance's version of the DWG file format used by Autodesk. Published as an open standard.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[w:ASCII_Drawing_Interchange_file_format|DXF]] (Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Promoted by AutoDesk as the preferred format for interoperability with other CAD software. Partially documented with partial support for functions contained in DWG files. Its limitations are described in more detail in the white paper &quot;[http://www.opendesign.com/about/whtpaper/whynot.htm Why Isn't DXF Good Enough?]&quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DGN (DesiGN file)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Also known as OpenDGN. The native format of MicroStation, a product of Bentley Corp. DGN is &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In 2001, the [http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)] format became a W3 recommended standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Vector files (2D &amp; 3D scalable line drawings)=

'''Vector files''' present special challenges partly because they are used for everything from 3 dimensional models of aircraft to scalable desktop icons. So to talk about one format for all the different uses would be misleading. Instead we'll break vector file formats down by their purpose.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;File type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Reviewed formats&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3 Dimensional models (architectural, animation, engineering...)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;!-- [[Wikipedia:CGM|CGM]],  --&gt;[[Wikipedia:.dwg|DWG]], [[Wikipedia:DXF|DXF]], [[Wikipedia:VRML|VRML]], [[Wikipedia:Industry_Foundation_Classes|IFC]]
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 Dimensional drawings (architectural, engineering...)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[Wikipedia:SVG|SVG]], [[Wikipedia:DXF|DXF]], [[Wikipedia:DWG|DWG]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==3 Dimensional models==
[[Wikipedia:3D_computer_graphics|3D computer graphics]] can model or represent almost anything found in the physical world, and much more. Because of the variety of uses progress has been slow on adopting standard formats for exchanging and storing data. Many good programs can import and export in several propriety formats, although the quality of the resulting file can be suspect because in many cases developers have had to experiment and guess their way into how the external format works.

In the fields of architecture, engineering and building, some formats (and families of formats) have begun to emerge as contenders for the role of an industry-wide standards. One such format (are there others?) is the Industry Foundation Classes format (IFC) which is now compulsory for state supported building projects in Denmark and many state supported Finnish projects [http://www.senaatti.fi/document.asp?siteID=2&amp;docID=517 ref].

Until the adoption of Object Class formats like IFC, the main contenders for being called a standard are the proprietary but open Drawing Exchange Format (DXF) from AutoDesk and the W3C recommendation Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML).

Because the use of AutoCAD (an AutoDesk product) is so widespread there has been a very successful attempt at supporting their format in other products. The Open Design Alliance has produced the commercially licensed OpenDWG (DWG format) as a format compatible with AutoCADs own DWG format. Many competitors of AutoCAD now offer support for DWG via this format.

The OpenSource 3D modeling application [[w:Blender_%28software%29 | Blender]] can export in both DXF and VRML.

== 2 Dimensional drawings==
Two-dimensional vector graphic formats can be divided into two groups. Commercial products like AutoCAD and ArchiCAD use 2D (and 3D) vector information to make highly advanced, multiply layered drawings for architects and engineers.

In the graphics and to some extent the animation industry, formats like the proprietary Flash format and the open source standard SVG are popular. Many Adobe programs use a variety of formats which could well be very good working files in the parent program, but can be a problem to open later when, especially when a copy of that program is no longer available.

(this section needs expansion)

===Recommendations===
* 3 Dimensional Models: Keep the original working file and make a copies in the DXF (to protect metadata) and VRML (to secure visual elements) formats.
* 2 Dimensional Drawings: Keep the original working file and make a copy in the DXF format or SVG format depending on which is best suited.

Clotho would spin the string that represented the life of a living being;
Lachesis would measure its length to determine the length of that being's life, and
Atropos, the eldest, would cut it when the time was right, thus ending with that being's life.

These three goddesses were thought to be the daughters of Zeus and Themis. This is debatable however.
Even some deities were afraid of the Fates. The women might have even been more powerful than Zeus himself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The section on &quot;diminishing returns&quot; in fact discusses the calculation of marginal cost.  Diminishing returns is best understood by examining &quot;marginal product&quot; associating the unit of input (capital or labor) with a particular amount of output.  The best explanation starts with a fixed amount of money to invest.  The money is split between capital and labor.  For example, the more capital that is purchased, the less labor that can be hired.  Each combination of capital and labor produces a particular level of output.  The optimum combination occurs where marginal product of labor is the same as marginal product of capital.  Moving away from that intersection decreases the marginal product of one of the two inputs.  For example, adding more labor causes less spending on capital equipment.  Not only that, the increment of labor added is less efficient than the previous amount of labor.  Thus, the solution to the problem of how much to produce (for a given amount of money to invest) occurs where the marginal product of labor is the same as the marginal product of capital.  All other solutions are non-optimal.  This information can then be translated into cost and output.  That function can be differentiated by the labor and capital variables to determine &quot;marginal cost of labor&quot; and &quot;marginal cost of capital&quot; discussed elsewhere.</text>

With age the normal elasticity of tendons is diminished. Signal change on MRI correlates with this age related change which is considered pathological when it occurs in the extreme or prematurely. Mechanically, the altered tissue is stiffer. Injury is most likely to occur where the muscle is functioning in an eccentric mode, lengthening of the muscle tendon unit, while the muscle contracts as in the late follow through phase of throwing in which the cuff contributes to the coordinated deceleration of the arm. The greater stiffness of the  elastin depleted tendon leads to failure. The elastin normally functions like a snubber on a mooring line which dampens the sudden jolt as the stucture of the rope reaches the limit of it's abliity to stretch.  The location of the failure varies with rate of load. Episodic near failure at the tuberosity may result in remodeling changes at the tendon bone interface as an adaptive response to shore up the tendon insertion.
Rotator cuff tears can occur through normal tendon with an acute injury of sufficient force and mechanism. In most cases however the pathophysiology is more complex and tears generally are found to have occurred through tendon that is not normal but rather through tendon that has deteriorated for lack of a better term.  A degenerative process is another term that we use to describe the changes in the structure of the tendon that are present and which predispose to the development of a tear. These changes in the tendon can be accompanied by pain but may also be clinically silent thus despite a lack of reported symptoms after age 50 the likelihood of identifying a rotator cuff tear in a random individual is roughly 20% at age 50 and 40% at age 70. 
It has been a natural presumption that a small assymptomatic tear can develop into a larger symptomatic tear and that over the course of this evolution the degree of difficulty in repair is increased due to the retraction of the muscle tendon unit.  Furthermore long established tears in the tendon can be accompanied by atrophy and fatty infiltration of the muscles at which point simply reestablishing the physical connection between the tendon and the bone will not necessarily restore the functional role of the structure in the overall kinematics and biomechanics of the shoulder. It is further apparent that the tendon connection to bone that results from repair of a rotator cuff differs from that of a normal tendon insertion.  One feature that is lacking in the repaired tendon are Sharpies fibers which in a normal tendon anchor into the structure of the bone imparting greater resistence to tear.  Lacking this feature therefore a repaired tendon is more subject to retear although as the results tally it may be possible to have successfully alleviated the complaint despite evidence on post operative imaging that the tendon has either failed to heal, or has retorn. 

The net benefit that is seen in 85% of rotator cuff repairs however suggests that a successful repair is not incompatable with a residual tendon defect.  On net then with our present techniques we can hope at least to convert a symptomatic tear into an assymptomatic tear.  Since we know by recent studies that a small tear need not progress this may nonetheless be an favorable outcome which is sustained. It is possible that a residual tear in the watershed zone at the junction of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus where many assymptomatic rotator cuffs are noted to occur at inconsequential to the result and represent the majority of residual tears that are assymptomatic.  Despite this hope we are driven to improve our results by restoring anatomy and function.  
One strategy is to improve tendon fixation strength to the point where early motion is feasible.  If we can justifiably extrapolate from the experience of tendon repair in the hand, a post operative environment that allows some degree of controlled active motion is optimum for healing if gaps can be prevented in the repair interface. Thusfar the predominant practice following rotator cuff repair is for no motion or very limited motion designed to be passive characterize the rehabilitation protocols following rotator cuff repair.  This approach presumes that the frequency of residual defects are due to repair failure and that this results more frequently when motion is allowed.  It seems as though our present methods of fixation as varied as they may be between double row and single row repairs arthroscopic or open, we have optimized the strength of fixation and it is insufficient to allow unsupervised active motion. 
The second strategy that is being pursued is to augment the healing process with biological adjuncts to stimulate and speed the process of healing if not to qualitatively improve the healing to better reiterate the ultrastucture of the normal tendon insertion. The possibility of one day augmenting the repair process is suggested by animal studies which show a promising effect of FGF-2 which stimulates fibroblasts. Impregnated in suture this has been shown to augment tendon healing and improve motion following flexor tendon repair in the hand. In has also been show to promote the development of sharpies fibers in some experimental models, thus this represents a promising line of future research. 
Early clinical efforts using PRP which contains a variety of growth factors are thusfar on no demonstrable benefit when applied within a collagen carrier to augment rotator cuss repair. The potential however is there and the devil as usual is in the details.  Other pharmacological interventions are of course promising including smoking sessation, avoidance of NSAIDs and the potential that doxycycline as a MMP inhibitor thereby moderating breakdown of nacent neotendon perhaps permitting more productive healing. The latter incidentally is a suitable antibiotic against P Acne which has a predilection to produce infection especially around the shoulder.

Whether through failure of through periodic contractile inhibition secondary to pain, the rotator cuff becomes functionally insufficient even before failure of its substance leads to a loss to the normal head centering function with glenohumeral abduction.  Eventually there is cephalad migration under the influence of the deltoid. The acromion and AC ligament receive compressive loads and adaptive changes occur leading to thickening of the anterior inferior acromion and ossification of the AC ligament. This abnormal boney structure then creates a secondary mode of injury by abrading the dorsal surface of the tendon acting like a wood plane. Osteophytes at the inferior surface of the A-C joint have a similar effect contributing to the process of outlet impingement. As part of the procedure for repairing the rotator cuff tear then measures are required to alter the potential for extrinsic abrasion by adjacent bony structures even if they are not as previously thought always the cause for the original tear.  The bony changes that occur secondary to the tear and the altered biomechanics do however present a threat to the integrity of the repair if they abrade the structure of the healing tendon. These spurs can occur anteriorly through ossification of the coracoacromial ligament with a resultant anterior inferior prominence of the acromion, which in some cases is already curved downward anteriory. The spurs that form inferiorly at the acromioclavicular joint also potentially threaten the integrity of the repaired supraspinatus which must glide beneath this joint in the course of active shoulder motion.  Failing to address these spurs but resection of the distal 8mm or so of clavicle can presumably contribute to retear.  Certainly the persistence of shoulder pain following rotator cuff repair is often found to be due to AC joint arthritis which has not been addressed at the primary surgery.  Indeed it seems that this pain and subsequent response to subsequent distal clavicle resection is not necessarily evident as a feature of the chief complaint.  This may be due to the pain limited motion at the time of initial presentation, if may also be that the repaired tendon being bulkier is more subject to the abrading effect of the AC joint spurs, thus a relatively low threshold for concomitant resection of the distal clavicle is warranted especially if there is evidence of superior impingement on the rotator cuff by inferiory protruding osteophytes.

 

Rotator cuff injury in the throwing athelete has a different mechanism.  The throwing athelete may develop excessive external rotion and a restricted internal rotation as a consequence of mechanical stresses on the shoulder capsule which occur with the throwing motion.  The anterior capsule stretches in late cocking phase and the posterior capsule strethces in follow.

The loss of elasticity of tendons happens by an unknown mechanism.  An abnormal pattern of remodeling with the rotator cuff tendon appears to be the net effect of an altered gene expression triggered by the extreme mechanical demands.  Abnormally high levels of metalloproteinases implying altered collagen processing are noted in assays of torn rotator cuffs.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Simple future|Futur simple}} ==

There are three versions of the future tense in French, the ''futur simple'' the ''futur composé'', and the ''futur antérieur''(future perfect). One uses the future simple tense when referring to an action, certain to occur, in a time ahead of now.&lt;!--The ''futur composé'' is formed by inserting the present form of ''aller'' before the infinitive, e.g. ''elle va réussir'' (she will pass, or she is going to pass) is the futur composé of ''elle réussit''--&gt;

=== Regular formation ===

To conjugate a verb in the simple future, one takes the infinitive and appends the right form of ''avoir'', except for ''nous'' and ''vous'' which takes ''-ons'' and ''-ez'':

&lt;div id='french-nationalities'&gt;
Nationalities are not capitalized as often in French as they are in English. If you are referring to a person, as in an Arab person or a Chinese person, the French equivalent is ''un Arabe'' or ''un Chinois''. However, if you are referring to the Arabic language or Chinese language, the French would not capitalize: ''l'arabe'', ''le chinois''. If the nationality is used as an adjective, it is normally left uncapitalized: ''un livre chinois'', ''un tapis arabe''.

==G: Simple Future of Irregular Verbs==

The simple future of irregular verbs, like the passé composé of many irregular verbs, must be memorized. What makes this somewhat easy is that verbs with similar endings normally have similar future stems.

For example, the future stem of the verb venir is viendr-. Verbs like venir (devenir, revenir) have a very similar stem (deviendr-, reviendr-).

==G: Issuing Commands in French - l'impératif==
*The ''nous'' form commands are used to say &quot;Let's...&quot;.
*The subject is not used when giving a command.

===Formation===
Take away the ending and add on the following shown in the table.

{| {{French Table|Grammar|The Imperative|L'impératif|104|7}}
!  
! colspan=2 | -er Verbs
! colspan=2 | -ir Verbs

|-
! Nous
| -ons||Parlons!||-issons||Finissons!||-ons||Vendons!
|-
! Vous
| -ez||Parlez!||-issez||Finissez!||-ez||Vendez!
|}

===Affirmative===

===Negative===

The negative imperative is formed by placing the imperative between &quot;ne&quot; and &quot;pas/jamais/rien/etcetera.&quot;

Ne parle pas! (Don't speak!)

Ne regarde jamais le soleil! (Never look at the sun!)

==G: Adverbs==
French adverbs, like their English counterparts, are used to modify [[French/Grammar/Adjectives|adjectives]], other adverbs, and [[French/Grammar/Verbs|verbs]] or clauses. They do not display any inflection; that is, their form does not change to reflect their precise role, nor any characteristics of what they modify.

===Formation===
In French, as in English, most adverbs are derived from adjectives. In most cases, this is done by adding the suffix ''-ment'' (&quot;-ly&quot;) to the adjective's feminine singular form. For example, the feminine singular form of ''lent'' (&quot;slow&quot;) is ''lente'', so the corresponding adverb is ''lentement'' (&quot;slowly&quot;); similarly, ''heureux'' &amp;rarr; ''heureusement'' (&quot;happy&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;happily&quot;).

As in English, however, the adjective stem is sometimes modified to accommodate the suffix:
Audio : [[media:French-Health2.ogg|Native French Speaker]]&lt;br/&gt;
* If the adjective ends in an ''i'', then ''-ment'' is added to the masculine singular (default) form, rather than to the feminine singular form:
** ''vrai'' &amp;rarr; ''vraiment'' (&quot;real&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;really&quot;)
** ''poli'' &amp;rarr; ''poliment'' (&quot;polite&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;politely&quot;)
* If the adjective ends in ''-ant'' or ''-ent'', then the corresponding adverb ends in ''-amment'' or ''-emment'', respectively:
** ''constant'' &amp;rarr; ''constamment'' (&quot;constant&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;constantly&quot;)
** ''récent'' &amp;rarr; ''récemment'' (&quot;recent&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;recently&quot;)
* Some adjectives make other changes:
** ''précis'' &amp;rarr; ''précisément'' (&quot;precise&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;precisely&quot;)
** ''gentil'' &amp;rarr; ''gentiment'' (&quot;nice&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;nicely&quot;)

Some adverbs are derived from adjectives in completely irregular fashions, not even using the suffix ''-ment'':
* ''bon'' &amp;rarr; ''bien'' (&quot;good&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;well&quot;)
* ''mauvais'' &amp;rarr; ''mal'' (&quot;bad&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;badly&quot;)
* ''meilleur'' &amp;rarr; ''mieux'' (&quot;better&quot;-adjective &amp;rarr; &quot;better&quot;-adverb)
* ''pire'' &amp;rarr; ''pis'' (&quot;worse&quot;-adjective &amp;rarr; &quot;worse&quot;-adverb)

And, as in English, many common adverbs are not derived from adjectives at all:
* ''ainsi'' (&quot;thus&quot; or &quot;thusly&quot;)

===Placement===
The placement of French adverbs is almost the same as the placement of English adverbs.
Audio : [[media:French-Health3.ogg|Native French Speaker]]&lt;br/&gt;
An adverb that modifies an adjective or adverb comes before that adjective or adverb:
* ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''complètement''' vrai'' (&quot;'''completely''' true&quot;)
* ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''pas''' possible'' (&quot;'''not''' possible&quot;)
* ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''tellement''' discrètement'' (&quot;'''so''' discreetly&quot;)
An adverb that modifies an [[French/Grammar/Tenses/Infinitive|Infinitive]] (verbal noun) generally comes after the infinitive:
* ''marcher '''lentement'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (&quot;to walk '''slowly'''&quot;)
But negative adverbs, such as ''pas'' (&quot;not&quot;), ''plus'' (&quot;not any more&quot;), and ''jamais'' come before the infinitive:
* ''ne '''pas''' marcher'' (&quot;'''not''' to walk&quot;)

An adverb that modifies a main verb or clause comes either after the verb, or before the clause:
* ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Lentement''' il commença à marcher'' or ''Il commença '''lentement''' à marcher'' (&quot;Slowly, he began to walk&quot; or &quot;He began slowly to walk&quot;).
Note that, unlike in English, this is true even of negative adverbs:
* ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Jamais''' je n'ai fait cela'' or ''Je n'ai '''jamais''' fait cela'' (&quot;'''Never''' have I done that&quot; or &quot;I've '''never''' done that&quot;)

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Present perfect|review-id=french-present-perfect}} ==
&lt;div id='french-present-perfect'&gt;
=== Auxiliary verb formation ===
The auxiliary verb is always either {{French/Word|avoir}} or {{French/Word|être}}. When the auxiliary verb is conjugated in the {{French/Word|passé composé}} the auxiliary verb is conjugated in the present indicative:
: {{French/Word|J'ai fini.|en=I have finished.}}

=== Past participle formation ===
* ''-er'' verbs: replace ''-er'' with ''é''
* ''-ir'' verbs: replace ''-ir'' with ''i''
* ''-re'' verbs: replace ''-re'' with ''u''

=== {{French/Section||Past participle agreement|audio=French-vacances16.ogg}} ===
The past participle must agree with the direct object of a clause in gender and plurality if the direct object goes before the verb.

If the direct object is masculine and singular, there is no change:
: {{French/Word|J'ai fini le jeu.|en=I have finished the game.}}
: {{French/Word|Je l'ai fini.|en=I have finished it.}}

If the direct object is feminine and singular, add an ''e'' to the past participle:
: {{French/Word|J'ai fini la tâche.|en=I have finished the task.}}
: {{French/Word|Je l'ai finie.|en=I have finished it.}}

If the direct object is masculine and plural, add an ''s'' to the past participle:
: {{French/Word|J'ai fini les jeux.|en=I have finished the games.}}
: {{French/Word|Je les ai finis.|en=I have finished them.}}

If the direct object is feminine and plural, add an ''es'' to the past participle:
: {{French/Word|J'ai fini les tâches.|en=I have finished the tasks.}}
: {{French/Word|Je les ai finies.|en=I have finished them.}}

=== {{French/Word|Avoir}} or {{French/Word|être}}? ===
In most circumstances, the auxiliary verb is {{French/Word|avoir}}. However, under certain situations, the auxiliary verb is {{French/Word|être}}. This occurs when the verb is reflexive or is one of sixteen special verbs that take {{French/Word|être}} (note that when a direct object is used with these verbs, {{French/Word|avoir}} is used).
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-present-perfect --&gt;

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Infinitives|review-id=french-infinitives}} ==
&lt;div id='french-infinitives'&gt;
The formation of a conjugated verb + infinitive is the same in French as it is in English: conjugate the first verb, then append the infinitive.

; {{French/Word|Aimer}}
: {{French/Word|J'aime jouer au tennis.|en=I like to play tennis.}}
: {{French/Word|J'aime lire le journal au lit.|en=I like to read the newspaper in bed.}}

; {{French/Word|Devoir}}

; {{French/Word|Venir}}

; {{French/Word|Vouloir}}
: {{French/Word|Je veux aller au centre commercial.|en=I want to go to the mall.}}

However, when one uses {{French/Word|vouloir}} to request something of someone else, one must use the subjunctive:
: {{French/Word|Je veux que tu fasses la vaisselle.|en=I want you to do the dishes.}}

; {{French/Word|Pouvoir}}

; {{French/Word|Faire causitif}}
: {{French/Word|Je le fais réparer.|en=I have it fixed.}}

; {{French/Word|Futur proche}}
: {{French/Word|Je vais aller.|en=I'm going to go.}}

=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns come before the verb they modify:
: {{French/Word|Je vais le voir.|en=I'm going to see it.}}

=== Negation ===
Either the conjugated verb or the infinitive can be negated, each with different meanings:
: {{French/Word|Je n'aime pas marcher.|en=I don't like to walk.}}
: {{French/Word|J'aime ne pas marcher.|en=I like to not walk.}}

==G: Personal Pronouns Review==
{{main|w:French personal pronouns}}
===Direct Objects===

While the subject of a sentence initiates an action (the verb), the direct object is the one that is affected by the action. A direct object pronoun is used to refer to the direct object of a previous sentence: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Pierre voit '''le cambrioleur'''.||Pierre sees '''the burglar'''.
|-
| Pierre '''le''' voit.||Pierre sees '''him'''.
|}

The following table shows the various types of direct object pronouns:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! French
| me, m'||te, t'||le, l'||la, l'||nous||vous||les
|-
! English
| me&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||him, it||her, it||us&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||them
|}

Notes:
*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''me, te, nous'', and ''vous'' are also used as indirect objects to mean ''to me, to you, to us'', and ''to you'' respectively.
* The pronoun form with an apostrophe is used before a vowel. 
* The direct object pronoun for ''nous'' and ''vous'' is the same as the subject.
* When the direct object comes before a verb in a perfect tense, a tense that uses a past participle, the direct object must agree in gender and plurality with the past participle. For example, in the phrase ''Je les ai eus'', or ''I had them'', the past participle would be spelled ''eus'' if the direct object, ''les'', were referring to a masculine object, and ''eues'' if ''les'' were referring to a feminine object.

===Indirect Objects===

An indirect object is an object that would be asked for with ''To whom...?'' or ''From whom...?''. It is called indirect because it occurs usually together with a direct object which is affected directly by the action: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Il donne du pain '''à Pierre'''.||The man gives some bread '''to Pierre'''.
|-
| Il '''lui''' donne du pain.||He gives bread '''to him'''.
|}

The following table shows the various types of direct object pronouns:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! French
| me, m'||te, t'||lui||nous||vous||leur
|-
! English
| to me&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||to you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||to him, to her||to us&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||to you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||to them
|}

Notes:
*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''me, te, nous'', and ''vous'' are also used as direct objects to mean ''me, you, us'', and ''you'' respectively.
* The pronoun form with an apostrophe is used before a vowel. 
* The indirect object pronoun for nous and vous is the same as the subject.
* The indirect object pronouns do '''not''' agree with the past participle like the direct object pronouns do. When ''me, te, nous'', and ''vous'' are used in a perfect tense, the writer must decide whether they are used as direct or indirect object pronouns. This is done by looking at the verb and seeing what type of action is being performed.

The bread ''is given'' by the man (direct). Pierre ''gets the given'' apple (indirect).

===The Pronoun ''Y''===
====Indirect Object Pronoun - ''to it, to them''====
The French pronoun ''y'' is used to replace an object of a prepositional phrase introduced by à.
*Je réponds aux questions. - J' y réponds.
*I respond to the questions. - I respond to them.
Note that ''lui'' and ''leur'', and not ''y'', are used when the object refers to a person or persons.

====Replacement of Places - ''there''====
The French pronoun ''y'' replaces a prepositional phrase referring to a place that begins with any preoposition except ''de'' (for which ''en'' is used).
*Les hommes vont en France. - Les hommes y vont.
*The men go to France - The men go there.
Note that ''en'', and not ''y'' is used when the object is of the preposition ''de''.

====Idioms====
*Ça y est! - It's Done!
*J'y suis! - I get it!

===En===

Note how we say ''Je veux du pain'' to say 'I want some bread' ? But what happens when we want to say 'I want some' without specifying what we want? In these cases, we use the pronoun 'en'.
As well, 'en' can mean 'of it' when 'it' is not specified. For instance, instead of saying ''J'ai besoin de l'argent'', if the idea of money has already been raised, we can just say 'J'en ai besoin'. This is because what ''en'' does is replace ''du'', ''de la'' or ''des'' when there is nothing after it.

Like with 'me', 'te' and other pronouns, ''en'' (meaning 'some') comes before the verb. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|Tu joues du piano? Non, je n'en joue pas||Do you play piano? No, I don't play it.
|-
|Vous prenez du poisson? Oui, j'en prends.||Are you having fish? Yes, I'm having some.
|-
|Vous avez commandé de l'eau? Oui, nous en avons commandé. ||Did you order some water? Yes, we ordered some.
|}

==G: Commands with Pronouns - L'impératif==
When expressing positive commands, there are several rules one must remember when using object pronouns. These are:
*The pronouns are attached the verb with a hyphen.
**Retrouve-la. - Find it.
*Me and Te become moi and toi.
**Donnez-moi les vidéos. - Give me the videos.
*''Le'', ''la'', and ''les'' precede all other object pronouns.
**Donnez-le-moi. - Give it to me.

==G: Present Conditional==

The ''present conditional'' tense is used to describe a hypothetical situation that would normally occur now.  For example, it may be a hypothetical situation, a polite request, or an event that didn't happen as expected. 

To conjugate a verb in the Conditional, one takes the infinitive and appends the same endings as when using the ''imparfait'', as according to the table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Subject||Add Ending||Conjugated Verb
|-
|Je||-ais||réussirais
|-
|Tu||-ais||réussirais
|-
|Il / Elle / On||-ait||réussirait
|-
|Nous||-ions||réussirions
|-
|Vous||-iez||réussiriez
|-
|Ils / Elles||-aient||réussiraient
|}


==V: Forms of Payment==
* Argent - Money
* carte - card
* carte de credit - credit card


==V: Economics==

==V: Handling Money==
saving, investing, etc

==V: Going to a Bank==

Darcs is a distributed version control system.  Being a distributed system, the darcs model is rather different from that of more popular systems like CVS or Subversion and these differences take some time getting used to.  One of our goals in writing this guide is to help you get a better grasp of the darcs model.  We also hope to provide a useful supplementary guide to using darcs, one which is oriented towards tasks you might like to accomplish and makes heavy use of walked-through examples.  For curious users and potential darcs developers, we would like to provide you with a friendly introduction to patch theory and the recent work on using a notion of conflictors to correct the current flaws in patch theory.

Casual users be warned, the stuff you're about to read is not for the faint of heart!  If you're a day-to-day darcs user, you probably do not need to read anything from this page on.  However, if you are interested in learning how darcs ''really'' works, we invite you to roll up your sleeves, and follow us in this guided tour of the growing Theory of Patches.

== What is the theory of patches? ==

The darcs patch formalism is the underlying &quot;math&quot; which helps us understand how darcs should behave when exchanging patches between repositories.  It is implemented in the darcs engine as data structures
for representing sequences of patches and Haskell functions equivalent to the operations in the formalism. 
This section is addressed at two audiences: curious onlookers and people wanting to participate in the development of the darcs core.  My aim is to help you understand the intuitions behind all this math, so that you can get up to speed with current conflictors research as fast as possible and start making contributions.  You should note that I [[User:Kowey|myself]] am only starting to learn about patch theory and conflictors, so there may be mistakes ahead.

== Why all this math? ==

One difference between centralized and distributed version control systems is that &quot;merging&quot; is something that we do practically all the time, so it is doubly important that we ''get merging right''.  Turning the problem of version control into a math problem has two effects: it lets us abstract all of the irrelevant implementation details away, and it forces us to make sure that whatever techniques we come up with are fundamentally sound, that they do not fall apart when things get increasingly complicated.  Unfortunately, math can be difficult for people who do not make use of it on a regular basis, so what we attempt to do in this manual is to ease you into the math through the use of concrete, illustrated examples.

A word of caution though, &quot;getting merging right&quot; does not necessarily consist of having clever behaviour with respect to conflicts.  We will begin by focusing on successful, non-conflicting merges and move on to the darcs approach to handling conflicts.  

{{Yellow Warning|Note that the notation we use follows that from FOSDEM 2006, and not the darcs patch theory appendix.  Namely, patch composition is written left to right. &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; means that B is applied after A}}

== Context, patches and changes ==

Let us begin with a little shopping.
Arjan is working to build a shopping list for the upcoming darcs hackathon.  As we speak, his repository contains a single file ''s_list'' with the contents
 1 apples
 2 bananas
 3 cookies
 4 rice
&lt;small&gt;Note:the numbers you see are just line numbers; they are not part of the file contents&lt;/small&gt;

As we will see in this and other examples in this book, we will often need to assign a name to the state of the repository.  We call this name a '''context'''.  For example, we can say that Arjan's repository is a context &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, defined by there being a file s_list with the contents mentioned above.
[[Image:Darcs-ag-initial.png|center|the initial context]]

Arjan makes a modification which consists of adding a line in ''s_list''.  His new file looks like this:
 1 apples
 2 bananas
 3 beer
 4 cookies
 5 rice

When Arjan records this '''change''' (adding beer), we produce a patch which tells us not only what contents Arjan added (&quot;beer&quot;) but where he added them, namely to line 3 of ''s_list''.  We can say that in his repository, we have moved from context &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; to context &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; via a '''patch''' A.  We can write this using a compact notation like &lt;math&gt;{}^oA^a&lt;/math&gt; or using the graphical representation below: [[Image:Darcs-ag-patchA.png|center|patch A]]

== Sequential patches ==

Starting from this context, Arjan might decide to make further changes.  His new changes would be patches that apply to the context of the previous patches.  So if Arjan makes a new patch &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; on top of this, it would take us from context &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to some new context &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  The next patch would take us from this context to yet another new context &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and so on and so forth.  Patches which apply on top of each other like this are called '''sequential patches'''.  We write them in ''left to right'' order as in the table below, either representing the contexts explicitly or leaving them out for brevity:

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!|with context||sans context (shorthand)
|-
||&lt;math&gt;{}^oA^a&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
|-
||&lt;math&gt;{}^oA^aB^b&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt;
|-
||&lt;math&gt;{}^oA^aB^bC^c&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;ABC&lt;/math&gt;
|}

All darcs repositories are simply sequences of patches as above; however, when performing a complex operation such as an undo or exchanging patches with another user, it becomes absolutely essential that we have some mechanism for rearranging patches and putting them in different orders.  Darcs patch theory is essentially about giving a precise definition to the ways in which patches and patch-trees can be manipulated and transformed while maintaining the coherency of the repository.

== Inverses ==

Let's return to the example from the beginning of this module.  Arjan has just added beer to our hackathon shopping list, but in a sudden fit of indecisiveness, he reconsiders that thought and wants to undo his change.  In our example, this might consist of firing up his text editor and remove the offending line from the shopping list.  But what if his changes were complex and hard to keep track of?  The better thing to do would be to let darcs figure it out by itself. Darcs does this by computing an '''inverse''' patch, that is, a patch which makes the exact opposite change of some other patch:

{{Definition|The inverse of patch &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;P^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which is '''the''' patch for which the composition &lt;math&gt;PP^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; makes no changes to the context and for which the inverse of the inverse is the original patch.}}

So above, we said that Arjan has created a patch &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which adds beer to the shopping list, passing from context &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, or more compactly, &lt;math&gt;{}^{o}A^{a}&lt;/math&gt;.  Now we are going to create the inverse patch &lt;math&gt;A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which ''removes'' beer from the shopping list and brings us back to context &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;. In the compact context-patch notation, we would write this as &lt;math&gt;{}^{o}A^{a}{A^{-1}}^{o}&lt;/math&gt;.  Graphically, we would represent the situation like this:

[[Image:Darcs-ag-inverse.png|center|An inverse patch makes the opposite change of another patch]]

Patch inverses may seem trivial, but as we will see later on in this module, they are a fundamental operation and absolutely crucial to make some of the fancier stuff -- like merging -- work correctly.  One of the rules we impose in darcs is that every patch must have an inverse.  These rules are what we call '''patch properties'''.  A patch property tells us things which must be true about a patch in order for darcs to work.  People often like to dream up new kinds of patches to extend darcs's functionality, and defining these patch properties is how we know that their new patch types will behave properly under darcs.  The first of these properties is dead simple:
{{Darcs patch property|Every patch must have an inverse}}

== Commutation ==

Arjan was lucky to realise that he wanted to undo his change as quickly as he did.  But what happens if he was a little slower to realise his mistake?  What if he makes some other changes before realising that he wants to undo the first change?  Is it possible to undo his first change without undoing all the subsequent changes?  It sometimes is, but to do so, we need to define an operation called '''commutation'''.

Consider a variant of the example above.  As usual, Arjan adds beer to the shopping list.  Next, he decides to add some pasta on line 5 of the file:
[[Image:Darcs-ag-pre-commute.png|center|Beer and pasta]]

The question is how darcs should behave if Arjan now decides that he does not want beer on the shopping list after all.  Arjan simply wants to remove the patch that adds the beer, without touching the one which adds pasta.  The problem is that darcs repositories are simple, stupid sequences of patches.  We can't just remove the beer patch, because then there would no longer be a context for the pasta patch!  Arjan's first patch &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; takes us to context &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; like so: &lt;math&gt;{}^{o}A^{a}&lt;/math&gt;, and his second patch takes us to context &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, notably starting from the initial context &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;
{}^{a}B^{b}&lt;/math&gt;.  Removing patch &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; would be pulling the rug out from under patch &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  The trick behind this is to somehow ''change the order'' of patches &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  This is precisely what commutation is for:  

{{Info|The commutation of patches &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is represented by &lt;math&gt;XY \leftrightarrow {Y_1}{X_1}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; are intended to perform the same change as &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;}}

=== Why not keep our old patches? ===

To understand commutation, you should understand why we cannot keep our original patches, but are forced to rely on evil step sisters instead.  It helps to work with a concrete example such as the beer and pasta one above.   While we could write the sequence &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; to represent adding beer and then pasta, simply writing &lt;math&gt;BA&lt;/math&gt; for pasta and then beer would be a very foolish thing to do.

Put it this way: what would happen if we applied &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; before &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;? We add pasta to line 5 of the file:
 1 apples
 2 bananas
 3 cookies
 4 rice
 5 pasta

Does something seem amiss to you?  We continue by adding beer to line 3.  If you pay attention to the contents of the end result, you might notice that the order of our list is subtly wrong.  Compare the two lists to see why:

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!|&lt;math&gt;BA&lt;/math&gt; (wrong!)
!|&lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; (right)
|-
||
 1 apples
 2 bananas
 3 beer
 4 cookies
 5 rice
 6 pasta
||
 1 apples
 2 bananas
 3 beer
 4 cookies
 5 pasta
 6 rice
|}

It might not matter here because it is only a shopping list, but imagine that it was your PhD thesis, or your computer program to end world hunger.  The error is all the more alarming because it is subtle and hard to pick out with the human eye.

The problem is one of context, specifically speaking, the context between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  In order for instructions like &quot;add pasta to line 5 of s_list&quot; to make any sense, they have to be in the correct context.  Fortunately, commutation is easy to do, it produces two new patches &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; which perform the same change as &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; but with a different context in between.

{{Exercises|Patch &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; is identical to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  It adds &quot;beer&quot; to line 3 of the shopping list.  But what should patch &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; do?}}  

One more important detail to note though!  We said earlier that getting the context right is the motivation behind commutation -- we can't simply apply patches &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; in a different order, &lt;math&gt;BA&lt;/math&gt; because that would get the context all wrong.  But context does not have any effect on whether A and B can commute (or how they should commute).  This is strictly a local affair.  Conversely, the commutation of A and B does not have any effect either on the global context: the sequences &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_1A_1&lt;/math&gt; (where the latter is the commutation of the former) start from the same context and end in the same context.

=== The complex undo revisited ===

Now that we know what the commutation operation does, let's see how we can use it to undo a patch that is buried under some other patch.  The first thing we do is commute Arjan's beer and pasta patches.  This gives us an alternate route to the same context.  But notice the small difference between &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt;!
[[Image:Darcs-ag-post-commute.png|center|commutation gives us two ways to get to the same patch]]

The purpose of commuting the patches is essentially to push patch &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; on to end of the list, so that we could simply apply its inverse.  Only here, it is not the inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that we want, but the inverse of its evil step sister &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;.  This is what applying that inverse does: it walks us back to the context &lt;math&gt;b1&lt;/math&gt;, as if we had only applied the pasta patch, but not the beer one.
[[Image:Darcs-ag-commute-inverse.png|center|commutation gives us two ways to get to the same patch]]

And now the undo is complete.  To sum up, when the patch we want to undo is buried under some other patch, we use commutation to squeeze it to the end of the patch sequence, and then compute the inverse of the commuted patch.  For the more sequentially minded, this is what the general scheme looks like:
[[Image:Darcs-complex-undo.png|center|Using commutation to handle a complex undo]]

{{Exercises|Imagine the opposite scenario: Arjan had started by adding pasta to the list, and then followed up with the beer.  
# If there was no commutation, what concretely would happen if he tried to remove the pasta patch, and not the beer patch?
# Work out how this undo would work using commutation.  Pay attention to the line numbers.
}}

=== Commutation and patches ===

Every time we define a type of patch, we have to define how it commutes with other patches.  Most of time, it is very straightforward.  When commuting two hunk patches, for instance, we simply adjust their line offset.  For instance, we want to put something on line 3 of the file, but if we use patch &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; to insert a single line before that, what used to be line 3 now becomes line 4!  So patch &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; inserts the line &quot;x&quot; into line 4, much like &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; inserts it into line 3. 

Some patches cannot be commuted.  For example, you can't commute the addition of a file with adding contents to it.  But for now, we focus on patches which ''can'' commute.

== Merging ==

:''Note: this might be a good place to take a break.  We are moving on to a new topic and new (but similar) examples''

We have presented two fundamental darcs operations: patch inverse and patch commutation.  It turns out these two operations are almost all that we need to perform a darcs merge.  

Arjan and Ganesh are working together to build a shopping list for the upcoming darcs hackathon.  Arjan initialises the repository and adds a file ''s_list'' with the contents
 1 apples
 2 bananas
 3 cookies
 4 rice

He then records his changes, and Ganesh performs a &lt;code&gt;darcs get&lt;/code&gt; to obtain an identical copy of his repository.  Notice that Arjan and Ganesh are starting from the same '''context'''
[[Image:Darcs-ag-initial.png|center|the initial context]]

Arjan makes a modification which consists of adding a line in ''s_list''.  His new file looks like this:
 1 apples
 2 bananas
 3 beer
 4 cookies
 5 rice

Arjan's patch brings him to a new context &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;:
[[Image:Darcs-ag-patchA.png|center|patch A]]

Now, in his repository, Ganesh also makes a modification; he decides that ''s_list'' is a little hard to decipher and renames the file to ''shopping''.  Remember, at this point, Ganesh has not seen Arjan's modifications.  He's still starting from the original context &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, and has moved a new context &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, via his patch &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;: [[Image:Darcs-ag-patchB.png|center|patch B]]

=== Parallel patches ===

At this point in time, Ganesh decides that it would be useful if he got a copy of Arjan's changes.  Roughly speaking we would like to pull Arjan's patch A into Ganesh's repository B.  But, there is a major problem!  Namely, Arjan's patch takes us from context &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; to context &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  Pulling it into Ganesh's repository would involve trying to apply it to context &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, which we simply do not know how to do.  Put another way: Arjan's patch tells us to add a line to file ''s_list''; however, in Ganesh's repository, ''s_list'' no longer exists, as it has been moved to ''shopping''.  How are we supposed to know that Arjan's change (adding the line &quot;beer&quot;) is supposed to apply to the new file ''shopping'' instead?  

[[Image:Darcs-ag-gpull-unknown.png|center|Ganesh attempts to pull from Arjan]]

Arjan and Ganesh's patches start from the same context o and diverge to different contexts a and b.  We say that their patches are '''parallel''' to each other, and write it as &lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt;.  In trying to pull patches from Arjan's repository, we are trying to merge these two patches.  The basic approach is to convert the parallel patches into the sequential patches &lt;math&gt;BA_1&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; does essentially the same change as &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; does, but within the context of b.  We want to produce the situation &lt;math&gt;{}^o{B^b}{A_1^{c}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Performing the merge ===

Converting Arjan and Ganesh's parallel patches into sequential ones requires little more than the inverse and commutation operations that we described earlier in this module:

# So we're starting out with just Ganesh's patch.  In context notation, we are at &lt;math&gt;{}^{o}{B}^{b}&lt;/math&gt;
# We calculate the inverse patch &lt;math&gt;B^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The sequence &lt;math&gt;BB^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; consists of moving s_list to shopping and then back again.  We've walked our way back to the original context: &lt;math&gt;{}^{o}{B}^{b}{B^{-1}}^{o}&lt;/math&gt;
# Now we can apply Arjan's patch without worries: &lt;math&gt;{}^{o}{B}^{b}{B^{-1}}^{o}A^{a}&lt;/math&gt;, but the result does not look very interesting, because we've basically got the same thing Arjan has now, not a merge.
# All we need to do is commute the last two patches, &lt;math&gt;{B}^{-1}{A}&lt;/math&gt;, to get a new pair of patches &lt;math&gt;{A_1}{B_1}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  Still, the end result doesn't seem to look very interesting since it results in exactly the same state as the last step: &lt;math&gt;{}^{o}{B}^{b}{A_1}^{c}{{B_1}^{-1}}^{a}&lt;/math&gt;
# However, one crucial difference is that the second to last patch produces just the state we're looking for! All we now have to do to get at it is to ditch the &lt;math&gt;{B_1}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; patch, which is only serving to undo Ganesh's precious work anyway. That is to say, by simply determining how to produce an &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; which will commute with &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, we have determined the version of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which will update Ganesh's repository.

[[Image:Darcs-merging.png|center|Merging via inverse and commutation]]

The end result of all this is that we have the patch we're looking for, &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; and a successful merge.

[[Image:Darcs-ag-gpull.png|center|We want a new patch A_1]]

=== Merging is symmetric ===

{{Side note|side=right|Merging is symmetric}} Concretely, we've talked about Ganesh pulling Arjan's patch into his repository, so what about the other way around?  Arjan pulling Ganesh's patch into his repository would work the same exact way, only that he is looking for a commuted version of Ganesh's patch &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; that would apply to his repository.  If Ganesh can pull Arjan's patch in, then Arjan can pull Ganesh's one too, and the result would be exactly the same:

[[Image:Darcs-ag-merge-symmetry.png|center|Merging is symmetric]]

{{Definition|The result of a merge of two patches &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is one of two patches &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt;, which satisfy the relationship
&lt;math&gt;A \vee B \Longrightarrow B{A_1} \leftrightarrow A{B_1}&lt;/math&gt;}}

The merge definition describes what should happen when you combine two parallel patches into a patch sequence.  The built-in symmetry is essential for darcs because a darcs repository is defined entirely by its patches.  Put 
another way, 
:''To be written''

=== The commutation with inverse property ===

The definition of a merge tells us what we want merging to look like.  How did we know how to actually perform that merge?  The answer comes out of the following property of commutation and inverse: if you can commute the inverse of a patch &lt;math&gt;A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; with some other patch &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then you can also commute the patch itself against &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Info|&lt;math&gt;B{A_1} \leftrightarrow A{B_1}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;{B_1}{A_1}^{-1} \leftrightarrow {A^{-1}}B&lt;/math&gt;, provided both commutations succeed.}}

Note how the left hand side of this property exactly matches the relationship demanded by the definition of a merge.  To see why this all works,

== Conflicts ==

Up to now, we have only dealt with merging patches that do not conflict with each other.  The next question of interest is how darcs should behave when they do.  

Consider the previous darcs hackathon example, where as usual, Arjan decides that the shopping list needs some beer.  In this scenario, Ganesh decides that you can't live on apples and cookies alone and records a patch adding &quot;pasta&quot; to the ''s_list'' file.  Now he wants to know what Arjan is up to, and so pulls the beer patch into his repository, but oh no! Arjan and Ganesh's patches conflict!  How should darcs behave here?

[[Image:Darcs-ag-conflict.png|center|Arjan and Ganesh's patches conflict]]

The darcs answer is that both patches ''cancel each other out'' so that neither of them has any effect.  The resulting shopping list has neither beer nor pasta.  This might sound alarming, but it's not as bad as you might think.  Darcs does not silently delete your code.  After canceling the two patches out, it adds a third patch into your working directory which indicates both sides of the conflict so that you can select the one that you want.  So any resolution you apply is a third patch which depends on the two conflicting ones.  If you did &lt;code&gt;darcs whatsnew&lt;/code&gt; on Ganesh's repository at this point, what you would get is something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
v v v v v v 
beer
-----------
pasta
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== How do we know we have a conflict? ===

It is intuitively obvious that Arjan's patch conflicts with Ganesh's, but intuition is useless if it does not translate into actual Haskell code.  The first issue is thus that of knowing that we have a conflict in the first place.  

All of this boils down to commutation.  We have a conflict if commutation is not defined for the two patches.  Let us briefly revisit the merge process described in the [[Understanding_Darcs/Patch_theory|previous chapter]].  When Ganesh tries to pull Arjan's patch in, he tries to adapt the patch to his context by performing the following sequence: invert his own patch, apply Arjan's patch &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, commute the inverted patch with Arjan's patch, and discard the evil step sister of his inverted patch. As we know, inverting patches is easy.  Ganesh's patch is inverted into something which remove 'pasta' from line 3 of the s_list file. On the other hand, when we try to commute that against Arjan's patch, we have a failure.  

Why?  Simply because it is how we define commutation between the two types of patches.  For instance, both Ganesh's and Arjan's patches are '''hunk patches'''.  The commutation of two hunk patches of the same file is defined in darcs using Haskell code very similar to the following (simplified from PatchCommute.lhs):&lt;pre&gt;
commuteHunk :: FileName -&gt; (FilePatchType, FilePatchType) -&gt; Maybe (Patch, Patch)
commuteHunk f (p1@(Hunk line2 old2 new2), p2@(Hunk line1 old1 new1))
  | line1 + lengthnew1 &lt; line2 = Just ...
  | line1 + lengthnew1 == line2 &amp;&amp; nonZero = Just ...
  | line2 + lengthold2 &lt; line1 = Just ...
  | line2 + lengthold2 == line1 &amp;&amp; nonZero = Just ...
  | otherwise = Nothing
  where nonZero = lengthold2 /= 0 &amp;&amp; lengthold1 /= 0 &amp;&amp; lengthnew2 /= 0 &amp;&amp; lengthnew1 /= 0 
        lengthnew1 = length new1
        lengthnew2 = length new2
        lengthold1 = length old1
        lengthold2 = length old2
&lt;/pre&gt; 
Only four cases are defined.  The first two cases cover the situation where the &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt; occurs in an earlier part file than &lt;code&gt;p2&lt;/code&gt; (even bumping up against it as in the second case).  The latter two cases cover the reverse situation (&lt;code&gt;p2&lt;/code&gt; is in earlier part of the file than &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;).  However, the case where &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;p2&lt;/code&gt; overlap simply does not fall into one of these possibilities.  Thus we have a conflict on our hands.

== Forced commutation ==

Now that we know we have a conflict, we now need to deal with this conflict in a sane manner.  We not only want to deal with the conflict at hand, but deal with it in a way which allows the conflict to propagate cleanly across an entire sequence of patches.  Well, darcs is based on commutation, so in order to keep things running smoothly, we need to make sure that things continue to commute.  So, we're going to define a secondary '''forced commutation''' operation that we only use when there is a conflict.

Recall the definition of commutation from the previous chapter:
{{Info|The commutation of patches &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is represented by &lt;math&gt;XY \leftrightarrow {Y_1}{X_1}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; are intended to perform the same change as &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;}}

The forced commutation is going to do something similar, but with a very odd twist.  Instead of patches &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; performing the same change as their respective ancestors &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;; forced commutation is going to give us patches, each of which makes the change that the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; patch does.  That is, normal commutation wants &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; to do roughly the same thing as &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, but forced commutation makes it do the same thing as &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  

{|border=1
!|operation
!|effect of &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt;
!|effect of &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
||normal commutation
||&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;
||&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;
|-
||forced commutation
||&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;
||&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Effects ===

As a side note, we're going to need a little terminology to keep ourselves from tripping over our tongues.  It's not very convenient to always talk about one patch making the same change as another patch, which is something we will be referring to a lot.  So let us compress things a little bit.  Instead of saying that patch &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; makes the same change as &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, let us simply say that the '''effect''' of &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  It is the same idea, but with slightly smoother terminology.

== Forced commutation in merging ==

Let us see what the implications of this are for Ganesh and Arjan.  We want to commute the inverse of Ganesh's patch (&lt;math&gt;B^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) against Arjan's patch.  Since the two patches conflict, we have to resort to forced commutation, which produces two patches &lt;math&gt;{A_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{B_1}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; with the following bizarre properties:
* the effect of &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;B^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;; it removes Ganesh's &quot;pasta&quot; from the shopping list. 
* likewise, the effect of &lt;math&gt;{B_1}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;; it adds Arjan's &quot;beer&quot; to the shopping list.

[[Image:Darcs-merging-forced.png|center|Merging a conflict through forced commutation]]

This is all very convenient, because if I may remind you, what we're really after is cancelling out the patches.  If we do the standard merging technique of simply removing &lt;math&gt;{B_1}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (so we don't add the beer after all), we will have succesfully undone Ganesh's pasta patch.  The merge is complete!

[[Image:Darcs-ag-conflict2.png|center|Resolving Arjan and Ganesh's conflict]]

=== Marking the conflict ===
 
But wait! We can't just leave things undone.  How is the poor developer supposed to know if there is a conflict, if darcs handles them by undoing things?  The answer is that we're not going to stop here.  Undoing the conflict is a very important first step, as we will see in further detail below.  Look at it this way.  We know there was a conflict, because of the way commutation was defined, and we know which patches were involved in the conflict.  So whenever this happens, we &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; undo everything, and then inspect the contents of the conflicting patches, and use that to create a new conflict-marking patch.

''FIXME:insert image here showing the conflict-marking patch''

== Darcs 2 ==

 :''TODO: introduce this section''
 
=== The exponential merge problem ===

Unfortunately, the darcs 1 merge algorithm has the property that certain merges -- merges that people have experienced in real life -- are exponential in time with respect to the size of conflict (in number of conflicting patches).  This leads to the problem that some users have experienced where users would do a &lt;tt&gt;darcs pull&lt;/tt&gt; and inexplicably, darcs would just sit there and hang... 

So how does the new darcs 2 fix this problem?  What's going on under the hood?

=== Conflictors ===

The notion of conflictors is essentially that we would special patches that contain a list of patches they conflict with

      <comment>Fixed templates</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">As usual with [[Main Page|wikibooks]] and the [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia]], ''you'' can edit all the pages of this module. Please, whenever you spot a mistake, correct it, and enter your own additions (new ''false friends'' etc.) if you like.

This page is designed to help with this task.

== Correcting mistakes ==

If you spot a mistake on one of the pages of this wikibook, please click at the ''edit this page'' button at the top of the page, find the mistake in the opening edit box and correct it.

== Adding a new false friend ==

If you want to add a false friend, just go to the respective page and click the ''edit this page'' button at the top of the page. An edit window opens, and you can enter your material.

Both for your convenience and to ensure that future design changes can apply to the whole module, use the following ''FalseFriends'' template:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/FalseFriends|ID
|LG1 '''''WORD1'''''
|LG2 ''EQUIVALENT OF WORD1'' ‘ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF EQUIVALENT’
|LG2 '''''WORD2'''''
|LG1 ''EQUIVALENT OF WORD2'' ‘ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF EQUIVALENT’
|MAPNAME}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here, ''LG1'' and ''LG2'' are the abbreviations of the relevant languages (see [[#Legend for the navigation table|above]]). Most other items to be entered should be self-evident. If you do not know the English translation, just leave it out, someone else will add it.

''ID'' is an identifier tag ('anchor') that can be used to link different pages of the wikibook. You can just leave this spot empty if you edit only one page (but be sure to write the &quot;|&quot;!), or make up any name (preferably not just a number, which worked fine with the 'old' false friends that were entered by a computer program).

You can also just leave out &quot;|MAPNAME&quot; (in this case together with the &quot;|&quot;, so that the last line can be just &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;. If a map for the respective 'false friend' exists, this is the name of the map (more precisely, the part of the page name after &quot;False_Friends_of_the_Slavist/Map_&quot;).

A possible way to fill this scheme might be:

{| border=1 width=100%
|what you enter
|what appears on the page
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/FalseFriends|ffknez
|Pol. '''''ksiądz'''''
|Cr. ''svećenik'' ‘priest’
|Cr. '''''knez'''''
|Pol. ''książę'' ‘prince, duke’
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;border-top:2px solid navy&quot;&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;  bgcolor=&quot;#dcdcdc&quot;&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ffknez
&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Pol. '''''ksiądz'''''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;Cr. ''svećenik'' ‘priest’
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;  bgcolor=&quot;#dcdcdc&quot;&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;Cr. '''''knez'''''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;Pol. ''książę'' ‘prince, duke’
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[/Map none|map]]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
|}

== Adding new data on a monolingual page ==

Whenever you enter new information on bilingual pages, it would be great if you could update the respective monolingual pages as well. (You find links to these pages at the head of each bilingual page, under the flags.) Of course this is not compulsory. If you do not do this, hopefully someone else will do it for you, so just go ahead and work on whatever you find interesting.

The structure of the monolingual pages is a bit different from the bilingual ones. Here, each 'false friend' looks basically like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Mono|ID
|WORD|
INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THE WORD IS A FALSE FRIEND AND WHERE NOT
|MAPNAME|
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT MEANINGS THE WORD HAS IN WHICH LANGUAGES
|[INFORMATION ON WHICH LANGUAGES ARE STILL MISSING]
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

''ID'' and ''MAPNAME'' are the same as on the bilingual pages. The other items should be self-explanatory. If you want to add information about a new 'false friend', best of all copy-paste an existing model from the same page and adopt it to your needs.

== Adding or modifying a map ==

Thanks to a quite sophisticated use of [[w:Wiki|wiki]] technology, editing the semasiological maps (and creating new ones!) is now as easy as pie. You do not have to meddle with graphics, you just have to modify the data in a little table of the following structure:

&lt;span id=&quot;maptemplate&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/MapConstructor|ID|
Lg.  |x|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|Word         |
-----|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-------------|
R.   | | | | | | | | | |
Blr. | | | | | | | | | |
Ukr. | | | | | | | | | |
Pol. | | | | | | | | | |
Ka.  | | | | | | | | | |
Lso. | | | | | | | | | |
USo. | | | | | | | | | |
Cz.  | | | | | | | | | |
Slk. | | | | | | | | | |
Sln. | | | | | | | | | |
Cr.  | | | | | | | | | |
Bo.  | | | | | | | | | |
Sb.  | | | | | | | | | |
Mk.  | | | | | | | | | |
Bg.  | | | | | | | | | |
-----|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-------------|
|MapHeading=
|Number of meanings=
|Meaning1=
|Meaning2=
|Meaning3=
|Meaning4=
|Meaning5=
|Meaning6=
|Meaning7=
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this table, enter an '''x''' into the second column of every language where you have data. (If the word does not exist in the respective language, enter only this '''x''' and leave the rest of the row free. In the resulting map, the '''x''' provides for a white country silhouette; without the '''x''', the space remains grey.)

The numbers of the columns correspond to the numbers of the meanings below the table. In the table itself, enter the '''number''' of the respective column (not just an '''x'''!) for every meaning the word has in the respective language. Leave a space in those columns where the meaning is not represented in the language.

In the column 'word', enter the false friend in the language of the row (preferably with no spaced around it, e.g. |жена|), or leave the blank space as it is where you do not know the word. If you know that a no false friend of this kind exists in the respective language, enter Ø.

''ID'' is the same as above. ''MapHeading'' may be the Proto-Slavic form of the compared words (with an asterisk before it and double apostrophes around it to make it italic, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;''*mǫžъ''&lt;/nowiki&gt;), the common phonetic form (in IPA transcription and in square brackets or slashes, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;[masa]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) the origin of a common loanword (e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;German ''Schiene''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) or anything else you consider representative of the false friend in all the languages compared.

For example, if you enter the following data, you get [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=False_Friends_of_the_Slavist/Map_zhena&amp;oldid=371743 this map].

&lt;pre&gt;
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/MapConstructor|ff1|
Lg.  |x|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|Word         |
-----|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-------------|
R.   |x| |2| | | | | |жена|
Blr. |x| |2| | | | | |жонка|
Ukr. |x|1| | | | | | |жінка|
Pol. |x| |2| | | | | |żona|
Ka.  | | | | | | | | | |
Lso. | | | | | | | | | |
USo. | | | | | | | | | |
Cz.  |x|1|2| | | | | |žena|
Slk. |x|1|2| | | | | |žena|
Sln. |x|1|2| | | | | |žena|
Cr.  |x|1|2| | | | | |žena|
Bo.  |x|1|2| | | | | |žena|
Sb.  |x|1|2| | | | | |жена|
Mk.  |x|1|2| | | | | |жена|
Bg.  |x|1|2| | | | | |жена|
-----|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-------------|
|MapHeading=''*žena''
|Number of meanings=2
|Meaning1=woman
|Meaning2=wife
|Meaning3=
|Meaning4=
|Meaning5=
|Meaning6=
|Meaning7=
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to create a completely new map page, just copy the [[#maptemplate|template above]] into a newly created page and fill the table as described.

== Adding information on printed false-friends dictionaries ==

If you know a printed false-friends dictionary that is not mentioned yet on the corresponding page of this wikibook, you should add it in the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Books}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; sections both of the respective language pair and of the two languages involved.

If a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Books}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; section does not exist yet on any one of the three pages, add it immediately before &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Bibliography}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It should look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Books|
And here come the bibliographical data of the books,
in ordinary wiki formatting.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Usually the citations begin with an asterisk (*), which makes them appear in a list with bullets in front.

'''Important:''' Do not use any ''equal'' signs (=) in the bibliographical data! They cause a software error, so that no books at all appear in the respective section. Use dashes (–), full stops (.), slashes (/) or anything like that instead.

== Adding a new bilingual page ==

If you want to enter false friends in a language pair that does not exist yet, just click at the respective red '''X''' in the [[#navtab|navigation table]]. In the edit box that opens you will have to enter the following templates to make the page look similar to the existing ones:

At the top of the page, write

&lt;pre&gt;
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Head|LANG1|LANG2}}
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Start}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

with LANG1 and LANG2 being the internal symbols of the two languages:

* '''bg''' for Bulgarian
* '''bih''' (not bs!) for Bosnian
* '''by''' (not be!) for Belarusian
* '''cz''' (not cs!) for Czech
* '''hr''' for Croatian
* '''ka''' (not csb!) for Kashubian
* '''lso''' for Lower Sorbian
* '''mk''' for Macedonian
* '''pl''' for Polish
* '''rus''' (not ru!) for Russian
* '''sk''' for Slovak
* '''slo''' (not sl!) for Slovenian
* '''ua''' (not uk!) for Ukrainian
* '''uso''' for Upper Sorbian
* '''yu''' (not sr or cs!) for Serbian

At the bottom of the page, write

&lt;pre&gt;
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Bibliography}}
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/End}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Between the described head and foot passages of the page, enter new 'false friends' as explained [[#Adding a new false friend|above]].

== Adding a new language ==

Of course, there are more than 15 [[w:Slavic languages|Slavonic languages]], so the module can always be expanded. However, this means that the [[{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/NavTab|navigation table template]] has to be modified, and this is a task for someone who knows some [[w:HTML|HTML]], and it is probably best done in some external editor. Apart from that, several new templates have to be created, namely:
* [[{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Lang-xx]] (with xx being the internal abbreviation for the new language) containing the name of the language in English
* [[{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Jaz-xx]] containing the name of the new language in the language itself
* [[{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Flag-xx]] containing the internal address of the flag for the new language
* [[{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Wiki-xx]] containing the internal address of the Wikipedia article about the new language (preferably in the language itself).

When opening a new monolingual page for the new language, note that the structure of a monolingual page is basically the same as the one of a [[#Adding a new bilingual page|bilingual page]]. Only instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Head|LANG1|LANG2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, you use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Head|xx|SPEAKERS}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (with xx as above and SPEAKERS being the approximate number of speakers of the language).

If you want to draw new maps that contain information about the new language, you will also have to upload the respective shadings [[:Image:FFmap-xx-1.gif]], [[:Image:FFmap-xx-2.gif]], [[:Image:FFmap-xx-3.gif]], [[:Image:FFmap-xx-4.gif]], [[:Image:FFmap-xx-5.gif]], [[:Image:FFmap-xx-6.gif]] and [[:Image:FFmap-xx-7.gif]] and [[:Image:FFmap-xx-x.gif]], copy [[:Image:FFmap-rus-_.gif]] to [[:Image:FFmap-xx-_.gif]] and modify [[:Image:FFmap-CountryNames.gif]]. If the symbolic territory of the new language intersects with the territory of an existing language, you will also have to modify the shadings belonging to that language. Apart from that, it is probably better not to touch the existing [[{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/MapConstructor]] but to create a new template on its basis, so that you do not have to edit ''all'' the map pages using the template.

'''So, if you would like to add 'false friends' in a language that is not covered by the [[#navtab|navigation table]] and do not know how to do it, you can put a request at the [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist|discussion page]].'''

== What else can I do? ==

Have a look at the '''discussion page''' of the language(s) you are interested in most: [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Russian|Russian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Belarusian|Belarusian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Ukrainian|Ukrainian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Polish|Polish]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Kashubian|Kashubian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Lower Sorbian|Lower Sorbian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Upper Sorbian|Upper Sorbian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Czech|Czech]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Slovak|Slovak]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Slovenian|Slovenian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Croatian|Croatian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Bosnian|Bosnian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Serbian|Serbian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Macedonian|Macedonian]], or [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Bulgarian|Bulgarian]]. They all include a '''Proofreading Center''' where tasks to be done by speakers of the respective languages are listed.

Apart from that, see the '''[[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist|main discussion page of this module]]''', where more general questions of what should be done with this book are discussed.

If you know a Slavonic language well, you can also help with completing the '''[[../Maps|semasiological maps]]'''. If you see that information about 'your' language is not yet included in the map, you can add it very easily, and this information can afterwards be used to complete the mono- and bilingual pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The major problem with this section is that it's rather hard to decide how to revise for it. It encompasses a whole variety of areas but a lot of it centres around being able to read through a text (rapidly!) and answering questions on it. Areas that have been looked at are:
* '''Logic tests''' - the usual puzzle which involves logical reasoning and working out how things work. The problem itself is not too complex but requires you to read diagrams and extract information from them. I found a lot of these questions similar to solving a [[wikipedia:Sudoku|Sudoko]] - the thinking isn't really [[wikipedia:Lateral_thinking|lateral]] but you do have to be tenacious and not get distracted to squeeze the answer out.
* '''Text comprehension''' - You are given a random piece of text and are given 3 to 6 questions to answer on it - the answers are often quite vague. They may ask you what an author is expressing in a given sentence with two answers seeming quite similar so it may be a good idea to boost your descriptive adjectives knowledge. A GAMSAT ambiguous question may ask you whether the author is being facile, facetious, ironic or sarcastic in a given sentence. Not so easy, is it?
* '''Artistic/social appreciation''' - These questions involve getting beyond the facts and understanding the meaning of piece of work which can be a cartoon, a painting or a poem. For example, you may be given a satirical cartoon (maybe something by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bell_%28cartoonist%29 Steve Bell]) and asked to discern the author's intent and what/who s/he is attacking.

These three areas are often combined - for example, in 2006, there was a text critically appraising a painting and the questions focussed on what both the text and the painting were expressing. The Logic Tests aren't as prevalent as some would like and, from my experience, in the 2006 exam, there was very little of the standard logical tests that were featured in the past GAMSAT exams.
==Revision tactics==
I feel that reading columnnist or editorials provide good material. Read them and ask yourself what points are being made by the author. What examples are they using to back up their argumentation? Note various [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_speech figures of speech] and be sure to know the following:
* [[wikipedia:Hyperbole|Hyperbole]]
* [[wikipedia:Understatement|Understatement]]
* [[wikipedia:Irony|Irony]]
* [[wikipedia:Metaphor|Metaphor]]
* [[wikipedia:Sarcasm|Sarcasm]]

I would also suggest getting hold of a poetry anthology - try to get something that spans both the modern and classical eras - and read your way through it noticing the way in which poetry works and think about what the poet is trying to tell us. [[wikipedia:Poetry_analysis|This article]] on poetry analysis is very good and an excellent place to start to learn more about poetry. For a briefer overview of Poetry, try [[wikipedia:Poetry|this]].

Finally, a general curiosity about the written word will help your performance in this section. If you can't afford to buy newspapers every day, you should remember that a lot of newspapers publish their content online and you can read them for free. If you find a word you don't know (or are unsure of the exact meaning) then look it up - you never know when it can come in useful! Expand your vocabulary by learning new words - one excellent way of doing that is learning one new word a day. Here's a [http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive list of words of the day]. 

==Source Material==
In this section you will be presented with either a passage of text, a saying, cartoon or a diagram, and then have to answer questions about this source material. 
The source material types commonly include:
# Non-fiction text
# Fiction text
# Poetry
# Sayings/quotes
# Cartoons
# Diagrams
Most questions will be text based so you should obviously devote more time to preparing for these questions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The luckiest feature of Indonesian philosophical tradition is its integral understanding of '''[[wikt:philosophia|philosophia]]''' (''love of wisdom''). Dichotomy of ‘reasoning’ and ‘feeling’ occurring in the Western philosophical tradition, as regretted by Frithjof Schuon in his ''The Transfiguration of Man'' (1995), doesn’t happen in Indonesia, for it has an original word which integrates ‘reasoning’ and ‘feeling’ in unison, called ''budi''. ''Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia'', an officially wide-spread dictionary of Indonesian language, defines the word ''budi'' as ''inner faculty which integrates reasoning and feeling to judge the good and the evil''. All creation and products of material and intellectual kind created by means of ''budi'' is called by ''Kamus Besar'' as ''kebudayaan''. Thus, to Indonesians, science, spirituality, religion, philosophy and technology are named in a generic word ''kebudayaan'', which is the manifestation and the realization of ''budi''.


According to an Indonesian philosopher Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, by whom this philosophical concept was firstly popularized, the word ''budi'' might be translated into German ''Geist'', but not English ''mind''. The difference particularly lies in the relation of mind to culture. The English word ''mind'', to Sutan’s viewpoint, has no single thing to do with culture, but the German word ''Geist'' does have. That’s why the human sciences in Germany can be named either as ''die Geisteswissenschaften'' or ''die Kulturwissenschaften''(ST. Alisjahbana 1977:6-7). Sutan explained further the impossibility of translation of ''budi'' into English language:

:''In contrast to Geist, the English concept of mind has more cognitive character. It is in this sense that in the English language there is no direct relationship between the concept of mind and the totality of culture, which includes the product of intuition, feeling and imagination as expressed in religious awe and the creation of the arts. It was this more comprehensive German concept of Geist which influenced me in the construction of my cultural philosophy. I have given to the concept of budi in the Indonesian language, which is related to the word `Buddha', the Enlightened One, the meaning of Geist, since in the Indonesian language the word `culture`(budidaya and kebudayaan) is directly related to the concept of `budi`, from which it is derived. Indeed, in the Indonesian language the concept of `budi` represents the most characteristic of the human psyche in constrast to the drives and instincts in the animal psyche'' &lt;br&gt;- (ST. Alisjahbana 1988:84).


Although Sutan expressed his latent dissatisfaction of the incapability of English language to translate the Indonesian word, he unfortunately didn’t explore further in his writings why English language could not translate well the word ''budi'' and its consequence in the field of philosophy. In my opinion, the consequence of incapability of English language to translate ''budi'' lies very clearly in their division of mind and culture. The English mind is ‘secularized’ out of the English culture. Between the mind and the culture there is a wide gap, as a wide gap as between philosophy and philosophical manifestations in culture. Philosophical tradition of England allows abstract speculation that doesn’t end with its realization in reality, but Indonesian tradition of philosophy does not. ''Budi'' is always realized undividedly in ''kebudayaan'' or ''budi daya''. In English philosophical tradition, mind is only related to cognition or thinking activity; that’s why it cannot integrate mind to culture, which is total manifestation of human capacity of reasoning, feeling, thinking, imagining, and even dreaming in reality.


Due to the integrality of ''budi'', Indonesian culture (''kebudayaan'') is consequently integrated. We Indonesians don’t make clear division or categorization of philosophy and religion, of religion and spirituality, of spirituality and science, as well as of science and art. In short, Indonesian culture has never known any strict materialism or hard-liner idealism. Our science and philosophy is as esthetic and artistic as our religion, spirituality and art. Our Borobudur Temple, ''suluk'' literature (Javanese mystical literature), traditional dances and sculptures, musical instruments, traditional houses and arms are as beautiful and tasteful as our philosophy, science and spirituality, for our ''budi'' combines ‘rationalizing’ and ‘feeling’ altogether. ''Serats'' (Javanese poetic literature inspired by Islam) combine poetical esthetics and philosophical logics and so do ''kakawins'' (Javanese poetic literature inspired by Hindu-Buddhism). Hamzah Al-Fansuri expressed his Sufistic speculation in his ''syairs'' (Malay poetry), whilst King Visnu of Sailendra Dynasty (775-782) built the esthetic Borobudur Temple to worship his holy ancestors. Poetry of traditional societies of Indonesia, which contains the first form of cosmology and cosmogony, is never less rational than modern essays. Our first cosmology contained in beautiful oral mythologies is no less reasonable and awesome than Old-Greek cosmology. Our ''pantuns'' (Malay traditional poems) mix rhymic esthetics and intellectual wisdom. In conclusion, the epistemology of ''budi'' held by Indonesians balances the use of mind and of senses and does justice to the ideal and the material. Consequently, there is no war between rationalism and empiricism or between idealism and materialism in Indonesian philosophical tradition.


Indonesian contemporary poets cannot escape from this embracing principle of ''budi'' too, as an Indonesian poet-philosopher Subagio Sastrowardoyo best explains it:

:''Since the early days of writing in Indonesia a close link has existed between philosophy and literature. In the classical literature of Indonesia a `pujangga` or writer was both poet and philosopher. He was expected to reveal in literary form views of and guidance for life and to provide his readers (or listeners) prophetic truth. `Wedatama`, a Javanese literary classic, and `Syair Perahu`, a well-known poem in Malay, are still revered as philosophy apart from the fact that they are recognized as excellent literature. But it is the philosophy, or `ngelmu` (in Javanese) which put the legitimizing stamp of “literature” on the works…'' &lt;br&gt;- (Subagio Sastrowardoyo 1992:135)

Contemporary literati like Sutardji Calzoum Bachri, Sapardi Djoko Damono, Linus Suryadi AG, Chairil Anwar and Sitor Situmorang convey their philosophical insights through their novels, poems, and short stories (Subagio Sastrowardoyo 1992:137).

It does not mean that ''budi'' epistemology has never been challenged in Indonesian history of philosophy. In the early 1900s, a philosophical movement called ‘Islamic Modernism` condemned “feeling” and its manifestation in culture as merely illusionary fantasy and false imagination (Arabic, ''takhayyul'' and ''khurafât'') (Deliar Noer 1996:xiii) I do not understand how they judged the Indonesian culture as full of false fantasy and imagination; maybe because of Dutch capitalist-rationalist influence they encountered in their period. They began to admit the supremacy of “reasoning” over “feeling”. In 1920s, Tan Malaka (d.1949) also condemned “feeling” and advocated instead the supremacy of reason and logic. He wrote:

:''…Let us build a steel wall between the past and the future, and never look at behind and never try to use the old power to encourage society to get happiness. Let us use “rational” thinking, because that kind of knowledge and way of thinking are the peak of human civilization and the first top level for the future… Only the rational way of thinking and of doing which enable humans to get lifted from illusionary imagination (ketakhayulan), poverty…and slavery and enable humans to reach truth…'' &lt;br&gt;- (Tan Malaka 2000:171-172)

In 1940s in a preparatory council of Indonesian independence (BPUPKI), Mohammad Yamin succeeded in winning [[rationalism]] over “feeling”, which he called “irrationalism” and “pre-modern logics”. Due to his astuteness, rationalism (called by him as ''kebijaksanaan'') was accepted as one of principles of state philosophy [[Pancasila]], namely its fourth ''sila''  ‘Kerakyatan yang dipimpin oleh hikmat kebijaksanaan…` ''Kebijaksanaan'' is none other than Yamin’s Indonesian translation of rationalism (Sekretaris Negara 1995:19-20)

Since 1940s onwards, ''budi'' epistemology was replaced by Modern-Western rational [[epistemology]]. [[Philosophy]], consequently, was only understood as reasoning and thinking, as clearly stated in a metaphysical work by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana:

:''To philosophize means to think and to examine freely, namely, it is not only free of any fixed science, but is also free of fixed belief, fixed dogma, and the like. To philosophy, there is nothing holy, nothing sacred, nothing forbidden, nothing tabooed, everything is brought into the examining field of thought…'' &lt;br&gt;- (Sutan Takdir 1981:2)

However, there had been no more revolutionary an idea before the decade of 1970s than Nurcholish Madjid`s blunt rational [[secularism]]. Nurcholish (d.2005) did not admit he advocated secularism; he only had not realized that what he proposed was a highway to secularism. He called his fellowmen to differentiate (therefore separate) the divine and the profane or the sacred and the secular. He dichotomized religion and culture—two elements that had been in the past unified in total unity. By doing this, he wanted to build a positivist-secular ''kebudayaan'' separated from its religious and spiritual content, which had been parts of his tradition (M.Kamal Hassan 1987:246-247) His proposal was very well welcomed by secularist technocrats as Ali Moertopo, Soedjono Hoemardani, TB. Simatupang, Rachman Tolleng, Midian Sirait, and “Berkeley Mafia” who gathered in a national development planning board BAPPENAS, who were also eminent advocates of Soeharto`s [[modernization]] [[politics]] called as “Orde Baru” (M. Kamal Hassan 1987:9-10)

Supremacy of ‘feeling’ over ‘reasoning’ advocated by some [[philosophers]] is also not good, since it can lead to radical sensism. Philosophers like Ki Ageng Selo (''circa'' 16 century AD), Pakubuwono IV, and Ki Ageng Suryomentaram (1892-1962) all adhere to a philosophical position which admires ‘rasa’ (feeling) over ‘akal’ (reasoning). Ki Ageng Selo said in his Serat Pepali :

:''Poma-poma anak putu mami''
:''Aja sira ngêgungakên akal''
:''Wong akal ilang baguse.''

:''I really hope, o my grandchildren''
:''Never you boast of your reason''
:''The man of reason loses his beauty)'' - (Ki Ageng Selo 1980:18)

Actually, ‘the man of reason’ cannot lose his beauty, if ‘reasoning’ is understood as complementary to ‘feeling’ and ‘feeling’ as complementary to ‘reasoning’, for a man normally cannot lose one of his capacities of ‘feeling’ or ‘reasoning’. There is no losing; there is no supremacy over others too. ‘Feeling’ and ‘reasoning’ are two different but complementary ways to knowledge; knowledge of the good and the evil. That’s why ''budi'' integrates them both, to reach the knowledge. 

We Indonesians are very lucky that we inherit the [[Indian philosophy]] in our philosophical tradition. Our word ''budi'' must have been rooted from the Indian [[Buddha]], ‘the Enlightened One’. If that is true, our ''budi'' must be able to guide us Indonesians to enlightenment, to knowledge which enlightens us with its light. That knowledge can of course be reached through ‘feeling’ and ‘reasoning’. We Indonesians have been (and are still) using our budi to reach some enlightening knowledge. We had collected and compiled the knowledge in what we call Adat. It is in our ''Adat'' that we collected all ''leluhur’s'' philosophies, ways of life, and wisdom. In our ''Adat'' too can we find out a kind of wisdom called by [[Schuon]] as ''sophia perennis''—the eternal wisdom given by ''Tuhan'' (the God) amidst all particulars, accidents, and changeables. Our ''budi'' and ''Adat'' together found what we call ''kebudayaan''—the divine, spiritual civilization and culture. In the following pages, I invite all readers to dive deep into that ocean of heritage.

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]

I have taken the GAMSAT twice, I got an overall mark of 57 in 2006 and 62 in 2007. The most crucial thing to remember is timekeeping in the exam. I calculated what question I should be at by what time and stuck to it. This helped me keep the pace up, and meant I didn't dwell on things I didn't know.

The day before I took the GAMSAT I felt very disheartened at how long it was, that it covered such a wide range of topics to quite a high level, and that I'd done very averagely on 3 other med school entry exams.  However, the day soon passed and it turns out I did very well on GAMSAT, so it goes to show you the best thing to do is to keep turning up to your entrance exams and try your hardest every time.  I think the GAMSAT is a very fair exam and people who didn't do well on the MSAT (because of its weighting on verbal reasoning) and BMAT (because its of its weighting on GCSE / A-Level Maths &amp; Physics)can demonstrate their understanding of degree-level science and humanities subjects.

: I agree on the timekeeping. You may be used to normal test taking, but the GAMSAT is nothing like it. It is like a marathon. It's not only quick, but its a long slog. [[User:Hydrogamsat|Hydrogamsat]] ([[User talk:Hydrogamsat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hydrogamsat|contribs]]) 17:23, 4 January 2014 (UTC)

I took the GAMSAT only once and managed to obtain a good enough mark to get an interview and subsequently got a place on the medical course. I managed to scrape just enough on the science part and did well on sections I and II to muster a good enough average. 
Time-keeping is completely crucial in this exam. You should have practised the exam under a strict time regime - also you should know how long on average you have per question. It's crucial to have this in mind so you can allocate enough time per question but not get bogged down in a question that is draining your overall time. A rule of thumb was that you will have to read the text as rapidly as possible and come up with your answer pretty much immediately. No dawdling or musing allowed sadly!

Another issue is that you should make sure to have all the questions answered even if it's at random. Randomly tick all the questions you haven't got round to answering.</text>

Two persons are getting information from a source.

[[Image:Information_from_the_source.jpg]]

----

Everybody associates something different with single words. They would not understand each other, because they have different definitions of the words.

[[Image:Information_getting_associated.jpg]]

Their communication may look like this:

[[Image:Different_worlds.jpg]]

----

Both persons share their associations around the single words.

[[Image:Associations_getting_shared.jpg]]

Their communication may look like this:

[[Image:Get_to_know_each_other.jpg]]

----

In detail everybody has some associations with single words.

[[Image:Person_as_associations.jpg]]

[[Image:Person_bs_associations.jpg]]

----

You could share these associations, which doubles everyone's knowledge around this single word.

[[Image:Both_persons_associations.jpg]]

----

How to do this? Here is a suggestion:

# You take a single &lt;word&gt;
# Everybody is writing a sentence. Always starting with &lt;word&gt;
# You get to know each other's associations with this specific &lt;word&gt;

You should get something like this:

 Person A: &lt;word&gt; is ...
 Person B: &lt;word&gt; looks like...
 Person C: &lt;word&gt; has got the following functions
 .
 .
 .

and so on.

Like the idea behind wikipedia. Sharing information. But sharing them around single words.

----

Basic idea behind:
# language carries information
# the single word is the first module
# the single word is understood very different, because humans are different.

== 02.03.06 ==
Person A has losely connected some words.

[[Image:Person_As_associations_4_words.jpg]]

Person B too:

[[Image:Person_Bs_associations_4_words.jpg]]

Now they start sharing their associations around these single words and they are both profiting from it. Their network of associations has grown and is now stronger than before.

[[Image:Both_Persons_associations_4_words.jpg]]

== 09.03.06 ==
A way to solve the problem of different associations and sharing them may be this wiki:
:http://wikinition.common-culture.net/index.php/Hauptseite

== 12.03.06 ==
An example how to set up linked words in a very easy way on a Windows XP machine with Open Office.

Picture 1: I want to connect the words: &quot;Germany&quot; and &quot;France&quot;

[[Image:01_Ger_and_Fra.jpg]]

Picture 2: Click on &quot;Germany&quot;. What information do I have in connection to this word?

[[Image:1_Ger.jpg]]

Picture 3: Click on &quot;France&quot;. France is related to Germany.

[[Image:2_Fra.jpg]]

What about putting them both in a folder called &quot;Europe&quot;? Let's connect both together and write everything down to &quot;Europe&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Orbit==
Why do satellites follow a path around the earth when they are broadcasting MTV.  Think about it this way, if they were going a bit slower, they would fall, and if they were going a bit faster, they would fly away.

The distance a satellite is orbiting at will be determined in much the same way as how far Shakira's hair will be from her head when she tosses it. The faster, the farther.

Newton made this observation in regards to the fact that the moon rotates around the earth as determined by the law of gravitation:

&lt;math&gt;F=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; = gravitation constant.
&lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; = mass of first object.
&lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; = mass of second object.
&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; = Radius from center of &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; to center of &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt;.

R is what we are concerned with here. The equation requires that the farther away from the gravitational force the satellite is, the slower it needs to go to stay in orbit.

==Leaning Tower of Pisa Experiment==
It is said that Galileo dropped two bowling bowls of different masses from the tower of pisa, but this is debated with many believing it only occurred as a thought experiment. The natural inclination is to believe that the heavier object would fall faster without air resistance, but this is not true, as it has been shown they both fall at the same time. The force equation above proves that the force is greater on the larger object all other things being equal (&lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; is what we are concerned with here...they are interchangeable). We know that it requires stronger muscles to hold up a person than a feather. So why doesn't the object that is heavier fall faster? One word. Inertia. You may have noticed that it is easier to throw a baseball than a bowling ball. The same applies to the Earth. You may be under the impression that the same rules that apply to you do not apply to the earth, but they do. The earth has to pull twice as hard on an object with twice the mass in order to produce the same acceleration as it would something with half that mass, so the fact that the force is twice as large is cancelled by the inertia being twice as great as well. This is of course ignoring air resistance. It takes a lot more energy to throw a whiffle ball a given distance than it does a baseball because of this. Without air resistance (in a vacuum), a normal whiffle ball is easier to throw a given distance than a baseball as hard as that is to believe.

|title=Extreme Value Theorem
|text=If ''f'' is a continuous function and closed on the interval [&lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt;], then ''f'' has both a minimum and a maximum.}}

This introduces us to the aspect of global extrema and local extrema. (Also known as absolute extrema or relative extrema respectively.)

How is this so? Let us use an example.

&lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^2 &lt;/math&gt; and is closed on the interval [-1,2]. Find all extrema.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x&lt;/math&gt;

A critical point (a point where the derivative is zero) exists at (0,0). Just for practice, let us use the second derivative test to evaluate whether or not it is a minimum or maximum. (You should know it is a minimum from looking at the graph.)

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f''(c) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, thus it must be a minimum.

As mentioned before, one can find global extrema on a closed interval. How? Evaluate the ''y'' coordinate at the endpoints of the interval and compare it to the ''y'' coordinates of the critical point.  When you are finding extrema on a closed interval it is called a local extremum and when it's for the whole graph it's called a global extremum.

1: Critical Point: (0,0) This is the lowest value in the interval. Therefore, it is a local minimum which also happens to be the global minimum.

2: Left Endpoint (-1, 1) This point is not a critical point nor is it the highest/lowest value, therefore it qualifies as nothing.

3: Right Endpoint (2, 4) This is the highest value in the interval, and thus it is a local maximum.

This example was to show you the '''extreme value theorem'''. The quintessential point is this: on a closed interval, the function will have both minima and maxima. However, if that interval was an open interval of all real numbers, (0,0) would have been a local minimum. On a closed interval, always remember to evaluate endpoints to obtain global extrema.

==First Derivative Test==

Recall that the first derivative of a function describes the slope of the graph of the function at every point along the graph for which the function is defined and differentiable.

{{Calculus/Def|text=
'''Increasing/Decreasing:'''

* If &lt;math&gt; f'(x) &lt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is decreasing.

* If &lt;math&gt; f'(x) &gt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is increasing.

'''Local Extrema:'''

* If &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx}|_{x=c} = f'(c) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f'(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; changes signs at &lt;math&gt; x = c \ &lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a local extremum at &lt;math&gt; x = c \ &lt;/math&gt;.

* If &lt;math&gt; f'(x) &lt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; x &lt; c \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f'(x) &gt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; x &gt; c \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f(c) \ &lt;/math&gt; is a local minimum.

* If &lt;math&gt; f'(x) &gt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; x &lt; c \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f'(x) &lt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; x &gt; c \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f(c) \ &lt;/math&gt; is a local maximum.
}}

'''Example 1:'''

 Let &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 \ &lt;/math&gt;. Find all local extrema.

* Find &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; f'(x) = 6x + 4 \ &lt;/math&gt;

* Set &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; to find local extrema.

: &lt;math&gt; 6x + 4 = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; 6x = -4 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; x = - \frac{2}{3} &lt;/math&gt;

* Determine whether there is a local minimum or maximum at &lt;math&gt; x = - \frac{2}{3} &lt;/math&gt;.

: Choose an ''x'' value smaller than &lt;math&gt; - \frac{2}{3} &lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; f'(-1) = 6(-1) + 4 = -2 &lt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;

: Choose an ''x'' value larger than &lt;math&gt; - \frac{2}{3} &lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; f'(1) = 6(1) + 4 = 10 &gt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, there is a local minimum at &lt;math&gt; x = - \frac{2}{3} &lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt; f'(- \frac{2}{3}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f'(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; changes signs at &lt;math&gt; x = - \frac{2}{3} &lt;/math&gt;.

 Answer: local minimum: &lt;math&gt; x = - \frac{2}{3} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Second Derivative Test== 

Recall that the second derivative of a function describes the concavity of the graph of that function.

{{Calculus/Def
|text=
* If &lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}|_{x=c} = f''(c) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f''(c) \ &lt;/math&gt; changes signs at &lt;math&gt; x = c \ &lt;/math&gt;, then there is a point of inflection (change in concavity) at &lt;math&gt; x = c \ &lt;/math&gt;.

* If &lt;math&gt; f''(x) &lt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then the graph of &lt;math&gt; f(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is concave down.

* If &lt;math&gt; f''(x) &gt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then the graph of &lt;math&gt; f(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is concave up.
}}

'''Example 2:'''

 Let &lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 7 \ &lt;/math&gt;.  Find any points of inflection on the graph of &lt;math&gt; f(x) \ &lt;/math&gt;.

* Find &lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 7 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; f''(x) = 6x \ &lt;/math&gt;

* Set &lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt; 6x = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; x = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;

* Determine whether &lt;math&gt; f''(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; changes signs at &lt;math&gt; x = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

: Choose an ''x'' value that is smaller than 0:

: &lt;math&gt; f''(-1) = 6(-1) = -6 &lt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;

: Choose an ''x'' value that is larger than 0:

: &lt;math&gt; f''(1) = 6(1) = 6 &gt; 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, there exists a point of inflection at &lt;math&gt; x = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt; f''(0) = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f''(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; changes signs at &lt;math&gt; x = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

 Answer: point of inflection: &lt;math&gt; x = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

|title=Rolle's Theorem
|text=If a function, &lt;math&gt; f(x) \ &lt;/math&gt;, is continuous on the closed interval &lt;math&gt; [a,b] \ &lt;/math&gt;, is differentiable on the open interval &lt;math&gt; (a,b) \ &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; f(a) = f(b) \ &lt;/math&gt;, then there exists at least one number c, in the interval &lt;math&gt; (a,b) \ &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f'(c) = 0 \ . &lt;/math&gt;
}}

Rolle's Theorem is important in proving the [[Calculus/Mean Value Theorem for Functions|Mean Value Theorem]].

==Examples==
[[Image:Rolle's theorem.svg]]

'''Example:'''

&lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^2 - 3x &lt;/math&gt;. Show that Rolle's Theorem holds true somewhere within this function. To do so, evaluate the ''x''-intercepts and use those points as your interval.

'''Solution:'''

1: The question wishes for us to use the ''x''-intercepts as the endpoints of our interval.

Factor the expression to obtain &lt;math&gt;x(x-3)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;. ''x'' = 0 and ''x'' = 3 are our two endpoints. We know that ''f''(0) and ''f''(3) are the same, thus that satisfies the first part of Rolle's theorem (''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b'')). 

2: Now by Rolle's Theorem, we know that somewhere between these points, the slope will be zero. Where? Easy: Take the derivative.

:&lt;math&gt; dy \over dx&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; = 2x - 3 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, at &lt;math&gt; x = 3/2 &lt;/math&gt;, we have a spot with a slope of zero. We know that &lt;math&gt;3/2&lt;/math&gt; (or 1.5) is between 0 and 3. Thus, Rolle's Theorem is true for this (as it is for all cases). This was merely a demonstration.

|title=Mean Value Theorem
|text=If &lt;math&gt; f(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is continuous on the closed interval &lt;math&gt; [a, b] \ &lt;/math&gt; and differentiable on the open interval &lt;math&gt; (a,b) \ &lt;/math&gt;, there exists a number, &lt;math&gt; c \ &lt;/math&gt;, in the open interval &lt;math&gt; (a,b) \ &lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt; f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} &lt;/math&gt;.
}}

==Examples==
[[Image:Lagrange mean value theorem.svg|right|thumb|250px]]
What does this mean? As usual, let us utilize an example to grasp the concept. Visualize (or graph) the function &lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^3&lt;/math&gt;.  Choose an interval (anything will work), but for the sake of simplicity, [0,2]. Draw a line going from point (0,0) to (2,8). Between the points ''x'' = 0 and ''x'' = 2 exists a number ''x'' = ''c'', where the derivative of &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; at point ''c'' is equal to the slope of the line you drew. 

'''Solution:'''

1: Using the definition of the mean value theorem

:&lt;math&gt;f(b) - f(a) \over b - a &lt;/math&gt;

insert values. Our chosen interval is [0,2]. So, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{f(2) - f(0)}{2 - 0} = \frac{8}{2} = 4&lt;/math&gt;

2: By the definition of the mean value theorem, we know that somewhere in the interval exists a point that has the same slope as that point. Thus, let us take the derivative to find this point ''x'' = ''c''.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Now, we know that the slope of the point is 4. So, the derivative at this point ''c'' is 4. Thus, &lt;math&gt; 4 = 3x^2 &lt;/math&gt;. The square root of 4/3 is the point. 

'''Example 2:''' Find the point that satisifes the mean value theorem on the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the interval [0,&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;].

'''Solution:'''

1: Always start with the definition:

:&lt;math&gt;f(b) - f(a) \over b - a &lt;/math&gt;

so,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin(\pi) - \sin(0)}{\pi - 0} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

(Remember, &lt;math&gt; \sin(\pi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sin(0) &lt;/math&gt; are both 0.)

2: Now that we have the slope of the line, we must find the point ''x'' = ''c'' that has the same slope. We must now get the derivative!

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\sin(x)}{dx} = \cos(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The cosine function is 0 at &lt;math&gt; \pi/2 + \pi n&lt;/math&gt; (where ''n'' is an integer). Remember, we are bound by the interval [&lt;math&gt;0, \pi&lt;/math&gt;], so &lt;math&gt; \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; is the point ''c'' that satisfies the Mean Value Theorem.

==Differentials==
&lt;!-- I don't think my explanation is very lucid...would someone like to explain it better? Also, I don't know how to synthesize capital Deltas. Thanks! -EbolaPox !--&gt;
Assume a function &lt;math&gt; y = f(x) &lt;/math&gt; that is differentiable in the open interval (a,b) that contains x. &lt;math&gt; \Delta y = &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; dy \over dx &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \cdot \Delta x &lt;/math&gt;

The &quot;Differential of x&quot; is the &lt;math&gt; \Delta x &lt;/math&gt;. This is an approximate change in x and can be considered &quot;equivalent&quot; to &lt;math&gt; dx &lt;/math&gt;. The same holds true for y. What is this saying? One can approximate a change in y by knowing a change in x and a change in x at a point very nearby. Let us view an example.

Example: A schoolteacher has asked her students to discover what &lt;math&gt; 4.1^2&lt;/math&gt; is. The students, bereft of their calculators, are too lazy to multiply this out by hand or in their head and desire to utilize calculus. How can they approximate this?

1: Set up a function that mimics the procedure. What are they doing? They are taking a number (Call it x) and they are squaring it to get a new number (call it y). Thus, y = x^2  Write yourself a small chart. Make notes of values for x, y, &lt;math&gt; \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \Delta y &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; dy \over dx&lt;/math&gt;. We are seeking what y really is, but we need the change in y first.

2: Choose a number close by that is easy to work with. Four is very close to 4.1, so write that down as x. Your &lt;math&gt; \delta x &lt;/math&gt; is .1 (This is the &quot;change&quot; in x from the approximation point to the point you chose.)

3: Take the derivative of your function. 

&lt;math&gt; dy \over dx &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = 2x&lt;/math&gt;. Now, &quot;split&quot; this up (This is not really what is happening, but to keep things simple, assume you are &quot;multiplying&quot; &lt;math&gt; dx&lt;/math&gt; over.)

3b. Now you have &lt;math&gt; dy&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = 2x \cdot dx &lt;/math&gt;. We are assuming &lt;math&gt; dy&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; dx &lt;/math&gt; are approximately the same as the change in x, thus we can use &lt;math&gt; \Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and y.

3c. Insert values: &lt;math&gt; dy &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = 2 \cdot 4 \cdot .1 &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt; dy &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= .8 &lt;/math&gt;.

4: To find &lt;math&gt; F(4.1)&lt;/math&gt;, take &lt;math&gt; F(4) + dy&lt;/math&gt; to get an approximation. 16 + .8 = 16.8; This approximation is nearly exact (The real answer is 16.81. This is only one hundredth off!)

==Definition of Derivative==
The exact value of the derivative at a point is the rate of change over an infinitely small distance, approaching zero.  Therefore, if h approaches 0 and the function is f(x):

:&lt;math&gt; f'(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x} &lt;/math&gt;

If h approaches 0, then:
:&lt;math&gt; f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. Open the ITD file in SDLX Edit. Unfortunately you have to do this file by file.

2. Export the ITD file using File &gt; Export to TRADOStag TTX format. The resulting file has the extension *.TTX.

3. Create a project in DVX.

4. Import the TTX file into DVX using the Wizard or Project Explorer.

5. Translate the file in DVX.

6. Export the file from DVX using Encoding option Unicode (not Unicode UTF-8!).

7. Make sure the original ITD file and the exported TTX file are in the same folder. Then import your translation into SDLX using the SDLX option File&gt; Trados &gt; Harvest exported TRADOStag TTX translation. The ITD file has been updated with your translation, but you still have to update the segment statuses in SDLX (that is, make sure that the grey and green segments [and also the golden segments if you need to deal with the full matches as well) are blue [= confirmed]).

8. Deactivate the SDLX options Auto-Propagate and Auto-Match BEFORE you start confirming the segments in SDLX.

9. Check the ITD files and confirm every translation (Edit &gt; Confirm/unconfirm &gt; Confirm all three options (100%, fuzzies, untranslated) subsequently. Most of the codes should be preserved and put in the right location.

&lt;Addition below by Rob_Laumen&gt;&lt;br&gt;
N.B. Regarding step 1, 2 and 7: the new SDLX 2006 version has an Exchange module which is available from the main GUI (&quot;switchboard&quot;) and allows you to quickly convert SDLX files to TTX files and 'harvest' TTX files into SDLX files, so you no longer have to manually convert files one after the other.&lt;br&gt;
N.B. 2 DVX will NOT import ITD files that have Format Painting issues -- these need to be solved first. Refer to the online Help of the SDLX program for information on how to do this.)&lt;br&gt;

'''Blood Supply of Long Bones'''

Vascular supply of long bones depends on several points of inflow, which feed complex sinusoidal networks within the bone. These in turn drain to various channels Through all surfaces of the bone except that covered by articular cartilage.

----
=General Anatomy=
One or two main diaphyseal nutrient arteries enter the shaft obliquely through one or two nutrient foramina leading to nutrient canals. Their sites of entry and angulation are almost constant and characteristically directed away form the growing epiphysis. Except for a few with double or no foramina, 90% of long bones have a single nutrient foramen in the middle third of the shaft. The nutrient arteries divide into ascending and descending branches in the medullary cavity. These approach the epiphysis dividing into smaller rami. Near the epiphysis they anastamose with the metaphyseal and epiphyseal arteries.

Metaphyseal arteries are the branches of neighbouring systemic vessels. They enter the long bones in the region of the metaphysis.

Epiphyseal arteries form the periarticular vascular arcades formed on non-articular surfaces of the long bones. Numerous vascular foramina are present at the end of long bones, some which are occupied by arteries but most by veins. The nutrient arteries of epiphyses form many intraosseous anastamoses as they pass towards the articular surfaces within the trabeculae. Near the articular cartilage they form serial anastamotic arcades from which arise end-arterial loops which pierce the thin hypochondral compact bone to enter and traverse the calcified zone of articualar cartilage before returning to the epiphyseal sinusoids.

Epiphyseal and metaphyseal arteries quantitatively exceed the diaphyseal supply which they can complement when the latter is destroyed. Nutrient arteries are responsible for two-thirds of blood supply of the diaphysis and one-third of blood supply of each of the metaphyses.

Periosteal plexuses are formed by arteries from the neighbouring muscles. Muscular arteries contribute vascular arcades with longitudinal links to the fibrous periosteum forming an external plexus. From this exteranl plexus a capillary network permeates the deeper osteogenic periosteum. However at muscular attachments periosteal and muscular arteries are confluent.

Inside the medullary cavity the ascending and the descending branches of the shaft give
* Centripetal branches to a hexagonal mesh of medullary sinusoids draining into a wide thin-walled central venous sinus.
* Cortical branches passing through endosteal canals feed fenestrated capillaries in the Haversian systems. These cortical capillaries conform in pattern to the Haversian canals, which are longitudinal with oblique interosteotomic connections.

The cortical capillaries also make capillary and venous connections with the periosteal plexuses mentioned above.

The central venous sinus drains veins, which trace the paths of nutrient arteries, sometimes piercing the shaft as independent emissary veins.

Modern research has emphasized
* A centrifugal type of flow of blood through the cortical bone in the shafts of the long bones
* A centripetal type of flow through the medulla.

This is in contrast to the earlier concept of substantial centripetal arterial flow of blood into the cortex form the periosteal vessels. Though the concept of exclusively centrifugal supply to the cortex has received increasing support, some have described an appreciable centripetal arterial flow especially to the outer cortical zones from the periosteal capillaries.

Blood supply of the immature bones is similar but the epiphysis is a discrete vascular zone separated from the metaphysic by the growth plate. Epiphyseal and metaphyseal arteries enter on both sides of the growth cartilage, with anastamoses between them being few or absent. Growth cartilage receives its blood supply form both the sources and also form an anastamotic collar in the adjoining perichondrium. Young periosteum is more vascular with its vessels communicating more freely with those of the shaft than in the adults and has more metaphyseal branches.

Physiologically blood flow in the bone occurs at the rate of 5 – 20 ml / min in 100 gm of wet bone tissue representing approximately 4 – 10 % of the resting cardiac output. The rate of blood flow is highest in the metaphysic. Control and variation of blood supply is due to stimulating factors such as sympathetic nerves, acid metabolites and increased or decreased carbon – di – oxide tension.
----

=Applied Anatomy=
Response of the bone to circulatory disturbances:
Like any other tissue in the body necrosis of the bone can occur due to interruption of its blood supply resulting from physical injury (trauma) or form non-traumatic occlusion of blood vessels (Caisson’s Disease). In such aseptic necrosis of bone, there could be two situations
#Bone with some residual supply:Involved bone is invaded by vascular fibrous stroma and the necrotic bone is gradually resorbed and replaced by new bone. Part of bone with blood supply undergoes atrophy with decalcification.
#Bone with completely no blood supply:Involved bone shows increased density because there is no blood supply to remove the mineral salts. Sequestrum is an example of the effect of loss of blood supply to bone.

Thereby increased density of bone may represent
* Zones of hypertrophic living bone
* Necrotic bone with reactive bone about it
* Simply necrotic bone

In situations where there is increased circulation, bone responds by hypertrophy and increase in length. Increase in length of lower limb with an arterio-venous aneurysm is an example.

Circulatory disturbances in specific regions of the long bones:
#Legg–Calve–Perthes Disease: Circulatory disturbance to the capital femoral epiphysis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
#Physeal Trauma: Epiphyseal vessels are responsible for nourishing the reproductive cells of the physis. Interruption of these vessels results in irreparable damage to the growth plate. Metaphyseal vessels supply calcium and Vitamin D via serum and phosphates via erythrocytes, aiding in the calcification of the matrix, removal of degenerate cells, and deposition of lamellar bone. The metaphyseal vessels are of no nutritional significance to proliferating chondrocytes of the physis.

Metaphysis:
#Haematogenous Osteomyelitis: In children infective foci are known to localize in the metaphysis within two hours following intravenous inoculation. This is explained by the nature of blood supply to this region. The last ramifications of the intramedullary nutrient artery to the metaphysic turn down in sharp loops and empty into a system of large sinusoidal veins where the rate of blood flow is decreased. This creates an ideal medium for the bacteria to settle down and proliferate. In the adult there is a free anastamosis between the metaphyseal and epiphyseal arteries and thereby osteomyelitis, when it does occur may appear anywhere. In infants a few vessels do cross the physis. At eight months the physeal cartilage becomes a barrier that becomes definitively established by 18 months. Therefore in infants osteomyelitis can lead to septic arthritis.
#Metastasis: Metastatic deposits are more common in the axial skeleton than the appendicular skeleton. However when they occur they are known to deposit in the region of the metaphysis. This is attributed to the fact that the metaphyseal circulation is richer compared to epiphyseal or diaphyseal circulation.

Diaphysis
# Intramedullary Reaming: Cortical reaming and nail insertion injures the medullary vascular system resulting in avascularity of significant portions of the cortex. Medullary reaming disturbs the intracortical transport mechanism by altering the high intramedullary pressure required for venous drainage into the periosteal veins and the pulsating intramedullary pressure necessary for nourishment of osteocytes. Research has shown that there is more rapid revascularization with nails placed without preparatory reaming compared with nails placed after reaming. Hence there is a shift of interest to interlocking nailing systems that do not require reaming.
#Fracture Healing: Periosteal circulation plays a very important role in healing of fractures. Soft tissue stripping thereby, while performing an internal fixation of a fractured bone must be kept to a minimum to encourage the participation of periosteum and its circulation in fracture healing.

Anterior instability after primary glenohumeral arthroplasty occurs usually as a result of failure of the subscapularis to heal. Surgery to repair the subscapularis possibly in conjunction with transfer of the pectoralis major, and in some cases with the use of a tendo-achilles allograft can restore stability and control pain,  though ultimately functional outcome is frequently marginal.

*It's very good, but later lessons need some formatting and the lesson on the Dative case is extremely flawed, since the exercices use pronouns and we only see them 2 sections after! Plus we need a corrected version of the exercices(which I could do) because exercices without correction = the lame. --[[User:Kundash|Kundash]] 21:19, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

*This book is scheduled to have almost all of its content finished, proofread, and perfected by April. See the timetable on my talk page for more. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 02:35, 4 March 2006 (UTC)
* A native french speaker (me) has verified all the grammar (french grammar is very easy lol) and with MY voice. [[User:Merrheim|Merrheim]] 18:53, 13 March 2006 (UTC)
* I recommend this book with slight reservations. I have looked around the book and it is extremely nice for the most part, and written by people that know what they're doing. Other parts are simply awful, with spelling errors in the French examples and slang expression/grammar(such as &quot;quel jour on est&quot; for &quot;what day are we&quot;, which should be &quot;quel jour sommes-nous&quot;), which is a huge no-no, since teaching a language should focus on formalties first and slang second, or even not at all. I largely prefer the Latin book over the French one, even if the Latin one is a little flawed, but I'm still going to give my support and vote in favour of the French wikibook.

*I'm adding this book quite late in the month, so it is not likely to get as many votes as it could have.  I am going to renominate this book for sure in April (for the May BotM) if it doesn't get the 3 renomination votes.

==Voting Rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

* This book needs collaboration from people with various Slavonic-language backgrounds (from [[w:Russian language|Russian]] to [[w:Sorbian languages|Lower Sorbian]]). It is an open-ended project which will probably never be complete, but there is already a lot there to read, which might hopefully encourage people to contribute. --[[User:Buncic|Daniel Bunčić]] 18:05, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
** Looks like a book with potential.  UnfortunetlyI can't really contribute anything [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 21:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
*I think it's more related to a project/discussion but not really a Wikibook because it's more showing the evolution of many Slovakian origins which could/couldn't be a myth, so the book has somewhat has a neutral point of view but the nomination is due to the involvement of many users but still, it doesn't matters to be a &quot;real&quot; Wikibook. -- &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[User:Mastermind_007|'''Master''']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Mastermind_007|'''mind''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Mastermind 007|'''007''']]&lt;/font&gt; '''''13:06, 9 March 2006 (UTC)'''''
:* Sorry, I didn't get your point, please make it clearer. It seems you have not really understood what the book is about. It is ''not'' about the [[w:Historical linguistics|evolution of any language]], ''not'' about [[w:Myth|myths]], and [[w:Slovak language|&quot;Slovakian&quot;]] is only one of the fifteen [[w:Slavic languages|Slavonic languages]] covered by the book. Please have a look at the wikipedia article [[w:False friend|False friend]] to understand that [[False Friends of the Slavist]] is in a way a very typical wikibook, as it provides a practical help to all those who want to learn a Slavonic language while already knowing another one (and most people who know one Slavonic language do not stop there). Apart from that, especially the [[False Friends of the Slavist/Maps|semasiological maps]] are also of linguistic interest. See the [[Esperanto/Appendix/False friends|English-Esperanto]], [[German: False Friends|English-German]] (from the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month/September 2005|CoM Sept. 2005]]), [[Finnish:Introduction#False friends|English-Finnish]] and [[Dutch: Introduction#Dutch and English|English-Dutch]] false friends for the relevance of this subject in other wikibooks. Note that even before this internet project became a wikibook it had already been used in class. --[[User:Buncic|Daniel Bunčić]] 15:46, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

This is a general interest Wikibook that might actually get some additional people into Wikibooks for collaboration.  It would be nice to get this book up to speed so as to become a Book of the Month candidate.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:35, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

I maintain this book and am glad it's up for nomination. The goals of the book are ''very'' large and a lot of content still needs to be added. What the book really needs is users who can add critical commentary and articulate descriptions of the storyline's plots, characters, etc. I don't want the book to become a &quot;macropedia&quot; with fact lists like Wikipedia already has. What the book is really meant for is commentary and analysis. Getting some public notice of this book would be great. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 04:26, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

&quot;The question for the modern surgeon is not whether operative treatment is to supersede manipulative...The problem before each of us is how we can improve our skill and technique in both manipulative and operative treatment and what means must we adopt in each individual case to give our patients the surest, safest and most complete restoration of function.&quot;
-Robert Jones 1913

This point of view recognizes two modes of fracture healing enchondral and intra-membranous. Closed management will attempt to optimize the former in which genetic expression at the fracture site will reiterate embryologic processes beginning with differentiation of recruited stem cells into cartilage cells.  Open treatment will tend toward a direct differentiation to bone formation.  Thus our treatments surgical or closed will either promote or interfere with these intrinsic mechanisms by which bone is capable of healing in an efficient scar free way so as to recreate its initial structure.  

When the stucture of the bone is violently disrupted there is physical disruption of the matrix as well as the cellular elements of bone.  Hemorrhage from disrupted blood vessels results in a fracture hematoma.  We interpret what appears to be happening at a cellular level as an initial call for help, setting the stage for damage control and the recruiting of all available healing resources.  There is pain which alerts us to the injury, there is swelling which splints the part and allows for the ready transit of any needed raw material out of the vasculature and into the zone of injury.  Inflammation is the name we give to this first of three recognized phases of fracture healing.The first responders then generate messages in the form of chemotactic factors to call upon what is needed for the healing process to continue.  This first 5 to 7days transitions into a process of cleaning out the damaged material, there is resorbtion of calcified bone, macrophage activation and modulation of mesenchymal pluripotential cells into fibroblasts and chondroblasts and osteoblasts, these activities dominate the picture  from days 4 to 40 in what is known as the reparative phase.  The process is accelerated in the young so that the reparative phase may be contracted into the first week in the new born and the final phase of fracture healing begins, the hallmark being the formation of calcified salts to form woven bone and radiographically aparent fracture healing.  This is typically evident at 4 weeks, more so in diaphyseal bones especially those with a generous surround of muscle.  Metaphyseal areas, intra-articular fractures, carpal bones and phalanges find a less exuberant or at least more delayed radiographic appearance even in the face of effective clinical union.  This last phase known as the remodeling phase continues for a year or more.  

A variety of endogenous and exogenous factors influence each of the three phases of fracture healing. The most important of these to recognize is the fact that a living patient is required to heal a fracture.  The first implication of this fact is that attention must first be paid to the ABC's of resuscitation prior to attending to the dramatically flailed extremity which may attract attention while an insidious life threatening situation may be overlooked.  The next consideration is that the bone will need blood supply to heal so will the soft tissues around the bone which may be precariously tented. Any deformity which is compromising the local perfusion about the fracture or to the distal extremity should be corrected.  A survey of all areas presuming unrecognized secondary skeletal injury, and using the best available means, which is a laying on of hands to feel for crepitation and in the conscious patient to elicit tenderness will tend to yield an overlooked fracture in 15% of cases.  In the case of high energy injury especially a fall from a height or a motor vehicular accident a skeletal survey to include spine and pelvis is usually pursued and commonly augmented by CT scan as this is generally used to screen for any intra-cranial or intra-abdominal injury is such cases thus a scan of the neck is easily added to supplement a cross table lateral plain film.  The identified fractures should be xrayed with two views in the standard frontal and saggital planes if possible with the joint above and below the fracture site demonstrated. 

The next priority is to address the open fracture with the goal of eliminating any foreign and devitalized material.  The foreign material is considered to harbor micoorganisms which must be diminished in their quantity if not eliminated as they have an agenda entirely at odds with our purposes and will tend to thrive unchecked in the nutrient rich setting of a fracture.  It is recognized that despite the most assiduous and repeated efforts in this regard some micoorganisms may persist at the fracture site, but if there are no sizable areas of devitalized tissue to harbor them then the patient's immune system in conjunction with parenterally administered antibiotics will eliminate any residual invaders.  Due attention to the volume of irrigation in proportion to the area of injury, with formal surgical exposure of the intramedullary aspect of the bone is the goal, paying all due respect to the preservation of blood supply to the fracture and the overlying soft tissues.  Pulse lavage and the use of a bone currette facilitates the process.  It is instructive to inspect a freshly irrigated open tibia under loupe magnification to recognize that even after 10 liters of  pulse lavage and scraping there remains low level contamination.  Despite the best efforts some open fractures will become infected and usually from the proliferation of an organism that entered at the time of injury.  Antibiotic resistence extent now in many communities requires surveillance to determine the optimal choice for initial antibiotic prophylaxis.

The desire to get on with what may be a lengthy process of stablizing the fracture with surgical implants must not be allowed to give short shrift to the process of cleansing the fracture site. From the point of view of an invading micoorganism, there is no more welcome addition than a large metallic surface allowing the organism  the opportunity to form a defensive perimeter in the form of a membrane adjacent to the implant within which the organism will evade the patients immune mechanisms and the deadly effects of any antibiotics administered either parenterally or locally.

The desirability of stabilizing all long bone fractures as soon as possible must be tempered by a realistic appaisal of the level of resources immediately available, the level of fatigue and expertise of the surgical team, and the duration of anesthesia which may represent an undesirable level of immediate physiologic stress to a recently traumatized patient.  If the crew is worn out, if the young surgeon is not quite sure of the best approach to stabilization, then focus on washing the fracture out and providing provisional stabilization
allowing for a respite, reconsideration of options, and additional consultation, and availablity of the most appropriate implants for the purpose at hand.  Many bad starts to a healing process are born in the middle of the night when strenuous efforts are brought to bear with the best of intensions.

== Introduction ==

Entomology is the study of insects. The field of entomology also encompasses arachnids. Insects and arachnids both belong to the Phylum Arthropoda, which also includes crustaceans (including shrimps and crabs), along with some other small groups. The Arthropoda are jointed leg animals with an exoskeleton. Entomology is concerned with the life history, biology, behavior, and ecology of insects in regards to both the environment and human industry (i.e. agriculture).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first species of counterpoint is the most simple, being that of one note placed against one note (that is, if the [[w:cantus firmus|cantus fimus]] is quarter notes, the counterpoint will also be in quarter notes).  

There are two ultimate rules of counterpoint that should be observed in first species counterpoint and are almost never broken in any counterpoint with two voices.  
*When progressing into a perfect consonance, oblique motion or contrary motion may be used.
*When progressing into a imperfect consonance, any motion might be used (however, parallel motion may only be used when progressing from imperfect to imperfect).

Motion, with regards to counterpoint, is the relationship between two notes in different voices and how they &quot;move&quot;, with reference to each other, as the score progresses.
*Motion where one voice does not move and the other does is called '''oblique motion'''.
*Motion where one voice moves up and the other down, or vice versa is called '''contrary motion'''.
*Motion where both voices move up or down in the same interval is called '''parallel motion'''.
*Motion where both voices move down, or both up (but not necessarily by the same interval) is called '''similar motion'''.

Parallel motion may be considered a special case of similar motion.

==The Definition of Consonances==
*A '''consonance''' is any interval considered harmonious by tonal standards (the third, sixth, fifth, octave, and unison). (Note that the unison may not be used except in beginning a counterpoint below the cantus firmus.)
**a '''Perfect Consonance''' is any consonant interval that cannot be major or minor.  These are the Perfect Fifth, Perfect Octave, and Perfect Unison (and any variation of these such as the fifteenth).
:''Special Note:'' In traditional counterpoint, the fourth is not considered a consonance because of the potential dissonance that can result if both fourth and third or fourth and fifth are utilized with a bass line in three or four voice counterpoint; however, in the less strict counterpoint of more vertical music, fourths are very frequently utilized as consonances.  In the case of any exercises in counterpoint, it would be prudent to consider the fourth as a dissonance.  
:*an '''Imperfect Consonance''' is any consonant interval that can be either major or minor.  These are the major and minor third, sixth and tenth.  
*A '''dissonance''' is any interval that is considered to be unpleasant to the ear or unstable by tonal standards (these are the second, tritone, seventh, and augmented or diminished intervals)

==Linear Nature of Counterpoint==
Good counterpoint must be multiple melodies set against each other.  As such, both melodies must be well written, with mostly stepwise motion and a high or low point that is reached as a &quot;goal&quot; of the melody.  In general, large skips should not be made over the bar line or onto a strong beat.  There are many other rules that will not be described in particular detail here.  
==Chordal Nature of Counterpoint==
It is important for counterpoint to make harmonic sense in addition to melodic sense.  The first and last chords must be the tonic chord of the key, and it is important for the cadence to make sense (usually the dominant or subdominant chord of the key).  
==Archaic vs. Modern==
Fifths are more utilized in archaic style as a perfect consonance.  In modern style, fifths are less utilized in favor of imperfect consonances, because these emphasize the tonality of the implied chord (major or minor)
==Use of Leaps==
According to Fux, leaps of seventh or any diminished or augmented intervals should be avoided. The melodic direction should change after a leap greater than a third.

==Cadences==
*'in archaic style': If the counterpoint is in the upper voice, the cadence should involve a major sixth resolving to a perfect consonance.  If the counterpoint is in the lower voice, the cadence should be a minor third resolving to a perfect consonance.  

*'in modern style': A V or IV chord must resolve to a I chord.

'''Multi-language labels (internationalization)'''

''''Important:'''' the following described files have to be in UTF-8-format or special characters like German umlauts will not be displayed correctly!

In the &lt;tt&gt;/WEB-INF&lt;/tt&gt;-directory create the files according to your needs, f.i. one with the standard labels (this one is selected if no matching language files could be found), &lt;tt&gt;i3-labels.properties&lt;/tt&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;app.title=Standard entry for the label if no other language-file matches
app.title.setByJavaCode=Standard entry for the label set by java code if no other language-file matches
app.question.delete={
Do you really want to delete this item? (Standard)
If enclosed in curly brackets, you can also include multiline-messages...
}
app.question.confirm=Please confirm...&lt;/pre&gt;
, one for user with german locale, &lt;tt&gt;i3-labels_de.properties&lt;/tt&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;app.title=Test für deutschen Label (German label)
app.title.setByJavaCode=Set by java code: Test für deutschen Label (German label)
app.question.delete={
Wirklich dieses Item löschen (Deutsch/German)?
Durch die Eingabe innerhalb von geschwungenen Klammern sind auch mehrzeilige Meldungen möglich.
}
app.question.confirm=Bitte bestätigen (de)...&lt;/pre&gt;
, and finally one for users with German locale in Germany, &lt;tt&gt;i3-labels_de_DE.properties&lt;/tt&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;app.title=Test für deutschen Label in Deutschland (German label in Germany)
app.title.setByJavaCode=Set by java code: Test für deutschen Label in Deutschland (German label in Germany)
app.question.delete={
Wirklich dieses Item löschen (Deutsch in Deutschland/German in Germany)?
Durch die Eingabe innerhalb von geschwungenen Klammern sind auch mehrzeilige Meldungen möglich.
}
app.question.confirm=Bitte bestätigen (de_DE)...&lt;/pre&gt;
If you want to change also the messages in the messageboxes you have to create special files in the directory &lt;tt&gt;/WEB-INF/classes/metainfo/mesg/&lt;/tt&gt; (at least on Tomcat; else in the &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;classpath&gt;/metainfo/mesg/&lt;/tt&gt;). The name of the files depend on the message you want to overwrite/create a language dependent value. For a list of all available messages you can unzip the jar-files of zk with your favourite unpacker and look at the included &lt;tt&gt;metainfo/mesg/*.properties&lt;/tt&gt;-files. F.i. to change the &lt;tt&gt;Messagebox.YES&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;Messagebox.NO&lt;/tt&gt; values you have to create a file &lt;tt&gt;/WEB-INF/classes/metainfo/mesg/msgzul_de.properties&lt;/tt&gt; (as the values are defined in the &lt;tt&gt;zul.jar&lt;/tt&gt;) with the following content:
&lt;pre&gt;2220=Ja bitte
2221=Nein danke&lt;/pre&gt;
The values before the &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, f.i. 2220 for &lt;tt&gt;Messagebox.YES&lt;/tt&gt; can be seen in the &lt;tt&gt;metainfo/mesg/msgzul.properties&lt;/tt&gt;-file if you unzip the &lt;tt&gt;zul.jar&lt;/tt&gt;-file. Some examples for the messageboxes:
&lt;pre&gt;#-=OK
2200=OK
#-=CANCEL
2201=Cancel
#-=YES
2220=Yes
#-=NO
2221=No
#-=RETRY
2230=Retry
#-=ABORT
2231=Abort
#-=IGNORE
2232=Ignore&lt;/pre&gt;

Next is the zul-file, where the first label is hardcoded, the second one set with an el-expression and the third is set with java-code. If you click on the button, a messagebox is shown depending on your locale.
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?taglib uri=&quot;/WEB-INF/tld/web/core.dsp.tld&quot; prefix=&quot;c&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;zk&gt;
	&lt;window onCreate=&quot;setLabel3()&quot;&gt;
		&lt;zscript&gt;
			public setLabel3() {
				lbl3.setValue(org.zkoss.util.resource.Labels.getLabel(&quot;app.title.setByJavaCode&quot;));
			}

                        public showMsgBox() {
                                Messagebox.show(org.zkoss.util.resource.Labels.getLabel(&quot;app.question.delete&quot;), org.zkoss.util.resource.Labels.getLabel(&quot;app.question.confirm&quot;), Messagebox.YES | Messagebox.NO, Messagebox.QUESTION);
                        }
		&lt;/zscript&gt;
		&lt;vbox&gt;
			&lt;label id=&quot;lbl1&quot; value=&quot;Hard coded label&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;label id=&quot;lbl2&quot; value=&quot;With el: ${c:l('app.title')}&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;label id=&quot;lbl3&quot; value=&quot;Will be set by java class&quot; /&gt;
                        &lt;button id=&quot;btnMsg&quot; label=&quot;Messagebox&quot; onClick=&quot;showMsgBox()&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/vbox&gt;
	&lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/zk&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;tt&gt;taglib&lt;/tt&gt;-tag is only needed if you want to use the el-expression. If you have many labels, you can also do the following within zscript (for shortening  the getLabel-command):
&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;import org.zkoss.util.resource.Labels;

public setLabel3() {
        lbl3.setValue(Labels.getLabel(&quot;app.title.setByJavaCode&quot;));
}&lt;/source&gt;

=== Snippets within java-code ===
'''Refresh (redraw) a component'''
Every component has a redraw-method, so to refresh its appearance try the following.
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;// F.i. you have a button with id=&quot;btn&quot;
java.io.StringWriter wr = new java.io.StringWriter();
btn.redraw(wr);&lt;/source&gt;
'''Selecting in a listbox via label'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;for(Iterator it = mylistbox.getItems().iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
  Listitem li = (Listitem) it.next();
  if (&quot;b&quot;.equals(li.getLabel()) {
    li.setSelected(true);
    break;
  }
}&lt;/source&gt;
'''Set language-dependend label value'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;((Label) Path.getComponent(&quot;//lbl3&quot;)).setValue(org.zkoss.util.resource.Labels.getLabel(&quot;app.title.setByJavaCode&quot;));&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Modelling the Christmas Story ==

We will now user our knowledge engineering skillz to model the [[wikipedia:Christmas|Christmas]] stories in [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Matthew|Matthew]] and [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Luke|Luke]] that a historian can compare and contrast them.

=== Functional Prerequisites ===

[[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Matthew|Matthew]] and [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Luke|Luke]] want to show that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah. Matthew and Luke want to show that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah; this calls for our modal statement and projection microtheory setup. 

 In Mt: GospelOfMatthewIntentionMt. 
 f: (beliefs (AuthorFn Matthew-BookOfBible) 
      (isa JesusOfNazareth Messiah)). 

 In Mt: GospelOfMatthewMt. 
 f: (isa JesusOfNazareth Messiah). 

 In Mt: GospelOfLukeIntentionMt. 
 f: (beliefs (AuthorFn Luke-BookOfBible) 
      (isa JesusOfNazareth Messiah)). 

 In Mt: GospelOfLukeMt. 
 f: (isa JesusOfNazareth Messiah).

From the [[wikipedia:Old_Testament|Old Testament]], specifically its prophecies, [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Matthew|Matthew]] and [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Luke|Luke]] know that the Messiah has to be born in Bethlehem. From the historical life of Jesus of Nazareth, however, they also know that Jesus has to end up living his childhood in Nazareth &amp;mdash; as his name suggests. 

==== The Prophetic Precondition ====

The prophetic passage regarding the location of the birth is the prophet Micah 5:2:
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;&lt;BR&gt;for out of you will come a ruler&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.'&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

The prophetic passage regarding the [[wikipedia:Virgin_birth|virgin birth]] is in Isiah 7:14: 
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel—which means, &quot;God with us.&quot;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

The critical aspects that the two gospels amalgamate from these two prophetic passages can be represented as follows:

 In Mt: MessianicPropheciesMt.
 f: (implies
       (and
         (isa ?SON MalePerson)
         (isa ?VIRGIN Virgin)
         (isa ?B-DAY BirthingEvent)
         (birthChild ?B-DAY ?SON)
         (birthParent ?B-DAY ?VIRGIN)
         (locationOf ?B-DAY Bethlehem))
       (isa ?SON Messiah)).

==== The Historical Precondition ====

The basic problem is expressed by the following rule:

 In Mt: FertileCrescentNamingConventionMt.
 f: (implies
       (and
          (isa ?PERSON FamousPerson)
          (isa ?EVENT Childhood)
          (animateActedOn ?EVENT ?PERSON)
          (locationOf ?EVENT ?TOWN)
          (firstName ?PERSON ?NAME))
       (ist EnglishLexiconMt 
          (commonNickName ?PERSON (WordConcatenationFn ?NAME Of-TheWord ?TOWN))).
   
This rule explains [[wikipedia:Herodotus|Herodotus of Halikarnassos]] as well as it explains Jesus of Nazareth. Which means that the narrative of the childhood of Jesus has to be brought round to end up in the village of Nazareth in Galilee.

== The Differences in the Christmas Narratives ==

Now we get into the individual differences between the two narratives as provided by [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Matthew|Matthew]] and [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Luke|Luke]]. It will become immediately obvious that these two narratives could not co-exist in the same context of reasoning without inducing contradictions.

=== The Announcement of the Miraculous Birth ===

# Who is the recipient of the announcement?
# Does the announcement preceed the begin of the pregnancy?
# Where and when does the announcement occur?

 Constant: AnnouncementOfBirthOfMessiah.
 In Mt: SharedNewTestamentMt.
 isa: AnnouncingSomething.
 ibtGenerated: BirthOfMessiah-IBT. 

Notice that the contents of the information bearing thing, the angelic message, would also be represented as a context of its own, a propositional information thing derived from the information bearing thing that is the announcement. While these announcements differ slightly, they are similar enough that for our current purposes we can use the following representational approach:

 In Mt: BaseMt.
 f: (genlMt (PITofIBTFn BirthOfMessiah-IBT) SharedNewTestamentMt). 
 In Mt: (PITofIBTFn BirthOfMessiah-IBT).
 f: (thereExists ?EVENT
      (and 
        (thereExists ?SON
          (isa ?EVENT Birth)
          (birthParent ?EVENT Mary-MotherOfJesus)
          (birthChild ?EVENT ?SON) 
          (isa ?SON MalePerson)
          (nameString ?SON &quot;Jesus&quot;))
        (startsAfterEndOf ?EVENT AnnouncementOfBirthOfMessiah)). 

Now we get to the meat of the differences. First, the recipients are different:

 In Mt: GospelAccordingToLukeMt.
 senderOfInfo: Gabriel-ArchAngel.
 f: (intendedAudience BirthOfMessiah-IBT Mary-MotherOfJesus).

 In Mt: GospelAccordingToMatthewMt.
 senderOfInfo: (SomeFn Angel).
 f: (intendedAudience BirthOfMessiah-IBT Joseph-FatherOfJesus).

Secondly, the temporal relationship to the pregnancy differs:

 In Mt: SharedNewTestamentMt.
 Constant: MiraculousPregnancyOfMaryWithJesus.
 isa: Pregnancy.
 physiologicalConditionAffects: Mary-MotherOfJesus. 

 In Mt: GospelAccordingToLukeMt.
 f: (startsAfterEndOf MiraculousPregnancyOfMaryWithJesus AnnouncementOfBirthOfMessiah).

 In Mt: GospelAccordingToMatthewMt.
 f: (startsAfterStartOf AnnouncementOfBirthOfMessiah MiraculousPregnancyOfMaryWithJesus).

For right now we will gloss over the fact that one of the announcements happened inside a dream (as they always do in the [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Matthew|Gospel of Matthew]]), while the other happens in broad daylight in Mary's house (which presumably means in the house of her parents). But we can capture the fact that the announcements happened in the different cities:

 In Mt: GospelAccordingToLukeMt.
 f: (eventOccursAt AnnouncementOfBirthOfMessiah NazarethGalilee).

 In Mt: GospelAccordingToMatthewMt.
 f: (eventOccursAt AnnouncementOfBirthOfMessiah BethlehemJudea).

=== Establishing the Location of the Birth ===

# What do Mary and Joseph have to do to be in Bethlehem?
# Where does the birth take place?

We have already pointed out that according to [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Matthew|Matthew]], Joseph and Mary lived in Bethlehem all along, which in [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Luke|Luke]] they have to travel to Bethlehem, based on a census ordered by Roman emperor [[wikipedia:Augustus|August]].

 In Mt: GospelOfMatthewMt.
 f: (residesInRegion Mary-MotherOfJesus BethlehemJudea).
 f: (residesInRegion Joseph-FatherOfJesus BethlehemJudea).

 In Mt: GospelOfLukeMt.
 f: (residesInRegion Mary-MotherOfJesus NazarethGalilee).
 f: (residesInRegion Joseph-FatherOfJesus NazarethGalilee).

 Constant: JourneyToBethlehemForCensus.
 isa: Travel-TripEvent.
 doneBy: Joseph-FatherOfJesus, Mary-MotherOfJesus.
 fromLocation: NazarethGalilee.
 toLocation: BethlehemJudea.

Now that we have the holy couple securely in Bethlehem ready to fulfill the prophecy, we can describe the birthing event.

 In Mt: BirthOfTheMessiah.
 isa: BirthEvent.
 birthParent: Mary-MotherOfJesus.
 birthChild: JesusOfNazareth.

 In Mt: GospelOfMatthewMt.
 Constant: HouseOfJosephInBethlehem.
 isa: House.
 f: (owns Joseph-FatherOfJesus HouseOfJosephInBethlehem).
 f: (eventOccursAt BirthOfTheMessiah HouseOfJosephInBethlehem).
 
 In Mt: GospelOfLukeMt.
 Constant: StableWhereJesusWasBorn.
 isa: Stable.
 internalSubRegion: BethlehemJudea.
 adjacentTo: (SomeFn HotelBuilding).
 f: (eventOccursAt BirthOfTheMessiah StableWhereJesusWasBorn).

=== The First Visitors ===

From what has been shown so far, it should be pretty obvious how to handle the first visitors, namely the shepards in the case of [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Luke|Luke]] versus the Wise Kings or Magi from the East in [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Matthew|Matthew]]. In fact, these are left as an exercise to the reader since they add nothing new in terms of how to approach this problem.

=== On to Nazareth ===

# How direct is the route to Nazareth?

What we said above about the visitors of Baby Jesus equally applies to the eventual return to Nazareth. There is the same angelic visions in dreams in [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Matthew|Matthew]] and the journeying first to Egypt and then back to Galilee (via the stop-over in Judea). [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Luke|Luke]] does not even recount the story of the return.

=== A Temporal Correction ===

There is actually at least one subtle mistake in the representation we have given so far: specifically, we have glossed over the fact that the temporal extent of the microtheory contexts is in some cases larger than is appropriate for the facts we have stated. The indivudal events are fine &amp;mdash; here the actor and role assignments are understood to be restricted to the temporal extent of event, not to the temporal extent of the enveloping context. But what about our residency statements regarding Joseph and Mary in the [[wikipedia:Gospel_of_Matthew|Gospel of Matthewe]]?

 ;; WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG
 In Mt: GospelOfMatthewMt.
 f: (residesInRegion Mary-MotherOfJesus BethlehemJudea).
 f: (residesInRegion Joseph-FatherOfJesus BethlehemJudea).

This is false, because they also reside in Egypt for a couple of years and then they move to Nazareth altogether &amp;mdash; we already discussed this. Anything asserted in the &lt;CODE&gt;GospelOfMatthewMt&lt;/CODE&gt; would have temporal extent to the whole of the story time as narrated, i.e. from the time of the opening geneaology to Jesus' ascension at the end of the Gospel.

In general temporal qualification is usually understood to mean mapping to an absolute timeline, like the Julian calendar. 

 In Mt: GospelOfMatthewMt.
 Time Dimension: (TimeIntervalInclusiveFn (YearBCE-JulianFn 7) (YearBCE-JulianFn 3)).
 Time Parameter: Time-Point.
 f: (residesInRegion JesusOfNazareth BethlehemJudea).

However, for our situation this is often inappropriate; for many of the events recounted here, we do not have dates (and sometimes we might not even have rough estimates). Fortunately, temporal qualification is not restricted to absolute dates. Rather, the temporal constraints of an event can be pushed up into the temporal dimension. So we can relate the constraints in terms of story time, as long as the events themselves are temporally related to each other in terms of their sequence.

 In Mt: GospelOfMatthewMt.
 Constant: HolyFamilyHidingInEgypt.
 isa: Event.
 startsAfterEndOf: BirthOfTheMessiah.
 endsBeforeStartOf: HolyFamilyBackInNazareth.
 f: (subEvents ChildhoodOfJesusOfNazareth HolyFamilyHidingInEgypt).

 Time Dimension: (TemporalExtentInMtFn HolyFamilyHidingInEgypt GospelOfMatthewMt)
 Time Parameter: Time-Point.
 f: (residesInRegion JesusOfNazareth Egypt).

==Page Name==
I think the name of this page isn't appropriate. Indeed, the page only talks about articles. Maybe we should add the other informations about genders which are on other pages as how to transform a masculine noun in an feminine nouns. [[User:Ernest no maboroshi|Ernest no maboroshi]] 12:48, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
:More information on nouns was added by Hagindaz a few weeks later. You make a good point about the name though. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:04, 16 April 2010 (UTC)

== Three Notorious Exceptions ==

I believe there are three nouns in French that switch genders when they are in the plural form:

Amour (un bel amour =&gt; Des belles amours), orgue, délice

Should that be mentioned on the page?

: Yes, that's a good idea. The [[French/Grammar|Grammar]] section of [[French]] should be a complete reference book. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 23:46, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

::Probably, aiming for completeness is too ambitious given current activity levels. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:04, 16 April 2010 (UTC)

==Partitive article?==
A section for this could be added on this page, based on [[Wikipedia:French articles and determiners]] or [[French/Lessons/Food_and_drink]]. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 23:45, 16 April 2010 (UTC)
:Done, but perhaps some duplication with the previous section has been introduced. Help from any knowledgeable editors would be welcomed! [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 11:12, 17 April 2010 (UTC)

==Subject Pronouns?==
It would probably be more logical to move the section on subject pronouns to the [[French/Grammar/Pronouns]] page. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:11, 16 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Traditionally, damage by wax moths (generally the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonela) has accounted for large losses of stored comb. This is especially in the southeastern and southwestern United States, where warm temperatures ensure a viable wax moth population year around. The larval stage of the wax moth does damage by boring into and leaving silk-lined tunnels or galleries in the combs, in extreme cases, the comb is reduced to nothing more than a mass of web. Larvae will also bore holes in the wooden parts of the hive. 

It is emphasized that the wax moth is generally not responsible for the death of a colony. Rather this insect is a &quot;garbage man&quot; of sorts, moves into areas unprotected by worker bees, and can be an early warning signal that everything is not well with a colony. Strongly populated honey bee colonies always have wax moths, but are unaffected because the moth larvae are being continually sought out and then cast out of the hive. Only when a colony becomes weak in numbers because of disease, starvation or some other occurrence, does the wax moth move in to &quot;clean up&quot; the colony by consuming the comb.

Wax moth is a consistent and vexing problem in stored comb; the rate of moth development in a stack of stored supers rivals the imagination! Traditionally, stored comb has been either heated, cooled or fumigated with chemicals to deter wax moth infestation.

A bacterial disease spore, which attacks only wax moth larvae, is now marketed under the name Certan for control. This material represents a breakthrough because the disease is so specific it cannot harm either bees or people and can be used with little concern around bees or equipment. However, its application is labor intensive and not favored by large-scale operators. Several chemical fumigants that have been used in the past were methyl bromide, aluminum phosphide, ethylene dibromide (EDB) and paradichlorobenzene (PDB). At present, only aluminum phosphide and PDB are approved in Florida.

Of these, paradichlorobenzene is less dangerous to the applicator and easier to apply. Unfortunately, it does not kill all stages of wax moth and so remains more of a preventative; it will not clean up a severe case.

Again, it is advisable to buy any chemicals for beekeeping use from bee supply houses; this way full information on use of the substance in beekeeping is available. All pesticides must be labelled for use on stored comb; the label is the law, under no circumstances should a pesticide be used, if that use is not specified on the label. Beeswax is similar in structure to many insecticides and often has an affinity for these substances. As a consequence extreme caution should be exercised when using pesticides anywhere near a beekeeping operation. For further information on toxicity of pesticides, see Florida Cooperative Extension Circular 534 , Protecting Honey Bees From Pesticides.Table 1 is a chart of temperatures required to kill all stages of wax moth using cold or heat treatment as published in Farmers' Bulletin Number 2217 &quot;Controlling the Greater Wax Moth..A Pest of Honeycombs,&quot; USDA Science and Education Administration, 1981.

Care should be taken when treating with cold because beeswax becomes brittle and breaks easily. Even more caution, however, is advised when heat-treating combs. They should only have very little honey to avoid distorting the wax comb, must be placed vertically in supers and the heat must be circulated to avoid creating hot spots which could melt the comb. Consult referenced works for more information on wax moth control. http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AA090

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a survival guide for the '''STAT 222''' course that all '''University of Alberta''' Computing Science students are required to take prior to completion of their degree.  This guide is designed to help anyone who is completely lost in STAT 222.  I started writing this guide because I am currently taking STAT 222 and I have no clue what the hell is going on.  So my goal here is to pass on any knowledge that I can in terms or words that should make sense rather than a bunch of STAT 222 jargon.  I only plan on filling in what I research, which is usually what I don't already know.  Hopefully, as I work on this guide, others will help out by adding more and more knowledge.  Eventually, this survival guide may turn into a replacement for the ''real'' text book.

If you see anything here that is incorrect, poorly stated, or for that matter, if you know something important that isn't mentioned, please by all means add your knowledge/correction to this wikibook.  This wikibook should be built on the knowledge of many students working together.  So please contribute what you can and help make STAT 222 a survivable course.

\section*{Preamble}
This guide is designed to help anyone who is completely lost in STAT 222.  I wrote this because I am currently taking STAT 222 and I have no clue what the hell is going on.  So my goal here is to pass on any knowledge that I can in terms or words that should make sense rather than a bunch of STAT 222 jargon.  I only plan on filling in what I research, which is usually what I don't already know.  Hopefully, when I am done with this guide, someone else can take over and continue adding more and more.  Eventually, this survival guide may turn into a replacement for the real book.\\
Make note that this guide does not include any information on discrete random variables since they are not part of the STAT 222 course material.\\

\chapter{Uniform RV's}
Uniform Random Variables are used where each outcome of an event is equally probable.  For $p_{U}(u) = P(U \leq u)$ where $U$ is some $[a, b]$-Uniform Random Variable, $p_{U}(u)$ will always be zero unless $(a \leq u \leq b)$.  When $(a \leq u \leq b)$, then $p_{U}(u) = \dfrac{1}{b-a}$.\\
\section*{Notable Equations}
\begin{align*}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{X}(x)\delta x&amp; = 1\\
\end{align*}

\chapter{Independence and Conditional Expectations}

$P(X_{1} \leq x_{1}, ..., X_{d} \leq x_{d}) = P(X_{1} \leq x_{1}) \cdot \cdot \cdot P(X_{d} \leq x_{d})$\\
\text{The same goes for }$F_{X_{1...d}}(x_{1...d})$, $f_{X_{1...d}}(x_{1...d})$, $E\left[X_{1...d}\right]$
\caption{If RV's are independent, then you can multiply them together}
\end{figure}

\caption{Moments, however, are a little different}

\section*{Moment Generating Functions}
In general, $M_{X}(u) = E\left[e^{uX}\right] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{ux}f_{X}(x)\delta x = 1 + uE[X] + \dfrac{u^{2}E\left[X^{2}\right]}{2!} + ... + \dfrac{u^{n}E\left[X^{n}\right]}{n!}$\\
Therefore, $\dfrac{\delta^{k}}{\delta u^{k}}M_{X}(u)\vert_{u=0} = E\left[X^{k}\right]$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, ...$\\
$M_{X_{1} + ... + X_{d}}(t) = M_{X_{1}}(t) \cdot\cdot\cdot M_{X_{d}}(t) = E\left[e^{tX_{1}} \cdot\cdot\cdot e^{tX_{d}}\right]$\\

This book is a series of guides that relate to life and education at the '''University of Alberta'''.  The goal of this book is to introduce guides/notes on courses that can be taken, professors that teach the courses, and otherwise general activities that occur on the University of Alberta campus.  Since this is a brand new book, there will not be a lot of content until it becomes more popular and the contributions start to increase.  However, in time, this book can become not only a complete survival guide to life at the University of Alberta, but also a template for other universities to start their own guides.

Life forms with low body mass can exploit varied niches and evade predators. The bones provide levors to affect speed and strength while minimizing body mass; the material stiffness of bone derives from the triple helical structure of type 1 collagen encrusted with hydroxyapatite crystals.  While this composit stucture is strong and light it's performance as a biomaterial is critically dependant on ongoing remodeling of microtrauma sustained in the course of daily mechanical stresses.

Hello, my name is '''Erwin''' and I'm 21 years od. I'm from '''Miami''', Florida. I was born in Havana, Cuba. I love to learn about any and ''every'' topic. I love history. I'm studying Multimedia Design at the ITT Technical Institute in Miami.



==Residence==
I currently reside in Miami, Florida. I grew up in '''Hialeah''', Florida until a few years ago when I moved to Live Oak, Florida. I didn't like it there so I came back to the south. I like this city because of it's diversity and location. I DON'T like it because of its weather, climate and traffic!


==Hobbies==
My hobbies include Web development ([[PHP]], [[MySQL]], [[CSS]]), [[Web Design]], playing the [[guitar]] (Ibanez RG-170), videogames, flying kites, and RC Vehicles.

==10 Facts about me==
{{Babel-2|es|en-4}}
# I was born on April fools day.
# I am not scared of anything except things that scare me.
# I mix Coke with water (2 parts Coke/3 parts water).
# My DNA is exactly the same as my father's brother's brother's son.
# I chew 95% of all the food I eat with the right side of my mouth.
# 2 = 5 + 234 + 95 - 641 + 350 - 200 + 5 + 101 + 55 - 2

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are various learning-styles, experts and theorists have classified learners as visual, auditory, or tactile (touching) and kinesthetic (moving). Learners that prefer the kinesthetic learning style like to learn best when they are involved or active and find it difficult to sit still for long periods, they may often use movement as a memory aid. Those who prefer a tactile way of learning may use writing and drawing as memory aids and learn well in hands-on activities like projects and demonstrations (Teaching English Website 2006)

Visual and in particular auditory learners tend to do well in the classroom. Tactile/kinesthetic learners typically do not. Research increasingly suggests that the majority of students classified as &quot;at risk&quot; of academic failure fit the description of concrete/common sense learner style, and favour the tactile/kinesthetic mode. Kinesthetic activities make abstract concepts concrete.

This is extremely important for students/learners who have difficulty dealing with abstractions. Whether the learner's preferred modality is auditory, visual, or tactile/kinesthetic, it is known that none of us always remembers what is seen or heard, and all of us remember best what we have had an opportunity to do.

An old Chinese proverb expresses this: &quot;I hear and I forget; I see and I remember; I do and I understand.&quot;

The tactile learning style is essentially touch. It is activated through receptors in the skin. Our tactile sense gives us information about size, shape, texture, and temperature. The kinesthetic system is activated through movement, with its receptors located in the tendons and muscles. It is the kinesthetic system that recognizes, for example, when a dance sequence you are practicing has not been properly carried out (TRCC website 2006)

Tactile/Kinesthetic learners engage in the learning process through the use of role play, dramatization, cooperative games, simulations, creative movement and dance, multi-sensory activities and hands-on projects.

What teaching methods and activities suit the tactile or kinesthetic learner?, the following examples highlight some of these;
• the game charades, it could be played as part of a vocabulary-building lesson
• a historical event might be role played or dramatized
• learning of new information might be demonstrated by creating a mural, diagram, model or decorated time line or mind map
• students might be assigned to sort and arrange in proper sequence index cards with information and dates related to the topic being studied (MSET website 2006)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first thing you have to know before becoming a Real Estate agent is know what Real Estate actually is. 

The term Real Estate evolved from &quot;Royal Estates&quot;, during a time when a small group of royalty held the [[w:Allodium|Allodium]] of their collective countries and partitioned it off in return for loyalty and monetary tribute. 

In the world of Real Estate there are two forms of Property, &quot;Real Property&quot; (things owned that are attached to the ground or attached to something in a static state) and &quot;Personal Property&quot; (things owned that are not attached to the ground) 

You, as a Real Estate agent, are there to help those looking to buy or sell their Real Property in exchange for a portion of profits gained from the transaction of that property. You can do the same thing with Personal Property, but there is no stated fiduciary and legal responsibility in doing this for others with Personal Property where usually there is for Real Property. 

When Real Property becomes Personal Property(ripping it out of the ground or whatever it's attached to), this process is called '''severance'''. The opposite, when Personal Property becomes Real Property, is called '''annexation'''. 

When property is in the vague middle ground between Personal and Real Property, it is commonly known as a &quot;fixture&quot;, such as a lightbulb, shelves, a basketball hoop in a driveway, etc. 

The inclusion or exclusion of fixtures can be part of the sale of the property as a whole per the agreement of both parties within the transference of the property (the seller and the buyer). 

==Types of Real Property==
Since we're looking to become Real Estate Agents, people who help others buy and sell Real Property, your focus will largely be on Real Property rather than Personal Property.

The forms of Real Property vary from area to area, largely under the authority of local zoning boards of adjustment, but there are generally a few broad categories that are consistent everywhere.

===Residential===
These are Real Properties that are used for the purpose of shelter. Residential Properties can be owned outright or through a varied number of joint or partial ownership/usership forms we'll discuss later.

===Commercial===
These are Real Properties that are used for the purpose of selling goods and services to others. Transactions regarding Commercial Properties have different criteria that determine its value to buyers and sellers than Residential Properties, and usually transactions regarding Commercial Properties take much longer than with Residential Properties.

===Industrial===
These are Real Properties that are used for the production or creation of something, such as a farm or a factory. Methods used to buy and sell Commercial and Industrial properties are similar in comparison to Residential Properties. 

===Special Use===
Sometimes termed differently, these are Real Properties that do not fit into the above three categories, and are usually seen as properties that are there for the good of the community such as parks, churches, government buildings, and so on. 

===Mixed Use===
These are Real Properties that combine one or more of the above kinds of Real Property, and often require a '''variance''', or permission from a local zoning board of adjustment to change the primary use of the property that is normally prohibited under local zoning law, due to the effects of that use on the property towards adjacent properties.

==The Township Range System==
When the United States was just entering the 19th Century, the Government decided that the country's new settlements to the west needed another ownership cataloging system because the [[w:Metes and Bounds|Metes and Bounds]] system just wasn't working out. 

Usually deeds to properties under Metes and Bounds would be a fancier version of something like...

'' Jim owns the land from the big rock to the tree with three branches to the river and back to the big rock ''

But what if somebody moved the rock? Or cut down the tree? Or the river changed its course? Jim would be screwed, that's what.  

So, all states except for the original colonies, Maine, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Texas, and the District of Columbia use the [[w:Township (United States)|Township Range System]], also known as the [[w:Public Land Survey System|Public Land Survey System]]. If you are going to be an agent in one of the states that doesn't use the Township Range System, you'll never need to know it again after you have learn it for the test, unless the government decides to go nuts and implement the Township Range System on those states too, which is about as likely as the Moon colliding into one of those states.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many ways to get rid of things: remove, rollback, revert, obliterate, unpull, unrecord... One would almost think too many.  Only three of these are very important.  In order of gravity, they are &lt;tt&gt;revert&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;unrecord&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;obliterate&lt;/tt&gt;.  You can also see them as being part of this table of symmetries:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
{|border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
!|recency
!|task
!|anti-task 
|-
||more recent
||whatsnew&lt;br&gt;(i.e: add, remove, mv, editing a file)
||revert
|-
||recent
||record
||unrecord
|-
||less recent
||pull
||unpull (aka obliterate)
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Don't worry too much about this table.  Surely it will make sense later on.

Anyway, here is a brief comparison of all the different ways you can get rid of stuff.  Each one has its place, even the weird ones, like &lt;tt&gt;rollback&lt;/tt&gt;.

== The big three ==

=== &lt;tt&gt;revert&lt;/tt&gt; only removes what's new ===

{{side note|side=right|&lt;tt&gt;revert&lt;/tt&gt;ed something by mistake?  Try &lt;tt&gt;unrevert&lt;/tt&gt;}}
The simplest of these commands is '''revert'''.  All reverting does is to get rid of stuff you have not recorded yet.  You can think of revert as being the &quot;opposite&quot; of whatsnew.  Revert gets rid of stuff that is new.

[[Image:Darcs-repo-revert.png|center|The darcs revert command]]

=== &lt;tt&gt;unrecord&lt;/tt&gt; makes things new again ===

'''Unrecord''' does something quite different from revert.  Whereas revert gets rid of stuff that is new, unrecord removes a patch, but here's the important part, ''makes the stuff in it new again'' so that you can choose to re-record or revert it at your leisure.

Unrecord should only be used if you recorded something, realised you made a mistake, and want to record it differently (note also amend-record).  Note: only use unrecord if you are sure that your repository is the only one that has that patch in it!

[[Image:Darcs-repo-unrecord.png|center|The darcs unrecord command]]

Note that the picture above gives a somewhat more accurate depiction of what unrecord does - it removes a patch and the corresponding modifications from the pristine tree.  The fact that something is new again is just a natural consequence of this fact.

=== &lt;tt&gt;obliterate&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;unrecord&lt;/tt&gt; + &lt;tt&gt;revert&lt;/tt&gt; ===

'''Obliterate''' was deliberately named to be scary.  Obliterate can be seen as unrecording a patch (thus making its stuff new again) and then reverting it.  In other words, obliterate totally wipes a patch out!  Typically: you would use obliterate to go really far back in time.  Say, &quot;hmm, all that stuff I've been working on for the past three months was pretty stupid&quot;.  Obliterate is the answer there.

[[Image:Darcs-repo-obliterate.png|center|The darcs obliterate command]]

{{Info|It is probably a good idea to &lt;tt&gt;darcs get&lt;/tt&gt; a backup copy of your repository before obliterating things.  This way, if you accidentally remove something by mistake, you can pull it back in}}

== Other ways to get rid of things ==

=== &lt;tt&gt;unpull&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;obliterate&lt;/tt&gt; ===

'''Unpull''' and '''obliterate''' are exactly the same command and is only named this way to reflect its usefulness for undoing a pull.

=== &lt;tt&gt;rollback&lt;/tt&gt; ===

'''Rollback''' is not a command that you can expect to use very often.  The situation is this.  You've got a patch you want to get rid of, but people have been telling you that you shouldn't obliterate or unrecord patches that are already in other people's repositories.  So what do you do?  One solution is to fire up your text editor and make exact opposite changes as the ones in the patch (and then record, etc).  Another solution is to generate a rollback patch, which does the same thing.  It creates a patch that does exactly the opposite of another patch.

Some users just find it easier to go the text-editor route.

=== &lt;tt&gt;remove&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't belong here ===

Despite its getting-rid-of-things style name, &lt;tt&gt;remove&lt;/tt&gt; is not really an undo kind of command.  Its job is the opposite of &lt;tt&gt;add&lt;/tt&gt;'s: it tells darcs not to pay attention to a file any longer.  But as we mentioned in the previous chapter, most of the time you don't even need &lt;tt&gt;darcs remove&lt;/tt&gt;.  Simply telling your computer to get rid of the file in your working directory is good enough for darcs to notice it is gone.

== Questions and objections ==

* But... but... I just want to go back to the state of my repository from two weeks ago!
** &lt;tt&gt;obliterate&lt;/tt&gt; is probably what you want.  See above.

Osteoarthritis is the most common disabling condition of humans in the western world. Recently with questions about the cardiac safety of Vioxx prompting the removal of that drug from the market, we search for alternatives to Cox II selective NSAIDS. 
Recognizing that anything you put in your mouth can be fatal, we still hesitate to use a medication for a non-life threatening condition when there may be life threatening consequences to the treatment, however rare.
The question of efficacy for other alternatives to NSAIDS is the subject of a recently completed large scale study.  There is a suggestion of efficacy for the combination of Chondroitin Sulfate, derived from animal cartilage in combination with Glucosamine derived from shellfish, the combination marketed as an alternative remedy and classified as a food additive, therefore not subject to the scrutiny of the FDA.

Euler's Method is a method for estimating the value of a function based upon the values of that function's first derivative.

The general algorithm for finding a value of &lt;math&gt; y(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is:

{{Calculus/Def|text=
: &lt;math&gt; y_{n+1} = y_n + \Delta x_{step} \cdot f(x_n,y_n), \ &lt;/math&gt;
}}
where f is y'(x). In other words, the new value, &lt;math&gt;y_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, is the sum of the old value &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; and the step size &lt;math&gt;\Delta x_{step}&lt;/math&gt; times the change, &lt;math&gt;f(x_n,y_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

You can think of the algorithm as a person traveling with a map: Now I am standing here and based on these surroundings I go that way 1 km. Then, I check the map again and determine my direction again and go 1 km that way. I repeat this until I have finished my trip.

The Euler method is mostly used to solve differential equations of the form 

{{Calculus/Def|text=: 
  &lt;math&gt; 
    y' = f(x,y), 
    y(x_0) = y_0. \ 
&lt;/math&gt;
}}


==Examples==

A simple example is to solve the equation: 


{{Calculus/Def|text=: 
  &lt;math&gt; 
    y' = x + y,  
    y(0) = 1. \ 
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
This yields &lt;math&gt;f = y' = x + y&lt;/math&gt; and hence, the updating rule is:
{{Calculus/Def|text=: 
  &lt;math&gt; 
    y_{n+1} = y_n + 0.1 (x_n + y_n)\ 
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
Step size &lt;math&gt;\Delta x_{step}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.1 is used here.

The easiest way to keep track of the successive values generated by the algorithm is to draw a table with columns for &lt;math&gt; n, x_n, y_n, y_{n+1} \ &lt;/math&gt;.

The above equation can be e.g. a population model, where y is the population size and x a decease that is reducing the population.

Kienbocks, stage IIIA with slightly negative ulnar variance age 40-50. There is as associated coronal plane fracture.
Conservative management may be satisfactory if range of motion and grip are good and pain managable with occasional non narcotic analgesic.
Pain which requires daily analgesic, which precludes desired avocational activity, which interferes with gainful employment may warrant ameliorative surgery.
Radial shortening, the width of two saw blades,or metaphyseal decompression, denervation and orif of the fractured lunate with a herbert screw.  Consider arthrocopy to evaluate articular surfaces at the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints to help decide between salvage of the lunate vs PRC. Scaphocapitate arthrodesis or capitate shortening are considerations for destressing the lunate.   The patient should understand that wrist arthodesis may be required and the above motion preserving options may offer incomplete or temporary relief. The patient may be well advised to give consent on a contingent basis to arthrodesis if the intraoperative findings suggest an unpredictable outcome from a lesser procedure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your job as a Real Estate Agent is to assist those helping to buy and sell Real Property, as discussed in [[../Real Estate/]]. 

However, there are several forms of agency that you and a person looking to buy or sell Real Estate can enter into. 

==Buyer's Agency==
In this form of agency, the agent has a [[w:fiduciary|fiduciary]] responsibility to a person or group looking to purchase Real Property. 

As an agent, you must faithfully submit all offers proposed by your client, give your client advice to the best of your abilities and never divulge information that may jeopardize your client's bargaining position.

==Seller's Agency==
In this form of agency, the agent has a [[w:fiduciary|fiduciary]] responsibility to the seller of the Real Property, basically mirroring the obligations of a Buyer's Agent (not jeopardizing the Seller's bargaining position, notifying the Seller of all offers, marketing the property to prospective buyers, etc.) 

Until recently, Seller's Agency was traditionally seen as what a Real Estate Agent &quot;did&quot;, basically as little more than a marketing scout. 

Often, a Seller will also become a Buyer for a new property when moving from one residence to another, this is sometimes colloquially referred to as a &quot;Double Whammy&quot;{{ref|1}}

==Disclosed Dual Agency==
It is unethical throughout the United States to be both a Buyer's Agent and a Seller's Agent at the same time without notifying both sides, and in some states, it is unethical to do so even when notifying both sides. 

However, in the states where it is ethical, which is the majority of them, an agreement where an agent represents both the buyer and the seller is called a ''Disclosed Dual Agency''. In a Disclosed Dual Agency, the Agent's duties become ministerial, and the fiduciary responsibility switches from that of the client to that of making sure the transaction is completed smoothly and neutrally, while not divulging any information that may have been received from prior agency agreements. 

When two agents close a deal from the same office, this is also technically a Dual Disclosed Agency since agents in the same office technically have fiduciary responsibilities to all clients contracted from that office, although the clients directly contracted to a certain agent usually have the agent's primary focus. 

==Non-Agency==

Under this form of agency, or lack thereof, the person looking to buy or sell Real Estate is known as a ''customer'' rather than a ''client''.

With the squeamishness of many people and groups looking to buy or sell Real Property, this is probably the most common form of Agency, despite its name. Non-Agents do not hold any fiduciary responsibility.

Theoretically, ''Sub Agents'', or agents contracted by other agents to do specific tasks in regards to their client for a share of the commission, are lumped in this category.

==Common Misconceptions==
Common to contrary belief, not all real estate agents are ''Realtors'', a ''Realtor'' is simply a member of the National Association of Realtors, a U.S-wide group of Real Estate agents.

The '''Zone diet''' is a diet popularised in books by Dr. Barry Sears, based on a theory that you can regulate blood sugar levels by maintaining a balance between [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]], [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|fats]], and [[Cookbook:Protein|proteins]].

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Future perfect}} ==
The future perfect tense, or the ''futur antérieur'', is used to say that before an event occurs, something else ''will have'' occurred by that time. Phrases constructed in the future perfect tense mean ''will have …ed'' in both French and English.

=== Formation ===
The future perfect is a perfect tense, and therefore consists of an auxiliary verb and a past participle. The auxiliary verb, ''avoir'' or ''être'', is conjugated in the future tense. All rules that apply to the ''passé composé'' and other perfect tenses, such as certain verbs using ''être'' as an auxiliary verb, apply to the future perfect as well.

; L'élection présidentielle
: Le président de la république est élu pour 5 ans au suffrage universel direct. L'élection comporte 2 tours : au premier tour la plupart des partis, petits ou grands, proposent un candidat. Il existe aussi de nombreux candidats soutenus par aucun parti. Il y a souvent entre 10 et 15 candidats au premier tour. Les 2 candidats arrivant en tête au premier tour s'affrontent lors du deuxième tour. En général, il y a un candidat du PS et un candidat de l'UMP au deuxième tour. 
: En 2002, à la surprise générale, Jean-Marie Le Pen (FN) est arrivé deuxième au premier tour devant Lionel Jospin (PS). Le second tour a donc opposé Jacques Chirac (UMP) et Jean-Marie Le Pen (FN). Jacques Chirac l'a largement emporté avec 80% des voix.
: Le Président de la République est le chef des armées et il désigne le Premier Ministre.

; L'Assemblée Nationale
: Les députés sont élus au suffrage universel direct à 2 tours.
: Les députés peuvent renversé le gouvernement si la politique qu'il conduit ne leur convient pas. Le Premier Ministre doit alors démissionner. Le Président de la République est donc obligé de choisir un Premier Ministre ayant la majorité des députés à l'Assemblée Nationale.
: L'Assemblée Nationale vote les lois proposées par le gouvernement.

; Le sénat
: Il est élu au suffrage indirect : seul les maires et les autres élus peuvent voter pour les sénateurs. Les sénateurs peuvent modifier certaines lois mais ont assez peu de pouvoir.}}

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Simple past of regular verbs}} ==

Unlike in English, there is a literary past tense in French, used when writing formally. This past tense is the {{French/Word|passé simple}}. It is relatively simple to predict when to use this tense: for every occurrence of the {{French/Word|passé composé}} in conversational French, one simply uses the {{French/Word|passé simple}} in literary French. Note that the {{French/Word|passé simple}} is not a composed tense, and therefore does not have an auxiliary verb.

=== Formation ===
To conjugate in this tense, find the stem and appends the appropriate ending.

{| {{French/Table|audio=French/Grammar/Formation of the simple past.ogg}}
! Subject || Ending || Conjugated verb || English
|-
| Je || -ai || Je dansai. || I danced.
|-
| Tu || -as || Tu dansas. || You danced.
|-
| Il || -a || Il dansa. || He danced.
|-
| Nous || -âmes || Nous dansâmes. || We danced
|-
| Vous || -âtes || Vous dansâtes. || You danced.

==Grammar: Imperfect - Imparfait==

The imparfait is used to &quot;set the tone&quot; of a past situation.  An example in English being:
&quot;We were singing when Dad came home.&quot;
It tells what was going on when a particular action or event occurred.
In French, the above example would be:
&quot;Nous chantions quand papa est rentré.&quot;

In order to conjugate the imperfect, 

*take the 1st person plural of the verb you want to conjugate:

{| {{French Table|Verb|jouer|to play|0|7}}
! colspan=3 |
|-
! ||singular||plural
|-
!first person
|je joue
|nous jouons
|-
!second person
|tu joues||vous jouez
|-
!third person
|il joue||ils jouent
|}


*Remove the ''-ons'' ending to find the stem, and add these endings:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!subject||ending||jouer&lt;br&gt;(nous ''jou''ons)||finir&lt;br&gt;(nous ''finiss''ons)||attendre&lt;br&gt;(nous ''attend''ons)
|-
!je||''-ais''
|jouais||finissais|||attendais
|-
!tu||''-ais''
|jouais||finissais||attendais
|-
!il/elle/on||''-ait''
|jouait||finissait||attendait
|-
!nous||''-ions''
|jouions||finissions||attendions
|-
!vous||''-iez''
|jouiez||finissiez||attendiez
|-
!ils/elles||''-aient''
|jouaient||finissaient||attendaient
|}

*Verbs ending -cer and -ger are semi-irregular, as shown below. The irregular forms are in bold.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!subject||manger&lt;br&gt;(nous ''mange''ons||commencer&lt;br&gt;(nous ''commenç''ons)
|-
!je
|mangeais||commençais
|-
!tu
|mangeais||commençais
|-
!il/elle/on
|mangeait||commençait
|-
!nous
|'''mangions'''||'''commencions'''
|-
!vous
|'''mangiez'''||'''commenciez'''
|-
!ils/elles
|mangeaient||commençaient
|}
 
*Note: The only verb that has an irregular stem (one not derived from the ''nous'' form of the present idicative) is être. The imperfect endings are added to ét___. Every other verb uses the ''nous'' form of the present indicative as its root.

==Grammar: Possessive Pronouns== 
Possessive pronouns replace possessive article + noun sets.

|}

*Vous avez votre voiture? - You have your car?
*Oui, nous avons la nôtre. - Yes, we have ours.

À + a stress pronoun is used when the noun replaced is also the subject of the sentence. This usually occurs in sentences with être.
*Elle est ta voiture? - Is that your car?
*Oui, elle est à moi. - Yes, it is mine.

==Grammar: Stem Changing Verbs Review==

===-e''x''er Verbs===
-e''x''er are regular -er verbs, but also are stem changing. The stem change applies to all forms except ''nous'' and ''vous'' in the present and all forms of the future simple. The stem change involves adding a grave accent ( ` ) over the ''e'' in the stem.

*Tenses affected by this rule: Present, Future Simple

===-é''x''er Verbs===
Like -e''x''er verbs, the accent acute above the e ( é ) changes to an accent grave ( è ) in all forms except ''nous'' and ''vous'' in the present. However, unlike similar stem changes, this does not affect the Future Simple.

*Tenses affected by this rule: Present

===-yer Verbs===
-yer verbs are regular -er verbs. However, in all forms except ''nous'' and ''vous'' in the present and all forms of the future simple, the &quot;y&quot; changes to an &quot;i&quot;.

*Tenses affected by this rule: Present, Future Simple


===Appeler===
All forms except ''nous'' and ''vous'' in the present and all forms of the future simple have the ''l'' doubled.

*Tenses affected by this rule: Present, Future Simple

===-cer Verbs===
The last ''c'' in the verb changes to ''ç'' in the ''nous'' form of the present and all forms except the &quot;nous&quot; and &quot;vous&quot; forms of the imperfect.

*Tenses affected by this rule: Present, Imperfect
commencer

===-ger Verbs===
An ''e'' is added after the ''g'' in the ''nous'' form of the present and all forms except the &quot;nous&quot; and &quot;vous&quot; forms of the imperfect.

*Tenses affected by this rule: Present, Imperfect
changer&lt;br/&gt;
manger

==Vocabulary: Children's Games and Toys==
* un hochet
* un cheval de bois
* une poupée
* une dinette
* un train électrique
* des légos
* un ours en peluche
* une console de jeu (une nintendo, une gameboy, une ps2)

==Vocabulary: French Children's Poems, Songs, and Stories==
=== Petit Papa Noël ===
Author : Raymond Vincy (1946)&lt;br /&gt;
Composer : Henri Martinet&lt;br /&gt;
Long version in italics&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;C'est la belle nuit de Noël&lt;br /&gt;
La neige étend son manteau blanc&lt;br /&gt;
Et les yeux levés vers le ciel A genoux&lt;br /&gt;
les petits enfants&lt;br /&gt;
Avant de fermer les paupières&lt;br /&gt;
Font une dernière prière&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

{Refrain:}&lt;br /&gt;
Petit Papa Noël&lt;br /&gt;
Quand tu descendras du ciel&lt;br /&gt;
Avec des jouets par milliers&lt;br /&gt;
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier&lt;br /&gt;

Mais, avant de partir&lt;br /&gt;
Il faudra bien te couvrir&lt;br /&gt;
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid&lt;br /&gt;
C'est un peu à cause de moi&lt;br /&gt;

Il me tarde tant que le jour se lève&lt;br /&gt;
Pour voir si tu m'as apporté&lt;br /&gt;
Tous les beaux joujoux que je vois en rêve&lt;br /&gt;
Et que je t'ai commandés&lt;br /&gt;

{Refrain}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Le marchand de sable est passé&lt;br /&gt;
Les enfants vont faire dodo&lt;br /&gt;
Et tu vas pouvoir commencer&lt;br /&gt;
Avec ta hotte sur le dos&lt;br /&gt;
Au son des cloches des églises&lt;br /&gt;
Ta distribution de surprises&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Et quand tu seras sur ton beau nuage&lt;br /&gt;
Viens d'abord sur notre maison&lt;br /&gt;
Je n'ai pas été tous les jours très sage&lt;br /&gt;
Mais j'en demande pardon&lt;br /&gt;

{Refrain}&lt;br /&gt;
Petit Papa Noël&lt;br /&gt;

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Pronominal verbs|review-id=french-pronominal-verbs}} ==
&lt;div id='french-pronominal-verbs'&gt;
Pronominal verbs are verbs that include pronouns. These pronouns are {{French/Word|me}}, {{French/Word|te}}, {{French/Word|se}}, {{French/Word|nous}}, and {{French/Word|vous}} and are used as either direct objects or indirect objects, depending on the verb that they modify. When pronominal verbs are conjugated in perfect tenses, {{French/Word|être}} is used as the auxiliary verb. There are three types of pronominal verbs: reflexive verbs, reciprocal verbs, and naturally pronominal verbs.

=== Reflexive verbs ===
Reflexive verbs reflect the action on the subject:
: {{French/Word|Je me lave.|en=I wash myself.}}
: {{French/Word|Nous nous lavons.|en=We wash ourselves.}}
: {{French/Word|Ils se lavent.|en=They wash themselves.}}

Reflexive verbs can also be used as infinitives:
: {{French/Word|Je vais me laver.|en=I'm going to wash myself.}}

Either the conjugated verb or the infinitive can be negated, each with different meanings:
: {{French/Word|Je ne vais pas me laver.|en=I'm not going to wash myself.}}

In perfect tenses, the past participles agree with the direct object pronoun, but not the indirect object pronoun, in gender and plurality. Therefore it would only agree when the reflexive pronoun is the direct object; the past participle does not agree with the direct object if it goes after the verb:
: {{French/Word|Elle s'est lavée.|en=She washed herself.}}
: {{French/Word|Nous nous sommes lavé{{French/Section|(e)}}s.|en=We washed ourselves.}}
: {{French/Word|Elle s'est lavé les mains.|en=She washed her hands.}}
: {{French/Word|Nous nous sommes lavé les mains.|en=We washed our hands.}}

=== Reciprocal verbs ===
With reciprocal verbs, people perform actions to each other:
: {{French/Word|Nous nous aimons.|en=We like each other.}}

Like reflexive verbs, the past participle of reciprocal verbs agrees in number and gender with the direct object if it goes before the verb. It therefore agrees with all reciprocal pronouns that function as direct objects:
: {{French/Word|Nous nous sommes aimé{{French/Section|(e)}}s.|en=We liked each other.}}

The reciprocal pronoun can also function as an indirect object without a direct object pronoun:
: {{French/Word|Nous nous sommes parlé.|en=We spoke to each other.}}
: {{French/Word|Elles se sont téléphoné.|en=They called to one another.}}
: {{French/Word|Vous vous êtes écrit souvent ?|en=You write to each other often?}}

=== Naturally pronominal verbs ===
Some verbs are pronominal without performing a reflexive or reciprocal action:
: {{French/Word|Tu te souviens ?|en=You remember?}}

In perfect tenses, these verbs agree with the direct object if it goes before the verb; otherwise, the past participle agrees with the subject:
: {{French/Word|Elle s'est souvenue.|en=She remembered.}}
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-pronominal-verbs --&gt;

== {{French/Section|Grammar|{{French/Word|Imparfait}} and {{French/Word|passé composé}}|review-id=french-imperfect}} ==
&lt;div id='french-imperfect'&gt;
The {{French/Word|imparfait}} is used for past habitual actions, to set the scene:
: {{French/Word|Quand j'etais petite, je jouais au foot.}}
: {{French/Word|C'etait samedi. La lune brillait.}}

The {{French/Word|passé composé}}, as well as the {{French/Word|passé simple}}, are used to express punctual actions:
: {{French/Word|Hier, j'ai joué à Colin Maillard. La lune a brillé pendant trois nuits.}}

This does not mean that the action had to happen over a very short time, but that it is understood as a single punctual event, now finished.

The {{French/Word|imparfait}} will express a more general statement while the {{French/Word|passé composé}} will express a more precise action:
: {{French/Word|Les singes criaient violemment lors de ma visite du zoo.|en=When I visited the zoo, the monkeys were loud.}}
: {{French/Word|Lorsque je suis passé devant leur cage, les singes ont crié violemment.|en=When I walked by their cage, the monkeys shouted violently.}}

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Plus-que-parfait}} ==

The {{French/Word|plus-que-parfait}} is used when there are two occurrences in the past and one wants to symbolise that one occurrence happened before the other. In English, this is used in a phrase like ''I '''had given''' him the toy before he went to sleep.'' In this example, there are two past tenses, but they occur at different times. The {{French/Word|plus-que-parfait}} can be used to indicate the occurrence of one before the other (essentially, the past before the past).

In French, the {{French/Word|plus-que-parfait}} is formed by conjugating the auxiliary verb in the {{French/Word|imparfait}} and adding the past participle. So to conjugate {{French/Word|je mange|en=I eat}} in the {{French/Word|plus-que-parfait}}, one finds the appropriate auxiliary verb ({{French/Word|avoir}}), conjugates it ({{French/Word|avais}}) and finds the past participle of {{French/Word|manger|en=mangé}}. So, the conjugation of {{French/Word|Je mange}} in the {{French/Word|plus-que-parfait}} becomes {{French/Word|j'avais mangé}} or, in English, ''I had eaten''.

=== Examples ===
{{sectstub}}
{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Examples with plus-que-parfait.ogg}}
| À ce moment, j'ai mangé le pain que tu m'avais donné. ||  || At that moment, I ate the bread that you had given me.
|-
| Tu m'avais déjà appelé, lorsque je suis parti. ||  || When I left, you had already called me.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Relative pronouns ''qui'' and ''que''|review-id=french-qui-and-que}} ==
&lt;div id='french-qui-and-que'&gt;
Relative pronouns begin adjective clauses:
: ''the man '''that''' was here''
: ''the man '''that''' I saw''

{{French/Word|Qui|IPA=/ki/|audio=Fr-Qui.ogg}} is the subject of the clause it introduces:
: {{French/Word|J’aime les chiens qui sont calmes.|en=I like dogs that are quiet.}}

{{French/Word|Que|IPA=/kə/|audio=Fr-que.ogg}} is the direct object of the clause it introduces:
: {{French/Word|C'est un homme que je connais très bien.|en=He's a man whom I know very well.}}

Remember that in perfect tenses, the past participle agrees with the direct object in gender and plurality if the direct object comes before the verb:
: {{French/Word|Elles sont les femmes que j'ai vues.|en=They are the women that I have seen.}}

If {{French/Word|que}} is followed by a vowel, it is shortened to {{French/Word|qu'}}:
: {{French/Word|Il est l'homme qu'elle a vu.|en=He is the man that she has seen.}}

=== Examples ===
{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Examples with qui and que.ogg}}

| Cette voiture bleue qui passe me plait beaucoup. ||  || This blue car which is passing I like a lot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Alphabet &amp; Pronunciation== 
The Old English alphabet has a few differences that of Modern English. It did not have the letters q, z, j, x, and v (k and x are used but rarely). It also had three letters not used in Modern English: æ (named &quot;Ash&quot;), þ (named &quot;Thorn&quot;), and Ð/ð (named &quot;Eth&quot;).

=== Pronunciation ===
Because the language has been dead for 900 years, we cannot be completely sure how Old English was pronounced. However, we can make good educated guesses at how Old English was pronounced because the Anglo-Saxons almost certainly wrote quite phonetically (that is, they wrote words how they sounded); we can compare it with Middle English, various Modern English dialects, and other closely related Germanic languages; we can look at phonetic poetic strategies used in Old English poems; and we can look at spelling variations withing Old English texts themselves.

For the vowels, try listening to the recordings on the right for an example of long and short pronunciations. Notice that &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; are all pronounced slightly more &quot;laxed&quot; or open than they are when long.

B, d, w, m, n, and l were all pronounced exactly as they are in such Modern English dialects as General American. 

R was possibly pronounced like a trill (like sometimes in Spanish, or by some Scottish English speakers), or as a flap (like a trill, but only once - like by some Irish speakers, or in most cases in Spanish), or similarly to how it is pronounced in Southern British Egnlish or General American today. 

&quot;T&quot; and &quot;p&quot; were possibly pronounced exactly like in Modern English &quot;turn&quot; and &quot;police&quot; respectively, but it is also possible that they were pronounced unaspirated - like in Modern Dutch. They  almost certainly were pronounced unaspirated at some point in or before the history of English; and since the modern descendants of one of the languages that Anglo-Saxon came from, Old Saxon, today are pronounced with unaspirated consonants, I am inclined to think that aspiration in English happened after arrival - which means at least for a time their &quot;p&quot; &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; were pronounced unaspirated in the Old English period. &quot;Unaspirated&quot; means that the excess puff of air that most Modern English speakers make when saying these consonants wouldn't be there. We use unaspirated &quot;t&quot; and &quot;p&quot; in &quot;sting&quot; and &quot;spark&quot; when speaking English, respectively (try put your hand in front of your face and first say&quot;turn&quot; and &quot;police&quot; - you should notice feeling a strongish puff of air; then say &quot;sting&quot; and &quot;spark&quot; - the puff of air should be much less). If you want to make sure you're pronouncing them unaspirated, you should hold a piece of paper close in front of your face, and first say normal English &quot;t&quot; and &quot;p&quot; - the paper will move because of the puff of air. Then say them again, trying not to say the extra puff of air. The paper should move barely at all if you say it unaspirated. Note that the same went for &quot;c&quot; when it was pronouned velar and not palatal.

===Þ and Đ===

The letters Þ and Đ (written in lower-case as þ and ð) are used for the sounds found initially in the Modern English words &quot;this&quot; and &quot;thin&quot;.

A writer's choice of whether to use þ or ð did ''not'' indicate which of those two sounds the writer thought he was writing. Instead, the pronunciation can be deduced from the context of the letter: if it occurs between either two vowels, or between a vowel and a voiced consonant, or between a voiced consonant and a vowel, it will itself be voiced; otherwise it won't.

So, for example, in the following words, no matter whether they are spelt with þ or ð, the &quot;th&quot; sound is voiced: &quot;maþm&quot;, &quot;eorðan&quot;, &quot;cūþra&quot;, &quot;ēðel&quot;. On the other hand, it is unvoiced in the following: &quot;ðonne&quot;, &quot;hǣþstapa&quot;, &quot;oð&quot;, &quot;hafaþ&quot;.

There was no standard way of choosing whether to write þ or ð: one can find cases where the same scribe has written the same word twice on the same page using first one and then the other. Therefore the reader needn't worry about memorizing which is correct, since either is correct according to personal taste.

=== S and F===

S can be pronounced unvoiced, as &quot;s&quot;, or voiced as &quot;z&quot;. F can be pronounced unvoiced, as &quot;f&quot;, or voiced as &quot;v&quot;. The rules for when to do which are just the same as the rules given above for deciding to voice a &quot;th&quot; sound.

So, for example, &quot;f&quot; will be pronounced as an &quot;f&quot; in the words &quot;hlāf&quot;, &quot;oft&quot;, &quot;foldan&quot;; but like a &quot;v&quot; in the words &quot;hlāfas&quot;, &quot;næfne&quot;, &quot;nefan&quot;. This, by the way, is why in Modern English we have alternations between singular and plural like &quot;wolf&quot;/&quot;wolves&quot; and &quot;loaf&quot;/&quot;loaves&quot;.

===C===

The letter c had two pronunciations: either like the sound we write with a &quot;k&quot; in &quot;kick&quot; (in which case we say it is ´´velar´´) or like the sound we write with a &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;child&quot; (in which case we say that the &quot;c&quot; is ''palatalized''). It was never pronounced as an &quot;s&quot;, as it so often is in Modern English.

It was palatalized invariably before or after a letter &quot;i&quot;, and sometimes but not always before or after a letter &quot;e&quot;, &quot;æ&quot;, or &quot;y&quot; - this is unless it was directly followed by a back vowel (a, o, or u), which case it would be pronounced normally like &quot;k&quot;.

In textbooks and other modern works the editors will often help you out by putting a little dot over the &quot;c&quot; when it is pronounced as a &quot;ch&quot; sound, like this:  &quot;ċ&quot;. However, this is not always done; and the Anglo-Saxons themselves never did so.

===G===
[[file:gboga.ogg|right|thumb|Fricative &quot;g&quot; pronunciation and an example in the word &quot;boga&quot;]]

G had three pronunciations. Often it is pronounced like the &quot;g&quot; in &quot;garden&quot;. However, it can also be palatalized under the same circumstances as c, in which case it is pronounced like the &quot;y&quot; in &quot;yes&quot;. And when it occurs between two &quot;back vowels&quot; (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;) then it gets the sound written in the International Phonetic Alphabet as ɣ. It is not easy to describe this sound: however, if you put your tongue in the position it would be in if you were about to say the &quot;g&quot; in &quot;garden&quot;, and, keeping your tongue in that position, you then try to say the &quot;y&quot; in &quot;yes&quot; instead, you will produce quite a good approximation to it.

Some texts will help you by writing palatalized &quot;g&quot; as &quot;ġ&quot;; as with &quot;ċ&quot;, the Anglo-Saxons themselves never did this.

===H===
[[file:hcniht.ogg|right|thumb|Pronunciation of &quot;h&quot; after a frontal vowel, with example word &quot;cniht&quot;]]
[[file:hfeoh.ogg|right|thumb|Pronunciation of &quot;h&quot; after a back vowel, with example word &quot;feoh&quot;]]

The letter &quot;h&quot; at the beginning of a word was pronounced like Moden English &quot;h&quot;. However, when not at the beginning of a syllable, it had a more &quot;substantial&quot; pronunciation. It was pronounced like the &quot;ch&quot; in Scottish English &quot;loch&quot; when it followed a back vowel (a, o, or u) or a back vowel and then a non-nasal consonant (like in the word &quot;burg&quot;). See the second recording to the right for an example of this pronunciation. After a frontal vowel (æ, e, i, or y), it was similar to how some people say the &quot;h&quot; in &quot;human&quot; - like the &quot;ch&quot; in German &quot;ich. For an example of this pronunciation, see the first recording on the right.

===SC===

The letters &quot;sc&quot; together very usually represented the sound which in Modern English we write as &quot;sh&quot;. So the word &quot;scip&quot; would be pronounced &quot;ship&quot;; and, indeed, it ''meant'' &quot;ship&quot;. This is one instance of how knowing how to pronounce Old English words makes it easier to learn.

There are exceptions to this rule: for example, in the word &quot;āscian&quot; (&quot;to ask&quot;) the &quot;sc&quot; sound is pronounced like the &quot;sk&quot; in Modern English &quot;ask&quot;.

Some modern editions will help you by writing &quot;sċ&quot; wherever &quot;sc&quot; has the &quot;sh&quot; pronunciation. As usual, we should note that the Anglo-Saxons themselves didn't ever do this.

===CG===

The letters &quot;cg&quot; written together represented the sound which in Modern English is written as &quot;j&quot; or &quot;dg&quot;. So Old English &quot;hecg&quot; would be pronounced like Modern English &quot;hedge&quot;, which, again, is exactly what it means.

===NG===

The letters ng represent a similar sound to Modern English &quot;ng&quot;, except that the &quot;g&quot; sound is always pronounced, as it is in Modern English &quot;anger&quot; and &quot;linger&quot;, not dropped as it is in &quot;clanger&quot; and &quot;singer&quot;.

===R===

In many modern British dialects, and some modern American dialects, the letter &quot;r&quot; is unpronounced at the end of a word, so that the word &quot;sister&quot; comes out more like &quot;sistuh&quot;. In Old English the letter &quot;r&quot; is pronounced whenever it is written.

===Double consonants===
[[file:Laymanlamemanreadyredd.ogg|right|thumb|Illustrating the difference between a short and a long consonant]]

In Old English, if a consonant is written as a double consonant, for example in the word &quot;winnan&quot;, it is pronounced as a double consonant: &quot;win-nan&quot;. In Modern English such doubling is only found in the middle of compound words: for example, the sound in the middle of Modern English &quot;penknife&quot; is like the double n in &quot;winnan&quot;.

Listen to the examples on the right. The first is the word layman, where &quot;m&quot; is pronounced short, and then the two words &quot;lame man&quot;, where &quot;m&quot; is pronounced long. The second example is the word &quot;ready&quot;, with a short &quot;d&quot;, and then the two words &quot;red d&quot; (as in the letter d), with a long &quot;d&quot; pronunciation.

===Vowel length===
In Old English a long vowel was a lengthened version of the shorter vowel, or very similar, unlike in Modern English where the &quot;long e&quot; in &quot;seem&quot; is actually a quite different vowel to the &quot;short e&quot; in &quot;bed&quot;.

Historically, long vowels in Old English were usually not explicitly written as such. Occasionally they were, either by doubling the vowel letter, or by adding an accute-accent-like mark above the vowel (acutally, it is not certain that this mark was intended to signify a long vowel - if it was, it was often poorly implemented). Note that the vowel mark they did use did not resemble the macron used in Latin. One mark they did use that did resemble the macron, was used as a shortcut above a vowel to show that the vowel was followed by a nasal consonant (m or n) without having to write the consonant, and in other writing shortcuts. 

However, on this Wikibook, long vowels are written with a macron.

===No silent consonants===

Modern English has a number of cases where written consonants are silent: the &quot;w&quot; in &quot;wren&quot;, the &quot;b&quot; in dumb, the &quot;g&quot; in &quot;gnat&quot;, the &quot;k&quot; in &quot;knight&quot; and so on. These silent consonants were all pronounced in Old English: the equivalent words are spelt &quot;wrænna&quot;, &quot;dumb&quot;, &quot;gnætt&quot;, and &quot;cniht&quot;, and every consonant recieves its full value, no matter how awkward you find it to pronounce.

The same is true of consonant combinations that in Modern English we no longer even write, such as the &quot;wl&quot; in &quot;wlanc&quot; (meaning &quot;proud&quot;) or the &quot;hl&quot; in &quot;hlædel&quot; (meaning &quot;ladle&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic idea behind independence is that if your random variables (or vectors) are independent then the combination of several of these random variable/vectors &lt;math&gt;\left(P\left(X_{1} \leq x_{1}, ..., X_{d} \leq x_{d}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt; can be multiplied together.

Given &lt;math&gt;T_{1}, T_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; are independent &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,\mbox{-Exponential}&lt;/math&gt; random variables, then &lt;math&gt;E\left[T_{1} + T_{2}\right] = E\left[2T_{1}\right] = E\left[2T_{2}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.  But &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Var}\left(T_{1} + T_{2}\right) &lt; \mbox{Var}\left(2T_{1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  This is because &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Var}\left(T_{1} + T_{2}\right) = \mbox{Var}\left(T_{1}\right) + \mbox{Var}\left(T_{2}\right) = 2\mbox{Var}\left(T_{1}\right)&lt;/math&gt; by independence, whereas &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Var}\left(2T_{1}\right) = 2^{2}\cdot\mbox{Var}\left(T_{1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

See the equations section for some more examples.

==The Scriptol Programming Language==


===A clean syntax===

C++ syntax:

 for(int x = 0; x &lt; 10; x++)
 {
  printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, x);
 } 


Scriptol syntax:

 for int x in 0 .. 9 print x

Scriptol doesn't need for semi-colon et end of statements. The end of line is also the end of statement unless several statements fits on a same line, in this case they are separated by semi-colons. If an instruction fits on two lines, the compiler recognizes the instruction.

===Objective design===

Unlike C that was designed with limited hardware in mind, Perl that has added features day after day, and other languages that depends upon the fantasy of the author, Scriptol apply objectives rules, and it near the more used syntax in computer world, the xml one... Xml is tagged and has as C one-line syntax.
Scriptol has one-line syntax, (see above) and is tagged:

 for 
 ... 
 /for

===Universal operators===

Some programming languages use the same operator for unrelated things.
For example,
The C programming language uses the &quot;*&quot; operator for both &quot;deferencing&quot; and &quot;multiply&quot;.
The C programming language uses the &quot;&amp;&quot; for both &quot;address-of&quot; and &quot;binary and&quot;.

Scriptol tries to avoid such confusion by making each operator mean something very similar in all the different ways it is used.

For example, the range operator &quot; .. &quot; is used:
* as the range in the &quot;for&quot; loop (see above).
* as an interval of an array or a dictionary (see array).
* as a range in an expression:


 if x in 0 .. 9 
   print &quot;x inside range&quot;
 /if

===Types from the real word=== 

In the 1970s, C and Pascal invented types that were related to hardware: char, long, short, char *, float, etc...

Scriptol uses types related to the real word: text, number, integer, natural, real, array, dict, dir, etc...

===Readability===

A complicated and unreadable part of C++ code...

 int x[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
 int i;
 for(i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++)
 {
   if(x[i] == test) std::cout &lt;&lt; test &lt;&lt; &quot; found&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 } 

may be replaced by a single and clear Scriptol statement.

 if test in { 1, 2, 3, 4 } print test, &quot;found&quot;




==If Control Structure==


===Common syntax===

For a conditional process, the statement is a &quot;if&quot; keyword, followed by a boolean expression, a list of statements to execute or no, depending of the condition, and the &quot;/if&quot; keyword.

 If x = 5
   print &quot;equal&quot;
 /if 


Introducing an alternative by the &quot;else&quot; keyword: when the condition is false, another list of statements may be processed.

 If x = 5
   print &quot;equal&quot;
 else
   print &quot;not equal&quot;
 /if 


===One-line structure===

When the body of the structure is just one statement, and not another structure, the syntax may be shortened to only a single line.

 If x = 5 print x 


If the statement is not a command as &quot;print&quot;, &quot;break&quot;, &quot;continue&quot; etc..., the &quot;let&quot; keyword is required.

 If x = 5 let y + 1 


===Composite if===

The structure may be extended into a more powerful construct that is both an &quot;if&quot; and a &quot;switch case&quot; structure, even more advanced than the C counterpart since you can test any type of variable.

 if x 
   = 5: print &quot;equal&quot;
   &gt; 5: print &quot;more&quot;
 else 
   print &quot;less&quot;
 /if

==For In== 


===Common syntax===

The standard syntax assigns a variable with the elements of a range, and Scriptol writes a range as it is commonly written, with a double dot between two values (or variables).


 for int x in 0 .. 10
   print x
 /for 


===One-line syntax===

If the body of the structure is only one statement, a simplified syntax is used.

 for int x in 0 .. 10 print x 


===For in list===

The for control structure may scan an interal as above, but also a text or an array.

 text hello = &quot;hello&quot;
 for text t in hello print t 


 array a = { 1, 2, 3 }
 for dyn x in a print x

==While Let==

===Common syntax===

 while x &lt; 5
  print x
  x + 1
 /while 


To increment a variable, Scriptol uses x + 1.
This could not work in C and other languages.


===Infinite loop in C===

The C and C-like languages (C++, Java, C#) leads easily into infinite loop. Here hare two simple examples.

 while(x &lt; 5);
 {
   printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, x);
   x += 1:
 }

Perhaps you have instantaneously noticed it (and perhaps no), but the construct is bad, due to the semi-colon after the condition!

Another example without the misplaced semi-colon:

 while(x &lt; 10)
 {
   printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, x);
   if(x = 5) continue;
   ... some statements ...
   x += 1;
 }


==Scan By==


===Common syntax===

The scan control structure allows to parse one or several arrays, and to apply a process onto each element of the array(s).

scan a 
 a[] * a[] 
 print a[] 
/scan 


The current element is denoted by an empty indice.

Example with two arrays:

 scan a, b
  print a[] + b[] 
 /scan 

===Scan with a function===

You can apply instead a predefined function. The argument of the function is an element of the array.

 array a = {1,2,3,4 } 

 void fun(number x) 
  print x * x
 return 

 scan a by fun 


If you use several arrays, the number of argument of the function must be the number of array.

==Xml or class==

===Common class===

Scriptol is object-oriented and has classes and inheritance.
Defining a class is easy. 
Example of a very simple class.

 class car
   int speed
   void getSpeed()
      ... some statements ...
   return speed 
 /class 


===Xml===

But Scriptol has also xml.
Defining a xml document is simple also.

 xml Car
   speed value = &quot;10&quot; /
   wheels number = &quot;4&quot;
   passengers number = &quot;5&quot;
      Clara, Charly, Corinna, Cyril, Cecilia
   /passengers  
 /xml 


===Using Xml===

Classes are used directly or by creating an instance, and making reference to attributes or calls to methods.

Using Xml is not different. 
You can define how many instances of xml documents you want, and modify the content of each of them. The content of elements or attributes may be assigned, and elements and attributes may be added of removed.

 Car myCar ` myCar is an instance of the Car Xml document.
 print myCar.speed ` displaying the value of the &quot;speed&quot; attribute.
 print myCar.passengers ` displaying the content of the &quot;passengers&quot; tag.

===Importing xml document===

Xml is mainly useful for performing processes on documents produced by various tools, word processors, spreadsheets, etc....

To load such documents, Scriptol integrates a sax parser.
You have just to declare a xml document, load le xml file, and you can use the document as a class declared in the source.

 xml Car ` declaring an empty xml document.
 /xml

 Car myCar` defining an instance (not required).
 myCar.load(&quot;document.xml&quot;)  ` loading an external xml document

 Car.load(&quot;document.xml&quot;)  ` you can use directly the xml class itself 


===Iterator===

Iterator on xml document is as iterator on array, plus the down() and up() methods.
Iterator allows to parse an entire xml document or just sub-elements of of an element.


 demo.begin() 
 while demo.isFound() 
 print demo.getData() 
 let demo.inc()

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Naturalist Intelligence'''

During 1983 Dr Howard Gardner came up with his theory that there were 7 multiple intelligences. This was published in his book, Frames of Mind (1983).  His theory was that there were single human intelligences that could be assessed using standard psychometric testing and these could be used within education, particularly with performance based testing.  

The original seven intelligences identified within Gardner’s book “Frames of Mind” (1983) were:-

“'''Linguistic intelligence''': sensitivity to the meaning and order of words
'''Logical-mathematical intelligence''': ability in mathematics and other complex logical systems
'''Musical intelligence''': the ability to understand and create music.  Musicians, composers and dancers show a heightened musical intelligence
'''Spatial intelligence''': the ability to “think in pictures”, to perceive the visual world accurately and recreate (or alter) it in the mind or on paper.  Spatial intelligence is highly developed in artists, architects, designers and sculptors
'''Bodily-kinaesthetic intelligence''': the ability to use one’s body in a skilled way, for self expression towards a goal
'''Interpersonal intelligence''': an ability to perceive and understand other individuals – their moods, desires and motivations.
'''Intrapersonal intelligence''': an understanding of one’s own emotions” Education World - Curriculum 

From the original list he added that of Naturalist Intelligence.  This occurred during 1996 when Gardner identified that it was a person’s intelligence that could differentiate patterns of nature 

Right back from the beginning of time itself, it was the Naturalist Intelligence that ensured that our ancestors survived.  Examples of Natural Intelligence are when a person can assess if particular areas of water are fit to drink, classifying and identifying which plants were edible, and discrimination between animals.

It is also linked to observing and understanding the natural environment from lakes, rivers and mountains to butterflies and birds. Charles Darwin is a specific example of someone with great Natural intelligence.  He would link his theories to what he observed and analysed around him.

Gardner’s definition of intelligence was “the human ability to solve problems or to make something that is valued in one or more cultures”.  Naturalist intelligence fitted directly into this statement.  

A person with naturalist intelligence would be someone who took every opportunity to access an interact with multiple elements of nature

'''Organic Gardening''' (also called '''Organic Horticulture''') is a growing practice among gardeners around the world, as an alternative to gardening through the use of synthetic chemicals. This wikibook contains techniques and tips for gardeners wishing to use organic methods.

While the movement behind organic gardening began as a &quot;back to basics&quot; movement, over the past several decades the practice has become enriched by scientific research in the fields of ecology, ethnobotany, microbiology, and agronomy.

The practice of organic gardening can be described as &quot;gardening with a limited toolbox&quot;, since organic gardeners do not use synthetic fertilizers or other synthetic chemicals. Non-synthetic fertilisers and chemicals can be used, however, depending on the gardeners preference.

Horticulture does not (at least presently) have separate pages for organic gardeners, but rather points out the &quot;organic remedies&quot; when a particular issue is discussed.

'''Vermicomposting''' is the art, science, or practice of cultivating worms for their castings (vermicompost). Most commonly done on a small scale by gardeners, vermicomposting is an easy way to convert kitchen scraps and other organic matter into a useful compost which can be used in the garden or even in potted plants. Vermicomposting can be done both indoors and outdoors, and is commonly practiced in both urban and rural areas. This chapter is a how-to manual to help aspiring vermicomposters get started.

==Outline==
===Preface (about vermicomposting/why vermicompost)===

Vermicomposting is a great way to turn your kitchen scraps into useful material for the garden. 

Vermicomposting can be done either indoors or outdoors, and is a great way for urbanites to compost their kitchen scraps.

Vermicomposting is fun for children.

Vermicompost is a superior soil amendment.

Vermicomposting keeps &quot;recyclable&quot; materials out of the landfill.

===Choosing the right strategy (indoor/outdoor, etc.)===

There are several methods for making vermicompost, from small scale indoor bins to large windrow-based operations. When choosing which strategy to use, there are several things to take into account.

#First, you'll need to determine what space is available. Will it be indoors or outdoors?
#Second, you'll need to know how much materials will be on hand for fodder. For most people, this will depend on family size and diet (i.e., how much vegetable waste is produced per week), though larger operations such as farms and restaurants will need to make a more complicated calculation.
#For larger scale methods such as windrows, you'll need to make a realistic estimation about how it will be aerated (e.g., by pitchfork? by tractor? by windrow turner?)

===Indoor Vermicomposting===

:Indoor setups
::Non-Continuous Bins
:::(From  the WP article:) '''Non-Continuous''' – A non-continuous bin is an undivided container. A layer of bedding materials is placed in the bin lining the bottom and worms are added and organic matter for composting is added in a layer above the bedding. Another layer is added on top of the organic matter and the worms will start to compost the organic matter and bedding. These type of bins are often used because they are small in size and easy to build. They are relatively difficult to harvest because all the materials and worms must be emptied out when harvesting.
:::Instructions for building this bin

::Continuous Vertical-Flow Bins
:::(From  the WP article:) '''Continuous Vertical Flow''' – Continuous flow bins are a series of trays stacked vertically. The bottom-most tray is filled first, in a similar fashion to any other bin, but is not harvested when it is full. Instead, a thick layer of bedding is added on top and the tray above is used for adding organic material. The idea is that the worms will finish composting the bottom tray and then migrate to the one above. When a sufficient number of worms have migrated the bottom tray can be collected and should be relatively free of worms. These bins provide an easier method of harvesting. 
:::Instructions for building this bin

::Continuous Horizontal Flow
:::(From  the WP article:) '''Continuous Horizontal Flow'''  – A continuous horizontal flow bin is another a bin that relies on the earthworms habits of migrating towards a food source in order to ease the process of harvesting. The bin is usually constructed to be similar to a non-continuous bin but twice as long (horizontally). The bin is divided in half, usually by a large gauge screen of [[chicken wire]]. Only one side is used initially. When that half becomes full, the other half is filled with bedding and organic matter. In time, the worms will migrate to the side with the food and the compost can be collected. These bins are larger than a non-continuous system but are still small enough to be used indoors, with the added bonus of being easier to harvest.
:::Instructions for building this bin

===Outdoor Vermicomposting===

:Outdoor Setups
::Wire Bins
::Piles
::Windrows

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a copy-paste from wikipedia... it's a very good start on a how-to book, but probably not so great as a 'pedia article. I'll work on fixing the red links over the next few days. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 15:38, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

== Please help! ==

I'm &quot;advertising&quot; this book on a few web forums, in the hopes of getting people with know-how to help write this book.  [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 19:20, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

== Please be careful when copying from Wikipedia ==

I am having some trouble understanding why this book needs a temporary page containing a Wikipedia article, when the article is already available at Wikipedia. (I guess that it is to help users expand the article into a book. I would have copied sections of the article into subpages.)

Also understand that Wikipedia is not in the public domain. We can only use Wikipedia content under their [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. I do not bother with the license details, but is is a requirement to mention that the book is derived from a Wikipedia article. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:56, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

:It's here to be worked on, as the stuff in the article needs to be reorganized to make a good skeleton for a book. Due to the how-to nature of the article, it might get some heavy editing over at the WP end, so seemed a good idea to put a copy here.  [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 10:43, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

== Merge proposal... ==

Will put the tag in when I figure it out. This book should be merged into [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]]. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 16:15, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

Merged now (obviously). [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 15:46, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Each succeeding evolution of the Tagalog Wikibook has brought new promise over itself.  This is a history of this Wikibook.

==Inception==
On May 18, 2005, a new Wikibook came on the scene: the Filipino Wikibook.  Started by an anonymous user (whose IP address at the time was 222.158.192.164), the book only contained a link to the Tagalog Wikipedia page, a Wikipedia page on the languages of the Philippines, and the three basic conditional greetings now covered in Lesson 1 (good morning, good afternoon and good evening and how are you?).  For a Wikibook it was very small, but a stepping stone towards the current book.

==First edits==
The first edit of the new Filipino Wikibook came nearly a month later after the inception of this Wikibook: on June 11, 2005.  Another anonymous user (whose IP address was 131.104.232.68 at the time) added more greetings, such as gender and gratitude (''lalaki''/''babae'' and ''salamat'').

The next eight edits came sixteen days after the very first edit (all within two days, from June 27-28, 2005): it added on pronouns and information on Tagalog nouns (now a separate lesson).  These were contributed by [[User:Jondel|Jondel]].

==More edits==
The next collection of edits by anonymous users and users [[User:Aya|Aya]] and [[User:Lotusduck|Lotusduck]] were mainly cosmetic changes and some information additions.  It was also here that the book's first lesson was conceived: the lesson spawned ideas on common Filipino greetings.  It was also during these edits that, in a move towards consensus, the Filipino Wikibook was renamed the Tagalog Wikibook.

==Major revamp==
A few months after the last edit, on February 9, 2006, a major revamp of the Tagalog Wikibook was established over the course of two weeks by user [[User:Akira123323|Akira123323]].  The old book structure was scrapped (except the nouns and markers section, which was moved) and a new structure adopted to better suit the book.  More lessons, grammar lessons, literature and introductions, though at first blank, were added, and eventually were filled.  The book was also partially written in Tagalog (such as titles) during this period.

Another revamp came when the main Tagalog Wikibook page was changed: the table of contents moved to its own page and the main page giving the title page.  Currently, there are 12 main lessons (four have been written) and 13 grammar lessons (two written), as well as literature.

Eventually, pages were moved to conform to the preferred Wikibooks structure by user [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] near the end of February 2006.  This led to the present book.

'''Vermicompost''' (or '''Worm Compost''') is the name for the ''castings'' produced from the breakdown of organic matter by special varieties of [[w:earthworms|earthworms]]. Compared to ordinary soil, the earthworm castings (the material produced from the digestive tracts of worms) contain five times more nitrogen, seven times more phosphorus and 11 times more potassium. They are rich in humic acids and improve the structure of the soil.

The [[w:earthworm|earthworm]] most often to be found in the [[w:compost|compost]] heap is Brandling Worms ([[w:Eisenia foetida|Eisenia foetida]]), or Redworms ([[w:Lumbricus rubellus|Lumbricus rubellus]]). This species is only rarely found in soil and is adapted to the special conditions in rotting [[w:vegetation|vegetation]], [[w:compost|compost]] and [[w:manure|manure]] piles. Earthworms are available from mail-order suppliers, or from [[w:angling|angling]] shops where they are sold as bait. Small scale vermicomposting is well suited to turn kitchen wastes into high quality soil where space is limited. 

In addition to worms, a healthy vermicomposting system hosts many other organisms such as [[w:insects|insects]], [[w:mold|molds]], and [[w:bacterium|bacteria]].  Though these all play a role in the composting process, the earthworm is the major catalyst for the composting process.

[[Image:Worm_bin.svg|right|frame|Diagram of a household-scale worm composting bin]]


==Bins==
Vermicomposting bins vary drastically depending on the system an individual composter wishes to create.

===Small scale===

Small scale systems offer a wide variety of bins. Often, small-scale composters build their own bins. Companies also offer commercial models for sale. Commonly, bins are built out of old plastic containers, wood, [[w:Styrofoam|Styrofoam]] containers, or metal containers.

Some materials are less desirable than others in bin construction. Styrofoam is believed to release toxins into the earthworms' environment. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, are prone to rusting, and may release heavy metals into compost.

The design of small bins usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms. All bins  in general have holes for airflow in the sides and some form of drainage, either holes in the bottom to drain on to a collection tray or an actual spout that can be opened or closed to allow drainage. Plastic bins in general require more drainage than wooden because they are non absorbent. Regardless of the material used to build the bin, most small bins can be grouped into three categories:

*'''Non-Continuous''' – A non-continuous bin is an undivided container. A layer of bedding materials is placed in the bin lining the bottom and worms are added and organic matter for composting is added in a layer above the bedding. Another layer is added on top of the organic matter and the worms will start to compost the organic matter and bedding. These type of bins are often used because they are small in size and easy to build. They are relatively difficult to harvest because all the materials and worms must be emptied out when harvesting.
*'''Continuous Vertical Flow''' – Continuous flow bins are a series of trays stacked vertically. The bottom-most tray is filled first, in a similar fashion to any other bin, but is not harvested when it is full. Instead, a thick layer of bedding is added on top and the tray above is used for adding organic material. The idea is that the worms will finish composting the bottom tray and then migrate to the one above. When a sufficient number of worms have migrated the bottom tray can be collected and should be relatively free of worms. These bins provide an easier method of harvesting. 
*'''Continuous Horizontal Flow'''  – A continuous horizontal flow bin is another a bin that relies on the earthworms habits of migrating towards a food source in order to ease the process of harvesting. The bin is usually constructed to be similar to a non-continuous bin but twice as long (horizontally). The bin is divided in half, usually by a large gauge screen of [[chicken wire]]. Only one side is used initially. When that half becomes full, the other half is filled with bedding and organic matter. In time, the worms will migrate to the side with the food and the compost can be collected. These bins are larger than a non-continuous system but are still small enough to be used indoors, with the added bonus of being easier to harvest.

===Large scale===

Most large scale vermicomposting or vermiculturing systems do not incorporate an actual physical bin at all, because it is simply too impracticable. A large system will usually use a [[w:windrow|windrow]]. The windrow simply consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in (see bedding below) and acts as a large worm bin; organic material is added to the windrow and the worms perform the composting. Although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping, in theory they should not due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on. Often times windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from killing off worm populations.

==Starting Off==

When beginning a vermicomposting bin, add as many composting worms as available.  They should be added to moist bedding. Quantities of kitchen waste appropriate for the worm population can be added to the bin daily or weekly. At first, feed the worms approximately 1/2 their body weight in kitchen scraps a day, maximum. After they have established themselves, you can feed them up to their entire body weight. 

==Bedding==

Bedding in a worm bin is the living medium for the worms but is also used as a food source, it is material that is high in carbon and is made to mimic dried leaves on the forest floor, which is the worms' natural habitat. The bedding needs to be moist (often related to the consistency of a wrung-out sponge) and loose to enable the earthworms to breath and to facilitate [[w:aerobic|aerobic]] decomposition. A wide variety of bedding materials can be used including newspaper, sawdust, hay, cardboard, [[w:peat moss|peat moss]], [[w:manure|aged manure]] (meaning the manure has to be pre-composted before use), and dried leaves. Most vermicomposters avoid using any glossy papers from newspapers and magazines, [[w:junk mail|junk mail]] and shredded paper from offices, because they may contain toxins which will severely affect the system. Also some cardboard cannot be used if it contains wax or plastic, such as [[w:cereal|cereal]] boxes, and other boxes designed to hold food items. Newspapers and phone books printed on regular, non-glossy pages are heavily regulated by the [[w:FDA|FDA]] and use non-toxic [[w:soy|soy]] and [[w:Canola|Canola]] based [[w:ink|inks]] (see [[w:Soy ink|Soy ink]]).

==Temperature==

The worms that are used in composting systems prefer temperatures between 55 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (c. 12-21 degrees Celsius), and temperature of the bedding should not get below freezing or above 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius).

==Kitchen waste==

*'''Greens''' -  If too much kitchen waste is added for the worms to process, the waste will [[w:putrification|putrify]]. A balance between &quot;green matter&quot; such as kitchen scraps and &quot;brown matter&quot; such as shredded newspaper for bedding must be maintained in order for the worms to do their work. This balance should be approximately one part &quot;green matter&quot; for every two parts of &quot;brown matter&quot;. Covering the kitchen scraps with a layer of &quot;brown matter&quot; also has the added benefit of reducing odor and insect problems.  Avoid [[w:grass clippings|grass clippings]] or other plant products that have been sprayed with [[w:pesticides|pesticides]]. In a small bin, this includes [[w:banana|banana]] peels which can kill everything in the bin, if heavily sprayed. 

*'''Meats''' - Although [[w:protein|proteins]] such as [[w:fat|fats]] and [[w:meat|meat]] scraps can be processed by a vermicompost bin, doing so tends to attract [[w:scavenger|scavengers]] and should be avoided if this is a risk. Worms are unable to break down [[w:bone|bone]] or [[w:synthetic|synthetic material]].

*'''Fecal Matter''' - [[w:Feces|Fecal material]] of [[w:omnivores|omnivores]] and [[w:carnivores|carnivores]] is unsuitable for composting due to the dangerous [[w:microorganisms|microorganisms]] it contains, though [[w:thermophilic composting|thermophilic composting]] or other applied heat can mitigate this problem. People have reported successfully using [[w:cow|cow]], [[w:rabbit|rabbit]], or [[w:goat|goat]] manure to help start up the bin. If done, this should be used in small quantities. If you are vermicomposting inside your home, you may want to avoid including manure or [[w:dairy|dairy]] products in your compost because they may have an unpleasant odor. 

Over the long term, care should be taken to maintain optimum moisture levels and [[w:pH|pH]] balance. In a non-continuous-flow vermicomposting bin, excess liquid can be drained via a tap and used as plant food. A continuous flow bin will not retain excess liquid and it requires extra water to be added to keep the bedding moist. Too many [[w:citrus|citrus]] peels in the material to be composted can cause excessive [[w:acidity|acidity]], but this can be mitigated by adding an occasional handful of [[w:calcium oxide|lime]]. 

Worms as well as other [[w:microorganisms|microorganisms]] in the composting process require [[w:oxygen|oxygen]], so the bin must &quot;breathe&quot;. This can be accomplished by regularly removing the composted material, adding holes to a composting bin, or using a continuous-flow bin. If insufficient oxygen is available, the compost will become [[w:anaerobic|anaerobic]]. This will provide a host environment for a different type of decay process which produces a strong odor offensive to most people. This type of decay is found in [[w:swamp|swamps]] and [[w:bog|bogs]] and is responsible for the stench sometimes found in these environments.

==Feeding methods==

There are basically two methods of adding more matter to the bin.
*The first method, known as top feeding, is when organic matter placed directly on top of the existing layer bedding in a bin and then covered with another layer of bedding. This is repeated every time the bin is fed.
*The other method of feeding is known as pocket feeding. In this method a top layer of bedding is maintained and food is buried beneath. The location of the food is changed each time and often the bin is fed in more than one location. As bedding runs low more is added. Vermicomposters often use a combination of both methods.  Sometimes by not burying the food it can attract [[w:fruit flies]].

==Problems==

*'''Odors''' - When this occurs it is usually due to the overabundance of &quot;greens&quot; in the bin, which is actually too much [[w:nitrogen|nitrogen]] combining with [[w:hydrogen|hydrogen]] and forms the [[w:ammonia|ammonia]].  To neutralize the odors you want to add a fair amount of carbon to the mix.  The carbon will instead absorb the nitrogen and form a compound that is not smelly. Paper and dried leaves are good sources of carbon.  Take note; too much carbon added slows the decomposition process considerably.

*'''Pests''' - certain types of material, as well as odours from these, can attract pests such as rodents and flies. This is especially true if the loading contains lots of kitchen waste, especially meat. This problem is largely negated if a sealed bin is used where the pests cannot access the material. Most domestic vermicomposters are advised by local authorities to avoid the problem of pests by avoiding using materials that attract them rather than relying on special containers. 

Note: Red Wiggler worms are not native to [[w:North America|North America]].  They are an [[w:invasive species|invasive species]] and have become naturalized in most of the globe.  Do not dump worm-containing compost in natural areas as they can have the effect of displacing the native worms.

==Vermicompost properties==

Worm compost is usually too rich for use as a [[w:seed compost|seed compost]], but is useful as a top layer of soil or an addition to [[w:potting compost|potting compost]]s. Some types of pitted seeds are reportedly easier to germinate when placed in vermicompost for several months.

Vermicompost is beneficial for soil in three ways:
* It improves the physical structure of the [[w:soil|soil]].
* It improves the biological properties of the soil (enrichment of micro-organisms, addition of [[w:growth hormones|growth hormones]] such  as [[w:auxins|auxins]] and [[w:gibberellic acid|gibberellic acid]], and addition of [[w:enzymes|enzymes]], such as [[w:phosphates|phosphates]], [[w:cellulase|cellulase]], etc.). 
* It attracts deep-burrowing earthworms already present in the soil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Consequences of Unemployment ==

Governments are always trying to reduce the level of unemployment, but why? What is so bad about not working? Well, the effects of unemployment can be roughly split into direct and indirect effects:
=== Direct Effects ===
* '''Fall in National Output''' - Labour, remember, is a factor of production. Hence, a fall in the overall supply of labour caused by higher levels of unemployment will result (cp) in a fall in national output. However, ''if'' the unemployment is caused by factor substitution i.e. labour is substituted by new machinery, then a fall in National Output may not necessarily result
* '''Loss of personal income''' - Those not working will encounter a fall in their living standards, as their income falls. The unemployed will have less purchasing power, and less disposable income. Of course, ''the dole'' may in fact provide more income than working, and the increased free time may be considered more valuable than working, though this is in the extreme minority
=== Indirect Effects ===
* '''Negative Multiplier Effect''' - Unemployed individuals, as mentioned above, are not able to spend as much money on goods and services, so a '''negative multiplier effect''' may result. For example, local businesses may suffer as a result of recent job losses in an area, meaning that purchases from suppliers will fall, and so on. Many areas where large job losses have occurred experience this effect, unless governments intervene.
* '''Loss of tax revenue''' - A fall in income results in a fall both in '''direct''' and '''indirect''' taxes. Why? Direct taxes come from wages, whilst indirect taxes come from the products those wages would have been spent on. As a result, governments must either raise the level of tax on existing wage earners, or reduce government spending (or borrow, which is unpopular but not necessarily always a bad idea). Both policies have a depressive effect on the economy.
* '''Society''' - Inequalities in wealth and income, and high unemployment have been shown to be linked to negative social effects, such as high crime rates in these areas. The lack of money to spend on private health care, healthy goods and living, means that those who are unemployed often lead less healthy lifestyles and have less backup when things go wrong. Also, children from unemployed households often have had poorer education and hold fewer skills than average, upon entering work, meaning that high unemployment levels can be self-perpetuating through time.

== Policies to reduce Unemployment ==
Government policies to reduce unemployment must be based upon the ''types'' and ''causes'' of unemployment that are prevalent. It may be worth glancing back to that section to remind yourself of the major kinds of unemployment; however, we will go into more detail in this section. General policies such as cuts in direct taxes should be effective across any kind of unemployment, as it increases the appeal of any job to any potential employee.

=== Real Wage Unemployment ===
This is unemployment as a result of a kind of '''market failure''', a failure of the labour market to respond to changes in demand. If demand for workers rises, it is logical that they will demand greater real wages ''(diagram)''. Similarly, if demand falls, workers should expect to suffer lower real wages for the same work. Unfortunate though it may seem, that is the way the market works!  Real wage unemployment is usually caused by a combination of:
* '''Strong trade unions''' - giving employees greater power over deciding wage conditions with the threat of ''industrial action'' (strikes etc.) With strong unions, firms will not be able to reduce wages when demand is low, leading to bankruptcy (unemployment) or layoffs of workers (unemployment)
* '''Wage 'stickiness'''' - Employees on long term contracts will have a fixed wage over a long period of time. If a downturn in demand occurs, wages cannot fall immediately in response - they are 'sticky'
* '''Minimum wage''' - This is a characteristic of most modern economies, guaranteeing every worker a minimum standard of living. Whilst this is undoubtedly wonderful, if the minimum wage is set '''too high''', the labour market is once again inflexible
Government policies to tackle this form of unemployment are invariably unpopular for workers, as their wage levels are threatened to the benefit of firms and businesses. However, it is largely appreciated that, for example, overly strong trade unions can utterly paralyse an economy (see Margeret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister in the UK). Policies to combat real wage unemployment include trade union reform (reducing their powers), increasing firms' ability to change wages and encouraging shorter term contracts and ensuring that the minimum wage level does not adversely impact the economy.

=== Frictional Unemployment ===
Remember, this is unemployment generated through incomplete information of the labour market. This can be solved in two main ways. Firstly, increasing the knowledge of the local vacancies through government funded 'job centres' could reduce time between jobs. Secondly, increasing the incentive to search for suitable jobs (such as reducing unemployment benefits and lower taxes on wages) could serve the dual 
purpose of increasing incentives to search for work, and making more vacancies acceptable to the unemployed individuals.

=== Cyclical Unemployment ===
It is worth noting that this form of unemployment can also be known as '''Keynesian or demand-deficient unemployment'''. Over the economic cycle demand changes, and regardless of how flexible wages are, unemployment will rise of fall ''(diagram)''. There are clear links between the rate of economic growth and the level of unemployment. It is clear that in a depression, unemployment will rise, as demand for good and services falls. This could result in a negative multiplier effect, without government intervention. Policies to reduce the impact of Keynesian unemployment include:
* '''Increased government spending''' - this includes reductions in taxes. Increased '''G''' will cause an outward shift in AD, and ''may'' create a multiplier effect. Theoretically, government spending to pay workers to dig huge trenches and fill them in again will help, as it increases national income. However, targeted policies to increase the quality of infrastructure or levels of investment will be more effective. Also, reductions in direct taxes will encourage more people into work, and also increase the level of disposable income, hopefully leading to a positive multiplier effect
* '''Reduction of interest rates''' - remember that a fall in interest rates can also stimulate AD. Return to that section to remind yourself that a fall in interest rates encourages consumption and investment

=== Geographical Unemployment ===
Naturally, policies to reduce geographical unemployment will seek to decrease '''geographical immobility of labour'''. This is the inability of people to relocate from areas with low demand for labour, to areas with high demand for labour. Policies to reduce geographical unemployment include:
* '''Regional Incentives''' - this is regional policy to increase the incentives for new businesses to locate in areas of high unemployment, thus reducing regional variations in unemployment caused by geographical immobility
* '''Reducing geographical immobility''' - is the second and more direct method of combatting geographical unemployment. It aims to reduce geographical immobility by reducing barriers to free movement of workers (such as no border controls and cheap housing). This is more difficult within a country as the barriers are often social in nature, such as family ties.

=== Structural Unemployment ===
This is the inability of workers to change the ''kind'' of employment (for example from manufacturing to IT) they are in. Left without intervention, this could lead to dangerous long term  unemployment, whereby workers find it increasingly difficult to find jobs as they become less desirable the longer they are unemployed. Policies to reduce occupational unemployment include:
* '''Retraining''' - incentives for both companies to retrain and employees to take part in training to make them more attractive and useful to firms. Governments may also directly take part in retraining projects where unemployment levels as a result of structural unemployment are very high
* '''Reducing geographical immobility''' - could result in no need for retraining programs, as worker could simply move to an area in which their skills are in high demand. This works providing the costs associated with reducing geographical immobility are lower than those required for occupational-orientated projects such as retraining, and that their skills are in demand ''somewhere''.

== Definitions of Unemployment ==
Measuring and defining unemployment is often at least as difficult as, for example, determining the rate of economic growth within an economy, for several reasons. Firstly, economist may disagree over '''what''' unemployment is, and '''how''' to measure it. Secondly, individuals may either not wish it be known they are unemployed (i.e. not claim benefits) or alternatively, claim that they are unemployed when they are not.

=== Measurements of Unemployment ===
==== Claimant Count ====
These include all the people that are nationally registered as claiming unemployment benefit from the government. This does not include those receiving a form of disability benefit, or those who do not claim unemployment allowance, only those that are willing and able to find work, and ''do'' claim.
==== Labour Force Survey ====
This is an internationally accepted measure used by the ''International Labour Organisation'' (ILO). This counts everyone without a job of any kind who have looked for a job in the past month and is willing to start working within the next fortnight. Of course since this is a ''survey'' and not a census (a survey is of a representative sample of a population, a census is of the entire population), there will always be inaccuracies and omissions in the data.

Generally, the ILO's LFS measure is higher than the claimant count, for the reasons mentioned above. When countries' unemployment levels are compared, the LFS is usually used.

To view recent data on unemployment figures for admittedly mostly European countries, see the [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/41/13/18595359.pdf  OECD's report].

====Definitions====
There are several different types of unemployment.  One notable type is deficient demand unemployment. This occurs when there are simply not enough jobs to go around. Another type is structural unemployment.  This occurs when the requirements of available jobs and the skills of available unemployed workers do not coincide.   It is not clear whether location is a factor for this special case, or whether if the jobs are in a different area this is structural unemployment.  It does seem clear that if the person could only become employed be accepting a rate of pay significantly below the going rate this it is structural unemployment.  The other main type of unemployment is transactional or frictional unemployment,  this is people between jobs.  It can be very hard to classify unemployment between these groups.  The classic example of this is if a major employer in a town closes.  Many people are made unemployed in a small area.  These people may be structurally unemployed because there are not enough jobs to go around, or they may fall within the special type of structural unemployment described above, because certain skills are required or the jobs are in a different area, or they may be transactionally unemployed if there are jobs for them but they have yet to find one.

== Types and Causes of Unemployment ==
While looking at figures of unemployment is often useful, it is worth looking into what ''kind'' of unemployment is rising or falling, and how best to combat it. Unemployment is caused by a number of factors, detailed below:

=== Frictional Unemployment ===
This is caused by the time individuals spend searching for a suitable job, the time between jobs. For example, having left a job in a certain industry, it will take time to find and secure another suitable job (location, wage bracket, skills) ''even if'' there is a vacancy. Frictional unemployment is caused by:
* '''Imperfect information''' - an unemployed person cannot know the location and status of all vacancies in their area. This can be reduced through 'job centres' or similar state-funded operations aimed at increasing information available to jobseekers
* '''Disincentives''' - there may be government disincentives to seek work, as an apparently well-paid job will appear less attractive/suitable due to taxation and/or removal of benefits.

=== Occupational or Structural Unemployment ===
This is the result of changes in the economy over the lifetime of a worker. Many developed economies have moved from primarily manufacturing to primarily services orientated economies in the past thirty years. Similarly, a reduction in the percentage employed in primary activities (farming, mining, foresting for examples) has occurred. Those who are otherwise highly qualified in these areas may find it difficult to locate a suitable job. So, the causes of such '''structural''' unemployment include:
* '''Economic Change''' - that is, simply the changes an economy goes through as a result in the standard of living, technological change, and the associated economic growth
* '''Globalisation and Liberalisation of Trade''' - has caused changes in the structure of many economies, with lower costs of production causing much manufacturing and some services to move from some Western countries to primarily Asian 'tiger' economies
* '''Capital replacement''' - is the replacement of labour by capital, as a result of improvements in economies, leading potentially to unemployment
Ways to reduce structural unemployment include incentives for retraining and less popular, governmental protectionism.

=== Geographical Unemployment ===
This is revealed by a difference in the level of unemployment in an Geographical Unemployment is caused by ''geographical immobility of labour'', the inability of workers to move easily from one area to another. Usually concerning difficulties within a country, it is affected by the rate of ''owner-occupation'' (owning one's own home, rather than renting for example), and barriers to free movement such as changes in the cost of living and family connections. Geographical unemployment can be reduced in two main ways:
# Alleviating levels of unemployment in the original area through incentives to invest by new companies (e.g. tax relief), government projects, or other targeted programs
# Reducing barriers to free movement of labour between areas. Notably, the European Union (EU) has reduced the barriers to free movement of labour between countries by reducing border controls. However, language difficulties will remain

=== Cyclical Unemployment ===
When an economy experiences a downturn, or otherwise experiences a fall in AD, firms will respond with a fall in the demand for labour. This will result in a fall in the average wage level, and a fall in the level of employment. A fall in the level of employment usually leads to a similar rise in unemployment. Alternatively, an economic boom will most likely result in a fall in unemployment levels. This process is known as '''cyclical unemployment''', variations in the levels of unemployment over the economic cycle.

=== Casual Unemployment ===
Simply, this is unemployment caused by those who are able to work, but do not wish to. They have sufficient cash to have no need to work, and because of this, may not be cause for concern in unemployment figures.

      <comment>/* Isotopes Of Hydrogen */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Atom==

The word [[w:atom|atom]] comes from the Greek for &quot;indivisible&quot;. An atom is the smallest particle of a chemical element that retains the chemical properties of the element. Atoms are composed of [[w:subatomic particles|subatomic particles]], and to understand the behaviour of an atom we must first understand its constituent particles.

===Electrons===

[[w:Electrons|Electrons]] are tiny, electrically-charged particles. They have a negative charge, very little mass and they exist in the empty space surrounding the nucleus of the atom which contains all the other particles. In their elemental states atoms are not charged and will have the same number of electrons as they have protons.
Electrons can behave as particles and also as waves; this is known as the wave-particle duality of matter. It is only significant for things which are of similar size to atomic particles.
Electrons exist in different energy levels or orbitals, filling the lowest energy levels first.

===Protons===

[[w:protons|Protons]] are much larger than electrons. They are 1836 times heavier than an electron and they have a positive charge equal and opposite to that of an electron.

===Neutrons===

[[w:neutrons|Neutrons]] were the last of the nuclear particles to be discovered.  They have no charge so they are not deflected by a magnetic field. They are almost the same weight as protons, and normally there are more neutrons than protons in a nucleus of an atom, however they can be equal/

==Atomic Numbers==

Atoms are normally described in terms of two key numbers, their [[w:atomic number|atomic number]] and their [[w:mass number|mass number]].

===Atomic Number (Z)===

The number of protons in the nucleus is the most important aspect of an atom. This number determines which [[w:element|element]] an atom belongs to. The atomic number of an atom can tell you:

* The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom
* The number of electrons in the atom when it is neutral
* The atom's position in the [[w:periodic table|periodic table]]

===Mass Number (A)===

Nearly all of an atom's mass comes from the nucleus. Since we know that the mass of a proton is almost equal to that of a neutron, we can measure the mass of an atom in terms of the number of particles in its nucleus. The mass number can tell you:

* The total number of particles in the nucleus
* The number of neutrons in the nucleus (remember to subtract the atomic number)
* The [[w:relative atomic mass|relative atomic mass]] of an atom

===Summary Table===

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| ''Particle Name''
| ''Relative Mass (unified atomic mass unit)''
| ''Mass (kg)''
| ''Relative Charge''
|- 
| Electron
| 1/1836

| -1
|-
| Proton

| 1.67*10-27
| +1
|-
| Neutron
| 1
| 1.67*10-27
| 0
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Isotopes==

Isotopes are '''Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass number'''

Isotopes are shown like this:

&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;Y&lt;/sup&gt;

Where A is the mass number, Z is the atomic number, Y is the charge on the atom and X is the symbol for that element.

===Isotopes Of Hydrogen===

For example, hydrogen has three isotopes.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| Name
| ''Protium''
| ''Deuterium''
| ''Tritium''
|-
| Symbol
| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;H
| &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;H
| &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;H
|-
| Protons
| 1
| 1
| 1
|-
| Neutrons
| 0
| 1
| 2
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

===Isotope Calculations===

It is fairly simple to work out the number of each sub-atomic particle from an isotope's symbol. For a simple example, lets look at a calcium ion:

&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

The number of protons is equal to Z.

The number of neutrons is equal to A - Z.

The number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to Z.

The number of electrons in a positive ion is equal to Z - Y.

The number of electrons in a negative ion is equal to Z + Y.

Using these rules, you should be able to work out that a calcium-40 ion has 20 protons, 20 neutrons and 18 electrons.

==Electrons in Atoms==

Most of the way that atoms behave is governed by the interactions of their electrons. When you sit on a chair the force that stops you from moving through it is the repulsion between the electrons in the atoms that make up the chair and those that make up your body.

In order to understand chemical reactions, you must understand how electrons exist in atoms. Much about what we know of electrons comes from quantum theory, which states that electrons can be described by four ''quantum numbers''. The only one you need to know about is the '''principle quantum number''', which describes the '''energy level''' of an electron.

===Energy Levels===

In your GCSE chemistry you will have come across the principle quantum number in the form of electron shells. The number is given the symbol ''n'', so that if we say 'the electron is in n = 3' what we mean is 'the electron is in the third shell, or energy level'. Each energy level can accommodate a certain number of electrons.


&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| n=
| Maxiumum Electrons
|- 
| 1
| 2
|-
| 2
| 8
|-
| 3
| 18
|}
&lt;/center&gt;


At GCSE, you would have been taught to denote the electronic configuration of that atom like this:

Examples:

Lithium (3): 2,1
Sodium (11): 2,8,1

At AS level we look deeper and divide the shells into a number of subshells. Pairs of electrons are known as atomic orbitals.&lt;br&gt;
s subshells hold 2 electrons (or 1 orbital),&lt;br&gt;
p subshells hold 6 electrons (or 3 orbitals),&lt;br&gt;
d subshells hold 10 electrons (or 5 orbitals),&lt;br&gt;
f subshells hold 14 electrons (or 7 orbitals).&lt;br&gt;

The subshells are arranged in the following order:

1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, ....

note that the 4s orbital fills before the 3d!!

This sounds daunting but with practice you will learn the correct order. All you have to remember is the order the subshells come in and the number of electrons each shell holds.

To denote the electronic configuration you simply write out that order, raising the number of electrons in each subshell as a superscript.

So Hydrogen-1 (1) is simply 1s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Lithium (3) is 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Sodium (11) is 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Orbitals also have a paired spin, one counterclockwise and one clockwise. You can denote this by drawing a box with an up and down arrow in it. You must remember, if asked to construct a diagram in an exam, that on each shell (say 2p) you always fill in the 3 orbitals first with arrows going in one direction (say fill in all 3 boxes with up arrows before filling in the down arrows). So if there are only meant to be 2 electrons in the 2p subshell, draw 2 up arrows in 2 separate orbitals and don't draw an up and down arrow in just one orbital.

The best evidence chemists have for the existence of the energy levels comes from ionisation energies.

===Ionisation Energy===

Atoms are ''ionised'' when they lose an electron. The energy required to remove the electron is known as the ''ionisation energy''. As each electron is removed from an atom the ionisation energy required increases, so we call the energy required to remove the first electron the ''first ionisation energy'', the energy required to remove the second electron the ''second ionisation energy'' and so on. To be more accurate, the first ionisation energy is '''the amount of energy needed to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous, monatomic element.'''  The second ionisation energy is '''the amount of energy needed to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous ions each of which bear a single positive charge'''.

==Electron Shells and subshells==

      <text xml:space="preserve">The pulmonary system consists predominantly of blood vessels and the lungs.  The blood vessels are known as the pulmonary vascular system and they are responsible for carrying blood from the heart (right ventricle) through the lungs and back to the heart (left atrium). As blood circulates through the lungs, it is oxygenated by passing through the pulmonary capillary network, being in close opposition to the gas exchanging units of the lung (alveoli) and thus picking up oxygen.  The lungs are made of airways for movement of air from the nose and mouth, and lung tissue (parenchyma) which includes the alveoli.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is delicious warm or cold as a dessert or &quot;stand-alone&quot; cake, this simple and reliable recipe is tried and tested. Cuts into 8 slices.

==Ingredients==
* 5 [[cookbook:ounce|ounces]] (145 g) [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 2 large [[cookbook:egg|egg]]s
* 8 [[cookbook:ounce|ounces]] (230 g) [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|caster sugar]]
* 1 [[cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[cookbook:almond essence|almond essence]]
* 8 [[cookbook:ounce|ounces]] (230 g) [[Cookbook:Self Raising Flour|self-raising flour]]
* 1&amp;frac12; level [[cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* approx. &amp;frac34; [[cookbook:pound|pounds]] (330 g) peeled cooking [[cookbook:apple|apple]]s (Bramleys)
* [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|icing sugar]] to dredge

==Method==
* Grease a 9&quot; (23 cm) loose-bottomed [[Cookbook:Springform Pan|spring-form cake tin]].
* Melt the butter in a pan gently, then pour into a large bowl.
* Add the eggs, sugar and almond essence and stir well until mixed. Then add the flour and baking powder. Stir well - at this point, it should be a stiff mixture.
* Spread just under two-thirds of the mixture into the cake tin.
* Immediately afterwards, peel, core and slice the apples and place on top of the mixture in the tin. Cover these with the remainder of the cake mixture. At this stage, the cake may appear &quot;untidy&quot;, but the cooking process eliminates most unevenness or gaps in the surface.
* Bake for 1¼ to 1½ hours in a pre-heated oven at 325 °F/160 °C/Gas Mark 3.

''Once cooked, allow to cool slightly in the tin, loosen the sides of the cake with a knife and gently push the cake out onto a plate. Lightly dust the top of the cake with sieved icing sugar once cool. Serve warm or cold, with cream for best results.''

==Storage==
This cake will last for at least 3-4 days, and can be re-heated as necessary. Keep covered or alternatively refrigerate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transposition is the integration of transposable elements into the genome. Transposable elements are DNA segments that jump around the genome and integrate themselves into different regions.

== Discovery  ==

The first description of mobile genetic elements in a genome was made by Barbara McClintock working at Cold Spring Harbor in the 1950s.  While attempting to explain the odd phenotypic behavior of mosaic color striations on corn kernels, she came to the conclusion that there were genetic elements in corn that could move among the chromosomes.  Although her experimental support was strong, her conclusions was so far from the mainstream understanding of the nature of chromosomes, that she was politely ignored.  In the late 1970s the discovery of bacterial transposons directed renewed attention on her pioneering work, and her efforts were resoundingly accepted when she was awarded an unshared Nobel prize in 1983.

== Uses in Genetics ==


Transposable elements are very useful in studying the genome. They allow researchers to search for genes and enhancers and find interesting relationships between phenotypes and genotypes. By using p-elements and transposase, DNA constructs can be formed to randomly jump around the genome. P-elements flank the DNA sequence you want to jump around and transposase is used to cut the squence out and reinsert it elsewhere.

On method for using transposable elements to find various enhancer sites is to construct a transposable element that contains the Gal-4 gene with a weak promoter with a p-element upstream and downstream. Another construct with UAS site (when the gal-4 protein binds to the UAS site, anything downstream is expressed) and a marker gene downstream that can, for example, encode for a fluorescent protein is also created. By inserting these constructs into 2 strains of flies, you will have 1 strain with the transposable Gal-4 gene and another strain with the stationary UAS construct. A third mouse strain containing transposase gene is needed.

Strain 1: Transposable Gal-4 strain

Strain 2: UAS marker Strain

Strain 3: Transposase Strain

First, strains 1 and 3 are crossed to produce flies with both the p-elements and the transposase. This allows the construct with gal-4 to jump around to random locations in the genome and depending on the location of gal-4, the amount of gal-4 expression with be changed. Afterwards, the gal-4 construct is stabilized by crossing it with normal flies and genotyped to find the flies with only the gal-4 gene. These flies are then crossed brother to sister to produce specific lines of homozygous gal-4 mutants. These new lines are then crossed with the UAS marker strain 2 and the effects on phenotype are observed. If for example a gal-4 construct lands next to a tissue specific enhancer for the eye, the gal-4 protein will bind to the UAS site and the marker gene will be expressed causing, for example, the tissue color to be green. Using probes for the known gal-4 sequence, the region of DNA is isolated and sequenced to find the enhancer site. This method can be used to find various enhancers that can be used in other experiments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[User:Genelowrey|Genelowrey]] 21:33, 2 March 2006 (UTC)The article under &quot;Lexington and Concord&quot; states that the &quot;Shot Heard 'Round the World&quot; was the first shot fired on Lexington Green.  This is a common misconception (and perhaps that shot should be so named), but the actual &quot;shot heard 'round the world&quot; was fired several hours later at the old north bridge in Concord.  The phrase originally came from Emerson's poem about the Concord fight.[[User:Genelowrey|Genelowrey]] 21:33, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

== Content &amp; structure ==

--[[User:Ccny930|Ccny930]] 02:12, 20 December 2006 (UTC) The chapter seems too &quot;loose&quot; if it aims to describe the Revolution. Some sections barely have any material (see &quot;Canada&quot;) whereas others are almost personal accounts of the battles themselves (see &quot;The Battle of Boston&quot;). If no one objects, I'll add some content to the shorter sections to balance the chapter out. Hopefully, we can get it to be at least 75% complete.

--[[User:Ccny930|Ccny930]] 02:49, 20 December 2006 (UTC) Well, after a half-hour's work, I reorganized several sections and added missing content. Then I changed the image in the Table of Contents to 75%. If anyone has questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to post them here.</text>

== Subject of the Sentence ==

Well, strictly speaking, the difference can be only stylistic, since the instrumental case is here the case of the so-called &quot;copula subject.&quot;  I don't know Polish well enough to decide which half of the subject to render in the instrumental.  In Russian, there's nothing wrong with saying &quot;Glavnye jazyki stranicy byli ...polskim i russkim&quot;, which is the same as &quot;Russkij i polskij byli glavnymi jazykami stranicy.&quot;  &quot;Glavnymi jazykami stranicy byli russkij i polskij&quot; is stylistically marked.  -VKokielov

== [[False Friends of the Slavist/Polish-Czech]] ==

I suggest also to add the following words:
* &quot;merdać&quot; - pol. &quot;to move a tail (dog)&quot;, cz. &quot;to fuck&quot;
* &quot;odbyt&quot; - pol. &quot;anus&quot;, cz. &quot;sale, market&quot;

: Please, could you not just add the 'false friends' in question on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=False_Friends_of_the_Slavist/Polish-Czech&amp;action=edit the respective page] yourself? Sorry, but I haven't got the time to make edits other people want to make. The idea of a Wiki is that people can edit it themselves. Apart from that, you will see that you have to enter more information than you gave me, e.g. the Polish word for 'to fuck' and the Czech word for 'to wag the tail'.

==руський = український==
Таке визначення подається в [http://www.slovnyk.net/?swrd=%F0%F3%F1%FC%EA%E8%E9 словнику] як історичне. Також я мав на увазі, що коли в сучасній українській мові вживається '''руський''' щодо означень доби Русі, то це має значення східнослов'янський. А якщо &quot;руський&quot;  вживається щодо  пізніших часів (коли паралельно існували етноніми &quot;Русь&quot; і &quot;Україна&quot;), наприклад щодо Галичини 19ст. (&quot;Центральна Руська Рада&quot; та ін.), то синонімом тут виступає слово &quot;український&quot; а не &quot;східнослов'янський&quot;.  --[[User:Yakudza|Yakudza]] 23:17, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">

== Bartending ==

I was being a little facetious when I asked what a measure was.  The issue here is that a good number of cocktails don't have fixed ratios; for
instance, a martini can go from the 2:1 reccommended by Noilly Prat to a more standard 4:1 &quot;extra dry,&quot; and the modern practice is coming closer and
closer to the &quot;science&quot; of [[w:homeopathy|homeopathy]].  On the other side of the spectrum, drinks like margaritas and mojitos, which are made with roughly
equal frequency by the glass or by the pitcher, need different ratios depending on the volume being prepared.  These factors lead me to think that the base spirit templates shouldn't attempt to have anything to do with measurements.  Further, it's not 100%
clear to me what one gains from indexing by base spirit at all; most bourbon drinks have a rum equivalent, for instance, and vodka gets substituted 
reguarly for just about anything behind the bar (admittedly, with occasionally disastrous effects.)  As for internationalization of measurements, all bartenders need to be equally familiar with jiggers, ounces, centiliters, and whatever other
measurements they're likely to see in recipes, so it doesn't make sense to try to edit this out of the book.  It seems that it would
make more sense to link the measurements to a section on measures which would include precise as well as measure-of-thumb conversions.
-- [[User:Dan131m|Dan131m]]

: If you're going to use templates for the ingredients I'd prefer they don't leave &quot;droppings&quot; on the page, except perhaps a link to a page with information about the liquor.  So, for instance, you could put something like &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;If cherry heering is unavailable, substitute {{kirsch}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which would add to the &quot;Drinks with kirsch&quot; category and insert a link to the kirsch page, sans any sort of &quot;one measure&quot; nonsense.  On an unrelated topic, I'm still not convinced that standardizing the units in the book accomplishes anything, other than creating a gap in bartenders' knowledge and annoying contributors who have to look up the canonical measurement units. -- [[User:Dan131m|Dan131m]]

Thank you for your comment on my talk page. Apologies for the delay in replying.

I have (I hope temporarily) restored all the bartending pages (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Bartending&amp;namespace=0 here] for a complete list of pages in the book. In each case the content of the pages beginning Bartending/Cocktails has already been merged into another article linked from [[Bartending/Cocktails]], which is why I believe the old links to be unnecessary. This merging preserved the then-current structure of listing cocktails by their main ingredients.

Now there are, of course, other ways to arrange cocktails - alphabetically, or by style, for example. I do think, for the sake of having a coherent book, that we should select which method to use, and stick to it.

Incidentally, I think general feedback is that small subpages, such as the book originally had, particularly when they are of greatly varying quality, are not welcomed by readers - and it does not make for a coherent book. It makes reading the book, and maintaining it, harder too. Some form of aggregation is important. Once the form of aggregation has been chosen, I'm happy to help with the change, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:24, 26 March 2006 (UTC)


Hi, I've almost finished transwikiing a bunch of cocktails articles to here.  I'm then going to move them all to the proper bartending/cocktails/ area from where they are now, at Transwiki: 
When I do so, do you want me to put the barwork tag on them all? --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 23:54, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
:I've transwikied them all, 90 or so.  I moved most of them to the Bartending/Cocktails/ area, and added the barwork tag to them all.  Except for about the following, which had previously existing articles here.  These will all need to be merged, or will need to replace the previously existing articles if they are better, perhaps.  I'm not sure what the procedure is on this, how do I go about doing this properly while still maintaining the history and all?  Here is the list:
*‎Transwiki:Black Velvet 
*‎Transwiki:Brandtea 
*‎Transwiki:Brandy Alexander 
*‎Transwiki:Cosmopolitan 
*‎Transwiki:French 75 
*‎Transwiki:Golden Cadillac 
*‎Transwiki:Margarita 
*‎Transwiki:Mojito 
*‎Transwiki:Prairie Oyster this is not strictly speaking an alcoholic beverage, not sure what to do with it
*‎Transwiki:Rob Roy 
*‎Transwiki:Sidecar 
*‎Transwiki:Slippery Nipple 
*‎Transwiki:Sloe Gin Fizz 
And http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Prarie_Fire  I realized there is another article here with the spelling Prairie Fire.
I am sending this same message to Jguk, you're the two who I know are paying attention to this area of wikibooks.  --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 15:48, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

== Bartending ==

Absolutely. The glossary is meant to be just that - the basics. It seems perfectly sensible to me to create pages to add more detail for the more interesting cocktails (though if you're willing, helping to create a good glossary of cocktails first would be nice).

Incidentally, I'm concerned about the name of the first cocktail listed in the glossary because of its offensive username. I'm wondering whether it would be better to censor it out, or at least abbreviate it to AMF. Your thoughts would be welcome, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:50, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:36, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

==Welcome back==

Good to see you back (I was worried I'd frightened you off by mistake). Now I have tidied up the glossary, hopefully it's clearer what I was getting at. Hopefully it can stay where we have very limited info on a cocktail (eg just the ingredients or just the ingredients and the most basic of mixing instructions). As noted before, where we already have more to say about a particular drink than is suitable in the cocktail, separate pages (either by cocktail or type of cocktail) will still be appropriate.

I'd very much like to see the Bartending page look complete (from a visual perspective). If it looks good, it should help draw in future contributors. It would also then be suitable for nomination as &quot;Book of the Month&quot;. By looking complete from a visual perspective, I do not, of course, mean that it cannot be expanded - it most certainly can - but hopefully the development can be in a more controlled manner rather than the &quot;let's dump this from wikipedia&quot; approach that some people have had in the past.

All the best for continuing to improve the book, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:30, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Phonetic Classification==
I wonder if the 'f' in the consonant chart is meant to be in the 'bilabial' column, as it is usually categorized as labiodental. My username on Wikipedia is RockRockOn if you wish to contact me there.

==Generalization==

In any case all Arabs can pronounce: ح خ ع غ ق ل ر properly)...

What if an Arab grows up in American and learns to speak only English?  In that case, not all Arabs can pronounce those letters properly.  It may be better to say &quot;...all native Arabic speakers can pronounce...&quot;

== Vocalization? ==

Any way of getting sound files for the letters included in this?  I'm sure there is somewhere you could get some, or maybe someone could make some.  I would but dont have the time / knowhow.</text>

The Wart meets King Pellinore in the Forest Savauge when he is out overnight looking for Cully, the goshawk. King Pellinore says he has been lost for 17 years. His dog is supposed to be tracking the Questing beast but she usually goes in opposite directions from King Pellinore, and gets her leash tied around the horse's legs. He appears to be a clumsy man and has problems keeping his visor up. King Pellinore complains about his armor &quot;all this beastly armor takes hours to put on. When it is on it's either frying or freezing, and it gets rusty. You have to sit up all night polishing the stuff. Oh, how i do wish I had a nice house of my own to live in, a house with beds in it and real pillows and sheets.&quot; the Wart offers him a feather bed in Sir Ector's castle if he will help the Wart find his way back to the castle. King Pellinore is very excited and completely forgets about the Wart being lost. Then he hears the beast and goes off after it, leaving the Wart. King Pellinore also appears in later chapters of the book.

==Textbooks==

I've gotten a couple of questions on the textbooks we will be using for the class. It seems at this stage that there are two texts available for the Fire Instructor: ''Fire and Emergency Services Instructor'' by IFSTA and ''Fire Service Instructor'' by Brady. The state exam in Ohio is based on the IFSTA book, but if someone wants to review the Brady one and give some feedback that would be great. The state uses PTS for their testing, if that helps.--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 16:27, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

FWIW I suspect Mr. Stross did some research (it's possible) into electronic trading history and came across Steve Wunsch, cartoon randian bad guy/libertarian pinup (delete as per personal politics) who had a big hand in getting that whole ball rolling.

(The Questing Beast is also known as the Beast Glatisant) King Pellinore has been searching for the Questing Beast for 17 years. Only a Pellinore or his next of kin can catch it. There is only one Questing Beast. It &quot;has the head of a serpent, ah, and the body of a libbard, the haunches of a lion, and he is footed like a hart. Wherever this beast goes he makes a noise in his belly as it had been the noise of thirty couple hounds question. Except when he is drinking, of course.&quot; -King Pellinore, Chapter 2. More information on the Questing Beast can be found in Chapter 16.

Please review the current version of the policy as proposed:

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Deletion_policy&amp;oldid=366253 Wikibooks:Deletion policy]

== Introduction ==

The current deletion policy is mainly a collection of best practices by administrators on this project.  As such, this has become a defacto policy, but it still hasn't recieved a formal vote by the community to become enforced policy.  Because this does deal with the actual content of Wikibooks, and enforcement of practices by users (especially administrators) it is important that some sort of formal policy be adopted.

The current policy has been listed on Wikibooks for over two years, which should have generated most of comments about modifications to it for those who are interested.  Still, experience shows that once a major move (like becoming an enforced policy) occurs there are many people who feel left out from the decision making process.

Feel free to also propose specific ammendments to this policy that might be beneficial to the community.  This page, however, is not a substitute for [[Wikibooks talk:Deletion policy]], where general discussion about this policy should still take place.

== Key points ==

There are several key points to review with this policy:

* Speedy Deletion Criteria
*:Some users are confused that administrators can remove content without even holding a vote for deletion.  The justifications for removing content immediately are narrow and have proven useful to avoid clutter on the VfD page.    This policy explicitly covers what that criteria would be.
* Copyright Violation Enforcement
*:This is the &quot;official&quot; policy for Wikibooks regarding copyright violation enforcement.
* Administrator Ettiquette for Deletion
*:Goes over the dos and don'ts of administrator actions regarding the deletion of content.  These are mainly guidelines to administrator behavior, but can be useful to point at when having a serious dispute with administrators or going before stewards and an arbitration board.

It is important to note that by making this enforced, it is not the final edit for this content.  It can be ammended and changed in the future, through community concensus.

== Votes ==

*Only registered users with at least 20 edits can vote. 
*Vote ends at April, 15th 00:01 GMT 
*Add votes in the format '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">In statics and mechanics, units can be expressed in terms of three basic dimensions: length, mass, and time.  All other units are created from combinations of these three basic units.   

Force can be considered a fourth basic unit.  Known as a derived measurement, it comes from Newton's 2nd Law: 

&lt;math&gt;\ \ \!\mathrm{F} = \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{a}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 

Here, force is defined as the amount of mass multiplied by the acceleration (length per second squared) that the mass achieves. 



== International System of Units (SI Units) ==
In the SI system of units, the three specified base units are the units of length, mass and time.  A fourth unit, that of force, is derived from the base units.

* The unit of length is the meter (m).
* The unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).
* The unit of time is the second (s).
* The unit of force is the Newtons (N), where:

&lt;math&gt;\ \!\mathrm{N} = 1\ \!\mathrm{kg}\ \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;



When working with units that are either large multiples or small fractions of these units, prefixes are often used in order to keep the numbers manageable .  For example,

&lt;math&gt;1000\ \!\mathrm{m} = 1\ \!\mathrm{km}&lt;/math&gt;

The following table gives a more detailed description of prefixes.  

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!width=&quot;50&quot;|Prefix
!width=&quot;50&quot;|Abbrev.
!width=&quot;50&quot;|Factor

|-
|femto- || f || 10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|atto- || a || 10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

All other measurements are derived using variations of these four basic units and  the listed prefixes.

== British and American Customary Units ==
While the International System of units is in common use throughout much of the world, engineers may still encounter British or American units.  Therefore, it is a good idea to have some familiarity with them.

While the basic units in International System of units are length, mass, and time--with the unit of force defined in terms of these--in the British and American units, the base units are length, force and time, with mass being defined in terms of these.

* The unit of length is the foot (ft).
* The unit of force is the pound (lb), which is occasionally called pound-force (lbf).
* The unit of time is the second (s).


The unit of mass in British and American units is the slug.  It is defined as the amount of mass accelerated at a rate of 1 ft/s^2 when 1 pound of force is applied.  

&lt;math&gt;1\ \!\mathrm{slug} = 1\ \!\mathrm{lb}_f\ \frac{\mathrm{ft}}{\mathrm{s}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Occasionally, mass is described as a pound-mass. It is equal to the mass required to move one lb of weight when acted upon by the standard acceleration of gravity.  On Earth, the standard acceleration of gravity is about 32.2 ft/s^2, this means that one slug is 32.2 lb(mass).

&lt;math&gt;1\ \!\mathrm{slug} = 32.2\ \!\mathrm{lb_m}&lt;/math&gt;

== Conversion from one System of Units to Another ==
While we can do all our calculations in one set of units or the other, as long as we are consistent, there are times we will want to convert from one system to the other.

* Unit of Length   1 ft = 0.3048 m
* Unit of Force    1 lb = 4.448 N
* Unit of Mass     1 slug = 1 lb-s^2/ft = 14.59 kg

As mentioned earlier, the second is the same in both systems of units and and so no conversion is required.

Common British and American Customary units and their SI equivalents are listed in the table below.

=== Example ===
According to the official National Hockey League rulebook, &quot;The official size of the (hockey) rink shall be two hundred feet (200') long and eighty-five feet (85') wide.&quot;  What are the dimensions in SI units?

==== Solution ====
:From the above table:

:&lt;math&gt; 1\ \mathrm{ft} = 0.3048\ \mathrm{m} &lt;/math&gt;

:Using dimensional analysis we find the length and width in meters.

:&lt;math&gt;l\ =\ 200\ \mathrm{ft}\ \cdot\ \frac{0.3048\ \mathrm{m}}{1\ \mathrm{ft}} =\ 60.96\ \mathrm{m} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;w\ =\ 85\ \mathrm{ft}\ \cdot\ \frac{0.3048\ \mathrm{m}}{1\ \mathrm{ft}} =\ 25.96\ \mathrm{m} &lt;/math&gt;

== Significant Digits ==
When we talk about measurements and calculations, we need to understand the degree of accuracy involved.

The accuracy of our calculations cannot be more precise than the accuracy of our measurements.

Suppose we are provided with a distance to an accuracy of one decimal place, say 9.8 m.  We are told an object travels this distance in 0.81 seconds.  It does not make sense to say the object is traveling at a velocity of 12.11111111 m/s, that is, to eight decimal places.

This is because neither the distance nor the time taken to travel this distance is specified to this degree of precision.  In fact, they are both specified to an accuracy of only two significant digits.

For reasons we will discuss shortly, we can say the object is traveling at a velocity of 12.1 m/s.

For many calculations in statics, we work to at most three significant digits.

=== Rules for Finding the Correct Number of Significant Digits ===
In general, when making a calculation, the answer can not have more significant digits than any of the numbers used in calculating it.  The number of significant digits in an answer is equal to the minimum number of significant digits used in the calculation.

Here are rules that will help outline whether or not a digit is significant or not.

# Non-zero numbers are always significant.
# Zeros placed in between two other digits are significant.
# Zeros placed at the end of a number, '''after a decimal''', are significant.

In Regards to Wish #3. There are many free image size alteration programs available. At the this moment, as I type this, I do not have a list ( I will make one shortly ). With one, resizing images is simple. Of course, renaming them can be the real hassel.

==Requesting Features==
Chris Laurel, Celestia's primary author, has been quite explicit that feature requests are very unlikely to be implemented if they aren't on the [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=21302&amp;atid=371302| SourceForge list]. If you are interested in any of the features listed on the previous page, '''''you''''' must take the responsibility of making sure they're requested on [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=21302&amp;atid=371302| SourceForge].

      <comment>Welcome to Wikibooks</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome to Wikibooks ==

I hope that you enjoy your experience here on Wikibooks.  I'd like to introduce myself, as I am one of the project administrators here and was looking over some of the recent contributions to this project you have made.

A few places you might want to check out:

*[[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge]] - For general project-wide conversation, good, bad and ugly.  Generally a civil tone prevails here, with new user questions (including FAQ type questions) welcome.
*[[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]] - Wikibooks specific policies.  Note especially [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] that is often cited as justifications to keep or remove content from Wikibooks.

At some point in the future the Wikibook that you have been working on, [[The Once and Future King]] should try and work on a standard way to name the content pages, especially with the new pages you have added.  What you have done so far is just fine, but there does need to be some more editorial and content organization of that whole collection of Wikibook modules.  The naming convention does not follow [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]], but this Wikibook falls under the grandfather clause as the naming convention existed prior to the adoption of that policy.

I seriously do want to welcome you here, and I hope that you have a positive experience on Wikibooks.  It is a fun experience to be adding this content, and is very rewarding when you see some comments from readers or even see your work cited externally to Wikibooks.  We are not as big as Wikipedia here, but we are growing at about the same rate at the moment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:43, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Erinyes were three sisters of hideous shape: they had large claws on their hands and feet, snakes for hair, and large batlike wings; in addition, they were outfitted with scourges or whips. Their purpose was to pursue and torment all evildoers for the rest of their life, swooping down on them with their weapons and claws and tearing at their flesh. It didn't matter where the evildoers were; the Erinyes would inevitably come and find them.

Their names were Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera.

RSD has a number of synonyms, the most common one being the eponymn Sudeck's Dystrophy. Others are Algodystrophy and the current term of art; complex regional pain syndome, type 1, a prefered term in that it omits the implied etiology involving the sympathetic nervous system, historical personages, and pedantic usage. In English, the word semantic means &quot;of or relating to meaning.&quot; In the science of linguistics, semantics is more explicit: It's the study of meaning based on the historical and psychological significance of words and terms. This greater specificity in defining our semantics is helpful when our therapeutic efforts are organized around a disease name instead of the preferred organization around a specific symptom or better still the influencing of a specific known pathophysiologic mechanism.

Whatever we choose to call the problem this remains a controversial area which touches on the nature of pain itself, and the more general philosophical question of mind body and the nature of perception. It is probably well that we imply nothing by our nomenclature rather than imply something erroneous or which unduely restricts the scope of the problem.



Consider the  sentence &quot;I can't help feeling this way.&quot; Now consider the sentence &quot;The feeling of which you speak is painful&quot;. It is evident from this comparison of usage for the word &quot;feeling&quot;, that the very language we use to describe pain or any other feeling for that matter leaves ambiguous the issue of the feeling as a tangible entity unto itself or more of an internal habit of mind. Can we hope to fruitfully delve into such matters in a scientific manner or will our inquiries inevitably lead to a reduction to absurdity by tracing feeling back to its neurophysiologic underpinnings.  

It is unusual to find pain that is purely somatic in its manifestations. All pain involves a central response and all pain associated with disability will effect the person as a whole whose normal connection to their place in the world is altered by their incapacity. The perception of pain distorts all aspects of reality as interpreted by the individual.  The sentient being who has conscious self awareness, who is conscious of their own mortality, this is the essential distiguishing characteristic of an intelligent life form and we tend to presume it is the defining characteristic of our humanity. 

Pain inherently reminds us of mortality. Pain deprives us of the transcendent bliss of dwelling in the present. The present is denied to the individual in pain, and the future is likewise denied as each moment in pain seems an eternity.  The past becomes the only escape and in the case of an individual who has been traumatized, this constraining quality of pain prevents recovery from the trauma.
This is stated better by Emily Dickinson in poem 650.[http://www.csustan.edu/english/reuben/pal/chap4/dickinson.html Dickinson]

Complex regional pain syndrome,shoulder hand syndrome, causalgia, minor trauma dystrophy, pain dysfunction syndrome,nonspecific upper extremity pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, we create categories of pain associated syndromes each with unknown pathophysiologic mechanisms. They seem to represent discrete categories and at other times they appear to morph, or oscillate. Could it be that the aparent discrepency between the manifestations of a patient's pain from one clinic visit to the next reflects such an ossilation between pain states. Do these pain states have differing neurophysiological bases?

Pain states have a protean character; they share this quality with other neuropathologies. There is a sort of quantum tendency to shift states of being in a way that belies the normal logic of classical anatomically based explanations. The quandry might be likened to the inadequacy of neutonian mechanics failing to account for the behavior of subatomic particles prior to the development of quantum mechanics and relativity.

Similar difficulties are encountered in defining neurophysiologic correlates for Anesthesia and Analgesia as these too represent related states of consciousnes, at the opposit spectrum in a sense from that of pain.

It is proposed that the management of pain in association with surgical recovery may predispose to a chronic pain experience.  The presumption is that the ideal would be a zero pain experience.  The acceptance that  some level of pain will be experienced is a prerequisite  to consent for the present as completely pain free is infrequently the case for most surgical procedures.  The afferent storm may be blunted.  The afferents may go nowhere, hit the wall at consciousness unreceptive, they are is a sense forgotten if not unseen.  So the effect of ideal anesthetic is one which dissociates recognition as adverse and harmful, detachment from reality without full loss of awareness, this would be Ketamine.  Then there is the complete detachment to the point of sleep, changed respirations, often suppressing, then there is complete dissociation of brain control on the maintenance of physiology warranting complete control of respirations and blood pressure by pressors and ventilatory support.  So anaesthesia is a variable proposition, depending upon what is being undertaken favoring the less is more approach, retaining a flexible response, or it could be more cookie cutter.  The consistency of the anesthesia, the appropriateness to the level of expected pain in the immediate post operative period, these are challenges made better by the experience of the crew, their awareness and familiarity with similar cases.  Much of this is undiscussed, relationship driven in some cases, it is helpful if the anesthesiologist knows his surgeon, and knows how to make him look good by getting the cocktail just right.  Who can really know in advance how much pain they can take.  So a patients prior experience with pain successful or otherwise would be well to know in advance of any procedure.  A patient may have a pretty good idea of how much they can take.  Others will recoil at the least amount of pain as if an old terror was awakened, the sight of a needle nearly qualifying as painful in itself.  

 While impossible to quantify one has a sense for what level of pain a person is experiencing.  
Competing scales include a one to ten verbal report, or a facial response scale.  As a guide this is imperfect but it is just one more tool of communication.  The human is ultimately deciding and interpreting.  If pain is to be called a thing, it would consist of three parts.  That which can be observed by facial expression and posture.  That which can be observed on the basis of physiologic monitoring including pulse blood pressure and respirations.  Thirdly that which can be ascertained by the patients utterances, or directed responses.  How the patient says it and what is said may be considered but ideally the patient reporting 10/10 pain is taken at face value.  
Together these three observations are what we can empirically call pain.  All the rest is what we ourselves have experienced, currently experience or can imagine.  So we are all influenced by our personal knowledge of pain and our cultural accumen with regard to what humans are capable of experiencing and surviviing.  Do we have a generational or cultural bias that influences our responses, and our responses to pain in another.  Do we react the same to a stoic or one who from their background, ethnicity sex, we expect may amplify their outward manifestation of pain, be more likely to verbalize it, One who is like us or unlike us.  Since the human judgement is in the loop with regard to the response to pain, individually and as health care providers these questions are relevant.  
Empirically another view of pain might be that which can be observed via imaging.  What does a brain look like that is in pain?  What would the monitoring of the spinal cord tell us as to the intraoperative experience of pain.  Is the spine also asleep when the brain is asleep?

One could imagine artificial intelligence being enlisted.  A computer delivered data including facial recognition
 inputs, auditory tonal cues, and physiologic feeds.  All of these brought together and the computer spits out a number corresponding to the patients pain score and advising the right response.  
How much?  What form. 

That being unavailable, the decision making is made between nurses and doctors, doctors ordering, adjusting their orders based on nursing observations. 
The role of the nurse in mediating this through the course of the night, is a separate battle ground.  How acceptable is level of pain, how quickly are adjustments made,

The doctor and nurse and patient are all in three different places while these decisions are made. While this is understandable it begs the question of why 
this could not be alleviated by the ubiquitous availability of wifi based video conferencing.  The nurse and doctor could quickly concur agreeing about how 
much pain a patient is in and whether to provide as much as might be demanded.  The answer is that such a capacity would infringe upon privacy.  

Ordering without video input or some other means, remote communication with the patient is a condition we accept to preserve privacy.   How much video scrutiny of the pain experience would be acceptable and what amount would be a problematic, violation of privacy etc might be anwered in advance, with none.  None without permission.  What tacit provision is already presumed.  How frequently is a doctor currently called to the bedside to evaluate pain?  Does this have as much to do with the relationship of the nurse and doctor.  Certainly a doctor getting short or angry or not fully coherent might dissuade a nurse from calling.  The nurse may not like speaking with the doctor.  She has to rely on professionalism and duty to the patient to overcome that, or she may find a way to take more on herself, but this is severely limited.  

Currently,  how accessible is a doctor to a nurses call is determined by  how much love and hate, CYA, experience or other characteristics of the doctor nurse working relationship might influence the current decision making and treatment delivery train.  The doctors pen, the nurses phone this is the point of the sword in cost of care.  The more that is ordered the higher the cost.  Are there cost considerations, between PCA vs intermittent dosing.  How much autonomy can be exercised by a nurse, in recovery vs ICU vs the floor

 There is currently no assent to such intrusion even though every other intrusion has been accepted, ones personal integrity put at risk giving every access to every orifice, but then there is the expectation of some privacy.  The conditions in the post recovery state, how to deliver care and support while retaining privacy encouraging autonomy.  Our present hospital rooms are static, hospital environments are compartmentalized, lounging areas, where autonomy is grown, patients rarely moving about unescorted, and hopefully not inappropriately so.  Safety being paramount a hospital is a highly regulated environment in which privacy and personal autonomy is dictated.  A matter of policy.   

Privacy may be sacrificed to the purpose of recovery, such as a built in semipublic experience of a group therapy session.  To what extent does this come into play.  Will a patient in the course of recovery be amidst others also recovering.  This could be good or bad of course, generally good though.  A patient may not know how much they can take but they may be darn sure they can take as much as that schmuck.  So attitudes, competitive or even prejudicial may become prorecovery.  To what extent can a hospital provide a personalized response knowing what would be most helpful for a given patient.  Lots of reassurance and presence, or more personal privacy with less interaction.  There are formal and informal ways in which the patient may tailor the environment, doors, their own clothing rather than gowns,  A recent bill board advertises the front opening robe they offer as an alternative to the back opening gown.  All and all, if you ask patients they will say they want as much privacy as possible.  Presumably, that may not be what is best for them.  They may need lots of frequent interaction and prodding.    

 There may be other reasons for a particular choice of management, respiratory difficulties, orientation limitations very sensitive to the side effect of any analgesic resulting in disorientation, a detachment from the external accompanying the emancipation from the nociceptive reality. The storm of afferents warning of recent or impending injury.  The fear of the possibility of life threatening or eternal disability.  The fear that the present course was a bad one and things are never getting better, something wrong was done or is this normal.  So over a particular period of time the afferent storm is interpreted and either amplified in significance or dismissed.  This division is clear when two patients undergo the same operation one doing well and another poorly. How are they different, both middle aged men working at the same job same problem carpal tunnel syndrome.  The surgeons can tell you with high reliability that one will do well and the other poorly.  Their differing phases of recovery, one rapid and one slow.  One dismissive of symptoms, focused on the improvements, optimistic that taking on more is good and not bad, ready to do the other hand sooner.  The other patient taking too long to reach a state of capability, enabling a return to one handed duty, and ultimately undertaking the second operation never really getting pinned down to its state of improvement relative to its previous state of dis-ease.  And slow to recover all the more after the second operation.  The symptoms then becoming commodities like playing cards more than symptoms.  More pain means lighter work.  That is all that I need report.  Then there is the question of whether the patient is consciously playing the cards or whether the brain is playing without the mind being aware.  This may be the level at which psychiatric theory would be expected to work.  To point out the disjunction. Analysis of the type of cognitive dissonance that may be involved.  The social psychology of the recovery process is generally not formally addressed, but argely the domain of the work comp nurse.  What factors of the patients overall life may be detrimental to recovery, which may need to be addressed proactively, in advance of surgery.  

To make the person acknowledge that their brain is playing this zero sum game.  Gaining advantage through the perpetuation of pain or disability and without  consulting you.  Psychiatry would suggest this autonomous layering whereby inner motivation and even happiness may be hostage to this disconnect. The extent to which behavior is determined by unconscious motivations is largely underestimated. In the case of patient B.  The unpleasantness of the work environment, conflicts with coworkers, peers and well as superiors are all potential obstacles to recovery.  Then there is a culture of entitlement.  A correlation between the duration of recovery and the ultimate settlement. If it took a long time coming back then it must have been pretty bad and more compensation is due.  

 The person either owns the pain, or is controlled by it.  All that is a stretch to even contemplate let alone make a difference with therapeutically, using conversation, mostly listening it may seem to some but observation as well.  Reflecting back to the person who is opening up.  Hard to standardize this process, it is as varied as there are individuals.  In fact such interactions are also at large within every persons experience, in net work with family and friends and coworkers.  The interaction of a patient in pain within himself may be determined by the expectations and encouragement of those around him.  An atmosphere that is prorecovery, sometimes shaming into recovery as might be seen as a chiding yet supportive band or brothers helping you through.  These factors must be enlisted in order to overcome what seem otherwise to be the forgone conclusion that the second patient will do poorly.  Knowing this in advance and preparing for the difficulty, may hopefully result in a better than expected outcome.  

Pain assessment on a chronic basis has a larger overall cost impact than does the management of acute pain.  The question remains as to whether the latter influences the former.  As with acute pain, the empirical description would be defined by one who takes medication to control pain.  One who appears to avoid certain activities because they are painful.  One who is weakened or dysfunctional due to pain.  One who has atrophy of disuse or skin changes associated with maximal contact avoidance.  Sweat pattern, and other vasomotor manifestation would also be included in the empirical description of chronic pain. So when is a patient who is still in pain to be encouraged or compelled to resume unrestricted work. 

 Is the pain being managed in a fashion compatible with work.   Narcotics dependency is a handicap which cannot be accommodated safely in the work place, where the actions or inaction of one may lead to injury of another.    So societal norms and obligations become central to the question of pain management in the chronic phase.  What benefit has been agreed to.  A job will be provided which I can do with no experience of pain.  Is there a level of pain experienced on the job which is considered allowable.  Are some jobs inherently associated with somatic pain.  Pain that resolves, in which case how reliably and how fully?  Is there a normative value that can be ascribed to an allowable standard for break in pain.  Is it possible to adjust the pain threshold through conditioning.  Does an employer have a right to expect fitness from a worker, sleep yes, nutritional balance maybe not.  What of smoking?  Currently no expectation that a worker will observe a program of strength or endurance training like an athlete.  But when the patient is recovering from a procedure from a covered injury or malady is it appropriate that employer may expect diet and exercise compliance beyond the norm for an uninjured employee.  At any given time what percentage of a corporate work force has an affliction under care?  What percentage of the current and retired work force is in that category?  

What is the usefulness of a pain log.  This would consist of two daily entries.  The morning entry would describe the events of the evening and night.  The evening entry would describe the events of the day.  The AM entry would include Pain, Restfulness and success of sleep, and evening emotive communication, anxiety, depression, TV watching, isolation.  The evening entry would describe pain episodes or severity over the course of the day of pain.  Secondly, the level of energy fatigue and stiffness over the course of the day.  Thirdly, emotive communication, how much Driving, Sitting, Walking or other exercise.  So with the benefit of a months log one might have the ability to make a comment about the persons chronic pain state.  Such a detailed set of information even if imperfectly recorded could improve decision making with regard to intervention.  

Problematic patterns in the log would include negative emotive communications in both AM and PM.  No social interaction in the AM log.  No positive feedback on performance or tangible accomplishment, jobs or tasks completed,   
High levels of financial anxiety. Lack of restful sleep.  Any number of patterns may be noted and each might call for a different therapeutic response.  

The hospital record is not unlike a series of ships logs.  The rather uneventful observation of wind sea state and ships encountered. In the hospital record is reams of data regarding vital signs, laboratory data. There is the maintenance log which in the hospital record would be surgeries and procedures, separately dictated, entries concerning the planning for the preparation for the decision to proceed with one or another course of action, a change in course which in a ships log would be recorded in the smooth log.  There is no directly corresponding document to a captains log.  It is something held privately and only sourced in the event of calamity.  So the medical record is largely tabular and smooth ships logs, and maintenance log.  We generally do not have a similar document for outpatient and aftercare. The office record has features which mirror the hospital record, similarly bland entries regarding progress and how things are going.  then in the smooth log the occasional untoward unexpected event.  Again we see the suppression of any tendency to make a captains log.  No running commentary of thoughts about a patient worries, conflicts.  These are absent from the record largely out of concern for potential litigation.  At the same time certain entries seem to anticipate the potential for negative scrutiny after the fact.  So the chart over the last 40 years has changed quite a bit.  The log on a ship is alive and well, still recommended practice and usually ignored.  

The reason to maintain a log in each case is that there is danger, it is possible to lose ones way and something of value life or ship could be lost in the process.  Both exist because a person is needing to get from point a to point b.  No one is in the hospital for an adventure.  For adventure travel the log becomes more a journal.  On a passage it is about safety.  Keeping a record allows for the noting of trends.  Trends are empirical confirmation of improvement.  Empirical confirmation conveyed to the patient is the stuff of psychological healing.  The perpetuation of pain being linked to the expectation of a protracted or eternal pain experience, a known negative prognostic indicator when encountered and best met with objective verification of improvement.

Is the Blender version better than the current template (and so we should update and improve this template)?
Or is the Blender version worse than the current template (and so we should replace the version in the Blender book with a {{tl|stages}} template reference)?

:What is the extra icon supposed to mean?  The explanation of it needs to be clearer (whether it's there or here).  It's being used sometimes by itself, sometimes in conjunction with one of the percent icons; so apparently it isn't being understood as &quot;less than zero&quot;, although that's its position in the key.  I doubt that it's useful, but it's hard to judge until I know what it's supposed to be used ''for''.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:46, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Plan Formulation Policy==  
:&quot;It is fundamental to the ([[Water Resources Directory/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|USACE]]) planning process to investigate the full range of solutions to problems, and to develop comprehensive solutions to problems.&quot; [http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/iwr/planningcapabilities/docs/planform/m1.ppt#261,11,Current Policy]  

== Plan Formulation Methods ==

A [http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/waterresources/plan/catmgmtmeasures.cfm Catalog of Potential Solutions] to consider in formulating the composite plan has been developed by the Institute for Water Resources.

== Plan Formulation Criteria ==

::Completeness - &quot;the extent to which an alternative plan provides and accounts for all necessary investments and other actions to ensure the realization of all planned effects.&quot; [http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/iwr/planningcapabilities/docs/planform/g2.ppt]
::Effectiveness - &quot;the extent to which an alternative plan alleviates the specified problems and acheives the specified opportunities, as specified in the planning objectives.&quot;[http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/iwr/planningcapabilities/docs/planform/g2.ppt]
::Efficiency - &quot;the extent to which an alternative plan is the most cost effective means of alleviating the specified problems and realizing the specified opportunities as established in the planning objectives, consistent with protecting the nation's environment.&quot;[http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/iwr/planningcapabilities/docs/planform/g2.ppt] 
::Acceptability - &quot;the workability and viability of the alternative plan with respect to acceptance by state and local entities and the public and compatibility with existing laws, regulations and public policies.&quot;[http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/iwr/planningcapabilities/docs/planform/g2.ppt]

== Plan Designations ==
This is a list of the types of plans identified in the federal (USA) legislation indicated [http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/iwr/planningcapabilities/docs/planform/g2.ppt#337,63,Plan Designations].

*NED Plan - national economic development plan (P&amp;G)
*NER Plan - National ecosystem restoration plan
*NED/NER Plan
*LPP - locally preferred plan
*LEDPA Plan - least environmentally damaging practicable alternative plan (US Clean Water Act)
*Non-structural Plan (WRDA 86)
*Reasonable &amp; Prudent Alternative (ESA)
*Environmentally Preferred Plan (NEPA)
*No Action Plan (NEPA)

== Plan Cost Allocation and Apportionment ==
The plan formulation includes the specification of &quot;who implements what&quot; and &quot;who pays for what&quot;.
The preferred [[Water Resources Directory/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|USACE]] method of cost allocation is SCRB (separable cost-remaining benefits), adopted by interagency agreement (March, 1954) and reaffirmed by [[Water Resources Directory/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers/ER 1105-2-100]]. (SCRB [http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/iwr/planningcapabilities/docs/planform/m3.ppt#284,16,SCRB Method])
&quot;Cost allocation is the process of equitably distributing project costs among the project purposes.&quot; [http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/iwr/planningcapabilities/docs/planform/m3.ppt#307,20,Review of Definitions]

This template is named ''solution'' with the first argument being the ''Title'' and the second argument being the ''Text''.

== Examples ==
Let's say the problem is '''1) 2x=4, solve for x.''' 

In this example, the problem is called '''Problem One: Solution''' and the text is the solution to the problem. Make sure to put arguments in quotes.

  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{solution|title=&quot;Problem One: Solution&quot;|text=&quot;Divide both sides by 2 to get x=2&quot;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This produces: {{solution|title=&quot;Problem One: Solution&quot;|text=&quot;Divide both sides by 2 to get x=2&quot;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Interpersonal Intelligence

Gardner’s Definition:
Interpersonal intelligence, (people smart) is understanding other people.  It’s an ability we all need, but is at a premium if you are a teacher, clinician, salesperson, or a politician.  Anybody who deals with other people has to be skilled in the interpersonal sphere.
http://www.chariho.k12.ri.us/curriculum/MISmart/inter.htm
People have the physical ability to exist individually and alone, we are also social animals who thrive and grow when involved with others. This ability to interact with others, understand them, and interpret their behaviour known as interpersonal intelligence.  A well-developed interpersonal intelligence plays a substantial role in such success. From a psychological and neurological point of view, the connection between interpersonal intelligence and the brain has been explored for generations; damage the frontal lobe, as was once done in the case of lobotomy patients, and you damage that person's personality and her ability to interact well with others. Interpersonal intelligence allows us to affect others by understanding others; without it, we lose the ability to exist socially.  It is recognised that those who have highly developed interpersonal intelligence are successful leader’s bosses.  They been seen be strong public speakers and may follow a career as a Military Officers for example.
Someone with strong interpersonal intelligence will probably have a lot of friends, they will show a great deal of empathy for other people and exhibit a deep understanding of other points of view.  They love team activities of all kinds and are a good team member – tending to pull there “own weight” in a team task.  Often found to sensitive to other people’s feelings and ideas.   In a discussion are likely to be skilled at drawing others out in a discussion.  People with strong interpersonal are also probably skilled in conflict resolution, mediation and finding a compromise when people are in radical opposition to each other.
Martin Luther King, Franklin Roosevelt and Norman Schwartzkopf are famous examples of successful people with interpersonal intelligence.
Characteristics include:
•	People come to me for advice 
•	Prefer group sports 
•	Seek out people when I have a problem for advice 
•	Likes games like monopoly rather than solitaire 
•	Enjoy teaching others what I know 
•	Considers oneself to be a leader 
•	Enjoys crowds 
•	Rather be at a noisy party than stay at home

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauces|Sauces]]

This is a basic tartar sauce, suitable for fish and chips. The recipe is largely based on a trial and error recreation of the tartar sauce used at a local restaurant I frequent.

==Ingredients==
* 10 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (280g) [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]&lt;!-- (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) --&gt;
* 2 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ounces (65ml) [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
* 2 ounces (55ml) [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
* 2 ounces (55ml) relish
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Garlic Salt|garlic salt]]
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; teaspoon celery salt

==Procedure==
# I suggest placing the [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] in the mixing bowl first, and whipping it until it's smooth.
# Mix in the other ingredients

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* I've found that using pickle juice (and lowering the amount of relish) is often better. This is especially true if you plan on using this in a squeeze bottle (as the relish can block the opening if it's too thick/chunky).

      <comment>Corrected the range for 10 bit - changed from 0.675 (wrong) to 0.625 (right)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">It may of interest to some in the group that I've achieved and measured 10-bit color resolution with the OSX PTB 1.0.6.

&lt;H2&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/H2&gt;
At issue is whether 10-bit color resolution can be achieved with the OSX PTB 1.0.6 and video cards sporting 10-bit DACs. Even if the hardware supports 10-bit depth, it has remained unclear whether the software pipeline (video card drivers, OpenGL, PTB, etc.) would truncate double-precision Matlab pixel values at the 8-bit (256 colors) or 10-bit (1024 colors) level. Although 8-bit artifacts can sometimes be determined by visually inspecting the display, the best test is to take a photometer to the screen and make measurements. [NOTE: an even easier way is to send the video card outputs though a splitter and look at the voltages produced on an oscilloscope - ABM].

&lt;H2&gt;HARDWARE&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power Mac G5 Dual 2.7 GHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 GB DDR SDRAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATI Radeon® X800 XT Mac Edition (has 10-bit DACs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iiyama HM204DT &quot;Vision Master 514&quot; 22&quot; color monitor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minolta LS-110 Hand-held Photometers + tripod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;SOFTWARE&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSX 10.4.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matlab 7.0.4 for Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSX Psychtoolbox 1.0.6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;H2&gt;IMAGE-MATRIX VALUES VS. LUT VALUES&lt;/H2&gt;
Critically, as outlined by Mario Kleiner, 10-bit values with the PTB 1.0.6 can only be obtained by manipulating * values * inside the look-up table (LUT). To illustrate this point, suppose you want to display a 50%-contrast grating. The wrong way to do it is to define a 50%-contrast image matrix in Matlab:

127.5 * (1 + 0.5 * grating)

and display that image using a normalized LUT that spans the full 0.0 to 1.0 range of
values. This inevitably result in less-than-10-bit quantization.

The right way (or at least the 10-bit way) to do it is to produce a nominally full-contrast grating:

127.5 * (1 + 1.0 * grating)

in the Matlab image matrix but display the image using a normalized LUT whose values only span the .25 to .75 range [NOTE: this would enable access a range defined by 9-bits ... for 10 bit range, the limits are 0.375 to 0.625 - ABM]. Unfortunately, LUTs in the PTB only have 256 slots, and so you must choose 256 values out of the 1024 available. This limitation can be problematic in cases where you need to display, say, a very low contrast pattern next to a very high contrast one.

&lt;H2&gt;MATLAB SCRIPT&lt;/H2&gt;
Here's the Matlab script I've used to measure luminance:
&lt;pre&gt;
% --------------------------------------
function Test10Bits

     p.screenNumber = max(Screen('Screens'));
     AssertOpenGL;
     Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1);

     masterGammaTable = ones(256, 3);

     windowPtr = Screen('OpenWindow', p.screenNumber, 255, [], 32, 2);
     Screen('LoadNormalizedGammaTable', windowPtr, masterGammaTable);

     Screen('FillRect', windowPtr, 0);
     Screen('Flip', windowPtr);

     while 1==1
         volts = input('Normalized Voltage Value (0-1): ');
         thisGammaTable = volts * masterGammaTable;
         Screen('LoadNormalizedGammaTable', windowPtr, thisGammaTable);
     end

     Screen('CloseAll');

end
% --------------------------------------
&lt;/pre&gt;
Valid entries into a normalized LUT are bounded between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusively. In a 8-bit system, the 0.0 to 1.0 range is divided in 256 possible values, each value corresponding to a 0.00392 increment over the previous value. In a 10-bit systems, the 0.0 to 1.0 range is divided in 1024 values, each value corresponding to a 0.00098 increment over the previous value. Therefore, if you step through the 0.0 to 1.0 range in increments of 0.001, a 10-bit system would increase luminance on every step whereas an 8-bit system would increase luminance on every fourth (sometimes third) step.

&lt;H2&gt;PHOTOMETER MEASUREMENTS&lt;/H2&gt;
Measurement precision varies depending on photometer setup. In my case, it was important to put the photometer on a tripod (rather than using it handheld) and set it to a long integration period to average out the noise and get reliable readings. Photometer precision also varies with the range of luminances being measured (e.g. my photometer goes from two to one decimal point when it goes above 100 cd/m^2 ). Long story short, continuous photometer readings jumped noticeably on every 0.001 LUT increment I tested, and this indicates that my display has 10-bit precision.

Hope this helps.

Cheers

Stéphane

20:05 &lt; xorian&gt; kowey: The current version of that stops right about where my understanding does.  The merger/conflictor depedns on the othertwo conflicting patches yet cancels them out... somehow.  And the patch resolving the conflict is made relative to.... this weird intermediate state that the merger/conflictor creates.

== Discussion ==

== Notepad ==

* Key insight about darcs - darcs thinks in a straight line, whereas human think in terms of graph dependencies.  The graphs get projected on the line.   Useful for explaining for example, what the third resolution patch depends on. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 16:50, 4 March 2006 (UTC)
* There isn't really any difference between a dependency and a conflict... is there?  Seems like a conflict is a just a dependency without nice contexts, but this is a very vague intuition -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 00:54, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

The &lt;math&gt;F_{X}(x) \rightarrow (cdf)\,&lt;/math&gt;, represents the probability that the value of a random variable &lt;math&gt;X\,&lt;/math&gt;, regardless of its distribution, will be less than or equal to the value &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; that is provided.  For continuous random variables, &lt;math&gt;F_{X}(0) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;P(X = 0) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt; for all continuous random variables.  Therefore, all cumulative distribution functions will start at zero.
&lt;br&gt;
Generally, &lt;math&gt;F_{X}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; represents &lt;math&gt;P(X \leq x)\,&lt;/math&gt;, however, if what is desired is &lt;math&gt;P(X &gt; x)\,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;1 - F_{X}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; would be used.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Exponential distribution cdf.png|325px|Cumulative distribution function]]
&lt;br&gt;
Notice that as &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; increases, the probability nears closer and closer to one.  This is because as &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; increases, the area under the curve of the PDF becomes closer and closer to one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The probability density function, &lt;math&gt;f_{X}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;, represents the distribution of the random variable &lt;math&gt;X\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Wikipedia defines the PDF as a smoothed out version of the random variable's histogram of its distribution.  Basically, the larger the value of &lt;math&gt;f_{X}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; for a specific value &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; means the more often that value &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; will appear when choosing a random variable of its type of distribution.

The total area under the curve formed by &lt;math&gt;f_{X}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; will always be one, since that total area represents the probability that the random variable &lt;math&gt;X\,&lt;/math&gt; will '''be''' a value.

[[Image:Exponential distribution pdf.png|325px|Probability density function]]

One way to calculate the PDF is to differentiate its CDF, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta}{\delta x}F_{X}(x) = f_{X}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Henry VII established the Tudor dynasty by defeating Richard III, a Yorkist, at the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. During his reign, Henry had to overcome threats to the stability of the English throne. Several pretenders, perhaps most notably Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel both wanted Henry removed from the throne, however Henry overcame these threats. Later, Henry passed many acts, for example acts against enclosure and the prohibition of Liveries.

Henry's son, Henry VIII succeeded him to the throne in 1509 following his death.

You've probably heard this before, but excellent job on creating PDFs for Wikibooks. The [[C Sharp Programming|C#]] one you just posted is awesome. I'll be looking forward to a print version of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] in the near future once we finalize a few things there. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:41, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

== Write yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours PDF ==

Impressive! Judging from the typesetting, you seem to have converted it to LaTeX.  Do you have a way of automating this?  If not, I'm hoping that someday, somebody gets around to writing a mediawiki parser for Pandoc -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:20, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

: I converted a few simple tags automatically (sorry, in Java :P), but went through the document and did the rest manually. The LaTeX is [[Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours/LaTeX|here]]. I was learning LaTeX while working on it, so please correct any mistakes you might find. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 13:36, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

Hi,

You evidently produced a PDF of my Unilingua wikibook.  Any chance you could do it again, because I have made very extensive revisions over the past year.  Thanks.

== BIG contribution to French Textbook ==

Hello, Greetings from the OLPC project.  I have a French professor from Slovenia with an online coursebook of Year One French (as a Foreign Language) that he would like to donate to the OLPC project.  Wikibooks is of course, the best place for this sort of content.  

You seem to have structured a great deal of the planning of the French textbook, would you like to help me structure the wikification?  I haven't ever fed a book to wikibooks before, and I'm curious as to the care and handling of such a beast.  [[User:Sethwoodworth|Sethwoodworth]] 22:00, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

: Sure, I'll be glad to help! Where's the textbook located now? --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 23:02, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

Dear Hagindaz,

I saw you great file for making from wikibooks a nice pdf.
Do you have a more clear description on how to do it?
I'm rewriting the Kicad EDA book for myself and the project. I did it in first instance in LaTeX markup, but this was no success to converting it to other files.

Thanks in advice,

== javalatex: usage and spanish ==

Hi, I downloaded your javalatex program and I have been trying to use it. Actually I can convert single files to latex format (it is great!!!), but I just have not been able to convert a whole book. ¿could you send me the instructions please (ogduartev at gmail.com). 

I can not figure out how javalatex takes the whole book ¿does it read the mysql database? if it does, I suppose I have to configure the database host, name and password. ¿does it read the web server wher the wikimedia software runs? if it does, I supposse I have to configure the http address.

¿do you need any kind of help for an spanish realese? I could help...

thanks in advance for your answer

Why do you propose changes in such a complicated way, why don't you just edit [[English in Use/Orthography]]?

[[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 11:07, 5 September 2009 (UTC)

==Thanks==
I know how hard finding references can be.  That was a very nice text you found and I spent the day reading a bit of it. Even though I didn't necessarily agree about how this book related to the happiness book your doing really good work.  So I just wanted to say well done.  In fact maybe you should skip my first comment today at the RfD and see my second. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:46, 17 June 2010 (UTC)

==&quot;Supplementary&quot; sections in French book==
I am a bit puzzled by the intention behind some of the supplementary sections in the French book. I can see how vocabulary could be optional, but I don't quite see how this applies to grammar. Were you thinking that the grammar sections you marked as supplementary had been included too early in the book, or perhaps should only be attempted by gifted students? I have seen books designed for mixed ability classes where this is done, but it would seem to make writing the book even more difficult than it is already. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:51, 30 November 2010 (UTC)
: It's for things like content that would come up again later, content that readers would naturally pick up, or minutia of the language like uncommon verbs. Another use is repetition: a topic might be introduced in a supplementary section, used in example sentences over several lessons, then covered in a review section. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:32, 22 February 2011 (UTC)
::Well, I guess that would work as an indication to the reader, but while we are writing the book I think it groups too many different cases together. e.g. if a topic only appears once like '''Demonstrative adjectives''' in [[French/Lessons/Description]], '''Le faire causatif''' in [[French/Lessons/The_house]] or '''Geography prepositions''' in [[French/Lessons/Vacations]] but is marked as supplementary, what tells an author that it should be added to another lesson elsewhere in the book and not treated as &quot;minutia&quot; or something to be picked up naturally? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 22:18, 22 February 2011 (UTC)
::: Ideally a well-developed set of lesson plans would be written so that lessons are consistent and work well together. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 18:33, 26 February 2011 (UTC)
::::Yes, that would be nice to have and I think the [[W:Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages| Common European Framework]] could provide a suitable starting point. I have the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject_Languages/French_language_task_force#Printed_Reference_Books|reference books]] for levels A1 and A2, which give you inventories of grammar, vocabulary and phrase templates appropriate for each level, without specifying any detailed lesson plan. I am just starting to study these books, in conjunction with the British specifications for French at secondary school level, but it will probably take quite some time before I could produce anything that might qualify as a &quot;well-developed set of lesson plans&quot;. In the meanwhile, I think it would be useful for you to justify particular &quot;supplementary&quot; labels in the talk pages of the lessons involved and/or in the &quot;Supplementary / review&quot; column of the [[French/Project/Book_overview|overview table]] that I put together recently. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 22:12, 27 February 2011 (UTC)
::::: Sure; feel free to remove the labels as well. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 16:49, 28 February 2011 (UTC)

== PDF Generator ==
Hey,
I read that you are trying to create PDF Version using Latex. I also do so for quite a while. I wrote a compiler that parses the mediawiki sourcetext into a parsetree and converts it into a latex sourcetext. I started on the german wikibooks only, and recently added some support for general mediawiki projects too. As a first demonstration of the technology I compiled the English book on Java programming this morning. The result is available here:

[[File:Java Programming.pdf]]

A Windows version of the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/wb2pdf/ compiler] is freely available from sourceforge. You can play with it a bit. But please use only single pages and don't use whole books since the inclusion mechanism is not yet correct in the current release.

There are also much more elaborate examples for pdf versions of german wikibooks already: [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physikalische_Grundlagen_der_Nuklearmedizin], [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Praktikum_Anorganische_Chemie]

: Thanks, it looks good. I'll try it out. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 16:33, 18 March 2011 (UTC)

Hey,
I finally managed to upload a new version of the generator. You can run it on whole books now. I also did one more book.

[[File:HaskellTest.pdf]]

Now you can point the generator to either the Haskell book or the Java book and it will produce the pdfs linked above. I also ran it on [[This Quantum World/print version]] and it produces a quite good result, although I did not modify the wiki or the generator for that. SO happy LaTeXing

      <text xml:space="preserve">== New Wikibooks and especially New Wikibookians ==

I feel that it is incredibly disruptive to the effort of trying to create a new Wikibook to have suddenly a VfD slapped on you within hours of when you start the content.  Generally this is done for reasons other than legitimate policy reasons to remove the content, and my experience is that they have a rather poor outcome as well.  (i.e. a large majority of pages that have this occur survive the VfD anyway).

One Wikibook that I started writing myself had a VfD slapped on it and totally stopped the train of thought I had going into developing it in the first place.  It also took over two weeks to fight the VfD, by which at that time the book fell off the bottom of the &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; list and stopped (IMHO) a bunch of people contributing to the book while it was at an early stage.  It did survive the VfD, but I'm still sort of pissed at the user who threw up the VfD.

Books are very hard to write, and you are obviously not trying to write random gibberish or experimenting with writing in Wiki markup techniques (both reasons to delete content immediately).  There are administrators (obviously) who don't agree with me on this point, and I've even had a row with Jimbo himself over this principle.  When discussed objectively and rationally away from a specific page, however, it seems like a reasonable policy.  If even content that is a blatant copyright violation is left for a couple of weeks, what real harm has occured?  This is to first assume good faith, and try to work with the user to perhaps put content where it belongs.  

Most recently I helped move a major effort to translate a medical textbook from English to Hatian Creole, and helped them to set up their own independent Wikisource project in Hatian Creole... up until now there was no original source material in that language.  Had I started with a VfD and would have been confrontational instead of cooperative, this content would not have even been available for Wikimedia projects.  And the translation is now available as GFDL'd text! (the original english version too, BTW).  Instead I worked directly with the authors that were adding the content in the first place and made a few e-mail messages to try and explain policies calmly without trying to be too harsh.  Unfortunately, that also takes quite a bit more time to do.

I hope your project works out, and BTW, '''Welcome to Wikibooks'''.  I hope you find success with your ideas here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:16, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

==Wikiversity==

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 22:37, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

== Templates, etc. ==

There are no general template standards for Wikibooks, and from my experience the use of templates is actually increasing due to people with more maturity using the MediaWiki software are adding content on Wikibooks now.  Perhaps the extent of the use of templates needs to be addressed, but there is no pressing need for that right now.

One standard you ought to consider is that any templates that are specific for a single Wikibook ought to use the &quot;namespace&quot; of that Wikibook as well.  For example, a Wikibook named [[Being a Real Estate Agent]] would have a template named [[:Template:Being a Real Estate Agent/Navigation]] or something similar.  This is also followed, BTW, on Wikisource as well for similar kinds of projects or &quot;books&quot;.  Deletion or removal of templates of this nature is IMHO tantamount to vandalism unless you have the general concensus of the individuals who are organizing and writing the Wikibook, and the decision to use or not use a template in this nature is a personal preference or style.  With Wikipedia being technically a single book, it could be argued to standardize things of that nature over there.  Here it is just simply inappropriate to demand such rigid standardization.  

Re: Title of your Wikibook.  There is a small group that are hyper mergists of content here on Wikibooks, with a noted example of two different C++ programming books that were merged together (haphazardly) into one book instead.  With this there is a tendancy to not go for flamboyant names like you suggested, but there is no policy about this nor is this (from my viewpoint) strictly necessary either.  My own attitude on this is if you can find a title like this in a public library, you should be able to use a similar title here on Wikibooks for a book.  In book publishing circles (not just here on Wikibooks) there is a tendancy to have simple names for books when possible, which is a significant difference if you compare historical titles of books from say the 18th Century and earlier, where book titles were '''very''' wordy.  If you use a more &quot;exotic&quot; title, just be prepared to defend the title in the disucssion pages of the book, and somebody simply renaming a book ''' 'cause it is awful sounding''' is a form of vandalism as well and unwelcome, particularly if they are not participating in the development of the content.  Otherwise, '''be creative'' and have some fun here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:45, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

===Redirects===

There is no current redirect policy of any sort, although some redirects have been deleted recently.  Doing page moves tends to create a whole bunch of redirects (MediaWiki software) and few of those are used much afterward, especially if it is a sub-module that was moved and all of the links have been adjusted within the Wikibook.  Don't try to get into an edit war over redirects, but if you find a redirect being deleted, try to find out who removed it and attempt to work out a compromise with that admin.  I personally think that too many are being deleted at the moment, but they are also very easy to recreate if necessary.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:21, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

== Speedy deletion ==

Hi. I deleted your &quot;Being a Real Estate Agent&quot; module. You sent it to [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] and wrote, &quot;I've renamed this elsewhere. Back on Wikipedia, we would have just CSDed this, but here? No clue.&quot;

Yes, the book is a &quot;candidate for speedy deletion&quot;. When you want to delete something, and it does not need a vote, use &lt;code&gt;{{tl1|delete|''your reason here''}}&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;{{tl|vfd}}&lt;/code&gt;. You can learn more about deletions by reading '''[[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]'''. As it is, I have no clue about how to delete Wikipedia pages... --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:02, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

== Cabalism on Wikipedia ==

Karmafist, as Wikibooks does not allow either original research or propaganda, I have deleted this book, which I see is in its original stages. May I suggest you look at [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]], as I am concerned that you have some misconceptions about this wiki. Hopefully you will find another home for it. If it would help, I am prepared either to email you the content of the deleted pages, or temporarily undelete them for a week to give you time to copy the text for your own records. Just leave a note on my talk page if this is the case. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 22:50, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

:I'd like to note, for your sake, that if you think this decision to remove this content was in error, you are welcome to add a request to undelete this content here: [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]]

:I happen to agree with Jguk on the reasons for deleting this content, but no person (or even a group of people) is necessarily correct.  Any and all decisions by administrators do have avenues to appeal what occurs, and don't get intimidated by what is going on here.  You also have the opportunity to express your opinion on [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] if you want to scream at the general Wikibooks community.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:44, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

*I'd seen you around WikiP, and it's ironic that I've got to add this seeing the preceding two posts! OTOH, what the hell, I navigated here as I recognized the user name on R Hornings page. I guess you could say you've just been spammed below, but I suspect (and think I recollect) we have some similar takes on things.
*I never got to my WikiWork today as I browsed through the staff lounge and saw a familiar theme from various wikipedia archives, this time, in time to make [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#A_Quasi-Veteren_Perspective_.28from_WikiP.29 a timely contribution].
*I'm also going to take the liberty of posting the link to your manifesto for these folks, as I'll probably sign on soon. Clearly something needs to be done. My thoughts are a bit less revolutionary, and more evolutionary, but the two are mutually reinforcing.   [[User:Fabartus|Fabartus]]//&amp;#91;&amp;#91;&amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;green&amp;quot;&amp;gt;User talk:Fabartus&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;]] 21:47, 8 April 2006 (UTC) (I wish I knew how to fix this sig here!)

----
Karmafist, I think that &quot;Cabalism at Wikipedia&quot; sounds like something you could start at http://meta.wikimedia.org, a wiki filled with meta content about Wikimedia projects, including pages critical of Wikipedia, such as my recent [[m:Enwikipediathink]] page. You might also want to read or edit [[Wikinfo:Critical views of Wikipedia]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:35, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are three primary '''types of pianos''': Grand, Upright, and Electronic. These types are often resized and combined to incarnate other styles, such as the &quot;Electric Baby Grand Piano&quot;, &quot;Electric Upright Pianos&quot;, and &quot;Baby Grand Piano&quot;.

==Grand==

The largest piano type, and frequently the most majestic (as well as expensive). Grand Pianos are categorized by horizontal soundboards sometimes stretching up to 4 ft. (front to back). The Soundboard is encased in a supportable opening platform that lifts on the left in a upwards direction. Dampers lie on top of the strings, adjacent to the hammers (also horizontal). The internal construction is braced with form-holders, usually made of wood, as well as the small equipped metal reinforcements. Essentially the casing is &quot;bottomless&quot; allowing one to see the soundboard support base, also of reinforced wood, which technically acts as the base. Keys consist of wood coated in ivory, or sometimes pure ivory, depending on the piano's manufacturers and classification. The grand piano has the standard 88 keys. Most of these pianos have sheet music piece platforms. A retractable cover slides over, or folds down on the keys.

===Baby Grand===
The Baby Grand piano, as the name implies, is essentially a smaller version of the regular grand piano. It has an 88-key set up, just like the regular grand does, but generally has a smaller soundboard and thus is not as loud as the regular grand.

==Upright==
[[Image:pianodroit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Upright piano]]
The most common piano, a popular addition to a living room or a parlor. The Upright piano has been a favorite because it costs less, it is more compact and offers a warm sound. The soundboard is vertical, strings and dampers stretching downward, hammers and dampers horizontal to the board. Since the hammers strike outward or horizontally, they take slightly longer to return to resting position than the hammers of a grand (which strike vertically). The support base of the soundboard as well as wooden reinforcements are visible on the backside. Uprights usually cost less, depending on the model, however some can exceed grands in total value. Although uprights often get depicted as inferior to the grand pianos, a five-foot upright can rival a typical grand in terms of tone quality and loudness. Essentially the keyboard is the same and like the grand, varies in material construction.

==Electric==

Good for beginners or moving performers, Electric Pianos are usually the most affordable, and although they do not have the qualities of an acoustic, sound continues to improve for the high-end and mid-range instruments. They vary greatly in quality, some have hollow keys, while others try to replicate the feel and weight of acoustic keyboards. In addition to the features of an accoustic piano, electric pianos have a variety of sounds and settings such as organ, guitar, string, choir, and percussion. The numerous sounds on some keyboards make it virtually a portable band. Other pianos have limited functions, but this is better for someone who is trying to replicate an acoustic and save money. True electric pianos (compared to the plain keyboards) have a professional appearance and good materials (most consist largely of plastic), as well as touch sensitive features and sometimes equipped frames. Most have connectors for pedals and computer interactive abilities. They never need to be tuned, and rapidly becoming more popular in modern bands. The electric piano also has the advantage of allowing the user to practice silently with headphones at times when doing so would otherwise disturb people. The few drawbacks are technological infancy and power supply.

==Cover / Main Page Discussion==
All images (flags and view of Montréal) come from the french Wikipédia. I converted flags in PNG format and the photo in JPG. I also resized the flags of Belgium and Luxembourg. The comment of the photo come also from fr:. [[User:Traroth|Traroth]] 11:55, 11 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I feel the flags don't look really professional. Some of them don't load up for me and it scrolls the &quot;contents&quot; link off the bottom of the page. May I suggest a map of the world with the French-speaking countries highlighted and named? That would better show the scope and worldwide utility of French.

Areas with French as the only language (ex. France) would be darkest, while places like Quebec with two official languages would be lighter, and so on (3-4 shades) to show the level of influence.

--[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 02:57, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:French in Quebec has just as much, if not more influence than in France though. --[[User:JulieADriver|JulieADriver]] 02:59, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

===Other languages and French articles===

The Greek section should be moved to the Greek Wikibooks server, as this is the English Wikibooks server. --[[User:JulieADriver|JulieADriver]] 02:59, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

===picture===

Well, description of the picture could be written in English ;p

:Done. --[[User:JulieADriver|JulieADriver]] 02:54, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

===Flags===

Can the flags be made to all be the same width?

==Contents Page Discussion==

===French navigating===

Hi, I'm wondering if it is a good idea to add the french equivalents to all the titles, such as Lesson/Leçon? I am going to proceed on pages that I have already worked on, please comment otherwise. [[User:Jonojet|Jonojet]]

== Pronouncation ==

It would be absolutely wonderful if there were a guide to pronouncation accompanying each example. Perhaps also a chapter mentioning some basic pronouncation rules. I know that it isn't grammar but it is IMHO inevitable when learning a new language.

:A native speaker speaking here. I agree considerably: a guide to orthography and pronunciation is sorely missing (how are English speakers to know the difference between ''patte'' et ''pâte'', or how to pronounce /y/ and /2/ ?) [[User:Circeus|Circeus]] 21:07, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

As a French student, I have to say I feel a bit let-down by this book...it really just reminds me more of a brief overview of grammar, as opposed to anything that could be considered a real book...

===Pronounciation===

Please provide a pronounciation guide for beginners, else I might be bold and provide one. E.g. J' habite a Paris =&gt; zshabi to pari., Je m' appelle John.=&gt; zhu mapel john. Thanks.--[[User:Jondel|Jondel]] 09:27, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

Well, there should be explained pronuncation of french letters, or letter sequences.. sblive, 3 Oct 2004

Sorry if I sound so inquisitive, my French is horrible and I want to fix it properly :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:03, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)

==General Requests and Improvement Ideas==

Shouldn't this be called something different? Isn't this more a &quot;travel guide&quot; sort of thing? Is there going to be a more systematic French tutorial coming?

===Standardisation (UK)/Standardization (US)===

Hi, I was editing some lessons when I came across a subtlety in standardization, and it's not about how &quot;standardisation&quot; is supposed to be spelt. In many french textbooks written in english, any example of something in french is often written in italics. Perhaps we could adopt this practise as well? That would mean that it would be better to place emphasis in bold. Comments?[[User:Jonojet|Jonojet]]

and lots more!

===Some music===

I think that can be a nice idea to add some &quot;music&quot;, for example: the song used by the children to learn alphabet... And other song too... It's could seem &quot;stupid&quot; for adults but this &quot;simple&quot; songs &quot;for children&quot; can help to learn a foreign language... (Sorry for English mistakes, im French :P)

I have a few CDs of french lessons and some highschool exercises, I might flip through them and add the important stuff, of course with a list of the source. [[User:OMouse|OMouse]] 1 Apr 2005

=== Vote for Restructure ===

I think it's really necessary that this book is structurally changed so that we can go more indepth and create a really meaningful resource for teaching this great language. Thereby I propose we re-structure the course element of this book, using the great, already written materials plus adding new ones. The proposed new structure (please feel free to comment, add or change) is at
[[User:Serge/French|Proposal for a Restructure of French Wikibook]]. Please have a look and then comment, or, if necessary, we can vote.

==Lessons Discussion==
Well according to the main page, looks like we should use the [[Foreign language textbook template]] which is referencing the Spanish textbook as example. I just took it's chapter organisation for the french textbook :p -- [[User:Hashar|Hashar]] 13:01, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:Perhaps there is a better organization than the Spanish one. We could start with these guidelines:
:# Don't use any vocabulary/grammar that hasn't been explained yet
:# Teach a useful topic each lesson
:# Don't make any lesson just grammar -- have a mixture of grammar, vocabulary, and examples.

:Then we could have a spiral model where each lesson builds on the one before. For example, telling whether someone is late depends on the skills of asking questions, negative statements, and telling the time; telling the time depends on knowing numbers; knowing numbers depends on knowing what ''et'' means. As another example, perhaps the first lesson could introduce ''je'' and ''vous'', a later lesson introduce ''tu'', ''il'', and ''elle'', a later lesson introduce ''on'', and so on. -- [[User:Mpt|Mpt]] 01:37, 1 Apr 2004 (UTC)

What is the aim of lesson 13 ? What do you want inside ? [[User:Traroth|Traroth]] 15:53, 18 Nov 2003 (UTC)

===We must create exercises, we must not muck up the audio file matching===

What is lacking here is practice exercises. I think there should be enough exercises ideally to have one new exercise page for every lesson page. 

When we edit and change, everybody be careful not to make the french different from the audio file whenever possible. Add other examples outside of the block of spoken examples and when trying to make translations more direct, change the english to match the french, not the other way around.
Also, lets all discuss our edits more than we actually edit, so these things can be tracked more easily
[[User:Lotusduck|Lotusduck]] 00:43, 4 November 2005 (UTC)lotusduck

=== Audio ===

I have a bit of spare time on my hands at the moment and am going to try to record audio to accompany the lessons. I'm not a native speaker, but hopefully it will be enough for this course. If it really annoys anyone, please change it! It would also be great if anyone could give me help with the dialogues involving male and female characters' voices. Thanks. [[User:Jonojet|Jonojet]]

===future tense and culture===

In chapter 11 and 13 I've added a bit on future tense and culture respectively. I assume that chapter 11 is a good enough time to introduce future tenses. And the culture lesson, I was tempted to blag most of the lesson from the [[w:Culture of France]] article. but i did something anyway. What do you think about lesson 14 then? I'd like to get involved more with this--[[User:Wonderfool|Wonderfool]] 00:42, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)


===Lesson suggestions===
====Beginners====
*Ca va? (perhaps have some material from la corps here, but it should be fairly early in the lessons)
*Quelle heure est-il? - What's the time? (inc. 24 hour time)
*Months and Days - Birthdays, Saints' days, seasons. (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) 
*Je suis perdu! - I'm lost! (Asking where places are, directions)


====Intermediate/Advanced====
Can I please suggest some lesson subjects?  (pinched from the Board of Studies, NSW, Australia).. ;)
*&quot;Relationships&quot; - do you get on with your family/friends, what kind of a friend are you, talk about your relationship with your petit(e) ami(e).
*&quot;School Life and Aspirations&quot; - what kind of career do you want in the future, what are your favourite subjects and why, do you learn well from your profs, etc.
*&quot;Young Person's World&quot; - pop culture, mass media, politics, what they think of fashion, if they have a part-time job.
*&quot;Leisure and Interests&quot; - hobbies, leisure, past hobbies, technology, mobile/cell phones
*&quot;Daily Life/Lifestyles&quot; - self explicatory, really.  
*&quot;Controversial Issues&quot; - again, fairly self explicatory.
see [http://www.boredofstudies.org/community/showthread.php?t=37468&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15] for more info/ideas. Thanks! - [[User:220.237.30.150|220.237.30.150]] 02:48, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

==Drastic Revision Needed==
Bleh, I did more for this book in a few days than has been done in two years. :) &lt;br&gt;
Anyway, I would like your thoughts on the changes I made and your help in creating exercises.
===Updates?===
This book hasn't really been updated in content since 2003, with the only page receiving anything more than minor changes being lesson 13. Given the current state of the book, this should be fixed and a clear direction of the book outlined as soon as possible. 

===Naming===
*The naming policy should be standardized. The best way would be French/[Lessons,Appendices,etc]/[Title] recommended in the [[WB:NP|Naming Policy]].
*Lesson Names and Apendices should be renamed to descriptive titles, following the [[WB:NP|Naming Policy]] structure.

===Book Structure===
*The book should follow the [[Foreign language textbook template]], which is now the [[German|German Wikibook]].
*The Grammar reference should be one contained page, following the [[German Grammar]] format.
*A header template should be made with links to major sections and added to every page, following to style of [[Template:HTBACTOC]]

===Reorganizing the Lessons===
*The most important action to be done is to reorganize and redo all the lessons. I feel this is something that should be done collaborately. 
# The new content arrangement for the lessons should first be finalized and agreed upon as soon as possible.
# The existing content should then be added to the respective sections of the new arrangement.
# Finally, new content should be created as needed.

===Lesson Structure Proposals===
*There are three reasonable options for lesson structure:

01: German WikiBook
*The lessons are desperately in need of thorough revision. There are simply too many grammar topics covered for a beginner to learn. Any one lesson in this book has more grammar than the [[German: Level I|First German Level]], which is only used to give enough grammar for a basic *understanding of the structure of phrases and to learn the vocabulary. The first French level should be the same.
*In the Second German Level, grammar has begun to be taught structurally, with technical rules of formation of verbs and sentences given. French lessons should follow this structure.
*[[User:Serge/French|Serge's proposed lessons]] would go well with this system.

02: Japanese Wikibook
*Maybe have a basic vocab-focused course and a separate grammar-intensive course, like [[Japanese|the Japanese WikiBook]]? That way we would be able to keep the current lessons.

03: Those outlined by an anonymous user in [[Talk:French/Table_of_Contents#Lesson_suggestions|Section 8 of the talk page]].

===Changes Already Done====
*Grammar organized.
*Header template created and added to all pages.
*Appendices organized.
*Naming standardized.
*Print versions created of lessons and grammar.

== Spreading out the grammar ==

Can I suggest something...we cut up the grammar majorly! There is FAR too much grammar in each lesson - for instance, a lesson to learn the past tenses is too hard - so can we create say, 3 levels (a la German wikibook) and have say about 10 lessons in each, with more vocabulary, more examples and more exercises? - Serge

I have moved your comment and my reply from the original location  to  [[:Programming:C_plus_plus/Conventions#new_presentation]].--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:38, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

You should move pages before you edit them so to keep the edits history and discussions related to the pages.  I've seen you have started C++ Programming doing it as you are, you are creating a fork (due to loss of information on future moves of pages or merge of content) and remember that the mains pages of the old Programming:C Plus Plus is still protected (can't be moved) a quick solution would be moving all the pages you already have created to your sandbox on wikibooks and start by moving the old ones before you do an edit on the same location, then you can apply you changes...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 08:12, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

Another solution could be moving old pages and structure to a new relative location including a major rename of pages I don't think this isn't a great idea, a bot should probably be used to fix all the needed relocations.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 08:22, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

---- 
Oh I see. I am sorry. exuse me ! I claimed a speedy deletion of the new pages. Do I need to do this for all the pages or only for the C++ Programming is sufficient ? [[User:Merrheim|Merrheim]] 09:26, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

All the pages i create are candidates for speedy deletion. I hope this is what i have to do. [[User:Merrheim|Merrheim]] 09:49, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
----
I've only market my own creations. All pages are a bit of overkill and no deletion is needed if you move them to lets say you userspace or a temp dir on C plus plus, the templates could stay as they are until the move from c plus plus is initiated the only problem can be name collisions. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:50, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

I have asked my own creation (copy of file from C plus plus but with name collision) to be deleted but all the templates are still alive and ready. I try to move one of my page but the old page is not deleted and the name collision stil exists. So when the problematic pages  will be deleted (the page with name collision), we move the page from C plus plus (with history !)and with a small manipulation the pages with the templates will be alive.

== French wikibook ==

Est-ce que vous vous interessez toujours à aider avec le Wikibook de la langue française? Je viens d'écrire une partie importante du quatrième niveau; mais je perds mon français (je n'étais jamais parfaitement bilingue) et je sais qu'il va y avoir des fautes. Si vous n'avez pas envie, ne vous inquiètez pas. :) En tous cas merci pour tout le travail que tu as fait sur ce wikibook. [[User:Tommciver|Tommciver]] 05:15, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you understand the Pythagorean Theorem and what it derives from, you can now start applying its formula to everyday problems.

==Examples==
===Example 1 - Plane Distance===
'''A plane flies south from an airport at 300 miles per hour. Another plane flies out at the same time due east at 250 miles per hour. How far apart are the planes after three hours?'''
===Solution to Example 1===
The solution would be about 1172 miles apart after three hours. How do we determine the answer?
  '''&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;'''                          The Pythagorean Theorem.
  '''&lt;math&gt;(300*3)^2 + (250*3)^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;'''                Substituting miles per hour.
  '''&lt;math&gt;900^2 + 750^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;'''                       Simplifying.
  '''&lt;math&gt;810000 + 562500 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;'''                   Simplifying.
  '''&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{c^2} = \sqrt{810000 + 562500}&lt;/math&gt;'''      Finding the hypotenuse (or distance).
  '''&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{1372500}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;c \approx 1172&lt;/math&gt;'''     Our distance, simplified.

      <comment>Corrected &quot;pronuncaition&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The word for &quot;the&quot; in Arabic is:
al ال

Aside: The word &quot;the&quot; matches up with the word &quot;al&quot; in most cases. &quot;al&quot; is used in some places where the word &quot;the&quot; wouldn't be used in English translation. &quot;al&quot; is sometimes used to talk about something in general.

Just remember: al=the

Pronunciations of al: &quot;al&quot;, and 
the &quot;e&quot; gets elided whenever possible.
example: kitaabu al-walad  Is pronounced: kitaabulwalad


&quot;al&quot; has two pronunciations. The first is the lunar pronunciation. This one is used when a moon letter starts the word after &quot;el&quot;. The second is the solar pronunciation. The solar pronunciation will be indicated with the following spelling:  èl. This is a convention to help beginners, it is rarely indicated in Arabic writing.

èl is weird. The &quot;l&quot; is not pronounced. In its place the first letter of the word after it is pronounced. Thus:
èl-shams   [esh-shams]
èl-daftar [ed-daf-tar]
èl-rajul [er-ra-jul]

This only happens if the letter after &quot;el&quot; is a solar letter. The solar letters are &quot;t,d,r,z,s&quot; (this only applies to the transliteration system used). There are more than 5 solar letters in standard Arabic writing.
== Sun Letters/Moon Letters ==

:Sun Letters
: ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن
:...................................
:Moon Letters
:ا ب ج ح خ ع غ ق ك م ه و ي 


==Vocab==
Practice adding &quot;el&quot; out loud. Remember that &quot;rajul&quot; begins with a solar letter.

#walad - a boy
#bint - a girl
#rajul - a man
#imra'ä - a woman
#kitaab - a book
#kabiir - big
#'''s'''aghiir - small

==Lesson Summary==
*el=the
*this spelling: èl
means do not pronounce the &quot;l&quot; instead pronounce the letter beginning the next word, then start pronouncing the next word.
**e.g. èl-daftar [ed-daf-tar]

== Exercises ==

A) Make the definite form of the following words.


#.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مَلِكٌ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;جَبَلٌ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;سُوقٌ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مُهَنْدِسٌ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;طَالِبٌ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


B) Do the same thing here. This time there are also adjective attributes.


1.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;كَاتِبٌ مَشْهُورٌ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مُدِيرٌ مَكْرُوهٌ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;بِنْتٌ صَغِيرٌ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
4.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;عُمَّالٌ شَاطِرٌ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

----

== Answers ==

1.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مَلِكٌ -&gt; أَلْمَلِكُ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;جَبَلٌ -&gt; أَلْجَبَلُ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;سُوقٌ -&gt; أَلسُّوقُ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
4.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مُهَنْدِسٌ -&gt; أَلْمُهَنْدِسُ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
5.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;طَالِبٌ -&gt; أَلطَّالِبُ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

{{wikipedia|List of liqueurs}}

The word '''liqueur''' is derived from the Latin word 'liquefacere',  which means to melt, or dissolve (literally 'to make liquid', i.e. the base ingredient in liquid form). Liqueurs are characterised by their high alcohol and sugar content&lt;ref name=&quot;EEC&quot;&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31989R1576:EN:HTML Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 of 29 May 1989 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks] an EEC regulation requires a sugar content of 100g per litre for a drink to be labelled a liqueur.&lt;/ref&gt;. Cordials are liqueurs manufactured using the infusion process as opposed to the essence and distillation processes&lt;ref name=&quot;brittanica&quot;&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/LEO_LOB/LIQUEURS.html 1911 Brittanica]&lt;/ref&gt;. Liqueurs are often used as the modifying ingredient in cocktails, and are occasionally consumed straight, often chilled or over ice.  As a modifying ingredient they have found popularity in cocktails such as the Sour Apple Martini or Brandy Alexander.  When consumed straight, they are usually taken as a digestif or dessert.

      <comment>gender -&gt; genre. it seems unnecessary to define the word genre though given that it's a very common word but i didn't remove that</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Archetypes==
There are many genres (type classification) of games, each one within its own defined domain, that commonly will have sub-domains (in a tree like form). All the games in a particular genre tend to share certain conventions, since they are the defining element. A game can also be classified in more than one genre, by layering (sectioning the game-play) or as a result of experimentation in an attempt to innovate or simply by a need to place very similar games in distinct categories.

For instance strategy games that are real time, will often share most common elements of turn base games, in fact '''RTS''' (Real time strategy) can be defined as a logical evolution of TBS games, due to the possibilities opened by the increase of computational power and graphics capabilities. In this example strategy games will then be the common root of TBS and RTS gender, and will include for instance the card game of Solitaire. Continuing with the example the Solitare game would be part of the simulator gender and its sub-domain of card games. 

{{NOTE|A careful consideration should be given to the expectations of players, for instant it is not uncommon that RTS games will often include a turn base version of the game-play. Too much innovation can put players off. The same can be said by the need of normalization, but that will be discussed later on...}}

The game genre can also be defining in the type of people who would play it. 

An '''archetype''' is a game that implements the purest set of conventions that is commonly accepted as defining a genre. A good example of an archetype would be any game that first implemented a genre or later implementations that strictly re-uses those conventions without any form of game-play innovation in terms of capabilities.

'''Classic Game Types'''

[[Image:Donkey_Kong_arcade.jpg|thumb|256px|right|&lt;font color=&quot;white&gt;Nintendo's Arcade version of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; - this is one of the oldest video games.&lt;/font&gt;]]
'''Arcade Classics'''

Digdug - Pac-man - Asteroids - Space Invaders - Breakout - Pong - Pitfall

{{TODO|Add simple coverage to rise and downfall of the arcade games.}}

=== Maze ===

Example:
*Pacman

=== Platform ===
A [[w:Platform game|platform game]] has the character(s) as anything from the protagonist to Arcadic Conventional and the player-character relationship being 1st or third person.

'''Platforms:'''The levels are designed as side scrollers (meaning that you see everything from the side almost like a cross-section. The character jumps between platforms to progress through the level and often times there are large 'bottomless-holes' in which the character dies.

'''Collectibles:'''Levels consist of collectibles such as coins, items, etc. which increase abilities and score.

Some platform games:
*[[w:Super Mario Bros|Super Mario Bros]]
*[[w:Mario 64|Super Mario 64]]

=== Scroll ===

=== Puzzle ===
A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_game Puzzle game] usually uses both character and player-character relationship as an influence in the game. It uses concepts of score and level progression through logic and skill.

Some Puzzle games:

Myst - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris Tetris] - Lumines

== Medium Qualifiers ==
The appearance of 3D environments in games that first started with vectorial simulations creates the need to distinguish 2D games from 3D, in arcades there was also attempts to create real 3D games, with minor successes and game studios attempted also a new type of system, the interactive video game that one day will probably make a come back. While not an archetype this type of qualifiers are often part of a game description.

=== 2D ===
{{TODO|Complete}}

=== 3D ===
{{TODO|Complete}}

=== Interactive ===   
{{TODO|Complete}}

== Extended Game Types ==
The end of the arcade matches well with the increase of affordability of powerful game systems for home use. A time that sees the rise of the 3D environment over the older 2D. As the game specific arcade starts to become unprofitable new genres starts to appear, especially due to the home computer and long play models that wouldn't fit the arcade model.   

=== Strategy ===

{{TODO|Cover Play by mail, and the need of reliable machines and the popularization of the PC so these type of game could be moved out of the main frames}}

==== Turn-base Strategy ====
The turn base strategy genre usually focus on tactics rather than superiority of arms such as in many RTS, the genre is therefore preferred by many gamers who desire long duration, complexity and greater tactical challenges instead of the hectic and repetitive game-play that is the basis of most recent RTS that is more focused in optimization of actions and returns.

The context were turn-base strategy can be applied is very vast, from military campaigns to businesses and fantasy all is opened to create the background. 

*[[w:Lords of Magic|Lords of Magic]]

==== Real Time Strategy (RTS) ====
RTS stands for Real Time Strategy. Therefore as a type that would define all games that are not turn based but the more specifically use of the generic label is given the real time strategy games where the player is generally an influence and the character, too. An influence (sometimes arcadic conventional or protagonist).  

===== Generic RTSs =====
The generic model germinated by [[w:BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Revenge|BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Revenge]] published by [[w:Infocom|Infocom]] and developed by [[w:Westwood Studios|Westwood]], this was the game that served as a prototype for what later became Dune 2, the first [[w:real-time strategy|real-time strategy]] title on the PC.

Essentially, The Crescent Hawk's Revenge was the turning point in PC strategy gaming, where a genre formerly dominated by turn-based titles would begin a massive shift towards real-time.  Later Westwood titles, [[w:Dune II|Dune 2]] and [[w:Command &amp; Conquer|Command &amp; Conquer]], would expand this newly-established real-time strategy gameplay.

This type of game has suffered many implementations being the basic game play very similar, innovations have been in map size and detail the addition of distinct planes to the game play and addition of tech trees and increased resource complexity.

The elements of an RTS are generally:
'''Resource Management:''' You must collect and manage resources to research and build your 'sect'. You usually build or raise an army to defend your buildings and to attack the other players. 

'''Multiplayer functions:''' These games are usually played across networks with other players and the objective is usually to wipe out the other player (other options are often present however.)

'''Citizen controls:''' You are able to control all the 'people', 'buildings' and 'troops' from anywhere in the realm.

'''Battle:''' You send your people into battle to defeat the other players using war tactics and soldier arrangements.

Other examples are:
*Dark Reign,
*Mechcommander
*[[w:Age_of_empires| Age of Empires]].
*[[w:Warcraft_III| Warcraft III]].
*[[StarCraft]].
*Total Annihilation

==== Tactical Combat Simulation ====
*[[w:Laser Squad|Laser Squad]], turn based.
*[[w:Jagged Alliance (series)|Jagged Alliance]], initially turn based, newer releases are mixed mode.

==== War Simulation ====
*[[w:Romance of the Three Kingdoms (video game series)|Romance of the Three Kingdoms]], turn based.

==== Business/Economy/Social simulation ====
*[[w:OpenTTD|OpenTTD]], real time.
*Civilization, turn based.

==== Other with no specific niches ====
*Final Fantasy Tactics, turn based.
*[[w:Dawn_of_war| Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War]], real time.
*[[w:Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic| Heroes of Might and Magic]], turn based.
*Black and White
*Imperium Galactica
*Real War

=== Role Playing ===
This defines any games wherein there the character(s) is/are the ''protagonist'' and the player either has a 3rd or 1st person interaction with it/them. Usually these games incorporate a personal view point of fantastic or futuristic settings, although others certainly exist.

==== Role Playing Game (RPG) ====
RPG or Role Playing Game should not to be simply confused with the more broad definition of role playing. The RPG genre evolved directly from complex table games.

The elements of an RPG generally include:

'''Battle:'''
Most RPGs have some form of battling in them. Historically they can occur in a resolution stage, based on a ''turn-based'' battle system, which shows players a new screen where the enemies are on one side of the 'field' and the characters are on the other. Each side must then wait till to gain enough ''energy'' to attack the other. The battle system often contains elements such as '''HP''' (health points), '''MP''' (Magic points), attack, speed, stamina, defense, and so forth.

A major portion of the battle system is '''EXP''' (experience) points. When the character(s) defeat an enemy it gain EXP and when it gains enough it will ''gain a level'', which increases some or all of its game statistics. This can be new or increased magic, spells, and special attacks.

recently however with more powerful processing power available, this static battle system have fallen in disuse, most RPGs today tend to be 3D and real-time combat is often the solution adopted. 

'''Inventory:'''
A database of items, armor, weapons, and so forth the characters hold.

'''Story line:'''
Usually the player starts out with one or a few characters and the challenge is presented. Then as the game progresses members of the player's ''party'' leave and new ones enter. Games like this are generally divided into regions wherein the player must fight through and discover the problem then fight a ''boss''. At the end of the game the player usually fights the ''final boss'' which generally has 3 stages. RPGs have a lot of talking and usually have deeper storyline than other game types.

'''Character Progression:''
As an extension of the battle system mentioned above, most RPG's heavily emphasize the player developing their character(s) over the course of the game. Systems that increase the character's prowess in battle are most common, although others, such as crafting systems to create equipment for the character, are also relatively common.

Some RPGs:

[[w:Final_Fantasy| Final Fantasy]]

Baldur's Gate - Dark Stone - Fallout - Ultima - Star Ocean - Dragon's Quest - Elder Scrolls - Icewind Dale

Hack n' Slash RPG Games:

Diablo I and II  - Dynasty Warriors - Gauntlet Legends - Champions

These games are considered a variance of the RPG genre; however, they fall under the Hack n' Slash category. These games differ by the character's depth as well as the core game-play mechanics of how the game runs.

==== Action/Adventure ====
Action/Adventure Games usually have 3rd person (sometimes 1st person) player character relationship and the character is usually the protagonist. They may mix several other types but ultimately they are role playing games.

Examples: 
*[[w:The_Legend_of_Zelda_series| Zelda]]
*Lost Planet
*Tomb Raider

=== First Person Shooters (FPS) ===
First Person Shooters are games based on the so called 1st person perspective (although this very often puts your point of view in about chest height of the character) that places you behind the eyes of the protagonist.
The elements of an FPS are:

'''Weapons and artillery:''' The character is able to collect and use weapons and artillery with which they use to attack and destroy other characters/enemies.

'''Story line:''' Usually an FPS does not have a very deep story line and is more about staying alive than anything.

Some FPS's

[[w:Quake |Quake]]

[[w:Duke Nukem 3D |Duke Nukem 3D]]

[[w:Doom| Doom]]

[[w:Halo_%28video_game_series%29 |Halo]]

[[w:Half-Life |Half-Life]]

Goldeneye

Perfect Dark

Turok

Bioshock

=== Racing ===
A racing game usually uses a 3rd (sometimes 1st) person player-character relationship where the character is an arcadic convention. Elements of Racing games are:

'''Vehicles:''' Usually there is some type of vehicle which the character drives, sometimes these vehicles are customizable and the game lets you choose a vehicle. Different vehicles usually have different stats such as faster speed but worse turning etc.

'''The Race:'''The race is separated in laps and judged by time and placing. Usually the game will have a 'time trial' mode wherein the player can try to beat a time. In the race the character will race against other characters (2+) the standard being 8.

Some Racing Games:
*[[w:Mario_Kart| Mario Kart]]
*Ridge Racer
*Grand Turismo
*Forza
*Wave Race 64
*Need For Speed
*Project Gotham Racing
*Burnout

=== Simulation ===
A simulator is as it says a simulation of reality, even an imaginary reality will do. The differences on how that reality is reflected is not very significant in classifying a game as a simulator, it only suffices that a simulation is clear on the bounds it intends in replicating and the level of detail it provides. Most simulators will include several sub-genre but they are clearly in a class of their own. 

Most simulator in 3D tend to have a hight degree of quality in regards to the simulated reality, that may indeed not satisfy the player beyond the specific purpose of the simulation. They are also mostly real time (or with real-time capability). This are often dedicated to things planes, helicopters, railroads, cars and tanks or even submarines in specific or generalized scenarios.

Isometric simulators are mostly relegating to economic simulation, management and construction, the need to reflect reality is not as important and modelization will suffice. They tend to be turn based or include very carefully designed pause events. 

A simulation game can also have a variety of character and character relationships. Usually however, the player-character relationship is influence and the character are archaic and conventional.

Some Simulation Games:
*City-building and management simulator
**[[w:SimCity_4|Sim City]] 
*Family simulation
**[[w:The_sims|The Sims]]
*Flight simulator
*Management simulator
**[[w:Theme Hospital|Theme Hospital]]
*Trade simulation
**Space trade
***[[w:Elite (video game)|Elite]], [[w:Freelancer (video game)|Freelancer]] ...

=== Grow-like games ===
The Grow-like games can be considered a kind of puzzle game,
but the way the narrative emerges with little information about rules, boundaries, and outcomes causes some to consider them in a genre all their own.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://infocult.typepad.com/infocult/2006/11/the_grow_genre_.html &quot;The Grow genre continues&quot;];
[http://infocult.typepad.com/infocult/2006/05/a_new_grow_game.html &quot;A new Grow game&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhythm games ===
Also a sub-genre of puzzle gaming, that specifically deals with the reproduction of actions and movements to replicate specific sequences of visual or audio queues.

=== Cross Genre Games ===

Hellgate: London - Rampart

==== MMO ==== 
MMO or Massively Multiplayer Online consists of all forms of all game genres where a nearly infinite number of players interact with each other via the Internet. MMO's usually consist of players killing monsters, doing quests, etc. to get to the highest level. MMO's are often PvP (Player vs. Player), where players from around the world will battle with each other with their custom-formed character.

Hallo people, I tried to translate the upper sorabian word šěna, but I had some difficulties. In german it is: Schiene, Stab, Leiste, but not in the medical or railway senses. Are there some good internet pages about the translation of sorabian words into English? I tried to find such pages. --[[User:Tlustulimu|Tlustulimu]] 15:35, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

: I can't help you with this, but I copied your question to [[../Upper Sorbian]], because people interested in Upper Sorbian will probably not look through the talk pages of all the maps, so one should really concentrate the discussion about questions of individual languages on only one page each. --[[User:Buncic|Daniel Bunčić]] 20:18, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

Would the anon user who 'corrected' a 'bug in the code' please justify his change from:

to

  if ProcessID &lt;&gt; 0 then

Remember that we are using VB6 and that in VB6 ''zero'' is equivalent to ''False'' and ''non-zero'' is equivalent to true.  It can be argued that one style is ''preferable'' to the other (I know which I prefer) but the original was emphatically ''not'' faulty code.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 15:43, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Explanation==
*In Arabic sentences, the adjectives come after the noun. 
*If an adjective is modifying a feminine noun, the adjective should take the taa' marbuu'''t'''ä ending.
*If the noun has &quot;el&quot; then so will the adjectives.


==Vocab==
# daftar&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; دفتر&lt;/font&gt;   notebook
# qadiim&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; قديم&lt;/font&gt;   old
# jadiid&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; جديد&lt;/font&gt;  new
# '''s'''aa'''h'''ib &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;صاحب&lt;/font&gt;  companion

==Homework==
Make sentences like the one's above. Using adjectives with the nouns كرسي (kursiyy) and دفتر (daftar). Remember to make sentences using the words جديد (jadiid) and قديم (qadiim)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a point where the affected extremity will need to be reintegrated with the whole person.  Until that point is reached the hand will not be well. The early encouragement of patient responsibility for the rehab of their problem the sooner the transition to wellness can be accomplished.  
Exercises that are tactile and with practical purpose, and especially gratifying activities are an example:  kneading dough, gardening.

== How to put two words in one language into these chart? ==
Hallo people, I have a little problem about the sorabian words. There are two forms: upper sorabian naprawo &quot;right, to the right&quot; (Esperanto [E-o]: dekstra, dekstren), lower sorabian napšawo / upper sorabian prawo &quot;right&quot; (E-o: rajto), lower sorabian pšawo. Is there a possibility to put both forms into the chart? --[[User:Tlustulimu|Tlustulimu]] 17:00, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

: Dear Tlustimu, first of all thanks for all your work on the maps. No, I think unfortunately there is no way to put two forms into the maps. This is no problem with the mono- and bilingual pages, but as the maps only show the meaning side for a fix form, this is impossible. But the noun ''*pravo'' exists in virtually all the Slavonic languages with similar meanings, and what is meant here is really the adverb (in this case the ‘dekstra, dekstren’ one, which is a cause for severe misunderstands because of the meaning ‘straight on’ it has in South Slavic languages). --[[User:Buncic|Daniel Bunčić]] 20:06, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

== ''pravo'' as noun, adverb, adjective ==

The way this map was now after the last change it was very misleading, since the meaning '(a) right' is present in almost all Slavonic languages but was shown as a specialty of some West and South Slavic languages. What this map was to show originally was the problem of different meanings of the '''adverb''' ''*pravo'' (especially when explaining the way to some foreigner from a different Slavonic country), so I left only the two meanings 'rightwards' and 'straight on' in this map and moved the meanings of the '''noun''' ''*pravo'' to [[False Friends of the Slavist/Map pravo (n.)|Map pravo (n.)]]. I have not created a similar map for the '''adjective''' ''*pravъjь'' (where ''*pravo'' is only the [short] neuter form), as the meaning 'genuine', which was now noted only for the western South Slavic languages, seems to be present in all Slavonic languages, and I do not know whether there are other meanings of the adjective ''*pravъjь'' that might cause confusion. --[[User:Buncic|Daniel Bunčić]] 19:33, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea Krom (south Vietnam) must be stopped to free the suffering Khmer Krom.  The victims of this cruel act are the Khmer Krom people who are the indigenous people of the Mekong Delta region.  I am one of the Khmer Krom individuals.  The State of Vietnam has been violating Khmer Krom's rights far too long and decapitating Khmer Krom's society to the core.  Kampuchea Krom's capital is Prey Nokor (former Saigon and today HCM city).  We, Khmer Krom, seek justice and the respect of our fundamental rights.  Currently Khmer Krom lack all means in everyday life: cannot study our own language, cannot learn about our history, cannot express opinion or speak freely, cannot move around freely, cannot form any institution such as local community or school, cannot conduct or practice our beliefs and religion freely, cannot represent ourselves in governments(locally, provincially, or nationally), cannot participate in law-making process, and most important of all--Khmer Krom are poorest of the poor in the region.  This is no exaggeration, but facts.

Psychiatry is a branch of medicine that is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders.  

However, it should also be noted that recent advances in the field have expanded its scope as the distinction between “psychiatric” disease  and “medical” disorders has begun to blur.  It is now widely recognized that psychiatric disease is an independent risk factor in the etiology of many disease states and disorders that have traditionally been the viewed as “medical” disorders. For example, depression is now known to increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, pharmacologic treatment of psychiatric disorders also plays a role in the iatrogenic etiology of medical disease. (for example, Diabetes Mellitus, cardiac arrhythmias, and Hypertension). 

  
This volume on Psychiatry is currently in the initial stages of development.  Further development will be a project of the Educational Taskforce of the World Psychiatric Association.

=== Basic Sciences Relevant to Psychiatry ===

Biochemistry - An amalgam of the scientific study of Biology (the science of living matter in all its forms) and Chemistry (the science concerned with the composition, properties, and reactions of substances) as they concern the processes (usually within the cells) which occur in living organisms. 

Microbiology – The scientific study of a diverse group of simple life-forms including concerned with their structure, function, and classification.  In medicine, more specifically, it is the study of disease-causing microorganisms that have been identified as a means to control their pathological effects.
 
Pharmacology – the study of the changes produced in living animals by chemical substances.  In medicine this relates to the actions of drugs, (substances used to treat disease, i.e. medicines), and their effects on the human organism.

Genetics – the science of heredity, which is how the characteristics of living things are transmitted from one generation to the next.  In medicine this relates to disease states resulting from chromosomal anomalies.

'''Neuroanatomy and physiology'''

to understand how it is that Brain is the substrate for Mind.


'''Psychology'''

to understand how behaviour, and internal states such as mood and thought, are regulated.


'''Sociology'''

to understand how individuals fit within society and are influenced by it.


=== Mental Health Status Examination ===


The purpose of this examination is to gather phenomenological data in an orderly way for purposes of diagnosis, checking of progress, note-taking, and communication.

It is largely based upon what a trained observer may see, and to a lesser extent upon what is described by the patient, although these must be combined.  For instance, the comparison of affect, mood as reported by the patient, and countertransference phenomena is a key to the proper assessment of mood and psychotic disorders.

'''Notes about speech, language, and thought.'''
In considering the mental state exam, speech may be confused with thought.  The following definitions may assist:

Most correctly, speech is to be defined as the motor aspect of language.  Speech would properly only be described according to articulation (how clearly each word is pronounced; slurring, running words together, etc.);  anything else about utterances would be best categorized under Language or Thought.  

Language is a system of symbols used to convey meaningful ideas.  Language also includes how the ideas expressed fit in with the social situation: eg turn-taking.  The neurology of language needs careful review by the student.  

Thought and language are of course tightly linked concepts.  Thought is the logical progression of ideas.  Clearly the style of logic employed to link the ideas (the Form of thought) varies.  Linkage may be only by sound, for instance: the so-called Klang association.  eg &quot;Mat, bat, cat.&quot;


The discussion below may be criticized as conflating speech with thought.

'''APPEARANCE'''

What does the patient look. like, smell like and sound like? Give a written description.

Self Neglect: cleanliness, shaven, make up, state of hair and clothes

Bizarre Appearance: secret documents openly displayed, special clothes or ornaments with symbolic significance, etc.


'''BEHAVIOUR'''

Involuntary movements: tics

Mannerisms

Stereotypes

Purposeful behaviour: pacing, fiddling

Congruity with the situation: does she act as if she understands the social conventions associated with the fact that she is being examined; eg. when invited into the room, sits in what is obviously the examiner's chair.


'''RAPPORT'''

Includes Demeanour: threatening, seductive, friendly


'''AFFECT'''

'''Mood:''' inner emotional experience: can be inferred, but is best described

'''Affect:''' outer expression of mood

'''Level:''' elevated, lowered, euthymic

'''Range:''' restricted, increased, normal

'''Congruity:''' does the affect match what is being discussed?

'''Communicability:''' how readily does the observed affect and described mood cause a corresponding and similar feeling in the examiner?  For instance, the moods of mania and depression are readily communicated.  See Countertransference.



'''SPEECH'''

'''Slow Speech:''' Long pauses before answering, long pauses between words

'''Pressure of Speech:''' An increase in the amount of spontaneous speech as compared with what is considered ordinary or socially customary. The patient talks rapidly and is difficult to interrupt. Some sentences may be left uncompleted because of eagerness to get on to a new idea. Simple questions that could be answered at great length, so that the answer takes minutes rather than seconds and indeed may not stop at all if the speaker is not interrupted. Even when interrupted, the speaker often continues to talk. Speech tends to be loud and emphatic. Sometimes speakers with severe pressure will talk without any social stimulation and talk even though no one is listening. When patients are receiving phenothiazines or lithium carbonate, their speech is slowed down by medication, and then it can be judged only on the basis of amount, volume and social appropriateness. This disorder may be accompanied by derailment, tangentiality, or incoherence, but it is distinct from them.

'''Non Social Speech:''' Talks, mutters, whispers to self, out of context of conversation with examiner.

'''Muteness:''' Almost mute, (fewer than 20 words in all) Totally mute

'''Poverty of Speech (Poverty of Thought, Laconic Speech):''' Restriction in the amount of spontaneous speech, so that replies to questions tend to be brief, concrete, and unelaborated. Unprompted additional information is rarely provided. Replies may be monosyllabic, and some questions may be left unanswered altogether.

When confronted with this speech pattern, the interviewer may find himself frequently prompting the patient to encourage elaboration of replies. To elicit this finding, the examiner must allow the patient adequate time to answer and to elaborate his answer.

Example   Interviewer &quot;Do you think there is a lot of corruption in government?&quot; Patient &quot;Yeah seem to be&quot; Interviewer &quot;Do you think Haldeman and Ehrlichman and Mitchell have been fairly treated?&quot; Patient &quot;I don't know&quot;. Interviewer &quot;Were you working at all before you came to the hospital?&quot; Patient &quot;No&quot;. Interviewer &quot;What kind of jobs have you had in the past?&quot; Patient &quot;Oh some janitor jobs painting&quot;
Interviewer &quot;What kind of work do you do?&quot; Patient &quot;I don't, don't like any kind of work.

That's silly&quot;. Interviewer &quot;How far did you go in school?&quot; Patient &quot;I'm still in 11th grade&quot;. Interviewer &quot;How old are you?&quot; Patient &quot;Eighteen”.

'''Neologisms:''' New word formation. A neologism is defined here as a completely new word or phrase whose derivation cannot be understood. Sometimes the term &quot;neologism&quot; has also been used to mean a word that has been incorrectly built up but with origins that are understandable as due to a misuse of the accepted methods of word formation. For purposes of clarity, these should be referred to as word approximations (discussed in the following section). Neologisms are quite uncommon.

Examples   &quot;I got so angry I picked up a dish and threw it at the geshinker&quot;. &quot;So I sort of bawked the whole thing up&quot;.

'''Word Approximations (Paraphasia, Metonyms):''' Old words that are used in a new and unconventional way, or new words that are developed by conventional rules of work formation. Often the meaning will be evident even though the usage seems peculiar or bizarre (i.e.: gloves referred to as &quot;handshoes&quot;, a ballpoint pen referred to as &quot;paper skate&quot; etc). Sometimes the word approximations may be based on the use of stock words, so that the patient uses one or several words repeatedly in ways that give them a new meaning (i.e.: a watch may be called a &quot;time vessel&quot; the stomach a &quot;food vessel&quot; a television set a &quot;news vessel&quot; etc). &quot;One is called 'per God' and the other is called 'per the Devil&quot;' miracle willed through God's 'turn horn' .... &quot;Well, there is. a frequenting of clairvoyance ...&quot; &quot;Per God&quot;. &quot;Per the Devil&quot; and &quot;turn horn&quot; are neologisms; &quot;frequenting of clairvoyance&quot; is an example of ordinary words used idiosyncratically. Write down examples.

'''Disorder of Content of Speech:''' Three types of disordered content are specified: incoherence, flight of ideas and poverty. There are overlapping concepts and in each case, the effect is to make it very difficult to grasp what the patient means. However, the symptoms are defined in terms of specific components so that it should, in most cases, be possible to say whether one, two or all three symptoms are present. If in doubt, rate hierarchically; i.e., rate incoherence in preference to flight of ideas, and flight of ideas in preference to poverty of speech.

'''Incoherence of Speech:''' see Incoherence in section on Thought Form

'''Clanging:''' A pattern of speech in which sounds rather than meaningful relationships appear to govern work choice, so that the intelligibility of the speech is impaired and redundant words are introduced. In addition to rhyming relationships, this pattern of speech may also include punning associations, so that a word similar in sound brings in a new thought. Example   &quot;I'm not trying to make noise. I'm trying to make sense. If you can make sense out of nonsense, well, have fun. I'm trying to make sense out of sense. I'm not making sense (cents) anymore. I have to make dollars&quot;.

'''Poverty of Content of Speech (Poverty of Thought, Empty Speech, Alogia, Verbigeration, Negative Formal thought Disorder):''' Although replies are long enough so that speech is adequate in amount, it conveys little information. Language tends to be vague, often over abstract or over concrete, repetitive and stereotyped. The interviewer may recognise this finding_ by observing that the patient has spoken at some length but has not given adequate information to answer the question. Alternatively, the patient may provide enough information to answer the question, but require many words to do so, so that a lengthy reply can be summarised in a sentence or two.

Sometimes the interviewer may characterise the speech as &quot;empty philosophising&quot;.

Exclusions   This finding differs from circumstantially in that the circumstantial patient tends to provide a wealth of detail.

Example   Interviewer &quot;Tell me what you are like, what kind of person you are&quot;. Patient &quot;Ah one hell of an odd thing to say perhaps in these particular circumstances, I happen to be quite pleased with who I am or how I am and many of the problems that I have and have been working on I have are difficult for me to handle or to work on because I am not aware of them as problems which upset me personally. I have to get my feelers way out to see how it is and where that what I may be or seem to be is distressing, too painful or uncomfortable to people who make a difference to me emotionally and personally or possibly on an economic or professional level. And I am I think becoming more aware that perhaps on an analogy the matter of some who understand or enjoy loud rages of anger, the same thing can be true for other people, and I have to kind of try to learn to see when that's true and what I can do about it&quot;.

'''Misleading Answers:''' Patient's answers are misleading because answers Yes or No to everything, or frequent self contradictions, or appears to be deliberately misleading. Do not include incoherence, flight of ideas or poverty of speech here.

'''Distractible Speech:''' During the course of a discussion or interview, the patient repeatedly stops talking in the middle of a sentence or idea and changes the subject in response to a nearby stimulus, such as an object on a desk, the interviewer's clothing or appearance, etc.

Example   &quot;Then I left San Francisco and moved to 	Where did you get that

tie? It looks like it's left over from the '50s. I like the warm weather in San Diego. Is
that a conch shell on your desk? Have you ever gone scuba diving&quot;.

'''Stilted Speech:''' Speech that has an excessively stilted or formal quality. It may seem rather quaint or outdated, or may appear pompous, distant, or overpolite. The stilted quality is usually achieved through use of particular word choices (multisyllabic when monosyllabic alternatives are available and equally appropriate), extremely polite phraseology. (&quot;Excuse me, madam, may I request a conference in your office at your convenience?&quot;), or stiff and formal syntax (&quot;Whereas the attorney comported himself indecorously, the physician behaved as is customary for a born gentleman&quot;).

Paraphasia, Phonemic: Recognisable mispronunciation of a word because sounds or syllables have slipped out of sequence. Severe forms occur in aphasia, milder forms may occur as &quot;slips of the tongue&quot; in everyday speech. The speaker often recognised his error and may attempt to correct it.

Example   &quot;I slipped on the lice and broke my arm while running to catch the bus&quot;

'''Paraphasia, Semantic:''' Substitution of an inappropriate word during his effort to say something specific. The speaker may or may not recognise his error and attempt to correct it. It typically occurs in both Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia. It may be difficult to distinguish from incoherence, since incoherence may also be due to semantic substitutions that distort or obscure meaning.


'''INSIGHT'''

Does the patient know there is a problem; how does she assess her impairment, disability, and handicap due to the problem

how important is it to her; 

does she want treatment; 

how rational is her understanding of the problem and its treatment


'''COGNITIVE EXAMINATION'''

ORIENTATION

SPECIFIC TESTS


'''PHYSICAL EXAMINATION'''
'''Special attention to:'''

the signs and causes of delirium

stigmata of drug use (acute: intoxication, and chronic, eg needle track marks, stigmata of alcohol and tobacco use) and abuse

stigmata of self harm, eg scars

general body habitus: obesity, degree of fitness

Neurological examination


'''COUNTERTRANSFERENCE'''

A term borrowed from psychoanalytic theory and practice, now used fairly generally to denote the therapist's own reactions to the interview.  It is an essential part of the armamentarium of the therapist in all diagnostic and therapeutic encounters.  Its components have been debated but may reasonably be said to include: 

a) reactions arising from the therapist (such as empathy, sympathy, and thoughts, feelings, impulses etc arising in the context of any state of mental health), and 

b) mental states arising within, and communicated directly and literally from the patient.  These may be experienced by the attuned therapist as unfamiliar, or not-self, although the distinction from one's own mental contents may be challenging even for experienced workers.

It will be apparent that the better a therapist knows him/herself, including his/her mental functioning and personality traits, the more valid a tool countertransference will be.  Hence this tool, and one's general functioning as a psychiatrist, may be enhanced by a personal therapy.

=== Delirium, Dementia, and other Cognitive Disorders ===
Although most psychiatric disorders are presumed to have an underlying alteration in function, this group are separated off by having a suspected cause in another area of medical specialty. For example, delirium ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium]), is commonly caused by alterations in brain oxygenation and would be better assessed by a physician to determine possible treatable causes.
The organic disorders may have an underlying basis that is treatable or untreatable and treatment may or may not improve symptoms.
This group includes Delirium, Dementia and other disorders listed below where they are proved to be secondary to a physical cause (e.g. a mood disorder secondary to changed thyroid function).
Disorders which are caused by intoxication or withdrawal may also be consider
ed under organic disorders, although we will consider substance use and misuse disorders separately


[[Dementia]]
Definition: usually permanent disorder of memory ,other cogntive functions and overall level of functioning. 
[[Major types of Dementia]] 

[[Alzheimer's Disease]]
[[Vascular Dementia]]
[[Lewy Body Dementia]]

=== Psychotic Disorders ===
The [[Psychiatric Disorders/Psychotic Disorders|Psychotic Disorders]] are characterized by alterations in thinking or perception that cause distress or impairment in functioning. These include disorders such as Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective disorder and related disorders. There are clusters of symptoms broadly characterized as positive and negative symptoms.
Positive symptoms include delusions, hallucinations or disorganisation of thought, negative symptoms include social withdrawal and loss of enjoyment, motivation or drive.

=== Mood Disorders ===
The [[Psychiatric Disorders/Mood Disorders|Mood Disorders]] include a variety of syndromes characterised by the symptoms of depressed mood, elevated mood and characteristic other physical symptoms. These may be present in a continuous, intermittant or cyclical pattern.

=== Anxiety Disorders ===
The [[Psychiatric Disorders/Anxiety disorders|Anxiety Disorders]] include disorders with symptoms of anxiety or excessive worrying, phobias and panic attacks.

=== Substance misuse and dependence ===
[[Psychiatric Disorders/Substance abuse disorders|Substance abuse disorders]] are those disorders or problems caused by substance use, abuse, intoxication or withdrawal. These may also contribute to other conditions. Substances involved may include legal ones such as tobacco, caffiene and alcohol, or illegal substances such as cannabis, 'Party Pills' or Cocaine.

=== Personality disorders ===
[[Psychiatric Disorders/Personality disorders|Personality disorders]] are loosly defined clusters of maladaptive coping strategies that cause a person discomfort or repeatedly cause negative interactions with others.

'''DSM IV'''
groups personality disorders into three clusters.

'''Cluster A'''

'''Cluster B'''

'''Cluster C'''

It is not unusual for any given patient to fulfill criteria for more than one personality disorder; the diagnoses are by no means mutually exclusive.


=== Other disorders ===

==== Childhood disorders ====
[[Psychiatric Disorders/childhood disorders/Introduction]] Children cannot be considered to be little adults.  Child and adolescent psychiatry is a unique area and conceptualisations typical of adult mental health are often either not helpful such as the rubric of personality disorders, or fall short in terms of emphasis. 
 
[[Psychiatric Disorders/childhood disorders/Epidemiology]] Population based surveys across numerous countries and cultural groups have recorded the prevalence of mental health disturbance in children and adolescents at between 15 - 20%. 

[[Psychiatric Disorders/childhood disorders/Clinical symptoms and classification]] A major issue differentiating child and adolescent psychiatry from practice with adults is that the content of symptoms varies across the child and adolescent developmental span. 
 
[[Psychiatric Disorders/childhood disorders/Assessment]] As a generalisation children live within a family context and so it is usual to begin with interviewing the whole family.  

[[Psychiatric Disorders/childhood disorders/Pathogenesis]] An approach seen across many areas of psychiatry is the biopsychosocial-cultural schema. Use of this schema in child and adoelscent psychiatry emphasises the child lives within a family, school, local environment context and there may need to be interventions at numerous parts of the individual and social ecology to achieve a successful outcome.  Rather than consider biopsychosocial-cultural factors during the infant, child, early and late adolescent stages separately, this section will take an over-arching developmental view and integrate these various ecological influences at different stages of development.

[[Psychiatric Disorders/childhood disorders/Treatment]] Treatment strategies in child and adolescent psychiatry emphasise the often complex pathogenesis of presentations, the need to target various aspects of the child's social ecology and a tendancy for psychotherapies to be the first line of management. Outlined below are details of the types of psychotherapeutic approaches, which medications have an evidence base and when these should be used, and the argument for combined therapy.

[[Psychiatric Disorders/childhood disorders/Pharmacotherapy]] Prior to a discussion of pharmacotherapy it is prudent to discuss the decision-making process around the use of medication, especially given the rapid advances in this area and the array of medications now available.  
[[Psychiatric Disorders/childhood disorders/Psychotherapy]] 
[[Psychiatric Disorders/childhood disorders/Combined treatment]]

==== Impulse Control Disorders ====

=== Psychiatric Treatments ===
These may be biological, psychological, and/or social.  In fact psychiatry is the area in medicine ''par excellence'' where it most makes sense --ideologically and practically-- that these three domains be integrated, since psychiatry focuses on examining and remedying disorders which involve the whole person.

'''Biological''': these commonly include medications and electroconvulsive therapy.  Many psychiatrists consider that physical aspects of lifestyle such as activity level and diet have an influence on symptomatology, for instance upon the mood disorders.  More controversial but receiving increasing recognition are the effects of vitamin and mineral deficiency (for instance zinc deficiency in depression), and glucose intolerance.

'''Psychological''': these talking therapies range from hypnosis, to psychoanalytically informed psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, to cognitive and behavioral (CBT) strategies.  Psychoanalytic and CBT techniques are amongst the most researched treatment modalities in all of medicine and find a particular place in the treatment-- often long-term-- of patients with personality disorders; they also allow amelioration of a wide variety of other conditions.  One mediating concept is that of attachment, both in childhood and throughout the lifespan.

'''Social''': Housing, family and social support structures, financial difficulty all play a role in the genesis of psychiatric disorders and certainly affect prognosis.  The role of the allied treatment team may be crucial.  Stress responses, involving increasingly well-understood biological mechanisms, mediate.

==== Forensic Psychiatry ====
 
Forensic psychiatry is a branch of medicine which focuses on the interface of law and mental health. It includes psychiatric consultation in a wide variety of legal matters (including expert testimony), as well as clinical work with perpetrators and victims. 
Although the media protrays persons who commit horrific acts as being &quot;disturbed&quot; by making vague statements regarding a person's, often unknown, mental health status, persons with mental illness are more often the victim than the perpetraitor. More than one-fourth of persons with severe mental illness are victims of violent crime in the course of a year, a rate 11 times higher than that of the general population, according to a study by researchers at Northwestern University.  They estimated that nearly 3 million severely mentally ill people are crime victims each year in the United States. This is the first such study to include a large, random sample of community-living, mentally ill persons and to use the same measures of victimization used by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, said lead author Linda Teplin, Ph.D., Owen L. Coon Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University, in the August Archives of General Psychiatry.

=Weatherproofing=
Should there be a section on weatherproofing?
:Hi, it's best to have an account before you add edits and commenst otherwise we can't see who you are. I don't think weatherproofing should be a section, it is the basic purpose of all buildins and as such is covered in many places, especially http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Straw_Bale_Construction/Techniques/Walls when it's finished. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 11:54, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

=Task list=
* find and correct all the broken links to wikipedia--[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 20:31, 4 March 2006 (UTC)
* add acounstics, refering to the danish report. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 14:08, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
* [[Straw_Bale_Construction/Techniques/Roofing|/Techniques/Roofing]] needs to be written --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 11:38, 24 March 2006 (UTC)
* New entries in the Glossary need tidying up --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 11:47, 24 March 2006 (UTC)
* The details of this passage in roof insulation need to be better referenced &quot;Rice hull has a thermal conductivity of about 0.0359 W/(m.°C); the values compare well with the thermal conductivity of excellent insulating materials (Houston, 1972).” Juliano (1985), p, 696. The thermal conductivity of rice hull ash is reported to be 0.062 W.m-1.K-1. See UNIDO, p. 21. A more recent test done by R&amp;D services of Cookville, Tennessee, indicates a 3.024 R-per-inch.&quot;--[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 17:11, 24 March 2006 (UTC)
* Clarify the last two paragraphs of the [[Straw Bale Construction/Characteristics/Insulation]] page: &quot;ORNL determined the R-value to be...R-33 for three string (23&quot;) bale wall systems.... Whatever the value, it is at least three times better than the average 'R-19' wood studwall system.&quot; To a layperson, R-33 doesn't seem to be three times better than R-19.--[[User:Cerewa|Cerewa]] 01:04, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

=Wish list=
[[Image:Straw_Bales.jpg|thumb|right]]
* find a front cover picture--[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 20:31, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

:Commons only has this picture and another like it. Checked [http://www.flickr.com/ Flickr] but couldn't find much else.. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 21:24, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
:Thanks [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]], There are some nice pics like that but the problem is that the bales are the wrong sort! I'd just like to find a picture with the right shaped bales - anything will do for now - but I'm stearing away from buildings (looks like you are too) because that would suggest that SB buildings have a certain look. Great to see someone else working on this wikibook :-) --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 14:03, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

::Oh yes, I know they're the wrong bales alright! (I've never had the privilege to be involved in a straw-bale build but I know a bit about it). A photo of someone laying or shaping a bale would be great (as you say, steering away from prescribing what a straw bale building looks like) - sounds like an opportunity for someone to take their camera along to a build. You know of any? [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 14:32, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

:::No, I'm thinking that at the right time we could use the hunt for a good picture as an awareness raiser on the several straw bale email lists around the place. &quot;Whose got the best pic?&quot; kinda competition.
:::PS. Is there a contact where you are from in the contact list?

::::Best pic competition sounds good - but what's stopping you from doing that now and then from that getting some input into the book-writing process? Just an idea. Oh, and I'm from Ireland (though living/studying in Manchester, England) - my [[m:User:Cormaggio|Meta]] and [[w:User:Cormaggio|Wikipedia]] user pages have more info. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 11:47, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

=What do we advise?=
* I think that as a general rule this wikibook should not recommend anything which is quite contentious amoung Straw Bale builders. If in doubt we should mention the doubts. There is a piece in the text on curved walls that looks like this: &quot;Bale strings can also be cut in order to allow the flakes to expand into the gap.&quot; This is not somthing that the SB community is in agreement on, it may well be ill advised as no-one has tested wether it is a good idea. It might work fine or it might not. It has not been tested to breaking point to see what effect is has on the walls strength. As such I have removed that sentence. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 20:46, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

=Layout=
Phase one of the layout cleanup is finished. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 22:30, 26 March 2006 (UTC)
Add comments about layout of the book generally here:

== Page Turning ==

I guess this is a general comment on the wikibooks site but if this is supposed to be a wikiBOOK, as opposed to a regular wiki, then surely it should have an obvious means to turn to the next page when I finish reading the current one?

=References=
Links which are embedded in wiki markup do not show up when printed. This means that important references can be lost in a printed version, and a printable version is a goal for me. I looked at a few ways of doing it but of those the best I could come up with that wouldn't make the print version a problem is as follows:
*References are done in the same way as you would in an essay: (Surname, Firstname, YEAR). Each reference should be linked to the bibliography. The following reference can serve as an example: ([[Straw Bale Construction/Bibliography|Doe, John. 1998]]). I think this also mirrors what people expect in a professional text about a technical subject. Comments welcome 
*If you're unfamiliar to HTML making the links work can seem hard. In HTML and wikicode the shorthand for a directory is a forward slash &quot;/&quot;, and the shorthand for going up to the directory above is two dots &quot;..&quot;. So here are some tips:
**If you're making a link from a main section then the 'Bibliography' page is ''below'' the main section. We only have to indicate that it is in a sub directory, so we add one slash. The link looks like this:
 ([[/Bibliography|Doe, John. 1998]])
**If you go into a sub-page, another layer down the hierachy, you have to indicate to the link that it must go up one layer before it look for the Bibliography page, that's done by adding two dots (..) so the link looks like this:
 ([[../Bibliography|Doe, John. 1998]])
**If you go into a sub-page of a sub-page then you have to add a seperating slash and anothe two dots, and so it goes on:
 ([[../../Bibliography|Doe, John. 1998]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Artificial Intelligence (AI) ===
Artificial intelligence is what make your game world come alive and gives your in-game creatures a mind of their own. AI also allows the difficulty of the game to change either by having a user select their own difficulty level or by having the game adapt automatically to the players skill level. There are many ways to implement AI in a game.

*[[Artificial Intelligence]]

==== Finite state machines ====
Very simple type of AI were used in Doom. Finite State Machines consist of a list of possible states (or &quot;emotions&quot;). Let's say there is a game that has guards that patrol a room looking for intruders. &lt;br&gt;
Let's also suppose these guards have five states:

* '''Patrolling''' - The guard is walking along on his assigned route
* '''Waiting, or idle''' - The guard is standing somewhere, possibly talking with another nearby guard, smoking, etc.
* '''Suspicious''' - The guard has heard a noise and thinks something is nearby (ex: a guard heard a player kick a rock off a ledge)
* '''Alert''' - The guard has visibly seen you and is attacking, or possibly shouting out for help
* '''Injured/In trouble''' - You have hurt the guard, but he is alive, and is running for help

These states would have particular actions consistent with the &quot;emotion&quot; of the guard. Patrol would activate the waypoint system, Alert would mean you activate the targeting system for the AI.

==== Neural Nets ====

==== Scripted rules based system ====

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Standard Library|XML Tools}}

Python includes a module for working with regular expressions on strings. For more information about writing regular expressions and syntax not specific to Python, see the [[regular expressions]] wikibook. Python's regular expression syntax is similar to [[Perl Programming/Regular Expressions Reference|Perl's]]

To start using regular expressions in your Python scripts, import the &quot;re&quot; module:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;import re&lt;/source&gt;

==Overview==
Regular expression functions in Python at a glance:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import re
if re.search(&quot;l+&quot;,&quot;Hello&quot;):        print 1  # Substring match suffices
if not re.match(&quot;ell.&quot;,&quot;Hello&quot;):   print 2  # The beginning of the string has to match
if re.match(&quot;.el&quot;,&quot;Hello&quot;):        print 3
if re.match(&quot;he..o&quot;,&quot;Hello&quot;,re.I): print 4  # Case-insensitive match
print re.sub(&quot;l+&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;)            # Prints &quot;Helo&quot;; replacement AKA substitution
print re.sub(r&quot;(.*)\1&quot;, r&quot;\1&quot;, &quot;HeyHey&quot;)    # Prints &quot;Hey&quot;; backreference
for match in re.findall(&quot;l+.&quot;, &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;):
  print match                               # Prints &quot;llo&quot; and then &quot;lly&quot;
for match in re.findall(&quot;e(l+.)&quot;, &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;):
  print match                               # Prints &quot;llo&quot;; match picks group 1
matchObj = re.match(&quot;(Hello|Hi) (Tom|Thom)&quot;,&quot;Hello Tom Bombadil&quot;)
if matchObj is not None:
  print matchObj.group(0)                   # Prints the whole match disregarding groups
  print matchObj.group(1) + matchObj.group(2) # Prints &quot;HelloTom&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Matching and searching==
One of the most common uses for regular expressions is extracting a part of a string or testing for the existence of a pattern in a string. Python offers several functions to do this.

The match and search functions do mostly the same thing, except that the match function will only return a result if the pattern matches at the beginning of the string being searched, while search will find a match anywhere in the string.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = re.compile(r'foo(.{,5})bar', re.I+re.S)
&gt;&gt;&gt; st1 = 'Foo, Bar, Baz'
&gt;&gt;&gt; st2 = '2. foo is bar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; search1 = foo.search(st1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; search2 = foo.search(st2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; match1 = foo.match(st1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; match2 = foo.match(st2)
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example, match2 will be &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;, because the string &lt;code&gt;st2&lt;/code&gt; does not start with the given pattern. The other 3 results will be Match objects (see below).

You can also match and search without compiling a regexp:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; search3 = re.search('oo.*ba', st1, re.I)
&lt;/source&gt;
Here we use the search function of the re module, rather than of the pattern object. For most cases, its best to compile the expression first. Not all of the re module functions support the flags argument and if the expression is used more than once, compiling first is more efficient and leads to cleaner looking code.

The compiled pattern object functions also have parameters for starting and ending the search, to search in a substring of the given string. In the first example in this section, &lt;code&gt;match2&lt;/code&gt; returns no result because the pattern does not start at the beginning of the string, but if we do:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; match3 = foo.match(st2, 3)
&lt;/source&gt;
it works, because we tell it to start searching at character number 3 in the string. 

What if we want to search for multiple instances of the pattern? Then we have two options. We can use the start and end position parameters of the search and match function in a loop, getting the position to start at from the previous match object (see below) or we can use the findall and finditer functions. The findall function returns a list of matching strings, useful for simple searching. For anything slightly complex, the finditer function should be used. This returns an iterator object, that when used in a loop, yields Match objects. For example:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; str3 = 'foo, Bar Foo. BAR FoO: bar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.findall(str3)
[', ', '. ', ': ']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for match in foo.finditer(str3):
...     match.group(1)
...
', '
'. '
': '
&lt;/source&gt;
If you're going to be iterating over the results of the search, using the finditer function is almost always a better choice. 

===Match objects===
Match objects are returned by the search and match functions, and include information about the pattern match.

The group function returns a string corresponding to a capture group (part of a regexp wrapped in &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;) of the expression, or if no group number is given, the entire match.
Using the &lt;code&gt;search1&lt;/code&gt; variable we defined above:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; search1.group()
'Foo, Bar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; search1.group(1)
', '
&lt;/source&gt;
Capture groups can also be given string names using a special syntax and referred to by &lt;code&gt;matchobj.group('name')&lt;/code&gt;. For simple expressions this is unnecessary, but for more complex expressions it can be very useful.

You can also get the position of a match or a group in a string, using the start and end functions:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; search1.start()
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; search1.end()
8
&gt;&gt;&gt; search1.start(1)
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; search1.end(1)
5
&lt;/source&gt;
This returns the start and end locations of the entire match, and the start and end of the first (and in this case only) capture group, respectively.

==Replacing==
Another use for regular expressions is replacing text in a string. To do this in Python, use the sub function.

sub takes up to 3 arguments: The text to replace with, the text to replace in, and, optionally, the maximum number of substitutions to make. Unlike the matching and searching functions, sub returns a string, consisting of the given text with the substitution(s) made.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; mystring = 'This string has a q in it'
&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern = re.compile(r'(a[n]? )(\w) ')
&gt;&gt;&gt; newstring = pattern.sub(r&quot;\1'\2' &quot;, mystring)
&gt;&gt;&gt; newstring
&quot;This string has a 'q' in it&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This takes any single alphanumeric character (\w in regular expression syntax) preceded by &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; and wraps in in single quotes. The &lt;code&gt;\1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\2&lt;/code&gt; in the replacement string are backreferences to the 2 capture groups in the expression; these would be group(1) and group(2) on a Match object from a search.

The subn function is similar to sub, except it returns a tuple, consisting of the result string and the number of replacements made. Using the string and expression from before:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; subresult = pattern.subn(r&quot;\1'\2' &quot;, mystring)
&gt;&gt;&gt; subresult
(&quot;This string has a 'q' in it&quot;, 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

Replacing without constructing and compiling a pattern object:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = re.sub(r&quot;b.*d&quot;,&quot;z&quot;,&quot;abccde&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result
'aze'
&lt;/source&gt;

==Splitting==


The split function splits a string based on a given regular expression:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; mystring = '1. First part 2. Second part 3. Third part'
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.split(r'\d\.', mystring)
['', ' First part ', ' Second part ', ' Third part']
&lt;/source&gt;

==Escaping==

The escape function escapes all non-alphanumeric characters in a string. This is useful if you need to take an unknown string that may contain regexp metacharacters like &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; and create a regular expression from it.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.escape(r'This text (and this) must be escaped with a &quot;\&quot; to use in a regexp.')
'This\\ text\\ \\(and\\ this\\)\\ must\\ be\\ escaped\\ with\\ a\\ \\&quot;\\\\\\&quot;\\ to\\ use\\ in\\ a\\ regexp\\.'
&lt;/source&gt;

==Flags==
The different flags use with regular expressions:
{| class=wikitable
! Abbreviation !! Full name !! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;re.I&lt;/code&gt;|| &lt;code&gt;re.IGNORECASE&lt;/code&gt; || Makes the regexp [[w:case sensitivity|case-insensitive]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;re.L&lt;/code&gt;|| &lt;code&gt;re.LOCALE&lt;/code&gt; || Makes the behavior of some special sequences (&lt;code&gt;\w, \W, \b, \B, \s, \S&lt;/code&gt;) dependent on the current [[w:locale|locale]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;re.M&lt;/code&gt;|| &lt;code&gt;re.MULTILINE&lt;/code&gt; || Makes the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; characters match at the beginning and end of each line, rather than just the beginning and end of the string
|-
| &lt;code&gt;re.S&lt;/code&gt;|| &lt;code&gt;re.DOTALL&lt;/code&gt; || Makes the &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; character match every character ''including'' newlines.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;re.U&lt;/code&gt;|| &lt;code&gt;re.UNICODE&lt;/code&gt; || Makes &lt;code&gt;\w, \W, \b, \B, \d, \D, \s, \S&lt;/code&gt; dependent on Unicode character properties
|-
| &lt;code&gt;re.X&lt;/code&gt;|| &lt;code&gt;re.VERBOSE&lt;/code&gt; || Ignores whitespace except when in a character class or preceded by an non-escaped backslash, and ignores &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; (except when in a character class or preceded by an non-escaped backslash) and everything after it to the end of a line, so it can be used as a comment. This allows for cleaner-looking regexps.
|}

==Pattern objects==
If you're going to be using the same regexp more than once in a program, or if you just want to keep the regexps separated somehow, you should create a pattern object, and refer to it later when searching/replacing.

To create a pattern object, use the compile function.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import re
foo = re.compile(r'foo(.{,5})bar', re.I+re.S)
&lt;/source&gt;
The first argument is the pattern, which matches the string &quot;foo&quot;, followed by up to 5 of any character, then the string &quot;bar&quot;, storing the middle characters to a group, which will be discussed later. The second, optional, argument is the flag or flags to modify the regexp's behavior. The flags themselves are simply variables referring to an integer used by the regular expression engine. In other languages, these would be constants, but Python does not have constants. Some of the regular expression functions do not support adding flags as a parameter when defining the pattern directly in the function, if you need any of the flags, it is best to use the compile function to create a pattern object.

The &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; preceding the expression string indicates that it should be treated as a raw string. This should normally be used when writing regexps, so that backslashes are interpreted literally rather than having to be escaped.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Setting up a New Project==
Depending on which app you plan to code in, you might need to set up a new C++ project before you begin. The instructions for this vary based on the program, so check your program's manual if you are unsure about how to do this.

==GLUT==
Many OpenGL applications take advantage of a cross-platform (Windows, Mac and Linux compatible) toolkit called GLUT, which is used in conjunction with OpenGL. GLUT is used to draw windows and handle mouse and keyboard events, which OpenGL cannot do on its own. There are alternatives to GLUT, but GLUT is the simplest GUI toolkit that runs cross-platform, so we assume you have GLUT installed.

There are many disadvantages to GLUT, which are related to its inflexibility. Since GLUT has to work the same across three very different operating systems, you don't have any  platform-specific features. GLUT itself cannot take advantage of operating-system provided widgets (buttons, pulldown menus). Your application will not be able to change window-level menus (although context-menus can be customized). If these limitations are dealbreakers for your project, you'll have to use an alternative to GLUT. These will be discussed later in this wikibook. For now, just sit tight with GLUT.

==My First OpenGL Program==
Open up (or create) your main.cpp file. You should be familiar with the basic format of this file:
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 {
 	return 0;
 }

===Including the OpenGL Headers===
We're going to need to add some includes here, so we can use OpenGL in our application. Depending on how and where you installed OpenGL, you might have to tweak these paths a bit.
 #include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/glu.h&gt;

This includes the basic OpenGL commands, GLUT and a utility toolkit called GLU which is useful later. Note that if your operating system handles filenames case sensitive (e.g. Linux) you must capitalize the GL before compiling.

If using Visual Studio, make sure to include windows.h before any of the OpenGL headers.

===Creating a Window===
Now that we have our library, we can begin to design our interface by creating our window inside our int main() function:

 #ifndef WIN32 //if using windows then do windows specific stuff.
 #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN //remove MFC overhead from windows.h which can cause slowness
 #define WIN32_EXTRA_LEAN
 
 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
 #endif
 
 #include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/glu.h&gt;
 
 '''void display() { /* empty function   required as of glut 3.0 */ }'''
 
 int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 {
 	'''glutInit(&amp;argc, argv);'''
 	'''glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DEPTH | GLUT_DOUBLE);'''
 	'''glutInitWindowSize(800,600);'''
 	'''glutCreateWindow(&quot;Hello World&quot;);'''
 	'''glutDisplayFunc(display);'''
 	'''glutMainLoop();'''
 	return 0;
 }

We first call glutInit(), which starts up GLUT for our use. Next, we set up a display mode. For now, just use the settings we've provided here for glutInitDisplayMode. You might tweak these settings later. Then we tell GLUT how big we want our window to be; 800 by 600 is OK for now. Finally, we actually create the window with glutCreateWindow(), passing the window title as an argument, and give control of our program to GLUT through glutMainLoop(). ''Never forget to call glutMainLoop() when you use GLUT!''

You might have noticed something so far: every function is prefixed with glut-. When we start actually using OpenGL itself, every function will be prefixed with just a gl-. This is for organization.

Try compiling this application. Hopefully, you should get an 800x600 window with the title Hello World. If you don't, refer to the installation section of this wikibook and consider reinstalling.

===Getting Ready to Draw Stuff===
Most simple OpenGL applications consist of only three elements:
* A setup function, which configures everything before you start actually drawing.
* A display function, which does the actual drawing, and 
* int main(), which we've mostly configured above. int main just calls the setup function, and tells GLUT to use the display function when it needs to.

Some OpenGL code might look sort of like this:

 #ifndef WIN32 //if using windows then do windows specific stuff.
 #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN //remove MFC overhead from windows.h which can cause slowness
 #define WIN32_EXTRA_LEAN
 
 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
 #endif
 
 #include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/glu.h&gt;
 
 '''void setup() { /* empty function  nothing to setup yet */ }'''
 '''void display() { /* empty function   required as of glut 3.0 */ }'''
 
 int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 {
        '''glutInit(&amp;argc, argv);'''
        glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DEPTH | GLUT_DOUBLE);
        glutInitWindowSize(800,600);
        glutCreateWindow(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
 
        '''setup();'''
        '''glutDisplayFunc(display);'''
 
        glutMainLoop();
 
        return 0;
 }
This code itself doesn't draw anything, since display() is empty.

*For a square:
&lt;math&gt;P=4 l&lt;/math&gt; The perimeter is equal to 4 times the length (l) of a side.
*For a rectangle:
&lt;math&gt;P=2 (b+h)&lt;/math&gt; The perimeter is equal to 2 times the sum of the base plus the height.
*For regular polygons
&lt;math&gt;P=n l&lt;/math&gt; The perimeter is equal to the number of sides (n) times the length (l) of a side.

Circles do not have sides made of line segments like polygons do but they do have a perimeter known as a circumference.
&lt;math&gt;C=2*\pi*r&lt;/math&gt; The circumference is equal to 2 times pi times the radius (r).

== Area ==
Area of a shape is how much space is inside the perimeter.

*For a triangle:
&lt;math&gt;A={b h \over 2}&lt;/math&gt; The area is equal to the product of the base (b) times the height (h) divided by 2.
*For a square:
&lt;math&gt;A=l^2&lt;/math&gt; The area is equal to the length (l) of a side squared.
*For a rectangle: 
&lt;math&gt;A=b h&lt;/math&gt; The area is equal to the length of the base (b) times the base of the height (h).
*For a circle:
&lt;math&gt;A=\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt; The area is equal to pi times the radius (r) squared.

*For polygons with irregular shapes a sum of smaller areas can be used.  The smaller area must completely compose the polygon.  Useful smaller areas can be squares, triangles, or rectangles.

*There is another method to calculate the area of a polygon located in an 2D coordinate system:
&lt;math&gt;A={1 \over 2} |x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1 + x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2 + x_3 y_4 - x_4 y_3 + ... + x_n y_1 - x_1 y_n|&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(x_i, y_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the ith vertex of the polygon, they have to be given in correct order, clockwise and counter clockwise is both ok. The polygon NEED NOT to be convex.

== Volume ==
Volume is the amount of space an object occupies.  Only shapes with 3 dimensions have a volume. This is because a 2 dimensional object has no thickness, and, therefore, takes-up no space.

*For a cube:
&lt;math&gt;V=l^3&lt;/math&gt; The volume is equal to the length of a side (l) cubed.
*For a rectangular prism
&lt;math&gt;V=b w h&lt;/math&gt; The volume is equal to the base (b) times the width (w) times the height (h).
*For a sphere
&lt;math&gt;V={4 \over 3}\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt; The volume is equal to four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.
*For a cone or pyramid
&lt;math&gt;V={1 \over 3}Bh&lt;/math&gt; The volume is one-third the area of the base times the height.
* For a cylinder with a base of '''any''' shape (as long as the cross sectional area is constant),
&lt;math&gt; V = A_{base} * h &lt;/math&gt; where h is the height (not slant height) of the cylinder and &lt;math&gt; A_{base} &lt;/math&gt; is the area of the base. For example, the volume of a '''circular cylinder''' is &lt;math&gt; \pi r^2 h &lt;/math&gt;

== Surface Area ==

For most shapes you can find the surface area by adding up the area of all its sides. For example, 

*(closed) Box with dimensions w, l, and h: &lt;math&gt; SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh &lt;/math&gt;
* Closed cube: &lt;math&gt; SA = 6s^2 &lt;/math&gt;
* Closed Cylinder with base area A and base perimeter P: &lt;math&gt; SA = P*h + 2A &lt;/math&gt;
*: For a circular cylinder, &lt;math&gt; SA = 2\pi r h + 2 \pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Spheres are special because they have no sides but using calculus it's possible to show that:

* Sphere: &lt;math&gt; SA = 4\pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Drawing Rectangles==
Recall from the previous chapter our basic structure for OpenGL/GLUT applications.

 #ifndef WIN32 //if using windows then do windows specific stuff.
 #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN //remove MFC overhead from windows.h which can cause slowness
 #define WIN32_EXTRA_LEAN
 
 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
 #endif
 
 #include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;
 #include &lt;GL/glu.h&gt;
 #include &lt;conio.h&gt;//needed for getch
 
 void setup() { /* empty function  nothing to setup yet */ }
 void display() { /* empty function   required as of glut 3.0 */ }
 
 int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 {
        glutInit(&amp;argc, argv);
        glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DEPTH | GLUT_DOUBLE);
        glutInitWindowSize(800,600);
        glutCreateWindow(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
 
        setup();
        glutDisplayFunc(display);
 
        glutMainLoop();
 
        getch();//pause here to see results or lack there of
        return 0;
 }
We're now going to add some things to the '''setup()''' and '''display()''' functions so we can draw a rectangle. 

===Changing the Background Colour===
Let's add a line to our setup function:
 void setup() {
        '''glClearColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);'''
 }
Calling '''glClearColor()''' with these arguments will change the background color to white. For now, we're going to leave this line as is without explanation. We'll return to what the 1.0s mean later.

===Preparing to Draw===
To allow us to draw, GLUT needs to clear the screen every time we work. This is accomplished through two functions, one at the beginning and one at the end of our display function:

 void display() {
        '''glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);'''
        '''/* drawing commands would go here, if we had any yet... */'''
        '''glutSwapBuffers();'''
 }

By using '''glClear()''', we give ourselves a clean slate to work on; everything that was in our buffer (the place in memory where we store the rendering image) before is gone. We're now using a new buffer, so at the end of the function, we need to switch that buffer into our window. In GLUT, this is accomplished through calling '''glutSwapBuffers()'''.

Don't worry if you don't fully understand why these two functions exist just yet. You'll have time to learn.

===Okay, NOW can I draw?===
Let's add a function to display that will give us a simple rectangle:
 void display() {
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
        '''glColor3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);'''
        '''glRectf(-0.75f,0.75f, 0.75f, -0.75f);'''
        glutSwapBuffers();
 }

Again, ignore the arguments to '''glColor3f()'''. Just trust us for now that this will make our rectangle black, so we can see it against the white background. Then we actually draw the rectangle using the function '''glRectf()'''. We pass in as parameters to '''glRectf()''' two sets of numbers: the x and y coordinates for one vertex of the rectangle you want to draw, and the x and y coordinates for the opposite vertex. An important thing to note is that these x and y coordinates are not given in pixels, but rather in viewport coordinates.

===The Viewport===
You'll notice, if you compile and run the program using the display function above and then resize the window, that your rectangle will grow and shrink as your window does. In this example, the rectangle will take up exactly 75% of the width and 75% of the height of the window. This is because we haven't set our viewport.

The viewport defines how coordinates are mapped from OpenGL space, which uses floating point numbers, to the window space which obviously uses pixels. By default, the viewport assumes that the top left is (-1, 1), the bottom left is (-1, -1), the top right is (1, 1) and the bottom right is (1, -1), ''regardless of the window position''.

====Adding illustrations====
I added some images to &quot;our tools&quot; and &quot;constructing equilateral triangle&quot;. I released them to the public domain. I'm completely new to this, so if I messed anything up, let me know or revert to the previous version. I'd like to add more illustrations. 

I made the compass and ruler as 3D Blender scenes, so it's easy to make new 2D images. I forgot to add a summary of my edits. I probably should have discussed this before going ahead? Any suggestions for improvements or corrections of mistakes are welcome.

[[User:Mcgill|Mcgill]] 10:35, 05 September 2006 (UTC)

====More updates====
I added more diagrams to some chapters. A lot of this book will need drastic simplification if it's going to be understood by kids. I've almost finished the diagrams for &quot;Constructing a triangle&quot; - drawing them in autoCAD was difficult enough for me, getting a child to draw them on paper could be seen as a form of mental torture. Need much clearer explanations or maybe consider omitting the chapter.&lt;br/&gt;[[User:Mcgill|Mcgill]] 18:31, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

====To illustrate my previous point====

The diagram for &quot;Constructing a Triangle&quot; would look like this:&lt;br/&gt;
[[image:GEOM constr temp.png]]&lt;br/&gt;
(where AB is one side and I carelessly forgot to label the remaining vertex;) I intend to break the construction into three stages, erasing the construction lines after each stage. Hopefully that might simplify it a bit.&lt;br/&gt;
[[User:Mcgill|Mcgill]] 19:45, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

====Updates====

The triangle construction has been simplified a bit.

== Copyright violation from another site ==
Hi, i'd like to report that the page [http://www.panload.com/page.php?id=3030 linked here] and some other related pages have been copied from [[Geometry for elementary school|this wikibook]]. --[[Special:Contributions/84.221.88.72|84.221.88.72]] ([[User talk:84.221.88.72|talk]]) 20:31, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

== A Question / Suggestion == 
This is a very good wikibook, but it seems a bit complicated for an elementary school student. I could be totally wrong but maybe we should make the articles a little bit easier with simpler math and less complicated words.  --[[User:Sanitized|Sanitized]] ([[User talk:Sanitized|talk]]) 05:47, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

I agree with the above person and share the opinion. Wikijunior has books supposedly aimed at children upto 12.(with some give and take, consider 14)
But this book treats topics like fractals, with summations of infinite geometric series, and what not!
I think the book ought to be made simpler and more interesting, possibly with more illustrations or something.
Please note that a 12 yr old can neither understand, nor is interested in an equation with a &quot;sigma&quot;, summing up an &quot;infinite series&quot;, none of which he/she knows about, to give an answer that says (4/3)^n, when they can barely understand what 3^2 is!!! &lt;anon&gt;  10:39, 30 Jan 2009 UTC

More interesting sure, but we're talking about 12 year olds here, not people who can &quot;barely understand what 3^2 is&quot;!  Summing infinite series and fractals are highly interesting to many kids from 7 or 8 upwards, and if a kid doesn't know about them then surely that's what this book is about?  Of course, more explanation is always welcome though...

I'm a 12-year-old. 3^2 is 9, right? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:31, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

:Maybe you folks are already familiar with this, but &amp;mdash; After hanging around Wikijunior long enough I learned from xixtas about the Gunning fog index, and other such metrics, that give ballpark estimates of the grade level of reading difficulty of a text.  (There's a special place in my heart for the Gunning fog index because &quot;fog&quot; really is ''fog'':  Gunning claimed that &quot;much of the reading problem is a writing problem&quot;, because the writing people were trying to read was &quot;full of fog and unnecessary complexity.&quot;)  When I'm curious to get a second opinion on the rough reading level of a passage, I use [http://www.addedbytes.com/code/readability-score/ this web page].  BTW, if you run the Preamble to the US Constitution through it &amp;mdash; the preface to that great defining document whose authors, so we're told, made the bold decision to write in plain language that anyone could understand, rather than lawyer-ese &amp;mdash; you'll find that that has a Gunning Fog Index of about 27.5: apparently, it's plain language suitable for anyone who has 12 years of grade school, four years of college, and another eleven and a half years of graduate school.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:59, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

== Exercises ==

Why there is no [[:Category:Exercises|Category for Exercises]] in the Wikibooks? I am specially interested (but not restricted to) math exercises; I wrote some in the [http://pt.wikibooks.org/wiki/Categoria:Exerc%C3%ADcios_de_geometria Portuguese mirror]. [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] ([[User talk:Albmont|talk]]) 20:15, 13 August 2008 (UTC)

== CAPS ==
Shouldn't the title [[Geometry for elementary school]] be in capitol letters?
I would change it to [[Geometry for Elementary School]], but that would mess up all the links.
Anyone know how to do this graciously?

==Needs Proofreading==

Hi. I was just having a look at the PDF version of this book, and discovered a typo in the Notation section: &quot;The notation that is used in the book is defined at the first time it is used. However, '''''it''''' order to simplify the use, it is also summarized in a special chapter. - Clearly this should read &quot;in order to simplify the use...&quot; - If this book is gonna go to featured status, it needs a thorough proofread before it gets there :) I'll correct the error I pointed out, but I have no idea if there may be others. [[User:BarkingFish|BarkingFish]] ([[User talk:BarkingFish|talk]]) 23:01, 22 June 2010 (UTC)

Scratch that, it appears to have been already corrected. But the version which appeared when I clicked on a link for a PDF clearly had that error in. Anyone got any ideas what could be going on there? [[User:BarkingFish|BarkingFish]] ([[User talk:BarkingFish|talk]]) 23:06, 22 June 2010 (UTC)

:PDFs are not automatically updated. You have to go and make another PDF if you want to update it. :) It would be great if you could make one ''after'' I finish the remaining modules! Thanks!

::No problem, Kayau. Let me know when you've done the remaining modules, and I'll regenerate the PDF and upload it again. [[User:BarkingFish|BarkingFish]] ([[User talk:BarkingFish|talk]]) 15:28, 5 July 2010 (UTC)

== Some pages speedied ==

I feel a tad guilty about leaving things undone in this book, especially since the book used to look different, so I've speedied a few pages that I'd planned but don't think I'll be able to finish. If you think you can write them you're welcome to. [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Transformations==
In preparation for drawing more complex 2D and 3D shapes, we should understand what transformations are. Transformations allow you to move objects around your window, as well as rotate and scale them.

===Translations===
Translations allow you to draw objects up, down, left, and right in your 2D scene. (When we get to 3D, you'll be drawing using depth coordinates too.) Just like we positioned points and lines, we translate around the scene in preparation of drawing an object in that place.

Translations are accomplished using: 
 glTranslatef(xTranslation, yTranslation, zTranslation);

Let's demonstrate how translations work by editing the display function of our basic OpenGL template.
 void display() {
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
        '''glColor3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);'''
        '''glTranslatef(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);'''
        '''glutSolidTeapot(0.25);'''
        glutSwapBuffers();
 }
Here, we set the color to black using glColor3f, then translate 0.5 up and 0.5 to the right. (We haven't talked about Z much yet, so we'll just leave that 0.0 for now.) The result is a teapot drawn in the upper right hand corner of the screen.

===Rotations===

===Scaling===

Bongard problems challenge you to find a common property in a series of pictures that is not present in another series. They make up a problem in artificial intelligence ([[w:Bongard_problem|Wikipedia article]]) but they are entertaining puzzles, too.

* [[Italian/Italian culture|Italian Culture ~ ''Cultura italiana'']]

==Why learn Italian? - ''Perché imparare l'italiano?'' ==
Italian is the official language of Italy, San Marino, the Ticino and Grigioni cantons of Switzerland. It is the second official language in Vatican City, after [[Latin]], and in some areas of Istria in Slovenia, Croatia and Libya with an Italian minority. It is the first language of 65 million people and the second language of an additional 14 million around the world.  
Italian is important to the field of music, as many operas are written in it, and it is the origin of some musical expressions.

Italian is taught in many schools around the world. In parts of Canada, Italian is, after French, the second most taught language. In the United States and the United Kingdom, Italian ranks fourth. Throughout the world, Italian is the fifth most taught non-native language, after English, French, Spanish and German. It is also highly mutually intelligible with Spanish and Portuguese (and to a lesser extent French), and can give a broader understanding of Romance languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The fewer words you use, the more powerful the message of a sentence is.

We'll learn how &quot;the boy's dog&quot; or &quot;the dog of the boy&quot; is expressed in Arabic.
While in English the word &quot;of&quot; is used to express something in Arabic no word is needed. In English the suffix apostrophe &quot;s&quot; could be used instead, but in Arabic no extra attachment is necessary.

How does Arabic avoid using a word or a suffix like English does to express what this lesson is about? Well, it makes use of word order that would be non-sensical in English.

&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;الولد&lt;/font&gt; means   the boy   (el-walad)
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;كتاب&lt;/font&gt; means   a book    (kitaab)

In Arabic these two words, believe it or not are all you need to make a sentence. Yet, this lesson is about making a sentence fragment.


&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;كتاب الولد&lt;/font&gt;  the boy's book (kitaabU el-walad[i])
If we look at it word for word. The first part is ''kitaab''' which translates to &quot;book&quot;. The second word is &quot;el-walad&quot; which translates to &quot;the boy&quot;.
So a word-for-word translation might be: book the boy

That doesn't make any sense in English. to fix it up we'd have to add &quot;of&quot;.
So that it becomes &quot;book of the boy&quot;.

the boy's book (kitaabu el-walad) [kitaabulwalad] &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; كتاب الولد&lt;/font&gt;


the girl's book (kitaabu el-bint) [kitaabulbint] &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; كتاب البنت&lt;/font&gt;


the boy's chair (kursiyyu el-walad) [kursiyyulwalad] &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; كرسي الولد&lt;/font&gt;


the girl's chair (kursiyyu el-bint) [kursiyyulbint] &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; كرسي البنت&lt;/font&gt;


the book's owner ('''s'''aa'''h'''ib el-kitaabi) ['''s'''aa'''h'''ibulkitaab]&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; صاحب الكتاب&lt;/font&gt;


the notebooks's owner ('''s'''aa'''h'''ibu el-daftari)&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; صاحب الدفتر&lt;/font&gt;


the man's book (kitaabu el-rajuli)&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; كتاب الرجل&lt;/font&gt;


the woman's book (kitaabu el-mar'äti)&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; كتاب المرأة&lt;/font&gt;

      <comment>/* Auxiliary verbs / Verbi ausiliari */ removing egli and ella which in all my time I have never heard used. Plus it seems strange that only the table for essere used the terms and not the avere table.egli(lui)/ella</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to conjugate verbs / ''Come coniugare i verbi''==
===Auxiliary verbs / ''Verbi ausiliari''===
The two most important verbs in Italian, by far, are ''avere'' (to have) and ''essere'' (to be). They are called ''verbi ausiliari'' (auxiliary verbs), and they are irregular in nearly every tense, including the present indicative, sometimes extremely so. Here are their conjugations.

'''Avere''' (to have):
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!'''Italian'''
!'''English'''
|-
|(Io) h'''o'''
|I have
|-
|(tu) hai
|you (singular) have
|-
|(lui/lei/Lei) h'''a'''
|he/she/you (singular formal) has
|-
|(noi) abb'''iamo''' 
|we have
|-
|(voi) av'''ete''' 
|you (plural) have
|-
|(loro) hanno 
|they have
|}


'''Essere''' (to be):
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!'''Italian'''
!'''English'''
|-
|(Io) son'''o'''
|I am
|-
|(tu) sei
|you (singular) are 
|-
|(lui/lei/Lei) è
|he/she/you (singular formal) is
|-
|(noi) s'''iamo''' 
|we are
|-
|(voi) si'''ete''' 
|you (plural) are
|-
|(loro) s'''ono'''
|they are
|}

===Regular verbs / ''Verbi regolari''===
In Italian, regular verbs are the most common ones. They always end with ''-are'', ''-ere'', and ''-ire'', are the same in the first person (singular and plural) and second person singular.  They are different in the third person (singular and plural) and second person plural. According to the different suffix, verbs are assigned to one of the three regular conjugation of verbs in Italian. For instance:

*''amare'' (to love): is a first conjugation verb (''prima coniugazione''); 
*''ripetere'' (to repeat): is a second conjugation verb (''seconda coniugazione'');
*''dormire'' (to sleep): is a third conjugation verb (''terza coniugazione'').

Here is a table of the regular present indicative for ''-are'', ''-ere'', and ''-ire'' verbs.

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!Who
!'''amàre (''to love'')'''
!'''ripétere (''to repeat'')'''
!'''dormìre (''to sleep'')'''
|-
|Io 
|àm'''o'''
|ripét'''o'''
|dòrm'''o'''
|-
|tu
|àm'''i'''
|ripét'''i'''
|dòrm'''i'''
|-
|lui/lei/Lei 
|àm'''a'''
|ripét'''e'''
|dòrm'''e'''
|-
|noi 
|am'''iàmo'''
|ripet'''iàmo'''
|dorm'''iàmo''' 
|-
|voi 
|am'''àte'''
|ripet'''éte''' 
|dorm'''ìte''' 
|-
|Essi/loro
|àm'''ano'''
|ripét'''ono'''
|dòrm'''ono''' 
|}

It is important to note the change of stress position in different person forms. Regular verbs follow the same position change. Stress is shown in table above to help learning, it is not written in real texts (see [[Italian/Pronunciation#Accents_and_stresses|Pronunciation]] for details on stress).

==Irregular verbs / ''Verbi irregolari''==
In Italian, there are also several irregular verbs. A very few of them do not even apply to the conjugation previously seen, such as ''porre'' (to put down, to place) and ''tradurre'' (to translate); actually they derive from second conjugation (''ponere'',''traducere''). This is a list of common usage verbs which are known to be irregular, and do not apply to the conjugation rules seen before:

*''andare'' (to go)
*''bere'' (to drink)
*''cercare'' (to seek, to look for)
*''dare'' (to give)
*''dire'' (to say)
*''fare'' (to do, to make)
*''piacere'' (to like)
*''stare'' (to stay, to remain)
*''uscire'' (to leave, to go out)
*''venire'' (to come)
*''vivere'' (to live)

==Modal verbs / ''Verbi servili''==
Three other important verbs, ''dovere'', ''potere'' and ''volere'', are irregular too; these three particular verbs are known as ''verbi servili'' (modal verbs), as they have the function to &quot;serve&quot; and &quot;support&quot; other infinite verbs. In particular:
*'''''dovere''''' is equivalent to the English modal verb ''must'', but also the ''have to'' form: for instance, ''devo studiare'' (I have to study, I must study).
*'''''potere''''' is equivalent to the English modal verbs ''can'' and ''may'': for instance, ''puoi andare'' (You can go, you may go).
*'''''volere''''' expresses willingness to do something, and is actually equivalent to the English verbs ''to want'', ''to wish'' and ''to will''; for instance, ''voglio mangiare'' (I want to eat). The verb ''volere'' can be also used in non-modal forms, that is not in support of an infinite verb.

&lt;center&gt;Adoptée par l'Assemblée constituante du 20 au 26 août 1789, acceptée par le roi le 5 octobre 1789&lt;/center&gt;

Les représentants du peuple français, constitués en Assemblée nationale, considérant que l'ignorance, l'oubli ou le mépris des droits de l'homme sont les seules causes des malheurs publics et de la corruption des gouvernements, ont résolu d'exposer, dans une Déclaration solennelle, les droits naturels, inaliénables et sacrés de l'homme, afin que cette Déclaration, constamment présente à tous les membres du corps social, leur rappelle sans cesse leurs droits et leurs devoirs; afin que les actes du pouvoir législatif, et ceux du pouvoir exécutif pouvant à chaque instant être comparés avec le but de toute institution politique, en soient plus respectés; afin que les réclamations des citoyens, fondées désormais sur des principes simples et incontestables, tournent toujours au maintien de la Constitution et au bonheur de tous.

==Text ''Declaration of Rights''==

En conséquence, l'Assemblée nationale reconnaît et déclare, en présence et sous les auspices de l'Être suprême, les droits suivants de l'homme et du citoyen:

*Article premier - Les hommes naissent et demeurent libres et égaux en droits. Les distinctions sociales ne peuvent être fondées que sur l'utilité commune.

*Article II - Le but de toute association politique est la conservation des droits naturels et imprescriptibles de l'homme. Ces droits sont la liberté, la propriété, la sûreté, et la résistance à l'oppression.

*Article III - Le principe de toute souveraineté réside essentiellement dans la nation. Nul corps, nul individu ne peut exercer d'autorité qui n'en émane expressément.

*Article IV - La liberté consiste à faire tout ce qui ne nuit pas à autrui: ainsi l'exercice des droits naturels de chaque homme n'a de bornes que celles qui assurent aux autres membres de la société la jouissance de ces mêmes droits. Ces bornes ne peuvent être déterminées que par la loi.

*Article V - La loi n'a le droit de défendre que les actions nuisibles à la société. Tout ce qui n'est pas défendu par la loi ne peut être empêché, et nul ne peut être contraint à faire ce qu'elle n'ordonne pas.

*Article VI - La loi est l'expression de la volonté générale. Tous les citoyens ont droit de concourir personnellement, ou par leurs représentants, à sa formation. Elle doit être la même pour tous, soit qu'elle protège, soit qu'elle punisse. Tous les citoyens, étant égaux à ses yeux, sont également admissibles à toutes dignités, places et emplois publics, selon leurs capacités et sans autre distinction que celle de leurs vertus et de leurs talents.

*Article VII - Nul homme ne peut être accusé, arrêté ni détenu que dans les cas déterminés par la loi, et selon les formes qu'elle a prescrites. Ceux qui sollicitent, expédient, exécutent ou font exécuter des ordres arbitraires, doivent être punis; mais tout citoyen appelé ou saisi en vertu de la loi doit obéir à l'instant; il se rend coupable par la résistance.

*Article VIII - La loi ne doit établir que des peines strictement et évidemment nécessaires, et nul ne peut être puni qu'en vertu d'une loi établie et promulguée antérieurement au délit et légalement appliquée.

*Article IX - Tout homme étant présumé innocent jusqu'à ce qu'il ait été déclaré coupable, s'il est jugé indispensable de l'arrêter, toute rigueur qui ne sera pas nécessaire pour s'assurer de sa personne doit être sévèrement réprimée par la loi.

*Article X - Nul ne doit être inquiété pour ses opinions, même religieuses, pourvu que leur manifestation ne trouble pas l'ordre public établi par la loi.

*Article XI - La libre communication des pensées et des opinions est un des droits les plus précieux de l'homme: tout citoyen peut donc parler, écrire, imprimer librement, sauf à répondre de l'abus de cette liberté, dans les cas déterminés par la loi.

*Article XII - La garantie des droits de l'homme et du citoyen nécessite une force publique: cette force est donc instituée pour l'avantage de tous et non pour l'utilité particulière de ceux auxquels elle est confiée.

*Article XIII - Pour l'entretien de la force publique et pour les dépenses d'administration, une contribution commune est indispensable. Elle doit être également répartie entre tous les citoyens, en raison de leurs facultés.

*Article XIV - Chaque citoyen a le droit, par lui-même ou par ses représentants, de constater la nécessité de la contribution publique, de la consentir librement, d'en suivre l'emploi et d'en déterminer la quotité, l'assiette, le recouvrement et la durée.

*Article XV - La société a le droit de demander compte à tout agent public de son administration.

*Article XVI - Toute société dans laquelle la garantie des droits n'est pas assurée, ni la séparation des pouvoirs déterminée, n'a pas de Constitution.

*Article XVII - La propriété étant un droit inviolable et sacré, nul ne peut en être privé, si ce n'est lorsque la nécessité publique, légalement constatée, l'exige évidemment, et sous la condition d'une juste et préalable indemnité.

&lt;center&gt;'''Solutions requirements'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Solutions must:
* Use only standard C++.
* Be compilable.
* Be in accordance to general coding practices. (no esoteric demonstrations are required)
and should:
* Handle error situations, even if behavior is not defined. Acceptable default is simply reporting an &quot;Error&quot;.
* Be internally consistent in relation to the adopted coding-style.
* Be as simple as possible on to the point (use the minimum required variables and function calls/classes and reduces convoluted I/O handling).
Please do not add solutions that are 99% similar to another that is already present, if it is an improvement just add it to the existing solution.

{{NOTE|Revisers are not required to provide commentary on the errors only to tag the exercise as failing the requested function. Use the talk page to clarify any issues or help submitters if the issue are purely logical, report to the book text otherwise. Fixing failed attempts should be proposed as an extended exercise whenever possible.}}

===EXERCISE 1 ===
Write a program that asks the user to type an [[w:Integer|integer]] and writes &quot;YOU WIN&quot; if the value is between 56 and 78 (both included). In the other case it writes &quot;YOU LOSE&quot;. 
{{solution|title=Solution|text=

int main()
{
	int i;

	cin &gt;&gt; i;
	if (i&gt;=58 &amp;&amp; i&lt;=78)
	{
		cout &lt;&lt; &quot;YOU WIN&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
	} 
	else 
	{			
		cout &lt;&lt; &quot;YOU LOSE&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

===EXERCISE 2 ===
Write a program that asks the user to type all the integers between 8 and 23 (both included) using a '''for''' loop.

===EXERCISE 10===
Write a program that is able to compute some operations on an integer. The program writes the value of the integer and writes the following menu : &lt;br/&gt;

1. Add 1&lt;br/&gt;
2. Multiply by 2&lt;br/&gt;
3. Subtract 4&lt;/br&gt;
4. Quit&lt;br/&gt;

The programs ask the user to type a value between 1 and 4. If the user types a value from 1 to 3 the operation is computed, the integer is written and the menu is displayed again. If the user types 4, the program quits.

===EXERCISE 11===
Write a program that asks the user to type a positive integer. When the user types a negative value the program writes ERROR and asks for another value. When the user types 0, that means that the last value has been typed and the program must write the average of the positive integers. If the number of typed values is zero the program writes 'NO AVERAGE'.

===EXERCISE 26 ===
Write a program that asks the user to input 5 sequences of characters. Then it will ask the user for a character to search for and will output the maximum number of times that it occurred between the 5 sequences.
Example: 
Sequence 1: aabc
Sequence 2: aaaa
If the user chooses to search for character 'a', the program will output &quot;Character a occurred a maximum of 4 times&quot; because it occurred 4 times in the second sequence, and only twice in the first sequence.

===EXERCISE 4===
Write a program that asks the user to type 10 integers of an array and an integer value V. The program must search if the value V exists in the array and must remove the first occurrence of V, shifting each following element left and adding a zero at the end of the array. The program must then write the final array.

===EXERCISE 9===
Ecrire un programme qui saisit 2 tableaux de 10 entiers a et b qui doivent être triés dans l'ordre croissant. Le programme devra tout d'abord vérifier que les deux tableaux sont triés. Le tableau c est un tableau de 20 entiers. Le programme doit mettre dans c la fusion des tableaux a et b. Le tableau c devra contenir les éléments de a et ceux de b et devra être trié. Le programme affiche ensuite le tableau c.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The topic of '''early literacy''' is a very controversial issue because it is hard to tell when a child is ready to start reading, and if flags should be raised if child is not reading by a certain time. However, it is agreed that literacy starts before any formal education takes place. Parents promote literacy in babies by talking to them, singing, and reading stories. This book hopes to provide information to parents about early literacy in general. Strategies and ideas for parents and educators on how to promote early literacy in the home and in the classroom. There is also a bibliography which includes facts and research findings backing up the ideas and strategies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sole proprietorship is the most simple and most prevailent type of business. It consists of a single owner who personally undertakes all rights and responsibilities of the business, and has unlimited liability. Effectively, the person running the business is the business itself. There is no separate &quot;entity&quot; and there are no special rights or responsibilities for a sole proprietor beyond those of a normal private citizen. 

A sole proproprietor may often be required to register the name of their business under a provincial statute. For example in Nova Scotia the business must register its name under section 4 of the ''Partnership and Business Names Registation Act''. 

Features of Sole proprietorship:
* unlimited personal liability
* duration limited to the lifespan of the owner
* income is taxed at the same rate as a private individual

* Unify the examples in the SOAP and WSDL sections
* Set up the SOAP section just like the WSDL section by first putting the code for a SOAP document, and than going through and explaining what each part does
* More information about SOAP
* Take out the Dot.Net perspective part


-blake schernekau


== Editorial Board ==

viji - 3/8/06

* '''Please bold words that are defined'''
** the definition of the term 'web services' is scattered: it begins at the top of the Web services section and continues in another paragraph(&quot;Web service is simply an application service supplied ...&quot;) - could you consolidate  the definitions and present them all at the beginning so the reader has a whole definition.  If you need, you can refer to any aspect of the definition in the rest of the chapter.
** could you clearly define distributed computing 

* '''Please remove the numbering column on the sample code table'''

* I agree with getting rid of the .net perspective

* I would like to see a set up for the reader - a story or reason why someone would want to use this application.  The examples show the temperatures by city.  Perhaps you could introduce the example with a story of how this was incorporated in the Tourism guide using SOAP.
** Chapter 15 in the 'XML for Dummies' book has a good bit of information on web services and can maybe help explain SOAP with examples.  -- Dr. Watson has a copy of the book and is willing to lend it out.

* Remember to go thru the checklist

Thank you,
Viji

Dr. Watson - I think the names of the authors that appear at the top of this page should maybe be part to the preface or a history page and include the subsequent editors.

== Professor ==
I agree with removing .net material and Viji's comments. Put the .net material in an appendix to this chapter so the material is not lost. 

Make certain you have a tested problem for the class to work on.

== Sample Surveys ==
Sample surveys involve the selection and study of a sample of items from a population.  A sample is just a set of members chosen from a population, but not the whole population.  A survey of a whole population is called a '''census'''.

A sample from a population may not give accurate results but it helps in decision making.

=== Examples ===

Examples of sample surveys:

*Phoning the fifth person on every page of the local phonebook and asking them how long they have lived in the area. (Systematic Sample)

*Dropping a quad. in five different places on a field and counting the number of wild flowers inside the quad. (Cluster Sample)

*Selecting sub-populations in proportion to their incidence in the overall population.  For instance, a researcher may have reason to select a sample consisting 30% females and 70% males in a population with those same gender proportions. (Stratified Sample)

*Selecting several cities in a country, several neighbourhoods in those cities and several streets in those neighbourhoods to recruit participants for a survey (Multi-stage sample)

The term random sample is used for a sample in which every item in the population is equally likely to be selected.

=== Bias ===

While sampling is a more cost effective method of determining a result, small samples or samples that depend on a certain selection method will result in a bias within the results. 

The following are common sources of bias:
* Sampling bias or statistical bias, where some individuals are more likely to be selected than others (such as if you give equal chance of cities being selected rather than weighting them by size)
* Systemic bias, where external influences try to affect the outcome (e.g. funding organizations wanting to have a specific result)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Naming  Conventions==
Now that we've used some OpenGL functions, it's time we understood what those '''3f'''s meant in those functions we've been using.

===OpenGL Functions===
OpenGL functions are always named in the following manner:

[[Image:OpenGLFunctionNamingConventions.jpg]]

: &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;First comes the prefix. In this example, gl- refers to a built-in OpenGL function. Functions from GLUT will be prefixed with glut- instead. Later, we'll see that GLU functions are similarly prefixed with glu-.&lt;/span&gt;

: &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;This is followed by the actual function name. Here, we're changing a color, so we provide Color as our function name.&lt;/span&gt;

: &lt;span style=&quot;color:#009900&quot;&gt;Next comes the number of arguments we plan to give to the function. Here we want to give it 3 arguments, so we write 3. In functions with an unfixed number of arguments (e.g. '''glTranslatef'''), this number is omitted.&lt;/span&gt;

: &lt;span style=&quot;color:#FF00FF&quot;&gt;Following the number of arguments, we have the type of arguments we plan to give. This can be either b, s, i, f or d in most cases, standing for byte, short, integer, float or double respectively. Use ub, us, ui for unsigned byte, short or integer.  Append a v here to pass an array instead of separate arguments. &lt;/span&gt;

: &lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;Finally, we have the actual arguments.&lt;/span&gt;

====Pick Your Battles, Pick Your Arguments====

Many functions are available with a different number of arguments. For example, the function glVertex2f() which we used in the last chapter takes 2 float parameters, x and y:

 &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;gl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Vertex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#009900&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FF00FF&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;(float x, float y)&lt;/span&gt;

may also be called with a third parameter, z, by using:

 &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;gl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Vertex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#009900&quot;&gt;'''3'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FF00FF&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;(float x, float y, '''float z''')&lt;/span&gt;

or with integers instead of floats:

 &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;gl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Vertex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#009900&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FF00FF&quot;&gt;'''i'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;('''int''' x, '''int''' y, '''int''' z)&lt;/span&gt;

or with an array of three floats:

 &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;gl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Vertex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#009900&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#FF00FF&quot;&gt;'''fv'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;('''float *''' array)&lt;/span&gt;

===OpenGL Data Types===
OpenGL defines some data types that are preferable to the built-in C data types. The more commonly used ones are:

* GLenum
* GLboolean
* GLvoid
* GLbyte
* GLshort
* GLint
* GLubyte
* GLushort
* GLuint
* GLsizei
* GLfloat
* GLdouble

Most of these are self explanatory. GLenum refers to a constant, and any type that starts with '''u''' means unsigned. All these types are equivalent but preferable to their C counterparts when writing OpenGL code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Color==

===Using RGB to Define a Color===
[[Image:AdditiveColorMixiing.svg|120px|left]]

There are many ways to specify a color in computer graphics, but one of the simplest and most widely used methods of describing a color is the RGB color model. RGB stands for the colors red, green and blue: the additive primary colors. Each of these colors is given a value, in OpenGL usually a value between 0 and 1. 1 means as much of that color as possible, and 0 means none of that color. We can mix these three colors together to give us a complete range of colors, as shown to on the left.

For instance, pure red is represented as (1, 0, 0) and full blue is (0, 0, 1). White is the combination of all three, denoted (1, 1, 1), while black is the absence of all three, (0, 0, 0). Yellow is the combination of red and green, as in (1, 1, 0). Orange is yellow with slightly less green, represented as (1, 0.5, 0).

For more information on RGB, see the [[w:RGB|Wikipedia article]].

===Using glColor3f===
glColor3f() takes 3 arguments: the red, green and blue components of the color you want. After you use glColor3f, everything you draw will be in that color. For example, consider this display function:
 void display() {
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
        '''glColor3f(0.5f, 0.0f, 1.0f); // (0.5, 0, 1) is half red and full blue, giving dark purple.'''
        '''glBegin(GL_QUADS);'''
                '''glVertex2f(-0.75, 0.75);'''
                '''glVertex2f(-0.75, -0.75);'''
                '''glVertex2f(0.75, -0.75);'''
                '''glVertex2f(0.75, 0.75);'''
        '''glEnd();'''
        glutSwapBuffers();
 }

This outputs a rectangle/quad in an attractive purple color.

Play with glColor3f(), passing different arguments in. See if you can make dark green, light gray or teal.

===Giving Individual Vertices Different Colors===
[[Image:OpenGLColorGradient.png|175px|thumb|The output of this program.]]glColor3f can be called in between glBegin and glEnd. When it is used this way, it can be used to give each vertex its own color. The resulting rectangle is then shaded with an attractive color gradient, as shown on the right.
 void display() {
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
        glBegin(GL_QUADS);
                '''glColor3f(0.5f, 0.0f, 1.0f); // make this vertex purple'''
                glVertex2f(-0.75, 0.75);
                '''glColor3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); // make this vertex red'''
                glVertex2f(-0.75, -0.75);
                '''glColor3f(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); // make this vertex green'''
                glVertex2f(0.75, -0.75);
                '''glColor3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); // make this vertex yellow'''
                glVertex2f(0.75, 0.75);
        glEnd();
        glutSwapBuffers();
 }

      <comment>/* Using glBegin with GL_TRIANGLE_FAN */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Drawing Triangles and Quads==
glRectf(), while useful, doesn't allow us very much control over the individual vertices of our rectangle. To give us more control, and the ability to draw more complicated shapes, we have to use different functions.

===Stand-Alone Vertex-Defined Shapes===

====Starting a Vertex-Defined Shape====
To start a shape defined by vertices, we use the glBegin() function. glBegin takes one argument: the type of shape you want to make. Here are some possible arguments:
* GL_TRIANGLES
* GL_QUADS
* GL_POLYGON

A quad is any shape with 4 vertices: a rectangle, a square, a trapezoid, etc. The position of the vertices will define what type of shape it is.

While polygon sounds ideal for drawing complicated shapes, scroll down for a warning on the limitations of polygons: there are quite a few, and you might be better off using a series of connected quads or triangles in certain cases.

====Defining Vertices====
After you have called glBegin, we actually define the vertices using glVertex2f(float xPosition, float yPosition):

 glBegin(GL_XYZ);
 glVertex2f(-1.0f,-0.5f);
 glVertex2f(1.0f,-0.25f);
 ...

'''Important Note:''' The order in which you define vertices is important! In general, if you define the vertices in counter-clockwise order, the front face will be facing towards you, which is usually what you want. The distinction becomes very important once we go into 3D, so make sure to define your vertices counter-clockwise unless you know what you're doing! If you would prefer to define your vertices in clockwise order, make sure to include this function in your setup() function:
 glFrontFace(GL_CW);
which will allow you to draw only in clockwise order.

====Finishing Up====
To end a vertex-defined shape, simply call glEnd(), which takes no arguments.

====Example====
This display function will draw a black trapezoid centered in our screen.
 void display() {
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
        '''glColor3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); // sets color to black.'''
        '''glBegin(GL_QUADS);'''
                '''glVertex2f(-0.25f, 0.25f); // vertex 1'''
                '''glVertex2f(-0.5f, -0.25f); // vertex 2'''
                '''glVertex2f(0.5f, -0.25f); // vertex 3'''
                '''glVertex2f(0.25f, 0.25f); // vertex 4'''
        '''glEnd();'''
        glutSwapBuffers();
 }
'''Note on Style:''' Calls to glVertex() are sometimes indented to separate them from the glBegin and glEnd. The indentation in the previous example was not a mistake.

===Drawing a Series of Connected Shapes Efficiently===
If we're going to draw a series of shape where every one shares an edge or vertex with the other, there's no reason to repeat so many calls to glVertex2f(). Instead, we call glBegin with a special argument to signal that we want a &quot;strip&quot; of these objects.

====Using glBegin with GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP or GL_QUAD_STRIP====
When we call glBegin with either of these two arguments, we can draw a series of triangles or quads, each of which shares one edge with another triangle or quad. One good use for this is drawing complicated shapes, e.g. a 2D Christmas tree. 

A triangle strip is defined by 3 initial vertices for the triangle, and then one vertex for each additional triangle. Any given triangle is formed by its one vertex and the two vertices immediately before. 

A quad strip is defined by 4 initial vertices for the quad, and then two vertices for each additional quad. Any given quad is formed by its two vertices and the two vertices that come immediately before.

====Example====
[[Image:OpenGLHouse.png|thumb|195px|Sample output of this program]]The following code defines a house shape, with a slanted roof, using triangle strips:
 void display() {
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
        '''glColor3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); // sets color to black.'''
        '''glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP); // draw in triangle strips'''
                '''glVertex2f(0.0f, 0.75f); // top of the roof'''
                '''glVertex2f(-0.5f, 0.25f); // left corner of the roof'''
                '''glVertex2f(0.5f, 0.25f); // right corner of the roof'''
                '''glVertex2f(-0.5f, -0.5f); // bottom left corner of the house'''
                '''glVertex2f(0.5f, -0.5f); //bottom right corner of the house'''
        '''glEnd();'''
        glutSwapBuffers();
 }

Here, three triangles are defined, one for the roof, one for the upper left corner of the house, and one for the lower right corner of the house.

====Using glBegin with GL_TRIANGLE_FAN====
If we want to draw a bunch triangles where every triangle shares a predefined vertex (for example, at the origin), we can use a triangle fan. Triangle fans define a shape through an odd number of vertices. The first vertex defines a center point which every triangle will have as a vertex. Every two vertices are then used with the initial vertex to define a triangle.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;#include &lt;GL/glut.h&gt;

void init(){ 
    glClearColor(0,0,0,0);
    glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
    gluOrtho2D(0,100,0,200);
}
void Display(){
     glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

         glVertex2f(-0.4,0);
 	 glVertex2f(0.4,0);
         glColor3f(0,1,0);
 	 glVertex2f(0,-0.5);
     glEnd();
     glFlush(); 
} 

int main(int argc, char **argv){ 	
    glutInit(&amp; argc, argv);
    glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_SINGLE|GLUT_RGB);
    glutInitWindowSize(500,500);

    glutCreateWindow(&quot;line&quot;);
    glutDisplayFunc(Display);
    init();
    glutMainLoop();
	
    return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Shapes Built In to GLUT===
GLUT has a few built-in objects that can be used just by calling a simple function. The most interesting and useful of these are:
{| 
| '''Function'''
| '''2D&amp;nbsp;Shape'''
| '''3D&amp;nbsp;Shape'''
| '''Comments'''
|-
| glutSolidSphere(float radius, int slices, int stacks)
| Circle
| Sphere
| Choose an integer 20-100 for the slices and stacks arguments; the higher the number, the more accurate the sphere/circle.
|-
| glutSolidCube(double size)
| Square
| Cube
|
|-
| glutSolidCone(double base, double height, int slices, int stacks)
| Triangle
| Cone
| The greater the slices argument is, the smoother the cone will appear.
|-
| glutSolidTorus(double innerRadius, double outerRadius, int nSides, int rings)
| 
| Torus
| 
|- 
| glutSolidTeapot(float radius)
| Teapot
| Teapot
| Yes, a teapot. See the Wikipedia article &quot;[[w:Utah Teapot|Utah Teapot]]&quot; to find out why a teapot was chosen.

*I delete some of the list of RSS aggregators. 
 I thought the list is too long and don't have to list so many readers.
 So just list 2-3 reader links for each platform.
 (i still keep the old links:

== Editorial Board - Moussa Mané- ==
Great job !! Very well structured. Only a few things to do: 
* Look at the Author guideline and look where the chapter is not conform (no text color, white box for the code...) 
* You can also look at the check-list that has been set up.
== Professor ==
The summary should come before exercises and answers. Also, check the ordering in the answer's page as it might also be reversed.

Show how to subscribe to an RSS feed for Firefox. For example, screenshots of the relevant screens.

We no longer have links to external files as you can copy and paste the code (eg delete HomePage.xml link)

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: pronunced → pronounced using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">mish=ain't
Note that the word &quot;lissa&quot; is used in exactly the same way by some speakers.
Note that &quot;mish&quot; can be pronounced &quot;mush&quot;.

mish is a useful Arabic slang word. We will use it to make sentences that would translate to...
_________ ain't __________.

So why would we teach a slang word to say &quot;is not&quot; rather than the other type?
# &quot;mish&quot; is extremely useful
# &quot;laisa&quot; is a verb and therefore requires conjugations
# because &quot;laisa&quot; is a verb the predicate changes case



==Words==
notebook (daftar)&lt;font size=&quot;+3&gt; دفتر&lt;/font&gt;

book (kitaab)&lt;font size=&quot;+3&gt; كتاب&lt;/font&gt;

man (rajul)&lt;font size=&quot;+3&gt; رجل&lt;/font&gt;

woman (imra'ä)&lt;font size=&quot;+3&gt; إمرأة &lt;/font&gt;

big (kabiir)&lt;font size=&quot;+3&gt; كبير&lt;/font&gt;

==examples==
el-kitaab mish kabiir.

The book ain't big.


èl-daftar mish kabiir.

The notebook ain't big.




In the next lesson we will learn how to make &quot;is&quot; sentences such as:

The book is big. The notebook is big.

This requires the removal of &quot;mish&quot; from the sentence.

      <comment>/* Commercial Web Hosting */  Added a bit about CurlFtpFS and SSHFS for us Linux people.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[PHP Programming|Back to PHP]]

== Commercial Web Hosting ==

The best scenario is if you have access to a commercial (perhaps free) web hosting service. Most likely it supports PHP and MySQL &quot;out of the box&quot;; it's pretty standard these days. The downside is, unless you have shell access and are comfortable with text-mode text editors, you will have to FTP your PHP scripts to the server every time you make any changes (which will be very often), this gets very annoying after a while. If your desktop is running on Windows, I suggest you download the text editor [http://www.editplus.com/ editplus] , which can open a file over FTP and whenever you save, upload automatically to the FTP site. A good open source alternative is [http://www.jedit.org/ jEdit], which can open and save automatically over FTP and even SFTP (secure) if one installs the [http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?FTP FTP plugin]. jEdit is written in Java, so it runs on Mac OS X, OS/2, Unix, VMS and Windows.  For you Linux people, you can also use something like CurlFtpFS (http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net/), which lets you mount an FTP location as if it were any other mountable object, and thus all those nasty file transfers are done transparently, and you can use any editor you want.  If you're blessed with a shell account, but are equally lazy, SSHFS (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html) is the one for you (assuming you use SSH to access your account...)

Please remember that anytime you upload an executable script to your web site, you create an opportunity for a malicious user to exploit any vulnerabilities in your code. In fact, one of the major advantages of operating on a commercial web host's server is that your scripts are prevented from affecting many critical parts of the machine. As long as you do not store important information on your web site, any damage a malicious user could cause will be kept to a minimum.

Some web hosting companies offer different features but most have a purchased product that allows you to navigate your server space quite easily. It is called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpanel cPanel] and it is a great way to learn how to either start web designing or become an advanced web designer/programmer. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesk Plesk] is similar in nature.

[[image:GENtle_proteolysis_assistant.png|thumb|The proteolysis assistant.]]
The '''proteolysis assistant''' can be invoked from the [[../Protein|protein]] module. It can help with choosing proteases for limited proteolysis, separation of protein domains, etc. There are several list boxes which depend on each other, so it may appear confusing initially.

# First and foremost, the protein is virtually cleaved by the proteases checked in the &lt;tt&gt;Proteases&lt;/tt&gt; list. The cuts from all these proteases in the protein are shown in the &lt;tt&gt;Cuts&lt;/tt&gt; list. The fragments resulting from these cuts are shown in the &lt;tt&gt;Resulting fragments&lt;/tt&gt; list, as well as in the &lt;tt&gt;Gel simulation&lt;/tt&gt;.
# If you know that certain cuts do not take place (e.g., because the recognition motif is protected) you can deselect (uncheck) these cuts in the &lt;tt&gt;Cuts&lt;/tt&gt; list.
# If you know that certain annotated features of the protein are protected from proteases, you can check them in the &lt;tt&gt;Protect features&lt;/tt&gt; list.
# If you want to separate annotated features(e.g., domains) of your protein via proteases, you can select two or more features in the &lt;tt&gt;Separate fragments&lt;/tt&gt; list. Depending on your selection and the state of &lt;tt&gt;Maximum number of proteases&lt;/tt&gt;, the &lt;tt&gt;Cocktail suggestions&lt;/tt&gt; list will be filled with proteases (or combinations of such) that will do the job. Selecting one of these &quot;cocktails&quot;, a more detailed description will be shown below the list, and the respective proteases will be selected in the &lt;tt&gt;Proteases&lt;/tt&gt; list.

The final result of all these settings is the &lt;tt&gt;Resulting fragments&lt;/tt&gt; list. You can &lt;tt&gt;Sort fragments by&lt;/tt&gt; cut position, fragment length, or size (weight). You can check individual fragments, &lt;tt&gt;All&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;None&lt;/tt&gt; of them. Upon &lt;tt&gt;OK&lt;/tt&gt;, several actions can be performed ''on the selected fragments'':
* &lt;tt&gt;Create selected fragments&lt;/tt&gt; will create a new protein module for each selectged fragment
* &lt;tt&gt;Annotate selected fragments&lt;/tt&gt; will add a feature for each of the selected fragments in the current protein module
* &lt;tt&gt;Keep proteases&lt;/tt&gt; will add the proteases selected in the &lt;tt&gt;Proteases&lt;/tt&gt; list to the current protein module</text>

== Style Changes ==
I changed the style of this template to give it a consistent look with the article of the month template.

== Removed Date ==

I removed the date from this template because at this time World War II is still in the beginning stages of development. It will take a while for this book to be finished and until we begin implementing the voting process again I don't feel it is necessary. It also makes the project seem abandoned as it said July 2007, and it is now February 2009. --[[User:Xxagile|Xxagile]] ([[User talk:Xxagile|talk]]) 18:26, 14 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==SBC: Single Board Computers==
Single Board Computers are a complete computer on a single printed circuit board. These usually require only a single power supply. SBCs commonly provide all standard PC I/O support like keyboard, mouse, SVGA, serial and parallel ports, ethernet, IDE, SCSI and USB. Some provide a PCMCIA connector. Late model SBCs are also replete with multiple CPU/Pentium 4/Xeon/AMD configurations.

SBC are commonly used in the industry in process control. Although they are quite expensive and hard to find (in retail), they can be a great way to control a larger robot. For small robots their power consumption would be a problem.

=== Stacking modular connector boards ===

{{ambox | text=''Consider splitting this section out into a separate page, perhaps [[Robotics/modular connectors]]'' }}
{{split}}

Many robots include a &quot;stack&quot; of boards,
typically with a [[Robotics/Computer Control/The Interface/SBC and multichip modules | processor on one board]],
H bridge motor driver on another board,
and a wireless communication on another board.

Many people prefer to build rapid prototypes out of many single-purpose boards that can be disassembled and re-used for the next prototype,
rather than making a single big specialized PCB prototype that is used once for testing and then thrown away.
There are many standards for such electronic pieces.&lt;ref&gt;

''(If I think the stacking idea is good, but my robot is too small for PC/104, do you have any tips for picking an appropriate stacking connector, and arranging which electrical signal/power goes where?)''

The &quot;stackable headers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
are one way to stack boards together.
What other options do we have for stacking connectors?

==Multichip Module Boards==
: ''Is there a better name for this sort of thing? See [[Talk:Robotics#terminology]].''

Multichip Module boards are lighter versions of the SBC. These boards provide less I/O abilities than a full fledged SBC, but are considerably less expensive. For example the Acme [http://www.acmesystems.it/index.php/Welcome_to_the_Acme_Systems_home_page Foxboard] provides a 100Mips processor with 16MB RAM and 4MB Flash running Linux. This board has IDE, SCSI, USB, Ethernet, I2C and more on a surface of aprox. 6x7cm. It consumes about 280mA and costs around €170. While this particular board is designed for embedded internet-enabled applications, it's a great board for controlling your robot. Another alternative is to use a Linksys router and install OpenWRT on it.  You can usually pick these up for around $50.  If you spend some time shopping around you may find similar boards that are better or cheaper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Envisioning Desired Futures ===
The purpose of planning is to identify a &quot;best&quot; set of actions to attain a more desirable future for someone(s).  A [[Water Resources Directory/Best Practices/Public Participation|public participation]] program may developed to identify the &quot;someones&quot; and to enable them and other affected parties to collaboratively define their desired future, which then becomes the target future condition (the goal) for the planning process.  For example, workshops to define the desired future for the Georgia Basin in Canada, using GB-QUEST model, were organized as part of the [http://www.basinfutures.net/about_gbfp/project_components/strategies.cfm Georgia Basin Futures Project].

=== Use of Goals in Planning ===

In a comprehensive multipurpose formulation approach, full consideration is given to all planning objectives and constraints in formulating alternative plans to achieve the multiple purposes.  [http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/iwr/planningcapabilities/docs/planform/m1.ppt#274,5,Multipurpose Formulation Approaches]

=== Purposes ===

*Flood damage reduction (+)
*Navigation (+)
*Ecosystem restoration (+)
*Water quality
*Water supply
*Recreation
*Hydropower generation
*Hurricane and storm damage prevention
*Stormwater management

(+) For a [[Water Resources Directory/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]' project, &quot;a ''Stand alone'' project purpose may only consist of one of the Corps' high priority project purposes:  flood damage reduction, navigation, or ecosystem restoration.&quot;[http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/iwr/planningcapabilities/docs/planform/m1.ppt#273,4,Definitions]

{
	class Class1

I get Hello World! twice followed by You become a teenager at an age of Teenager. I would have expected 13 instead of Teenager. Have I made an error in my program? Thanks. Sorry about messing up the syntax of the code block, but I can't figure it out -- take a look at the edit source. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:70.182.153.38|70.182.153.38]] ([[User talk:70.182.153.38|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/70.182.153.38|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

:That's because &lt;code&gt;Age&lt;/code&gt; is an enumeration, so &lt;code&gt;age.ToString()&lt;/code&gt; returns the enumeration value's name.  To show the underlying integer (13), use this instead:
: &lt;code&gt;Console.WriteLine(&quot;You become a teenager at an age of {0}.&quot;, (int)age);&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Andrew Sylvia, and I am a licensed Real Estate agent in the American state of New Hampshire.

At first glance, the world of Real Estate can seem like a path to easy money, but this is definitely not the case, it takes the ability to withstand multiple and repeated failures because it takes many, many steps for someone to buy a home, and you need to make sure all of them are correct or you'll jeopardize your chances at a sale.

However, the best thing to know is that you're not alone in this, almost 2/3rds of new agents quit within the first year, as long as you have patience and a good corps of people around you, you'll succeed.

My goal with this book is to take the lessons I am currently learning as a new agent both for a reference to myself and future newly minted agents so myself and others can make it into that 1/3rd that sticks with the job and makes a large annual salary.

Please feel free to add any experience or information where it fits, just make sure that you clarify who you are, I don't want to take credit for your work.

You have far more to learn after this, but in order to represent anyone other than yourself in real estate transactions, you need to be a licensed real estate agent or have power of attorney.

      <comment>Macbeth essay for secondary students</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
How Macbeth has changed as a character between Act 2 scene 2 and 3 - Act 5 scenes 3,4 and 5.

Macbeth is a very complex character, who has many layers. He changes a lot throughout the play; 

 How he relates to his wife.
 The choices he makes.


Macbeth’s thoughts and feelings are portrayed through all of these subjects, however the change that is most prominent is the relationship between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. In Act 2, Macbeth is undecided on weather to kill Duncan, his confusion is shown in a monologue  in Act 1 scene 7. Where he decides not to kill Duncan. 
“He’s here in double trust: First I am his Kinsman and his subject, Strong both against deed; then, as his host. 
This shows that Macbeth feels he should not kill Duncan because he has been kind to him the past few days. We can now tell that Macbeth is very compassionate for the people in his life and feels for them strongly. He also has high morals because he believes killing a relative is wrong and a king is even worse because God makes people Kings and if you disrupt the harmony then bad thing’s will happen to you. In Macbeth’s whole speech he shows that love is stronger than power. 

However Lady Macbeth is the more ambitious and powerful character from the both of them and soon persuades him to kill Duncan. We know that Macbeth loves Lady Macbeth very much because on the success of his battle he wrote to tell her the good news. In Act 1 scene 7 Lady Macbeth uses this love to emotionally blackmail him into the murder.
“From this time, such I account my love.”
This is showing that Lady Macbeth is willing to do anything to get into a position of more power. 

In Act 5 there position of power changes and their relationship is much weaker. Lady Macbeth has been driven mad by the guilt of Duncan’s death, even though she said, 
“Go get some water and wash this filthy witness from your hands.”
This is showing that she believes anything can wash right of someone and that there is no need to lose sleep over this particular deed. Whereas in Act 5 she is sleepwalking and trys to get the blood of her hands.
“Out damned spot! Out, I say!”
This is a hallucination but it symbolises, the guilt she is experiencing and feels that Duncan should not have been killed. Overall Shakespeare is showing how she thought she was strong but it became to much to handle. 

Macbeth however was contemplating over his first murder. When he realised how far the death of one person had got him, he started to kill other close friends. He did this because he was covering up for his first murder. However his next few murders were barely spared a thought and he did not confide them to Lady Macbeth. This shows how far a part they have grown and that Macbeth’s compassion has been replaced by power. To reinforce this Shakespeare has directed Lady Macbeth to die so he could show Macbeth’s reaction. Even though she is his wife he is to preoccupied with the forthcoming battle that he can barely spare her a thought. 
“should she have died hereafter, there would have been time for such a word.”

Overall Macbeth and Lady Macbeth have switched roles and his compassion has been replaced by power, so he no longer cares when it is time for him to grieve his wife’s death. Will anybody be mourning him when his time comes?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chapter One-
A rather interesting tale

She may have been a twenty year old woman, but she still had the face of innocence. An inquisitive face that wanted to know the wisdom’s of the world, but as her deep hazel eyes reached into mine, I couldn’t help but let the light in my soul, flicker on. She had a pleasant warmth to her, like a flame in the distanced of a menacing night. As her eyes search mine, her cheeks turned a welcoming pink and she seemed to light up the room with her hope. Her smile was like the sweet smell of spring when the flowers were at there prime. Her auburn hair looked windswept and messy, showing just how much of a struggle her journey was. All to see me. I could only feel gratitude beyond all belief as her fragile hand reached into her pocket and withdrew the reason of her visit. See was beauty…..At least that’s how I hoped it would be.   

Back in the real world, things were much different. Including this particular girl’s journey.   

It all started when I took up the interest of finding my family tree. I always new my family had an interesting life. Many hours of my young childhood was spent by Grandma’s cosy fire, listening intensively to the stories of long forgotten family members. If anyone new history and law, it was Grandma. Unfortunately she was not with me to embark on this truly incredible adventure. As much as my heart wished she was here, I heaved on with my research, trying in my Grandmothers name, to find the most accurate information on long gone family members. 

Things got plenty interesting when I stumbled along the most curious sounding person, in my family tree. Daniel Wood. My great-great-great-great-grandfather. A carpenter by day, but after working hours he had the most fascinating hobby, of invention. That was the only part of the website I understood entirely. Then it waffled on about patents and conspiracy theories.

I thought this was a good time to bring in, my very best friend (and true love) ,Tasha. A very talented law student, who had a un-canning passion for conspiracies of the past. All too perfect. Was it a coincidence. 

There was a hammering knock on the flimsy front door, that wanted to break due to a hand smacking hard on it’s mud splattered face. The woman who was so furiously banging on the door, heard someone storming down the stairs. She was windswept as the man inside the house threw the door open with the greatest urgency. There before her was an unmistakably, overworked and underpaid, but gorgeous young man. His name was Michael Jaymolethue Wood. Also known as Mike. Light, wispy hair, entrancing blue eyes, cute button nose and welcoming smile. That was Mike. 

There before him was a successful, independent young woman. auburn hair, tied into a lose ponytail with blonde bangs, hanging out. Deep hazel eyes and a deadly smile. She was an ornament of her sex. Freethinking  and free living. The way she stood in her vintage clothes, standing gracefully on the door step.  
“ Come in, tea, coffee?” Asked Mike in awe.
“Thank you for the offer but I’m trying to cut out coffee, I’ll have some tea with milk and no sugar though.” Replied Tasha, while striding through the front door. 
“Been thinking. That family tree I started, well I have a great-great-great-great grandfather who used to be an inven…” Tasha cut in.
“tor, so you thought you would ask me if I could make sense of the website.” Mike busied himself with the tea, feeling slightly embarrassed. He found it incredible how Tasha could make assumption from the smallest amount of information.
“Shall we go up stairs” said Tasha, while being handed the tea. 


Chapter 2-
The truth of the patent

Tasha cautiously walked into the study, hoping to find it clean and tidy like she liked it, however that was clearly not the case as the door handle pulled down and creaked the door open. What lay beyond there was anything but a clean and tidy working area. It was the reason she didn’t have a boyfriend. Mess! Piles of it, on the desk, on the floor, on the windowsill. She was going to have to do something about this, so she cleared an area for her tea, as she called out to Mike. “Go get a bin liner.” 
“What for?” Inquired Mike.
“We’re going to clean this hell hole up, now go and get that bin liner.”
Slowly half the day slipped between their fingers as they “chucked” and ‘kept” numerous belongings to Mike. 

At 2 o’clock the study was immaculate. It had been tidied, cleaned and vacuumed, until at last it was a suitable working area for Tasha. After a quick lunch of peanut butter sandwiches, the work began. Mike flicked on the computer screen and took Tasha to the website. She started to read, it felt like hours, when eventually, Tasha started to explain the meaning of the words, splattered on the page. 

“Basically, your great-great-great-great-grandfather invented the telephone, but then didn’t patent it because he didn’t have the money. So Henry Thatcher gave him a large fortune of fifty thousand pounds, to get your relative to say Henry invented it.”
Shocked at the news Mike managed to splutter out a question. 
“How much is fifteen thousand pounds worth now?” asked mike, cautiously. 
“About two million pounds.” Explained Tasha.
“So where is the money now?” 
“That’s the problem, he gave it to a friend to look after because many people wanted the money, but he never saw it again.” 
“Does that mean it’s gone?” Asked mike apprehensively. 
“ Far from it. Now, Harry Thatcher owns the money and he’s not what you’d call a nice fellow” 

So the conversation carried on, they talked long into the night, about Daniel Wood and his telephone to what they would do with two million pounds. 


Chapter 3-
The problem with information

Information is a curious thing. You may find out a piece of interesting information but then out of the blue, want to know more. This can cause great adventures of mild peril for some people, but for Mike, it would only cause massive peril. All because of his need for more information.

For the next few days, Mike tried to continue with his normal life. However this was a lot harder when you have obtained a piece of information that tells you that your family rightfully owns millions of pounds. Whatever he did, no matter how normal he could not tame the twinge that was forever in his stomach. A twinge that needed information. 

Life suddenly became a lot more difficult for Tasha as well. It may have been none of her business, but the thought that someone had a fortune that wasn’t even theirs, made her cringe. Yet no matter how much information she acquired on the problem at hand, she still felt that it was her business to put it right. After all she was a girl of action.


Chapter 4
The city really wasn’t big enough for the both of them.

He was cruel and malevolent. Whatever he did he wanted more, and as his thin nimble hands curled around his cigar he felt no guilt towards his family name. As his dark and entrancing eyes stared into the mirror he knew he would not let his guard down. As his fat cigar grazed his thin lips he felt no dread for what he was going to do. 

Harry Thatcher. He was one of those people everyone knew. Even though they weren’t in movies or wrote songs. He was the kind of person who was born rich and lived the rich lifestyle. Knew the right people. If you know what I mean.

''Romanian pronunciation is very phonetic''

'''All'' pronunciation is phonetic! Is this not perhaps, rather, a reference to the &quot;phonetic&quot; (i.e. near-phonemic) ''spelling'' of Romanian? -- [[User:81.158.0.123|81.158.0.123]] 18:30, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

''a lot of foreigners find it hard to speak it, especially English speakers''

Is there really any evidence that English-speakers are more likely than, say, Mandarin-speakers, Hungarian-speakers, or Arabic-speakers to find Romanian hard to speak? -- [[User:81.158.0.123|81.158.0.123]] 18:26, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

No, there's not. For one thing, &quot;English-speakers&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;native English-speakers&quot; and certainly not the same thing as &quot;native English speakers who speak Romanian non-natively&quot;. Some people are even native in both languages. In addition, I don't think this is an objective claim at all, and evidence obviously has not been provided in over two years. Removed. [[User:Tlaxcalli|Tlaxcalli]] ([[User talk:Tlaxcalli|talk]]) 04:03, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

:... And if it were so hard for English speakers then I'm not sure what this &quot;Category I: Romanian&quot; is on about ([[Wikibooks:Language_Learning_Difficulty_for_English_Speakers]]). Perhaps a better wording would have been &quot;it may appear hard/different, but ...&quot; (followed by encouragement of sorts, particularly linking to the aforementioned phonetic spelling). [[User:Ceigered|Ceigered]] ([[User talk:Ceigered|talk]]) 10:01, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

What about the diphthonge '''oa''' as in the word dumneavoastră? How to spell? --[[User:80.223.182.232|80.223.182.232]] 10:57, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

== ău ==
Is this sound [@u] identical to the Received Pronunciation treatement of a long &quot;o&quot; in English (sl'''o'''pe), and to a lesser extent similar to the long &quot;o&quot; in Australian/NZ/SA accents? This might help English speakers familiar with these sounds better approximate the sound if it is indeed identical/similar I suppose [[User:Ceigered|Ceigered]] ([[User talk:Ceigered|talk]]) 10:01, 13 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A suppository is a method of giving medicines into the rectum. The medicine is mixed with a fat or wax. Traditionally cocoa butter (theobroma oil) was used, but synthetic bases are more common today. The important thing is that the base should melt at temperatures above normal room temperature, but below body temperature. This gives us a narrow band between roughly 30 and 35 degrees celsius for the melting point of the base.

There are also suppositories based on gelatin. These need to be dampened before insertion, because they dissolve rather than melting.

The same technology used for suppositories applies to female pessaries, but pessaries tend to be larger. Suppositories typically come in 1g, 2g or 4g sizes, while pessaries may be 4g, 8g or 15g. The size of the suppository depends on the size of the recipient - 1g for infants, 2g for children and 4g for adults being a general rule.

The drugs used in suppositories are either chosen for their local effect - medicines for use in haemorrhoids, for example - or because this route avoids the need to swallow. Diazepam may be given rectally in cases of epilepsy because a person undergoing fits may not be able to take medicines by mouth at that time.

Would it make sense to have smaller screen shots? I'm thinking of icon-size instead of small image size. That would make the layout a lot smaller and would provide a better overview of the table of contents (which is the whole point of a table of contents :) and it would require less scrolling. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 13:07, 29 August 2011 (UTC)
: Thanks for the suggestion.  I rearranged the page with smaller screenshots and double-columns - but I didn't go as small as icon-sized :) [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 20:07, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

I copy these two illustrations here, so we can easily copy/paste the code when we need them on the wikibook front page.

== OpenGL 2.1 - big picture missing ==
It seems the OpenGL 2.1 (&quot;modern&quot;) part jumps directly to code and vertex/fragment shaders ([http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Modern_OpenGL_Introduction]). I think a big picture (what stages does the pipeline consist of, what data is passed from what stage to what stage, etc.) is missing there. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/OpenGL_ES_Overview#OpenGL_ES_2.0_Pipeline_Structure] for an example. -- [[User:NotInventedHere|NotInventedHere]] ([[User talk:NotInventedHere|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/NotInventedHere|contribs]]) 08:40, 6 December 2011 (UTC)

:The overview that you cite is given in an appendix of the OpenGL Programming book. Thus, it is certainly not missing. Would it be a good idea to start with that overview instead of putting it into an appendix? Here are some reasons against this approach:
:* It's very difficult to understand what the stages of the pipeline are good for before you see any application of the pipeline. It's easier to start with some simple examples and later introduce the pipeline, once its main features and uses are known.
:* Many modern learners prefer to learn from tutorials that teach useful stuff instead of books that talk about abstract concepts (e.g. the OpenGL pipeline) that cannot be used for anything without a lot of other information.
:* For some learners (in particular with a strong technical background), it is very helpful to know the pipeline. Presenting the pipeline in an appendix and linking to it at appropriate places in the tutorials allows these learners to read about the pipeline at the best possible time: when they already have an idea how the pipeline fits into the rendering process and they are curious how it works exactly.
:I understand that there are also reasons in favor of a more prominent introduction to the pipeline but I think the current version is a quite good solution. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]])

::The overview has been written by me a while back, basically filling in the (in my eyes crucial) information my OpenGL ES tutorial book (&quot;OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide&quot;) was missing, making it hard to comprehend. So it's been written from a learner's perspective. Anyways, I agree that no long-winded pipeline introduction is needed, but some advance words about it (some paragraphs) would be good. The problem with my text is that it's too long and applies to OpenGL ES. I would rework it if I had the time and knowledge about OpenGL 2.0 (non-ES). -- [[User:NotInventedHere|NotInventedHere]] ([[User talk:NotInventedHere|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/NotInventedHere|contribs]]) 22:59, 28 December 2011 (UTC)

== Sides labelled wrongly ==

In the topic that adds the cube I notice that at least in my implementation (and also from what I can tell by thinking through the code) the index's that are listed as making up some of the sides are labelled as making up different sides. For example 
    // left
    4, 5, 1,
    1, 0, 4,

Looks to me like it makes up the BOTTOM of the cube, not the left.
Can anyone clarify? [[Special:Contributions/62.49.19.234|62.49.19.234]] ([[User talk:62.49.19.234|discuss]]) 13:02, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

== Copyright of these tutorials? ==

What is the license of these tutorials? Is it ok to use these kinds of code (and e.g. Wikipedia's code examples) in closed source projects? For example, in the [[GLSL_Programming/Introduction]] there is a box that says &quot;Unless stated otherwise, all example source code on this page is granted to the public domain.&quot; at the bottom of the page. --[[Special:Contributions/88.148.251.200|88.148.251.200]] ([[User talk:88.148.251.200|discuss]]) 10:39, 16 December 2012 (UTC)

:Without such a notice, any code in Wikibooks is by default under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license, which makes it difficult to use it in closed source projects. Thus, you have to ask the author for permission. (For code from the GLSL Programming wikibook you don't have to ask because that box grants the code to the public domain.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 18:55, 17 December 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter 6: Graphic functions==
===Simple plots===
To plot a funtion you use the plot(function) command.  You need to tell Maple what variable it needs to plot against the value function.  This is done by plot(funtion, variable=a..b).  This will plot the value of the function as the variable changes from a to b.  Example:
 &gt;plot(x^2, x=0..1);     #Image on the left
 &gt;plot(1/3*x^3, x=-1..1);     #Image on the right
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Plotof-xsquared.png]][[Image:Plotof-onethirdxcubed.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

You can also get Maple to plot a function that you have entered previously.
 &gt;2/3*x^2+x;
 &gt;plot(%, x=-2..1);
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Plotof-twothirdsxsquaredplusone.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Maple will also accept variables in the range option if it can equate the function to those extremes.  This is particulary useful if you are plotting trigonometric functions as you can then make use of multiples of pi.
 &gt;plot(cos(x), x=0..2*Pi);     #Image on the left
 &gt;a:=Pi:     #Affecting the variable a to equal pi
 &gt;plot(sin(x), x=-a..a);     #Image on the right
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Plotof-cosinex.png]][[Image:Plotof-sinex.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

There are many other options you can apply to a plot.
 &gt;plot(x^3+3*x^2+x-1, x=-3..1, colour=blue, style=point, title=&quot;This is a title&quot;);     #Image on the left
 &gt;plot(-x^3-3*x^2-x+1, x=-3..1, colour=green, thickness=2, labels=[&quot;X axis label&quot;, &quot;Y axis label&quot;], labeldirections=[horizontal, vertical]);     #Image on the right
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Plot-options1.png]][[Image:Plot-options2.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

===Saving of plots===
For using (storing, publishing), the figures should be prepared in an appropriate format (gif, jpg, pdf, eps) and saved to disk.
Such a convertion can be achieved by setting the device with the command plotssetup. Example:

 &gt; plotsetup(ps)

This command specifies that the graphic should be prepared in the EncapsulatedPostscript format. However, after such a command,
while all other setting required is well arranged the plot command may cause errors. Therefore, after such a command, the command

 &gt; plotsetup(default)

can be very useful; especially while the user tries all the options one by one trying to catch the combination of commands which writes the picture into a file.

However, there exist also a way of saving pictures by use of the menu. The user should click on the figure (&quot;mark it&quot;), then find the option '''plot''' at the top menu bar and open the second-order menu &quot;export&quot; at its bottom, where the user has to choose the file-format to export to. This work should be repeated for each picture saved or updated.
===Display multiple graphs in single plot===
t2 := plot(g2(y), y = 1 .. 10, color = red): t4 := plot(g4(y), y = 1 .. 8, color = blue): t6 := plot(g6(y), y = 1 .. 8): display({t2, t4, t6});
[[File:Maple display three curves.JPG|thumb|center|Maple display three curves]]
===Rotation and reflection of plot===
[[File:Maple plot rotate.JPG|thumb|center|Maple plot rotate]]
&gt;K2 := plot(g2, y = 0 .. 10,color=red): plottools:-reflect(plottools:-rotate(K2, (1/2)*Pi), [[0, 0], [0, 1;

K4:= plot(g4, y = 0 .. 10,color=blue): plottools:-reflect(plottools:-rotate(K4, (1/2)*Pi), [[0, 0], [0, 1]]);

&gt;K6 := plot(g6, y = 0 .. 10, color = black); plottools:-reflect(plottools:-rotate(K6, (1/2)*Pi), [[0, 0], [0, 1]]);

==Animation==

&lt;math&gt;f:=2*k^2/cosh(k*(x-4*k^2*t))^2&lt;/math&gt;


with(plots);
animate(subs(k = .5, f), x = -30 .. 30, t = -10 .. 10, numpoints = 200, frames = 50, color = red, thickness = 3);

== Introduction ==

This Wikibook is an introduction to category theory.  It is written for those who have some understanding of one or more branches of abstract mathematics, such as group theory, analysis or topology.  The book contains many examples drawn from various branches of math.  If you are not familiar with some of the kinds of math mentioned, don’t worry.  If practically all the examples are unfamiliar, this book may be too advanced for you.

===What is a category?===

A category is a mathematical structure, like a group or a vector space, abstractly defined by axioms.  Groups were defined in this way in order to study symmetries (of physical objects and equations, among other things).  Vector spaces are an abstraction of vector calculus.  

What makes category theory different from the study of other structures is that in a sense the concept of category is an ''abstraction of a kind of mathematics''.  (This cannot be made into a precise mathematical definition!)  This makes category theory unusually self-referential and capable of treating many of the same questions that mathematical logic treats.  In particular, it provides a language that ''unifies many concepts in different parts of math''.

In more detail, a category has ''objects'' and ''morphisms'' or ''arrows''.  (It is best to think of the morphisms as arrows: the word “morphism” makes you think they are set maps, and they are ''not'' always set maps. The formal definition of category is given in [[Category Theory/Categories |the chapter on categories]].) 
*The category of groups has groups as objects and homomorphisms as arrows.  
*The category of vector spaces has vector spaces as objects and linear maps as arrows.   

The maps between categories that preserve structure are called ''functors''.  
*The underlying set of a group determines a functor from the category of groups to the category of sets.  
*The fundamental group of a pointed space determines a functor from the category of pointed topological spaces to the category of groups.  The fact that it is a functor means that a continuous point-preserving map from a pointed space S  to a pointed space T induces a group homomorphism from the fundamental group of S to the fundamental group of T.

Categories form a category as well, with functors as arrows.  Most fundamentally, ''functors between specific categories'' form a category: its morphisms are called ''natural transformations''.  The fact that category theory has natural transformations is arguably the single feature that makes category theory so important.

===History===

Category theory was invented by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in the 1940s as a way of expressing certain constructions in algebraic topology.  Category theory was developed rapidly in the subsequent decades.  It has become an autonomous part of mathematics, studied for its own sake as well as being widely used as a unified language for the expression of mathematical ideas relating different fields. 

For example, algebraic topology relates domains of interest in geometry to domains of interest in algebra. Algebraic geometry, on the other hand, goes in the opposite direction, associating, for example, with each commutative ring its spectrum of prime ideals.  These fields were among the earliest to be studied using tools of category theory.  Later applications came to abstract algebra, logic, computing science and physics, among others.

===Aspects of category theory===

Because the concept of a category is so general, it is to be expected that theorems provable for all categories will not usually be very deep. Consequently, many theorems of category theory are stated and proved for particular classes of categories.  
*Homological algebra is concerned with Abelian categories, which exhibit features suggested by the category of Abelian groups.  
*Logic is studied using topos theory: a topos is a category with certain properties in common with the category of sets but which allows the logic of the topos to be weaker than classical logic.  It is characteristic of the malleability of category theory that toposes were originally developed to study algebraic geometry.

An important use purpose of categorical reasoning is to identify within a given argument that part which is trivial and separate it from the part which is deep and proper to the particular context. For example, in the study of the theory of the GCD, the fact that it is essentially unique simply follows from the uniqueness of the product in any category and is thus really trivial. On the other hand, the fact that the GCD of the integers A and B can be expressed as a linear combination of A and B with integer coefficients—GCD(''a'', ''b'') = ''ma + nb'', for some integers ''m'' and ''n''—is a much deeper fact that is special to a much more restricted situation.

===Note on terminology===

Most variations in terminology are discussed in the place where the terminology is defined.  Here it is important to point out one annoying terminological problem:  The adjective corresponding to “category” is “categorical”.  Since “categorical” in logic means having only one model up to isomorphism, this can cause cognitive dissonance; in any case, the use of “categorical” in this book has ''nothing to do with the idea of having only one model''.

Some authors use “categorial” instead.  Unfortunately, this means something else in linguistics.  This book follows majority usage with “categorical”.

== Bijection ==

A set is said to be '''countable''' it there exists a one to one correspondence between that set and the set of integers.

=== Examples ===

'''The Even Integers:''' There is a simple bijection between the integers and the even integers, namely &lt;math&gt;f:\bold{Z}\rightarrow\bold{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(n)=2n&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence the even integers are countable.

'''A 2 - Dimensional Lattice:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\bold{Z}^2&lt;/math&gt; represent the usual two dimensional integer lattice, then &lt;math&gt;\bold{Z}^2&lt;/math&gt; is countable.

Proof:  let &lt;math&gt;f:\bold{Z}\rightarrow\bold{Z}&lt;/math&gt; represent the function such that &lt;math&gt;f(0)=(0,)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(n)= (x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is whichever point:

* not represented by some &lt;math&gt;f(m)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is the lattice point 1 unit from &lt;math&gt;f(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; nearest to the origin.  In the case where there are two such points, an arbitrary choice may be made.

Because &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; exists and is a bijection with the integers, The 2 - dimensional integer lattice is countable.

== Axioms of countability ==

===First Axiom of Countability===
====Definition====
A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;is said to satisfy the '''First Axiom of Countability''' if, for every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a countable collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;of neighbourhoods of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, such that if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is any neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;U\in\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq N&lt;/math&gt;.

A topological space that satisfies the first axiom of countability is said to be '''First-Countable'''.

All metric spaces satisfy the first axiom of countability because for any neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, there is an open ball &lt;math&gt;B_r(x)&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and the countable collection of neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that are &lt;math&gt;B_{1/k}(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, has the neighborhood &lt;math&gt;B_{1/n}(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

====Theorem====
If a topological space satisfies the first axiom of countability, then for any point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of closure of a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, there is a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{ a_i\}&lt;/math&gt; of points within &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; which converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
=====Proof=====
Let &lt;math&gt;\{ A_i\}&lt;/math&gt; be a countable collection of neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that for any neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, there is an &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A_i\subset N&lt;/math&gt;. Define&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;B_n=\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Then form a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{ a_i\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a_i\in B_i&lt;/math&gt;. Then obviously &lt;math&gt;\{ a_i\}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

====Theorem====
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space satisfying the first axiom of countability. Then, a subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is closed if an only if all convergent sequences &lt;math&gt;\{ x_n\}\subset A&lt;/math&gt; which converge to an element of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; converge to an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
=====Proof=====
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\{ x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a limit point of &lt;math&gt;\{ x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and thus is a limit point of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and since &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is closed, it is contained within &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, suppose that all convergent sequences within &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; converge to an element within &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be any point of contact for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Then by the theorem above, there is a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{ x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; which converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is closed.

====Theorem====
If a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the first axiom of countability, then &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if whenever &lt;math&gt;\{ x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{ f(x_n)\}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
=====Proof=====
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the first axiom of countability, and let &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; be continuous. Let &lt;math&gt;\{ x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence which converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be any open neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, there exists an open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;A\subset f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\{ x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, then there must exist an &lt;math&gt;N\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; must contain &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which contains &lt;math&gt;f(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\{ f(x_n)\}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversely, suppose that whenever &lt;math&gt;\{ x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, that &lt;math&gt;\{ f(x_n)\}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be a closed subset of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x_n\in f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence which converges onto a limit &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; converges onto a limit &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which is within &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;, implying that it is closed. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

===Second Axiom of Countability===
====Definition====
A topological space is said to satisfy the ''second axiom of countability'' if it has a countable base.

A topological space that satisfies the second axiom of countability is said to be '''Second-Countable'''.

A topological space satisfies the second axiom of countable is first countable, since the countable collection of neighborhoods of a point can be all neighborhoods of the point within the countable base, so that any neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of that point must contain at least one neighborhood &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; within the collection, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; must be a subset of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

====Theorem====
If a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the second axiom of countability, then all open covers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; have a countable subcover.&lt;br /&gt;
=====Proof=====
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; be an open cover of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; be a countable base for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; covers &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. For all points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, select an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_x&lt;/math&gt; which contains &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and an element of the base, &lt;math&gt;B_x&lt;/math&gt; which contains &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and is a subset of &lt;math&gt;C_x&lt;/math&gt; (which is possible because &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is a base). &lt;math&gt;\{ B_x\}&lt;/math&gt; forms a countable open cover for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;B_x&lt;/math&gt;, select an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; which contains &lt;math&gt;B_x&lt;/math&gt;, and this is a countable subcover of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Seperable Spaces===
====Definition====
A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''separable'' if it has a countable proper subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)=X&lt;/math&gt;.

Example: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is separable because &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a countable subset and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(\mathbb{Q}^n)=\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

====Definition====
A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is seperable if it has a countable dense subset.

Example: The set of real numbers and complex numbers are both seperable.

====Theorem====
If a topological space satisfies the ''second axiom of countability'', then it is separable.&lt;br /&gt;
=====Proof=====
Consider a countable base of a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Choose a point from each set within the base. The resulting set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of the chosen points is countable. Moreover, its closure is the whole space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; since any neighborhood of any element of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; must be a union of the bases, and thus must contain at least one element within the base, which in turn must contain an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; contains at least one point from each base. Thus it is separable.

=====Corollary=====
In any topological space, second countability implies seperable &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; first countable. Prove of this is left for the reader.

====Theorem====
If a metric space is separable, then it satisfies the second axiom of countability.&lt;br /&gt;

=====Proof=====
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space, and let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a countable set such that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)=X&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the countable set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of open balls &lt;math&gt;\{ B_{1/k}(p)|k\in N, p\in A\}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; be any open set, and let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be any element of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be an open ball of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; with radius r. Let &lt;math&gt;r'&lt;/math&gt; be a number of the form &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; that is less than &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)=X&lt;/math&gt;, there is an element &lt;math&gt;x'\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x',x)&lt;\tfrac{r'}{4}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ball &lt;math&gt;B_{r'/2}(x')&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and is a subset of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; because if &lt;math&gt;y\in B_{r'/2}(x')&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;d(y,x)\leq d(y,x')+d(x',x)&lt;\tfrac{3}{4}r'&lt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;B_{r'/2}\subseteq O&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The union of all such neighborhoods containing an element of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a base for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

=====Corollary (Lindelöf covering theorem)=====
If a metric space is separable, then it satisfies the second axiom of countability, and thus any cover of a subset of that metric space can be reduced to a countable cover.

Example: Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a separable metric space, it satisfies the second axiom of countability. This directly implies that any cover a set in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; has a countable subcover.

== Countable Compactness ==

====Definition====
A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''Countably Compact'' if and only if all countable covers of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have a finite subcover.

Clearly all compact spaces are countably compact.

A countably compact space is compact if it satisfies the second axiom of countability by the theorem above.

====Theorem====
A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is countably compact if and only if any infinite subset of that space has at least one limit point.&lt;br /&gt;
=====Proof=====
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;\{ x_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(i=1,2,3,...)&lt;/math&gt; be a set within &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; without any limit point. Then this sequence is closed, since they are all isolated points within the sequence. Let &lt;math&gt;S_n=\{ x_i\}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;(i=n, n+1, n+2, ...)&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;X\setminus S_n&lt;/math&gt; are all open sets, and so is a countable cover of the set, but any finite subcover &lt;math&gt;\{ X\setminus S_{n_i}\}&lt;/math&gt; of this cover does not cover &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; because it does not contain &lt;math&gt;S_{n_{max\{ i\} }}&lt;/math&gt;. This contradicts the assumption that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is countably compact. 

(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;\{ S_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be open subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that any finite union of those sets does not cover &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Define:

&lt;math&gt;B_n=\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} S_n&lt;/math&gt;,

which does not cover &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and is open. Select &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_n\notin B_n&lt;/math&gt;. There is a limit point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of this set of points, which must also be a limit point of &lt;math&gt;X\setminus B_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;X\setminus B_n&lt;/math&gt; is closed, &lt;math&gt;x\in X \setminus B_n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x\notin B_n&lt;/math&gt; and thus is not within any &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is not an open cover of X. Thus, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is countably compact.

=== Relative Countable Compactness ===

Since there is relative compactness, there is an analogous property called relative countable compactness.

====Definition====
A subset S of a topological space X is '''relatively countably compact''' when its closure Cl(S) is countably compact.

== Total Boundedness ==

====Definition====
A set &lt;math&gt;N\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is an '''&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-net''' of a metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if for any &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there is an element &lt;math&gt;x\in N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(b,x)&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

====Definition====
A metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is '''totally bounded''' when it has a finite &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-net for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

====Theorem====
A countably compact metric space is totally bounded.&lt;br /&gt;
=====Proof=====
Any infinite subset of  a countably compact metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; must have at least one limit point. Thus, selecting &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is at least &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; apart from any &lt;math&gt;x_d&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;, one must eventually have formed an &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-net because this process must be finite, because there is no possible infinite set with all elements more than &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; apart.

====Theorem====
A totally bounded set is separable.&lt;br /&gt;
=====Proof=====
Take the union of all finite &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;-nets, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; varies over the natural numbers, and that is a countable set such that its closure is the whole space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

==Urysohn's Metrizability Theorem==
The following theorem establishes a sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable.

===Theorem===

A second countable normal T1 topological space is homeomorphic to a metric space.

===Proof===
We are going to use the Hilbert cube, which is a metric space, in this proof, to prove that the topological space is homeomorphic to a subset of the Hilbert cube, and is thus a metric space.

First, since all T1 normal spaces are Hausdorff, all single points are closed sets. Therefore, consider any countable base of the topological space X, and any open &lt;math&gt;O_n&lt;/math&gt; set of it. Select a point &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; within this open set. Since the complement of the open set is closed, and since a point within the open set is also closed, and since these two closed sets are disjoint, we can apply Urysohn's lemma to find a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f_n: X \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that:

&lt;math&gt;f_n(x_n)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f_n(X/O_n)=1&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see from the proof of Urysohn's lemma that we have not only constructed a function with such properties, but that such that &lt;math&gt;f_n(O_n)&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that the function value of any point within the open set is less than 1.

Now define the function &lt;math&gt;g: X \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; from X to the Hilbert cube to be &lt;math&gt;g(x)=(f_1(x),\frac{f_2(x)}{2},\frac{f_3(x)}{4},...)&lt;/math&gt;.

To prove that this is continuous, let &lt;math&gt;a_n \rightarrow a&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence that converges to ''a''. Consider the open ball &lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon(f(a))&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. There exists an N such that

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=N}^\infty(\frac{1}{2^i})^2&lt;\frac{\epsilon^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Moreover, since &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function from X to [0,1], there exists a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore an open set &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; of the base within that neighborhood containing a such that if &lt;math&gt;y\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;|f_n(y)-f_n(z)|&lt;\frac{2^n\epsilon}{\sqrt{2N}}&lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt;(\frac{f_n(y)-f_n(z)}{2^n})^2&lt;\frac{\epsilon^2}{2N}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let

&lt;math&gt;S=\bigcap_{i=1}^{N-1} S_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In addition, since &lt;math&gt;a_n\rightarrow a&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; (i=1,2,3,...,M-1) such that when &lt;math&gt;n&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;, that &lt;math&gt;a_n\in S_i&lt;/math&gt;, and let M be the maximum of &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; so that when n&gt;M, then &lt;math&gt;a_n\in S&lt;/math&gt;.

Let n&gt;M, and then the distance from &lt;math&gt;g(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; to g(a) is now

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty (\frac{f_i(a_n)-f_i(a)}{2^i})^2 = &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}(\frac{f_i(a_n)-f_i(a)}{2^i})^2 + &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=N}^\infty(\frac{f_i(a_n)-f_i(a)}{2^i})^2 \le &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{N-1}{2N}\epsilon^2+\sum_{i=N}^\infty(\frac{f_n(y)-f_n(z)}{2^n})^2 \le &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{N-1}{2N}\epsilon^2+\frac{\epsilon^2}{2} &lt; \epsilon^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This proves that it is continuous.

To prove that this is one-to-one, consider two different points, a and b. Since the space is Hausdorff, there exists disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;a\in U_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\in U_b&lt;/math&gt;, and select an element of the base &lt;math&gt;O_n&lt;/math&gt; that contains a and is within &lt;math&gt;U_a&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;f_n(a)&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; whereas &lt;math&gt;f_n(b)=1&lt;/math&gt;, proving that the function g is one-to-one, and that there exists an inverse &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

To prove that the inverse &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, let &lt;math&gt;O_n&lt;/math&gt; be an open set within the countable base of X. Consider any point x within &lt;math&gt;O_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, indicating that there exists an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that when

&lt;math&gt;|f_n(z)-f_n(x)|&lt;2^n\epsilon_n&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;z\in O_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;g(z)\in g(X)\cap B_{\epsilon_n}(g(y))&lt;/math&gt;. Then

&lt;math&gt;(\frac{f_n(z)-f_n(x)}{2^n})^2\le\sum_{i=1}^\infty(\frac{f_i(z)-f_i(x)}{2^i})^2\le \epsilon_n^2&lt;/math&gt;

Implying that &lt;math&gt;|f_n(z)-f_n(x)|\le 2^n\epsilon^n&lt;/math&gt; indicating that &lt;math&gt;z\in O_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Now consider any open set O around x. Then there exists a set of the base &lt;math&gt;x\in O_n\subseteq O&lt;/math&gt; and an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever &lt;math&gt;g(z)\in g(X)\cap B_{\epsilon_n}(g(y))&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;z\in O_n&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that &lt;math&gt;z\in O&lt;/math&gt;. This proves that the inverse is continuous.

Since the function is continuous, is one-to-one, and has a continuous inverse, it is thus a homeomorphism, proving that X is metrizable.

Note that this also proves that the Hilbert cube thus contains any second-countable normal T1 space.

==Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Theorem==
[[Image:Hilbert curve.png|thumb|The [[w:en:Space filling curve|Hilbert Curve]]- a space filling curve|300px|right]]The Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem is one of the most historically important results of point-set topology, for it completely solves the problem of &quot;space-filling&quot; curves. This theorem provides the necessary and sufficient condition for a space to be 'covered by curve', a property that is widely considered to be counter-intuitive.

Here, we present the theorem without its proof. 

====Theorem====
A Hausdorff space is a continuous image of the unit interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is a compact, connected, locally connected and second-countable space.



==Exercise==
#Prove that a separable metric space satisfies the second axiom of countability. Hence, or otherwise, prove that a countably compact metric space is compact.
#Prove the sufficiency condition of the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem:&lt;br /&gt;If a Hausdorff space is a continuous image of the unit interval, then it is compact, connected, locally-connected and second countable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What ''is'' a Computer? ==

If you are not reading this from printed paper, you will – without a shadow of a doubt – be using a computer (most likely taking the form of a desktop, laptop or portable mobile device) to read this WikiBook. '''Pretty much everything around you that's mechanical is a computer.''' You may say, &quot;No way! My old wooden grandfather clock is not a computer,&quot; but you would be wrong — computers are 'general purpose machines that process data according to a set of (temporarily or permanently) internally stored instructions.'

A computer (or computing device) is, fundamentally,'' 'a programmable general purpose electronic device capable of performing multiple functions.' ''Or, in non-nerd terms,'' 'anything that performs defined functions automatically according to instructions it has already been given.' ''

So, that clock is indeed a computer: its 'set of instructions' is its internal timekeeping mechanism, cogs, springs, weights and all. The fact that its program happens to be one which is predictable in its expected output makes no difference (the gradual rotation of the hands around the clock face every twenty-four hours, or the fact that it self-regulates its output – the hands' movement – to once per second).

Whilst the example of a clock may be more reminiscent of the very first computer (Charles Babbage's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine Difference Engine]) the concepts employed are identical. Practically anything electromechanical could be considered a 'computer'.


== This Book's definition of a Computer ==

When most people talk about 'computers', they are implicitly referring to Personal Computers (PCs) - those wondrous devices that allow us to communicate, read, write and learn with the help of about a dozen common components all working harmoniously to send, receive, process and display information of every type imaginable. For consistency, whenever this Book mentions a 'computer', it is referring to a Personal Computer (to avoid any confusion possibly arising from the more specialist 'computing systems' or 'computational devices'.)

But what's in a computer? [[Non-nerd's_Guide_to_Computers/basic_components|Read on to find out]]...

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What's in a Computer? ==
Ask a pedant, or nerd (most are both) what the 'computer' is, and they will reply 'the Central Processing Unit' (CPU) - and the rest of the machine is considered 'peripheral'. However, as a lowest common denominator, every computer contains half a dozen essential components (plus a few more to enhance and add new functionality). Take one of those away, and the machine simply won't turn on (or if it does, you won't get very far with it).

Here's a quick list of what you absolutely need:

*The '''motherboard''' (or 'mainboard') - the core component onto which all other components and peripherals connect;
*The '''hard drive''' (or 'hard disk') - on which the computer's data, operating system (Windows, Mac OS X or Linux) and your personal files are stored;
*The '''RAM''' (Random Access Memory) - the computer's temporary storage; this is where the computer 'parks' data whilst it's working with it;
*The '''CPU''' (or Central Processing Unit, aka the 'Processor') - the brain of the computer, usually obscured by a large fan and heatsink as they generate ''a lot'' of heat during operation;
*The '''video card''' (or 'graphics card') - this creates all the graphics you see on-screen, be it a spreadsheet, this WikiBook, a game or a film;
*The '''sound card''' - this outputs every sound you hear from your computer, as well as 'digitising' incoming sounds from a microphone;
*The '''optical drive''' (DVD, Blu-Ray etc) and various other 'peripherals' like memory card readers and any specialist equipment like TV cards;
*The '''power supply''' - the substation providing continuous, regulated power to every component inside your computer; and
*The '''connecting cables''' - most computers contain several dozen power, data and monitoring cables, all colour coded and with specific connectors to avoid inadvertent misconnections.



This Book could go on and on listing every connector and screw (and there are many hundreds of permutations of memory, processors, hard drives and motherboards – it is not 'one size fits all') but these are the fundamental components of any working computer. We'll discuss these parts, one by one, in the following subsections, starting with the very first part: the [[../motherboard/]].

      <comment>/* Motherboard: The Mail Carrier */ editing title and subtitle</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Motherboard: ''From Whence All Connections Came'' ==
What exactly IS a motherboard? Let's take a quick example through a figure of speech. Think about mail service. Who delivers and picks up the mail? The mail carrier of course! He or she is given mail and drives around putting someone's mail in its appropriate mailbox, allowing people to communicate, and picks up mail already in the mailbox. The mail carrier is the equivalent of a motherboard. The motherboard is basically a mail carrier which allows all the components of a computer to communicate through exchanging data. The motherboard directs all this data, sending it to the appropriate places to be taken care of. Without a motherboard, computers would be lost, sending letters without an address. Since there is no way for each component to discern where data goes, it would be a mess and would not work.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Indirect object pronouns ''lui'' and ''leur''|review-id=french-lui-and-leur}} ==
&lt;div id='french-lui-and-leur'&gt;
The indirect object  pronoun {{fr|lui|IPA=/lɥi/|audio=Fr-lui.ogg}} means ''to him'' or ''to her'':
: {{fr|Je lui donne le livre.|en=I'm giving the book to him/her.}}
: {{fr|Je lui donne un coup de main.|en=I'm giving a helping hand to him/her.}}

Likewise, the indirect object pronoun {{fr|leur|IPA=/lœʁ/|audio=Fr-leur.ogg}} means ''to them'':
: {{fr|Je leur donne le livre.|en=I'm giving the book to them.}}
: {{fr|Je leur donne un coup de main.|en=I'm giving a helping hand to them.}}

''Lui'' replaces ''à [''person'']'':
: {{fr|Je parle à Jean.|en=I'm speaking to Jean.}}
: {{fr|Je lui parle.|en=I'm speaking to him.}}

Likewise, ''leur'' replaces ''à [''people'']'':
: {{fr|Je parle à Jean et Marie.|en=I'm speaking to Jean and Marie.}}
: {{fr|Je leur parle.|en=I'm speaking to them.}}

''Lui'' and ''leur'' usually only refer to people; they will sometimes also be used in reference to things.

=== Examples ===
{{sectstub}}
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-lui-and-leur --&gt;

== {{French/Section|Grammar|''Il y a'' and ''combien de''|review-id=french-il-y-a-and-combien-de}} ==
&lt;div id='french-il-y-a-and-combien-de'&gt;
The expression {{fr|il y a|IPA=/i.lja/|audio=Fr-il y a.ogg}} means ''there is …'' or ''there are …'':
: {{fr|Il y a un problème.|en=There is a problem.}}
: {{fr|Il y a des livres.|en=There are books.}}

The interrogative form of ''il y a'' is {{fr|y a-t-il|IPA=/i aˈt̪il/|audio=fr-fr-y_a-t-il.ogg}}. That is, ''il y a'' is inverted to ''y a-t-il'', meaning ''is there?'' or ''are there?'', within questions:
: {{fr|Y a-t-il un problème ?|en=Is there a problem?}}
: {{fr|Y a-t-il des magasins près d'ici ?|en=Are there shops near here?}}

Both ''How much …'' and ''How many …'' (quantity) are translated as {{fr|Combien de …|IPA=&lt;!-- IPA here --&gt;}}.

If the person or thing it refers to is countable, ''combien de'' is always followed by a plural noun:
: {{fr|Combien de personnes y a-t-il à votre bureau ?|en=How many people are there in your office?}}
: {{fr|Vous avez combien de frères ?|en=You have how many brothers?}}

However, with uncountable nouns, such as {{fr|l'eau|IPA=/o/|audio=Fr-eau.ogg|en=water|gender=m}} and {{fr|l'argent|IPA=/aʁ.ʒɑ̃/|audio=Fr-argent.ogg|en=money|gender=m}}, the singular form is used:
: {{fr|Vous avez combien d’argent ?|en=You have how much money?}}

=== Examples ===
{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Examples with combien de and il y a.ogg}}
| Tu as combien de livres ? ||  || You have how many books?
|-
| Combien d’argent avez-vous sur votre compte d’épargne ? ||  || How much money do you have in your account?
|-
| Combien y a-t-il de personnes ? ||  || How many people are there?
|-
| Avez-vous tous vos bagages ? ||  || Do you have all your baggage?
|-
| Y a-t-il beaucoup de pièces ? ||  || Are there many rooms?
|-
| N'y a-t-il pas de fruits ? ||  || Are there no fruit?

== {{French/Section|Text|Le système solaire}} ==
{{French/Text
 | Le système solaire est un système planétaire composé d'une étoile, le Soleil et des corps célestes gravitant autour de lui: les huit planètes et leurs 165 satellites naturels connus (appelés usuellement des « lunes »), les cinq planètes naines, et les milliards de petits corps (astéroïdes, objets glacés, comètes, météorites, poussière interplanétaire, etc.).

De façon schématique, le système solaire est composé du Soleil, de quatre planètes telluriques internes, d'une ceinture d'astéroïdes composée de petits corps rocheux, quatre géantes gazeuses externes et une seconde ceinture appelée ceinture de Kuiper, composée d’objets glacés. 

De la plus proche à la plus éloignée (du Soleil), les planètes du système se nomment Mercure, Vénus, Terre, Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, Uranus et Neptune. Six de ces planètes possèdent des satellites en orbite et chacune des planètes externes est entourée d’un anneau planétaire de poussière et d’autres particules. Toutes les planètes, excepté la Terre, portent les noms de dieux et déesses de la mythologie romaine et de la mythologie grecque.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Questions}} ==

=== Inversion ===
Nouns and verbs are often inverted within questions. The inverted words are connected by a dash:
: {{fr|vous avez …|en=you have …}} → {{fr|… avez-vous ?|en=… do you have?}}
: {{fr|vous êtes …|en=you are …}} → {{fr|êtes-vous … ?|en=are you … ?}}

{{fr|-t-}} is used to connect vowels in inverted phrases (called an ''euphonic'' or pleasing to the ear):
: {{fr|il a …|en=he has …}} → {{fr|… a-t-il ?|en=… does he have?}}
: {{fr|il y a …|en=there is …}} → {{fr|… y a-t-il ?|en=… is there?}}

For example:
: {{fr|Où es-tu ?|en=Where are you?}}
: {{fr|Où vas-tu ?|en=Where are you going?}}
: {{fr|Combien de frères avez-vous ?|en=How many brothers do you have?}}

===Spirit of Prophecy texts===

*[http://www.whiteestate.org/books/mh/mh16.html The Ministry of Healing] Chapter 16: Prayer for the Sick.
*[http://www.whiteestate.org/books/da/da36.html Desire of Ages] Chapter 36: The Touch of Faith 

===Procedure for Anointing the Sick===

The procedure for anointing the sick is outlined in the ''Minister's Manual''.  The anointing service is performed for anyone who is seriously ill.  While it should not be used for minor ailments, it should also not be reserved only for those who are dying. 

&quot;Is anyone among you sick?  Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.  And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up.  And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.&quot;  (James 5:14, 15).

Note that the verse asks, &quot;Is anyone among you sick?&quot; rather than &quot;Is anyone among you dying?&quot;

The service is performed by a pastor or in his absence, by an elder (but with the pastor's approval).  The person officiating should be accompanied by a few elders, and anyone who has a special gift for prayer.  It can be performed in a home, at the church, in a nursing home, or in a hospital.  If it is done in a hospital or nursing home, it should not interfere with the medical work being done there.

Normally, non-Christian friends and family are not invited to the service, but they should not be asked to leave if they are present already.

Before the service, the recipient should be prepared by a careful examination of his or her own heart.  This should include a confession of any sins to the Lord. &quot;If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear&quot; (Psalm 66:18).  The recipient may also be encouraged to read the chapter &quot;Prayer for the Sick&quot; in Ellen White's ''The Ministry of Healing.'' (see the Spirit of Prophecy references above).

The service begins when the pastor explains the purpose of the service to all present, and how the service will be performed.  The recipient may be asked to give a testimony.  If the recipient is not too sick, time should be taken to read passages from the Scriptures explaining the prerequisites for divine healing:

# '''Belief that God can and does heal.'''
# '''The confession of sin.'''
# '''Commitment to healthful living.'''  It is presumptuous to ask God to heal us if the person intends to continue the behavior that caused the illness in the first place.
# '''Willingness to use human means.'''  God does work miracles, but sometimes he chooses to do this through human agents.  He may already have chosen a doctor through whom the afflicted person may be healed.  It is not a sign of faithlessness to seek healing through human effort.  &quot;Every good gift and every prefect gift is from above&quot; (James 1:17)
# '''Trust God's answer.''' Sometimes God answers quickly, sometimes slowly, and sometimes He answers &quot;No.&quot;  If the sick person is not healed immediately (or is not healed at all) it is not a sign that God was unwilling to heal or that the person lacked faith or spirituality.  The scripture reading should end with the assurance that everything has been placed in God's hands and that God can be trusted.

Everyone then kneels, and prayer begins.  The anointed may pray first, followed by the elders.  The pastor prays last as he dips his finger into a vial of olive oil and rubs a small amount on the recipient's forehead.  The oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit touching the sick person in a special way.  Seventh-day Adventists do not follow the practice of applying oil to the part of the body that is afflicted.

As soon as the prayer is ended, the anointing party leaves.  If fellowship is desired, it should take place before the anointing service.  The party should leave while the spirit of reverence and the presence of God prevail.

== 3. What is continuing education as related to health careers? ==
Once health professionals are certified or licensed to practice, they are required to keep their educations current by enrolling in &quot;Continuing Professional Education&quot; or CPE.  They must complete a specific number of hours of coursework every year.  During these courses, the professionals review current practices and are exposed to the latest techniques.  These courses are often sponsored by their employers, and often involve overnight trips taught at resorts or spas.  Employers provide this &quot;perk&quot; because they wish to retain their employees.

== 4. Interview at least two people who work in a medical health career. One of the two must be someone other than a doctor or nurse, such as someone working in dentistry, physical therapy, respiratory therapy, radiology, nutrition, etc. In your interview ask the following questions: ==
*'''a. Why did you choose your profession? '''
*'''b. What education is necessary to enter your profession? '''
*'''c. After education, what amount of time does it take to become certified or proficient in your field? '''
*'''d. What part of your job do you like the best? The least? '''
*'''e. What day of the week and hours per day do you work at your job?'''
*'''f. What advancement is available in your field?'''
*'''g. What course of study in college would complement your chosen profession?'''
*'''h. List local schools that offer training in your profession?'''

The interview should take about 20-30 minutes to complete.  Interviewing a respiratory therapist can also meet a requirement for the Voyager AY curriculum, so if you choose this option, be sure to ask these questions as well:

# What are the benefits of regular exercise?
# Explain the treadmill test.  

You may need to set up an appointment with these professionals, and they may ask that you come to their facilities for the interview.  Be prompt.  It is also courteous to send your interviewees a card or a gift as a thank you.  If the interview is conducted at the medical facility, you may be able to meet much of requirement '''5b''' as well.

== 5. Do one of the following: ==
=== a. Be a candy striper or a page in a hospital or medical facility ===
=== b. Visit a medical or dental office and do the following: ===
:'''(1)''' Observe the areas of operation, such as the business office, laboratory, examining rooms, x-ray room, etc.
:'''(2)''' Be introduced to the equipment used in the office.
:'''(3)''' Learn the steps of an office visit from when a patient comes into the waiting room until the time he leaves the office.
:'''(4)''' Learn how the doctor does an examination from the taking of the patient's history to the diagnosis.
=== c. Go on a visit with a home nurse and do the following: ===
:'''(1)''' Learn the steps of a home visit from when the nurse finds out about the patient to when the nurse reports to a doctor.
:'''(2)''' Observe the nurse taking the vital signs.
:'''(3)''' Observe the nurse giving instructions and medication.

=== d. Visit an outpatient department of a hospital, such as physical therapy, x-ray, laboratory, etc. Do the following: ===
:'''(1)''' Observe the areas of operation in the department.
:'''(2)''' (Be introduced to the equipment used in the department and how it works.)
:'''(3)''' Learn the steps a patient takes when visiting the department.
:'''(4)''' How many people does it take to staff the department?
:'''(5)''' Does the department operate at night?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Convolution==
* &lt;math&gt;f_{X + Y}(z) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{X}(y - z)f_{Y}(z)\delta z = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{X}(z)f_{Y}(y - z)\delta z&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===
&lt;math&gt;f_{X}(x) = \begin{cases}\frac{3x^{2}}{2}&amp; x \in [-1,1]\\ 0&amp; else \end{cases} \qquad f_{Y}(y) = \begin{cases}\frac{y}{9}&amp; y \in [4,5]\\ 0&amp; else \end{cases} \qquad X \mbox{ and } Y \mbox{ are independent RVs, find } f_{X + Y}(z)&lt;/math&gt;
* Start by converting the pdf's to indicator functions
** &lt;math&gt;f_{X}(x) = \frac{3x^{2}}{2}\cdot 1_{[-1,1]}(x) \qquad f_{Y}(y) = \frac{y}{9}\cdot 1_{[4,5]}(y)&lt;/math&gt;
*** Now &lt;math&gt;f_{X}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined only when &lt;math&gt;x \in [-1,1]\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_{Y}(y)\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined only when &lt;math&gt;y \in [4,5]\,&lt;/math&gt;
* Use the convolution formula above to write out the integral
** &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{X}(z)f_{Y}(y - z)\delta z = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{3z^{2}}{2}\cdot 1_{[-1,1]}(z)\frac{y - z}{9}\cdot 1_{[4,5]}(y - z)\delta z&lt;/math&gt;
* Factor out any constants, in this case, a multiplier
** &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{18}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}z^{2}\cdot 1_{[-1,1]}(z)(y - z)\cdot 1_{[4,5]}(y - z)\delta z = \frac{1}{6}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}z^{2}\cdot 1_{[-1,1]}(z)(y - z)\cdot 1_{[4,5]}(y - z)\delta z&lt;/math&gt;
* Factor out the indicator function for &lt;math&gt;(z)\,&lt;/math&gt; into the integral bounds
** &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6}\int_{-1}^{1}z^{2}(y - z)\cdot 1_{[4,5]}(y - z)\delta z&lt;/math&gt;
*** Note that &lt;math&gt;4 \leq y - z \leq 5, (\mbox{ try to isolate } z) \rightarrow  4 - y \leq -z \leq 5 - y \rightarrow y - 5 \leq z \leq y - 4&lt;/math&gt;
* Now that have isolated the indicator for z, we can combine the entire integral for that indicator
** &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6}\int_{-1}^{1}\left(z^{2}(y - z)\right)\cdot 1_{[y-5,y-4]}(z)\delta z = \frac{1}{6}\int_{-1}^{1}\left(z^{2}y - z^{3}\right)\cdot 1_{[y-5,y-4]}(z)\delta z&lt;/math&gt;
* Finally, split the integral into the separate cases based on the remaining indicator function
** &lt;math&gt;f_{X + Y}(z) = \frac{1}{6} \begin{cases}0&amp; y &lt; 3\\ \int_{-1}^{y-4}(z^{2}y - z^{3})\delta z&amp; 3 \leq y &lt; 4\\ \int_{y-5}^{y-4}(z^{2}y - z^{3})\delta z&amp; 4 \leq y &lt; 5\\ \int_{y-5}^{1}(z^{2}y - z^{3})\delta z&amp; 5 \leq y &lt; 6\\ 0&amp; y \geq 6\\ \end{cases} \qquad = \begin{cases}0\\ -\frac{255}{4} + 43z + \frac{z^{4}}{12} - 8z^{2}\\ \frac{369}{4} - \frac{122z}{3} + \frac{9z^{2}}{2}\\ 156 - 83z - \frac{z^{4}}{12} + \frac{25z^{2}}{2}\\ 0\\ \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
*** When &lt;math&gt;y &lt; 3\,&lt;/math&gt; the integral has no bounds since &lt;math&gt;(y&lt;3) - 4 &lt; -1\,&lt;/math&gt; so the upper bound would be less than &lt;math&gt;-1\,&lt;/math&gt; which would be &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;.
*** When &lt;math&gt;3 \leq y &lt; 4\,&lt;/math&gt; the integral is bound between &lt;math&gt;-1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y - 4\,&lt;/math&gt;since &lt;math&gt;y - 4\,&lt;/math&gt; will be at least &lt;math&gt;-1\,&lt;/math&gt; but less than &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;
*** As you can see there is a pattern here, it goes as follows:
**** Given &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b}(\cdot)1_{[c,d]}\delta z\,&lt;/math&gt; you will have &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}y &lt; (d - a = 0)\\ (d - a = 0) \leq y &lt; (c - a = 0)\\ (c - a = 0) \leq y &lt; (d - b = 0)\\ (d - b = 0) \leq y &lt; (c - b = 0)\\ y \geq (c - b = 0)\\ \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{FrenchToC}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In French, the two forms of the infinitive are [[French/Grammar/Tenses/Infinitive|present]] and past. Read on below to learn more about the past infinitive.

==Formation==
The past infinitive is composed of '''avoir''' or '''être''' in infinitive form and the past participle of a verb.
*avoir parlé - having spoken
*être allé(e)(s) - having gone
Note that both avoir and être translate to ''having'' in English. This is the same in all composed tenses.
The past participle may have an -e or -s added in order to agree with other parts of the sentence. All standard agreement rules that composed tenses follow apply to the past infinitive as well.
*Je suis content(e) d'avoir été là. - I am happy of having been there.
*Je suis content(e) de les avoir vu(e)s. - I am happy of having seen them.
To make the past infinitive negative, add ne pas in front of ''avoir'' or ''être''.
*Je suis content(e) de ne '''pas''' avoir été là. - I am happy of '''not''' having been there.

==Usage==
The past infinitive is always used only after prepositions, such as ''de'', ''après'', or ''sans''. 
*Je suis parti(e) sans avoir entendu la fille. - I left without having heard the girl.
*Je suis parti(e) après avoir entendu la fille. - I left after having heard the girl.
To express a similar idea without a preposition, [[French/Grammar/Verbs/Present participle|the composed present participle]] is used.
*Je suis parti(e) ayant entendu la fille. - I left having heard the girl.

Hallo, Zak! Schön, dass Du das Projekt um eine obersorbisch-niedersorbische Seite erweitert hast, sehr spannend! Ich glaube, Du wärest der Richtige, um  die noch benötigten [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Upper Sorbian#Translations needed|obersorbischen]] und [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Lower Sorbian#Translations needed|niedersorbischen]] '''Übersetzungen''' zu besorgen. --[[User:Buncic|Daniel Bunčić]] 09:54, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
:Ich hab mal paar Übersetzungen erledigt. Falls ich was übersehen habe, einfach darauf hinweisen und ich schau´s mir mal an. Ein Artikel über Obersorbisch und Niedersorbisch war mir jetzt erstmal zu viel. :D --[[User:Zak|Zak]] 16:07, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
:: Super, danke! Du solltest jetzt nur noch auf der [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Upper Sorbian#Translations needed|obersorbischen]] und [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Lower Sorbian#Translations needed|niedersorbischen]] Diskussionsseite vermerken, dass Du die Übersetzungen gemacht hast, damit dort wirklich nur noch benötigte Übersetzungen aufgelistet sind. (Vielleicht ist es sogar sinnvoll, ausnahmsweise mal bestehenden Text einfach zu löschen, um die Seite lesbarer zu machen.) Liebe Grüße! --[[User:Buncic|Daniel Bunčić]] 16:16, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Colon convention and interwiki links ==

What if someone creates a &quot;cookbook&quot; wiki, and someone adds &quot;cookbook&quot; to [[m:Interwiki map]]? Does this means that all [[Cookbook]] links on Wikibooks, like this link [[Cookbook:Recipes]], start failing? That is, do interwiki links conflict with our colon convention? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:37, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

:Raises a good point, but i can't imagine anybody naming a new wiki something that doesnt have the wiki-prefix attached. I can see a &quot;wikicooks&quot; or something like that spring up, or a &quot;wikicookbooks&quot; or something. All of the new books that I have been working on all use the forward-slash convention anyway, i think that's the best way to go. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:49, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

Our current [[MetaWikipedia:Interwiki map]] is bloated. I can do [[Google:Cookbook]] and [[FreeBSDman:cat]]. What if someone copies &quot;Cookbook&quot; from [http://pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/InterMap the default PmWiki InterMap]? (I was surprised to encounter a &quot;cookbook:&quot; wiki, but at least there might not much interest in linking to PmWiki recipes from MediaWiki wikis.) --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:19, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

== Colon Convention Usefulness ==

Could someone explain to me the use of colon convention? I personally think it makes more work for writers, isn't a practice used in other Wikis, and causes a lot of trouble with the MediaWiki software. I like the idea of removing the acceptance of colon convention from this policy entirely. To me, slash notation is a lot cleaner and there's a lot more experience with it by many.

:I agree wholeheartedly. there are no benefits to the colon convention, and there are benefits to the slash convention. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 22:32, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
::I'd like for the section to be removed from the policy then (if more people support it). The real problem is getting all the old books fixed up, but I really think getting this policy moved to &quot;enforced&quot; first is a step in that direction.

:::The current reason for colon convention seems to be to avoid renaming several existing pages, including the [[Cookbook]] pages. However, I do prefer slash convention for books that I edit, and I did mention the conflict with interwiki links in the previous thread. But my one reason for supporting colon convention is that I currently use it in the category and template namespaces (especially as {{tl|Guide to X11:stub}} does not match any submodule &quot;Guide to X11/stub&quot;). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:23, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::::That is a good point. We could keep the colon convention around for use in templates, because in templates, everything is already in the Template: namespace. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 15:11, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::::I agree that Template should stay around (should have specified that since I never wanted it gone to begin) since it is a proper use of the convention. One thing we may want to add to this policy is that the colon convention should only be used by things like templates, but to keep the templates within a structure of their own based on the book. The Guide to X11 is close to an example of what I'd like. It's not just &quot;Template:Xinerama&quot; or something like that but &quot;Template:Guide to X11/Xinerama.&quot; It might not be a bad idea to keep the templates structured this way. Is there a problem with that implementation? -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 15:33, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:: With respect to the [[Cookbook]], one reason for using the colon convention is that the book is supposedly supposed to get its own namespace (indicated by &quot;namespace:&quot;) and leaving it as-is would relieve any updating of links. When this happens is of course completely up to wikimedia administrators and developers so who knows. Also, unlike other books, the Cookbook has much less structure, so I think most pages would end up just being &quot;Cookbook/Recipe Name&quot; anyway...

== one way that colons work better than slashes ==

''&quot;colon convention? I personally think it makes more work for writers&quot;''

I have found one way that colons work better than slashes.
Writers often refer to other chapters of the book.
Writers spend less effort and are less likely to make mistakes
when they use the [[w:pipe trick]].
But the pipe trick only works when titles use colon or the parentheses.
(How do I file a bug report to request that the pipe trick be improved, so that it also works when titles contain slashes?)
Because of the [[w:pipe trick]],
* [[Gardening:Sweet Potato|Sweet Potato]]  [[GCSE Science/Electrical Power|Electrical Power]] [[Embedded Systems:Embedded System Basics|Embedded System Basics]] (see the colon?) or
* [[Sweet Potato (Gardening)|Sweet Potato]] [[GCSE Science/Electrical Power|Electrical Power]] [[Embedded System Basics (Embedded Systems)|Embedded System Basics]] (see the parentheses?)
take less work than using the slash to write
* [[Gardening/Sweet Potato|Sweet Potato]]  [[GCSE Science/Electrical Power|Electrical Power]] [[Embedded Systems/Embedded System Basics|Embedded System Basics]] (see the slash and the extra typing?)
.

Couldn't we add the book name to the end of a book and shorten it, as in &quot;Certification (mmm)&quot;, &quot;Downloading Script (mmm)&quot; and so on?

== Bad Tactics ==

:I have no problem with the concept of coming up with a standard for naming modules, and I am in general agreement with the proposed policy. But I strongly object to placement of banners on modules that appear not to presently fit the suggested naming &quot;rule&quot;.  These banners are essentially a form of vandalism to the book or module. If they are intended to convey a suggestion (that renaming is in order), then they belong on the discussion page of the module where any information intebnded for contributors is placed. What was one of the real pluses of working at Wikibooks, was the lack of editors with nothing better to do than run around imposing their idea of what is correct on contributing editors work. This phase has apparently ended here. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:13, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

:: I don't understand you. It is a common Wikipedia rule to place cleanup messages at front of page, not discussion page.

First will be marked as enforced, second as proposed policy. I would see most of the current article in first part, including title delimiter rules and page structure. As we still have doubts about categories, templates and aliases, these paragraphs will be marked as proposed.

As for me, I would support every consistent policy, regardless which shape it will have. I find current policy mature and well-written, maybe excluding part concerning category naming, but I would accept it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks needs best page titles (and happy authors) ==

=== Problems with forcing article titles to be computer filenames ===

The articles (modules) written for Wikibooks need to have a good title (something your English teacher would have approved as an appropriate title) and also a concise filename (something your computer programming teacher would have approved) for use in programming functions such as linking to the article and showing its hierarchy within the chapter and book.   This was easy on Wikipedia, because each article (module) could have a short title (encyclopia articles typically do have short titles) which could also serve as the filename.  And the Wikipedia articles do not have to link back to any higher level article, so the automatic Table of Contents box on Wikipedia only needs to show the downward hierarchy of any sections and subsections within the article, but it does not need to show any upward hierarchy.  But the Wikipedia page naming method and the Wikipedia auto TOC do not really fit the needs of Wikibooks.  &lt;br/&gt;
For example, suppose that the editor for a book on Windmills would like to invite a respected historian to contribute an article (module, or section of the book) on the topic of history of the traditional American farm windmill.  The historian may wish to call his article, &quot;History of the Traditional American Farm Windmill.&quot;  The historian might not like to have his article forced to be named:  Windmills/History/Farms/American or any other article title which looks like a computer file name.  He might not accept the invitation to write the article is he is forced to use some computer convention in naming his work.  Forcing the current '''proposed''' Wikibook:Naming Policy may make it harder for book editors to recruit the best people to write the articles.  --[[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 16:02, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

Has anyone heard of a high quality book publisher (for printed books) who requires book editors and authors to name their book sections according to a hierarchical format (like a computer file structure) as proposed on the WB:Naming Policy page as follows? &lt;br/&gt;
Lifeforms/Animals/Insects/Butterfly &lt;br/&gt;
I think that removing ability of book editors and authors to name their work could make many of them unhappy and likely to look elsewhere for a kinder book publisher.
&lt;br/&gt;
The reason for the current proposed policy (requiring a computer file naming structure as the Wikibook page naming convention) is to show the hierarchical position of the page within the book, and also to help readers quickly navigate to the next higher level section.  But there might be a better way to do this than using the page title for this purpose.   We need to find a way to meet both objectives:  (1) let authors provide best title for the page, and (2) provide a way to show page hierarchy and quick link to the &quot;parent&quot; page.  [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]]

* The recommended alternative to the name &quot;History of the Traditional American Farm Windmill&quot; is not &quot;Windmills/History/Farms/American&quot; but rather &quot;Windmills/History of the Traditional American Farm Windmill.&quot;  The former alternative may be offputting to a historian, but the second is considerably less likely to be so.  The proposed policy does not require a hierarchical naming scheme.  In particular, it does not require a name like &quot;Lifeforms/Animals/Insects/Butterfly.&quot;  The hierarchical naming scheme is given as one alternative, and not even as the recommended one.  The flat naming scheme is given as the recommended alternative.  In it, the butterfly page becomes &quot;Lifeforms/Butterfly&quot;.  If even this seems a bit offputting, remember that this is an example used to illustrate the difference between the flat and hierarchical schemes.  For a real book that follows the recommended nameing scheme, see [[How To Build A Computer]] which was listed approvingly as an example in the policy.  For a book I'm writing, [[Formal Logic]], I use a mixed scheme.  It has a three level hierarchy with further organization at the the lowest level following the flat naming scheme.  Although not specifically forseen by the naming policy, this plan complies with it.  See also my comment to your [[Wikibooks Talk:Naming_policy#Idea_1_-_Use_page_filename_and_page_title|Idea 1]] below.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 16:04, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

:* Yes, you are right to point out that the flat naming naming scheme is given as the recommended alternative, and that is likely to be less offputting to authors.  I like the idea of having alternatives and recommendations regarding the naming scheme to be available to book editors.  But even the flat naming scheme can be awkward when the book title is long and the section title is long.  I just went to my bookshelf and pulled out a random book, to see how authors might be naming their book sections.  
::The book is &quot;An Introduction to Philosophy: Ideas in Confict&quot; (by Peter Y. Windt).  
:::Chapter 11 is titled &quot;Perception and Knowledge of the Physical World&quot; and the first section in that chapter is titled 
::::&quot;Rene Descartes: 'Sceptical Doubts about Our Knowledge of the Physical World.&quot;  
:So the page name for this section would be long and probably spill over into two lines of text.  The flat naming scheme could be made less offputting to authors if the first line (the book name before the divider) were in smaller font that the second line (the title of the section), and if the line break came at a logical place such as just after the divider. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 16:22, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
::* Suppose Wikibooks (or WikiCommons) editor wished to import an existing classics book (with permission, of course) and set it up with all the linkages.  If the original book had long titles, as above, it would be handy to have a shorthand version to type as links (within the double brackets).  So a page name that is structured as computer filename would be helpful as a shorthand, such as,  PhilosophyIntro:Perception:Descartes for the above case.  Then the pages would look better if the page filename appeared in small font and the actual article title appeared in prominent font.  
:*Now there is the second issue of whether to force authors to use the slash as the divider.  Using the slash, rather than colon, triggers the feature of automatically putting the backlink to the higher level module (first part of page name before the slash) just under the page name.  But some book editors may prefer to make their own backlink in their own format, and may not want a duplicate automatic backlink put on the book pages.  I think that editors should be free to do this, as long as they do indeed provide some backlink. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 16:22, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
::*Also I think the slash looks less aesthetic in print, because it does not provide enough visual separation between the words.

=== Unbundling TWO Proposed Policies - Naming and BackLinking ===
*The current proposed policy on [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] actually combines two proposals.  The first is the naming convention and the second is how the article will be linked back to the parent article (module).  Under the current proposal, lower level page names will be required to include the names of higher level modules within their page name, and to separate the multiple higher level names using slashes.  Using slashes in the multilevel page name (instead of colon or dash or space) then triggers the function of automatically showing the backlinks (in small font) just below the page name on each page.  This automatic backlinking feature then either forces the book editor to accept this method of showing backlinking on the pages, or it produces a duplicate backlinking if the book editor has already provided his own system of backlinking and showing page hierarchy.  I notice that [[User:Marshman]] already uses his own system of showing page hierarchy and backlinking in his [[Botany]] book, and his system looks very nice and looks better than the backlinking system to be forced by the proposed WB:NP. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 16:02, 27 January 2006 (UTC)


=== Idea 1 - Use page filename and page title ===
*One idea is to not try to make the page name serve two different and incompatible objectives at the same time.  Instead, separate the two functions by having both a page filename (which shows hierarchy) and a page title (whatever authors want for any new page title). 
:One method of doing this is shown in book on Botany in chapter on Mycoloty, [[Botany Mycology]], where the page name (first line on the page) is allowed to be a computer filename, and the actual page (or chapter) title is written as text in large font.   So the author can select any most appropriate title he wishes.  I would just prefer that the font for the filename be made smaller in comparison with the actual title for the article.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 16:02, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
:Another method (as used by Wikipedia) is to let the page name be the article title.  Then the page filename would need to be shown in smaller font below the page title, and there would need to be some way for the author to enter the correct title (rather than the page filename) as the first line on the page.  [[User:Krischik|Krischik]] in his comment (above) offered a possible coding method for doing this.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 16:02, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

:* The method employed in [[Botany Mycology]] does not violate the naming policy, though the page name &quot;Botany Mycology&quot; does.  Changing the page name to &quot;Botany/Mycology&quot; to conform with the naming policy would not change the fact that the page employs Idea 1.  In other words, your idea is consistent with the naming policy.  The wiki software provides no support for implementing this idea, but there is nothing, naming policy or otherwise, to prevent you from implementing it by hand as you did in [[Botany Mycology]].  You were concerned above about the offputting name &quot;Windmills/History/Farms/American.&quot;  Implementing Idea 1 by hand should soothe the few prospective authors that would be put off by the page name &quot;Windmills/History of the Traditional American Farm Windmill.&quot;  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 16:22, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Idea 2 - Improve the auto TOC ===
*Second idea  (which may even solve two problems in organizing a book):   Improve the automatic table of contents feature on each wikibook page so that it shows the page hierarchy upwards as well as downwards.  Then the reader could click on the higher level section or chapter in the auto TOC to navigate to the &quot;parent&quot; page.  

=== Idea 3 - Status quo with superheadings ===
*I prefer the status quo where book authors are still allowed to name their book pages as they think best (and no one sneakily adds a bot-written box on the discussion pages to lure readers to change the &quot;nonconforming&quot; page names into the computer file structure format).  Anything to help the book authors (help, not force) to improve the clarity and consistency of page hierarchy and improve quick page navigation within the book will be welcome.  I'd like to make better use of the existing auto TOC feature for this purpose.  Does anyone know how to fix the section numbering within the auto TOC so that the first section is not always numbered as 1.0?  For example, if the page is chapter 4 of the book, I would like for the auto TOC to begin numbering the page subheadings as 4.1 then 4.2 then 4.3 etc.  With ability to control the numbering, I could then show the upward hierarchy for the page in the auto TOC by using some subheadings creatively as superheadings. [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 00:42, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Idea 4 - Page name using 2 lines and 2 fonts ===
*This might be a compromise solution.  Using the proposed naming policy (with slashes) sometimes causes long page names which spill over into two lines at top of a page.   The page would look better if this line break occurred at a logical place, such as after the last slash.  That would provide a better visual separation of the book name (on the first line) from the chapter or section name (on the second line).  I suggest making this separation even when the page name is short.  If the first line of the page name (the book title) could be shown in small font, with the second line (the title of the chapter or section) in the existing large font, that might provide a way to meet both objectives.   - [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 14:04, 26 January 2006 (UTC)


I'm strongly sceptical about all these ideas. MediaWiki team is focused on improvements useful for Wikipedia, I don't think they would put much effort on features useful only at a marginal project, which Wikibooks unfortunately is. Even if they started working on it, I won't expect results very soon - should we sit and wait for new MediaWiki version? Moreover, in my opinion there will always be books that won't fit schema of &quot;normal&quot; Wikibooks, having an odd structure which would mess up automatic navigation generating. As for me, we are stick to current naming conventions.

One more thing: what if a module got orphaned? If it was named like &quot;Solution 3&quot; it would be very hard to find it's parent book. If you check [[Special:Lonelypages|orphaned page list]], you will see how big this problem is. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:44, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Examples where filename and title differ ===
[[image:wiki-titles-x11-building.png|thumb|right|400px|screenshot of [[Guide to X11/Building]]]]
I had a similar problem at Wikisource; the page was called [[Wikisource:Elements of Style:Form|Elements of Style:Form]] but I wanted the title to be &quot;IV. A Few Matters of Form&quot;. I added the title in a manner similar to what [[Botany]] does.

Today I adjusted [[Guide to X11/Building]] in the same way. At the top of the page:
# Filename &quot;Guide to X11/Building&quot;, which is what I copy and put in double-square-brackets when I want to make a link.
# Backlink &quot;&lt; [[Guide to X11]]&quot; to the front page of the book.
# {{tl|Guide to X11}} which produces a green box for navigation.
# Contents automatically inserted by MediaWiki.
# &lt;tt&gt;== Building ==&lt;/tt&gt;, the title; one can replace it with a longer title without renaming the page.

An [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Guide_to_X11/Building&amp;oldid=271497 older version of the same page] only had elements 1 and 2, the minimum needed to label and navigate this book. When I created the page, if I had called it &quot;Guide to X11:Building&quot; instead, the link would be missing, like how [[Civ:Terminology]] has no link to [[Civ]]. But [[Botany Mycology]] is an example of authors providing links without using slash convention. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:58, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

::This is a good example, and it shows a professional looking page.  It also shows a TOC feature where I have wished for a solution.  Your green box shows that Building is your book's chapter 3, but the automatic TOC shows number 1. Building.  Does anyone know how to make the TOC show the correct chapter, by numbering as 3. Building, with the sections below numbered as 3.1 then 3.2 then 3.3?   -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 20:38, 30 January 2006 (UTC)


=== Idea 5 - Use a Book portal, similar to Wikipedia use of topic portals ===
:Wikipedia has several major topic portals to help guide readers to pages which all pertain to a particular topic (Geography, Science, etc.).  Might be possible for Wikibooks to also use the portal concept, with Book:Bookname instead of Portal:Geography.  In Wikipedia, each page pertaining to the portal topic then gets a template pointing back to the portal entrance.  Simiilarly, each page on a Wikibook could also get a template (perhaps as the very first code on the page) pointing back to the book mainpage.

=== Idea 6 - Each book gets own domain name or subwiki, similar to Wikicities projects ===
See discussion under the subwiki topic (below).  Also, on February 5, [[User:Cramer|Cramer]] asked about giving each book its own domain name, similar to the way that Wikicities gives each project its own domain name.  For example, the StarWars wikicity has domain name [http://starwars.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page].  This would keep all the pages in a book together within the same domain name, without having to include the book title in every page name.



==Where was vote on &quot;deprecated&quot; naming schemes?==
The [[WB:NP|proposed naming policy]] points out historical conventions which are said to be &quot;deprecated&quot; (which means disapproved and belittled).  But I've looked at current talk page and the one archived talk page, and do not see any discussion or consensus about this.   Where is it?  The archived talk page shows the losing vote for the [[WB:NP|proposed naming policy]], with its push to force consistency in page naming.  This [[Wikibooks talk:Naming policy/Archive 1|losing vote]] is one reason it is unwise to be pushing readers to enforce this proposal and punishing book editors for &quot;violating&quot; it, when it is only a proposal which has already lost a vote.  I'll change the project page to remove implication that these other naming schemes are presently deprecated (rather than proposed to be deprecated).  It this change is incorrect (if there has actually already been consensus to deprecate some naming schemes), then OK with me to revert and put the correct information on the page. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 18:04, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

: I can't imagine situation where there are 10 different, incompatibile naming conventions allowed at a project. That's completely absurd and would end up with making reading and managing books impossible. If we don't have some standards, don't integrate books together, Wikibooks will turn into unorganised host for completely independent, standalone books with small, closed groups of contributors - because every book would have completely different editorial guidelines. Is that what we want?
: From list of historical naming conventions especially 'no delimiter convention' is the most detrimental and misleading one, it obfuscates book name and makes using automated tools (like bots, but also finding parent book) almost impossible. Wikipedia convention causes the same problem, also disambiguation convention is not convenient in this category. Why we should care about bots? Suppose we have book &quot;Movie making manual&quot; and their authors decided they want the title &quot;Movie Making Manual&quot;. But unfortunately first book author started naming pages with one of conventions mentioned above and they have to rename 50 pages manualy. If they had pages named in slash or colon convention, running bot which would alter every page of this book would be very easy.

::A second vote sounds like a good idea.  Well, consistency has advantages, and freedom of choice always comes with the risk of making a poor choice (as well as the opportunity to create a better choice than the conventional choice, or just to be a different flavor).  Would you like to remove the user preferences option for Wikibooks?  Before casting my vote, I'd like to hear more from your perspective about the advantages of consistency.

: Last comment by Kernigh gave me an excellent example on how book could mess up with naming convention. Look at [[Botany]] - there are three different naming styles in the main TOC. In my opinion, our policy should clearly dissuade users from giving books such structure.
: Why consistency is important? Do you imagine that people wanting to contribute to someone else's book have to learn everything from scratch for every single book? It's not important which naming convention we choose, the thing is that we should have only one or maybe two so that readers and contributors won't be confused with every new book. Yes, authors are very creative, but in my opinion they should concentrate on writing content not inventing new naming systems. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:00, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
:: Yes, I think that you have the right idea here about pointing out advantages and disadvantages of    the two approaches (status quo versus proposal 2).  So below there is a new subheading to help with that comparison.  Wikibooks is a collaborative effort of people with various skills - computer programing, editing, knowledge of specific subjects, etc.  The policies need to find a good middle ground, and so discussion from these different perspectives will be helpful. -- [[User:KHatcher]]

:To correct, that vote is not very significant for current discussion. The votes are across a span of six months and the page content changed quite a bit across the &quot;voting time.&quot; The votes pointed out important discussion topics at the time but weren't really maintained by those voting.

There was no &quot;loss&quot; in my opinion since those votes covered way too many issues and were outdated. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 18:09, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

== Comparing pros and cons for status quo versus proposal 2 ==

=== Clear statement of Proposal 2 ===
Proposal 2, as request by Derbeth (above) is &quot;to completely forbid all historical conventions (I mean all except colon and slash one) for newly created books&quot;. 

*'''New books''' - only slash is allowed as delimiter for page names. Page names must be in format  &lt;Bookname/Chaptername&gt;.  Colon as delimiter is reserved to Cookbook only.
*'''Existing books''' - Any convention can be used, provided that book name is included in every chapter title.  No cleanup boxes regarding page naming will be used on any existing books.  Existing books must provide their own backlinks on all pages (except slash convention which automatically provides the backlinks).
*'''Enforcement''' -  Polite cleanup request can be put on the discussion page (not the module page) of nonconforming new books.  There is no enforcement for existing books.

=== Clear statement of Status quo ===

Book editors may use their discretion in naming pages in a new book and existing books. The [[WB:NP]] page will provide guidance to help new book editors make an informed choice.  Books must provide their own backlinks (using their own format) on all pages, unless slash convention is used to provide the standard automatic backlinking.  A template may be used on pages to provide the backlinking to the book title and chapters.   The [[WB:NP]] will provide advice and examples of such book templates and custom backlinking. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 22:23, 30 January 2006 (UTC)


=== Proposal 2 - advantages and disadvantages ===

Pros:
* consistent, clear, easy to understand for readers and editors naming policy
* slash convention provides pre-formatted automatic backlinks to the higher level pages (bookname, chaptername)
* slash convention provides exclusive possiblity to use fast links to subchapters (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/chapter/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) and sibling chapters (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[../sibling/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;), saving the time for typing the longer form (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[bookname/chapter]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;)
* colon convention: only one applicable for namespaces (which Cookbook is)

Cons:
* does not let book authors decide which naming convention is best for them
* forces book section names to look like computer file names, such as: Windmills/Australian farms
* if authors want to use a better book section title, such as &quot;History of Windmills on Australian Farms&quot; then the page appears to have two large-font titles 
* slash convention inserts a mandatory (no option to turn it off) second line of text on each page with the pre-formatted backlink, which is unnecessary if pages include their own backlinks or book contents template such as [[Botany]] example.
* slash convention causes multiple redundancy with cluttered appearance at top of each page if authors want to use literary titles for book sections instead of computer file names, and also use their own backlinks (or book contents template) instead of the pre-formatted backlinks.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 16:24, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

=== Status Quo - advantages and disadvantages ===

Pros:
* book auhors have full freedom

Cons:
* two completely different books may link to the same chapter without knowing it (like [[Contents]])
* makes automatics tasks (use of bots to fix errors) hard
* may confuse readers and contributors (if a contributor sees two books with completely different naming conventions)
* two different naming convention in one book are allowed

I think that if good advice is provided at [[WB:NP]], nearly all new books' editors will decide to use the slash convention or the colon convention.  But the books' editors will be able to use a different custom page naming scheme if they believe that better suits the book purpose. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 22:23, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

::I really see no benefits of the colon convention over the slash convention (given that slashes allow for better navigation). Let's require all new books to use the slash convention of &lt;Book title/Chapter&gt; (and if they wish &lt;Book title/Chapter/Subchapter&gt;, &lt;Book title/Chapter/Subchapter/Subsubchapter&gt;, etc). It allows for a lot of editor freedom, and has the benefit of clearly segregating each book so that you're never confused as to what book you're reading.

::Then encourage existing books over to this convention. No doubt, at some stage, we'll then be left in time with a small rump of books that haven't changed over to the slash convention. We can look at forcing the final resistance over then, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:23, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

== In defense of a slash ==

(I started writing this comment before the pros and cons heading above was added.  I would have written in in a more pro v. con style had I seen it earlier.)

Wikibooks faces a significant organizational challenge that sets us apart from our sister wikis.  We write books, not self-contained articles.  Because of this, we need some mechanism for organizing our individual modules pages into discrete books.  The wiki software provides only very meager facilities for this.  We have to do most of the work by adopting some sort of convention or other.  The slash naming convention provides three important organizing elements.  Whether we adopt the slash convention or some other, adopting any convention will require enforcing some rules.  If it is not an enforced policy, then it is not an adopted convention.

1.  The slash naming convention helps authors avoid stepping on each other’s page names.  For example, book I am working on, [[Formal Logic]], has a page ([[Formal Logic/Sets]]) giving a quick and dirty introduction to set theory terminology used in the rest of [[Formal Logic]].  There are also set theory chapters of [[Discrete mathematics]], [[Topology]], [[Puzzles]], [[Beginning Mathematics]], and perhaps others.  Any number of additional books might want a brief introduction on set theory such as in [[Formal Logic]] but geared to their own book.  As another example, a chapter on mushrooms might show up in books on botany (the book [[Botany]] has a chapter on the broader topic of fungi), cooking, gardening,  Super Mario, illegal drugs, or or books to which finding edible mushrooms is relevant (hobbies, survivalism, pig-breeding).  The slash convention allows all these current and perhaps future pages co-exist peacefully.  This is especially important when a book is mapped out with red-linked future pages.  The author is guaranteed he won't be surprised by a name clash when gets around to adding a page to match the red link.
:: These are good points.  They are not solely advantages of the the slash convention, however.  They are achieved by all the historical conventions which do use the book name (or its abbreviation) somewhere in the page name.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 10:35, 31 January 2006 &lt;small&gt;(Note: The [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Naming_policy&amp;diff=350867&amp;oldid=350828 post of 10:35, 31 January 2006], was made from IP address [[Special:Contributions/128.192.18.97|128.192.18.97]] while the user was not logged in.)&lt;/small&gt;
:::You are not exactly right. Two naming conventions: slash and colon are naturally preferred. One reason is that you can find them in Wikipedia (colon is used in namespaces and slash in subpages). We don't want to embarrass people coming from Wikipedia to Wikibooks by introducing strange naming conventions. Another thing privileging slash and colon conventions are MediaWiki links. You can use &quot;pipe trick&quot; with colon convention: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:onion|]]s&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and another trick with slash convention: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Subchapter/]] [[../Sibling chapter/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. This is impossible with all other conventions.  I think these two facts show real advantage colon and slash convention have over other conventions. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

2.  The slash naming convention places a page within a book and lets the reader know where in the book you are.  The reader readily sees that he is at this subpage of that chapter of such-and-such a book.  At present, for example, it is ambiguous whether Wikibooks has a set theory book.  There is a Set Theory link from the [[Wikibooks:Mathematics bookshelf|Mathematics bookshelf]].  But [[Set Theory]] is a redirect to [[Topology/Set Theory]] which may be its own book or may be a chapter of [[Topology]], it’s actually ambiguous which it is.  The subpages of [[Topology/Set Theory]] have names like [[Set Theory:Axioms]] which adds to the confusion.  And who knows what book [[Set Theory:Review]] review belongs to?  It is one of our approximately 1000 [[Special:Lonelypages|orphaned pages]].  It is entirely unclear whether [[Set Theory:Review]] was intended as belonging to [[Topology/Set Theory]].  Without an enforced consistent convention which places pages within a book and which lets the reader know where in the book you are, we end up with a big mess.
:: These are good points.  They are not solely advantages of the slash convention, however.  They are achieved by all of the historical naming conventions for which the editors do provide backlinks to show position of the page within the book.  It is not necessary to require duplicate methods to show position of the page within the book, both backlinks and the page naming scheme. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 10:35, 31 January 2006

3.  The slash naming convention provides automatic back-links.  This makes it possible to find pages up the hierarchy and, in particular, find the root or main page of the book.  Some authors can’t be bothered to adhere to any naming convention, not even a book-specific convention (see, for example, [[Botany]] whose page names vary among approximately three conventions).  But even these tend to provide back links within their books.  So the importance of back-links seems unquestioned.
:: I agree about importance of back-links.  Perhaps the policy should be to require backlinks, rather than to require a particular page naming scheme.  Orphan pages are then defined as those which are missing the backlink to the parent module. 
:: That the slash convention provides automatic back-links in a standard style would be an advantage for book editors who like that style, but a disadvantage for book editors who would prefer to have a different style of backlinking, such as by using a template on each page to show the book outline. In that case, the slash convention puts duplicate and unnecesssary backlinking information on the page and also puts duplicate information in the page name about position of page within the book.  Some book editors may like to have their own graphic design style for the book, and not be forced to use a standard style or to have duplicate information cluttering up the pages.  Yes, there are some novices on Wikibooks who are sloppy about book set up.  It would good to have a way to deal with this, without harming the competent book editors.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 10:35, 31 January 2006
::: &lt;small&gt;My apologies for not getting back to this until after the vote started.&lt;/small&gt;  The issue is not just competent v. sloppy authors.  It is also a issue of mature books v. new books.  Books are frequently created as a few red links and evolve into something useful.  The authors will often not fully know where the  book is going, what the graphic design should be, what sorts of navigational help will be best suited for that particular book.  It would be fairly absurd to start a book and comply with a slash convention (becuase you haven't got all that figured out yet&amp;mdash;and then rename all the pages in a freewheeling non-complient way when the book matures and they type of alternative navagation assistance becomes settled.  Besides, it the automatic back-link line really obnoxious?  It does not seem any more obnoxious then the &quot;Redirected from ..;..&quot;  link.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 07:15, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

The slash convention provides these organizational features, but perhaps other conventions could do so as well.  The kinds of convention we can adopt divide into two sorts: page name conventions and content conventions.  (By content convention, I mean requirements concerning actual page content, the stuff that you type in on an edit page.  And by adopting a convention, I mean enforcing a policy.)  Among page name conventions, the slash convention is the only one that will provide all three advantages.  The colon convention, and perhaps others, can provide the first two advantages.  However, only the slash convention provides automatic back links.  Further, no content convention can provide us with the first of these features.  So any alternative to the slash convention that provides all three organizational features will have to be a mixture of page and content conventions.
:: I think the Wikibooks uses the term &quot;convention&quot; to mean just the most common methods and not enforced.  But term accepted &quot;policy&quot; would mean enforced.  -- [[User:128.192.18.97|128.192.18.97]] 15:39, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

Imagine what an enforced content convention ensuring back links would look like.  Would it simply say that you must provide some back links of some sort?  Back links to the main page?  Back links up the page hierarchy (assuming that there is a page hierarchy)?  What other standards would they have to meet?  Would you be prohibited from adding additional back links?  If you think automatic back links resulting from the slash convention are obtrusive and big-brotherish, imagine you would feel about an enforced content policy requiring back-links.  The same kind of consideration goes for an enforced content policy requiring the content to include information as to book the page belongs to and where in the book the page is.

I submit that enforcing the slash convention is the best, most robust, least obtrusive, and least big-brotherish means we have of organizing pages into books.

It has been objected that the slash convention restricts author options.  For, example, I can’t entitle my page “History of the Traditional American Farm Windmill.”  But there is no reason an author can’t provide such a title in the content independently of the page name.  [[Botany Mycology]] does this, (though the page name does not conform to the slash convention).  It has been objected that authors want to provide their own back linking scheme, one which may well work better in a particular book than the automatic back links generated by the slash convention.  But there is no reason an author can’t provide his own back linking scheme in addition to the slash convention’s automatic back links. [[Formal Logic]] and [[Guide to X11]] do this.
:: These points provide a work-around for the slash convention, by letting authors provide a duplicate page title and a duplicate method of backlinks if they have to use the slash convention but don't like how it makes page names look or how it shows the backlinks.  Book editors may not want to have book graphic design style with such duplicate information on all the pages. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 10:35, 31 January 2006

Our authors’ flexibility in how they collect, organize, and back link their pages would be even more constrained if we enforced content conventions concerning these matters.  And enforce we must, for otherwise we end up with a mess.  Indeed, we already have a mess as indicated by our thousand orphaned pages.  In Wikipedia, each article is supposed to be self-contained, so orphaned pages are less important.  In Wikibooks, an orphaned page is part of a book that is not really part of a book after all&amp;mdash;so orphaned pages are a much more serious affair.  Perhaps if the wiki software provided better tools for organizing pages into books, we would not have to enforce a naming convention at all.  But it doesn’t, and we have to work with the software we have.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 22:48, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
::I would prefer to continue to look for better tools using wiki software to achieve important organizing goals, while continuing to give book editors choice about book graphic design style.  Is there another way to deal with the orphaned pages, such as searching for those having no backlinks and putting them all under an &quot;orphaned book pages&quot; folder (book) for a certain period of time until they are repaired?
:: By the way, why are orphaned pages (with no backlinks) such a serious problem on Wikibooks, when all the pages on Wikipedia have no backlinks?   I don't really see a serious problem here, just perhaps a small aesthetic issue of wanting to look different than Wikipedia.  Could someone please explain?  OK, so Wikibooks would have some pages (maybe a lot of pages) which look like Wikipedia pages.  Why is this bad?  It is not bothering me as a book editor or as a reader of Wikibooks.

Actually, '''every''' [[Wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]] article and [[Wiktionary:Main Page|Wiktionary]] entry has a backlink called &quot;Main Page&quot;. Also, encyclopedia articles and dictionary entries have predictable names; Wikibooks do not. I have to check a bookshelf to search to know if a book is called [[Letter writing]] or &quot;Writing a Letter&quot; or &quot;How to write a letter&quot; or &quot;Effective Letters&quot;. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:27, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

:I'd like to add that one of the reasons why orphaned modules are such a huge problem on Wikibooks as well is that generally a single module doesn't stand on its own within Wikibooks, unlike Wikipedia.  A Wikipedia article, even a stub, is self-supporting and doesn't really depend on any other article to help build its content.  That is one of the reasons why writing a Wikipedia article is generally easier to start or write, as you don't have to do nearly so much preparation.  Writing a whole book, on the other hand, takes a considerably higher level of organization and this policy is an attempt to encourage that sort of organization.  In addition, if you find an orphaned module that follows this naming convention policy, you can usually link it more directly to where it belongs, and sometimes content that would otherwise be deleted immediately as random gibberish can be kept because it can be put into context for what it represents.

:Consider for a moment this page:  [[Riddles: 28]]  This page would normally be deleted immediately on Wikipedia, but it is just fine on Wikibooks because of the context it has with the module [[Puzzles:Riddles|Riddles]].  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:40, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
::Just fine with me, too.  And it doesn't use the slash or colon convention, it uses a space-colon convention which looks good on the page.   -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 18:03, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
::: &lt;small&gt;My apologies for not getting back to this until after the vote started.&lt;/small&gt;  I think [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] was talking about the content being okay, not the page name.  The content is just a back link plus the single word &quot;Ladder&quot;.  Out of context, such a page would just be trash subject to a speedy delete.  But in context, it is the answer to a riddle posed on another page.  How do we know not to mark it for speedy delete?  Two reasons:  (1) it has a (hand placed) back link and (2) the [[Riddles]] page has a link to it.  But what if the author forgot to do (2).  Then it is an orphaned page: one cannot get to by following links.  Now suppose someone moves [[Riddles]] to [[The Book of Riddles]], thus breaking the back link.  Or suppose the author mistyped the back link and came up with [[Fiddles]] instead.  Three bad things happen.  First, someone reading the Riddles book doesn't find the answer to Riddle 28.  Second, someone else comes along a creates [[Riddles:28]] to answer Riddle 28, thus duplicating the effort of the previous author.  Third, someone marks [[Riddles: 28]] for speedy deletion because they don't know that it actually belongs to a book.

I support what's on the content page, especially only allowing slash for new pages (and '''not''' colon). I thought there was significant discussion here explaining how colon really should only be used like it is outlined on the content page. I think clean-up tags could go on talk pages only, but enforcing the naming policy on old books is a must. Here's what I think:
::*Slash only for new book content
::*Colon allowed on new pages for categories, templates, and Cookbook
::*Clean-up tags can go on both new and existing books, in the talk pages
::*Naming policy enforced on both new and existing pages
::The &quot;status quo&quot; idea seemed decently defeated here and the &quot;Clear statement of Proposal 2&quot; seems to be bringing in too much openness. I thought that what I just outlined above was largely the concensus, unless I'm missing discussion somewhere. I would vote &quot;no&quot; on the &quot;clear statement&quot; because I don't think it's what's right for organizing the large mess of improperly named pages all over here. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 17:35, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

: Ok, I made another change to restrict use of colon convention. But I don't agree with your attitude to existing books. Book authors have better things to do than correcting naming conventions. I think that we should leave it as it is and make enforcement a separate vote. Please understand, that we need any naming convention. Current proposal is less restrictive than yours, but it has chanse for wider support. We can always make another votes to change details - like enforcements for old books. Another thing is naming of categories and templates. This issue is completely unimportant for me and I would like to exclude it completely from this proposal to avoid endless discussions and think about it when we have some basic set of rules ready and accepted. We need minimal but clear set of rules ''now''. I would like to break status quo as soon as possible. If you take such restrictive approach, we won't get consensus soon. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:53, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
::Sounds reasonable to me. I think a lot of the recent bot talk was connected to fixing old colon convention pages so I didn't think authors would have to do too much to get their naming correct. I would support what you say above assuming the details can be figured out later. I think old books that didn't conform would tarnish things, but we can definitely focus on just getting new page guidelines up and running for now. I'd go for a vote. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 23:59, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

== Need to include book folder name in all page names?  or use small subwiki? ==
A book such as [[Botany|Study Guide to the Science of Botany]] has both a book folder name (Botany, at very top of the page) and an actual book title, Study Guide to the Science of Botany.  Inherent in Proposal 2 is the requirement to include the book folder name as the first portion of every page name.   Why is this needed if the page already includes a backlink to the main page of the book?  

[[User:Kernigh]]'s comment (above) about Wikipedia pages all have backlink to &quot;Main Page&quot; is fortunate because it sparks an idea.   Yes, and every Wikibooks module also has a similar backlink called &quot;Main Page&quot; back to Wikibooks, as shown in the navigation box along the left column.  [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]]'s observation sparks another idea to solve our problems, perhaps using the navigation box.  I notice that Wikicities has a way for each project there to have its own Main Page and URL &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://starwars.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page]&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Also Wikipedia provides a sub-wiki for each language.  Is there any potential to provide something like a subwiki for each book on Wikibooks?  This idea is way beyond my poor computer skills, so I hope you can comment on its feasibility. If it succeeded, we would not need to include the book folder name as part of each page name as a work-around to keeping the pages within the correct book, since they would automatically be within the correct subwiki as they were created.   Sorry if this is just wild idea, but I think we need to try think broadly and creatively about a solution to help everyone.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 18:03, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
: I don't think its technically possible, we host hunderds of books. Apart from technical problems, what do you think is easier for a newcomer: note that pages are named like &quot;Book/Chapter&quot; or that each book has its subwiki? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:41, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
:: It was technically possible on Wikipedia, though, for the languages.  When Wikipedia had this similar problem, they could have set policy that all pages names have two parts to keep pages together, so articles would be named, for example, &quot;English/History of Windmills&quot;.  That would not look so good.  Wikipedia made the better choice, and it is not hard for authors to work within the language subwiki, instead of typing &quot;Language/ArticleTitle&quot; on every page. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 21:04, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
: Haven't you noticed you need separate account for every language edition of Wikipedia, you can't use templates in one wiki in another etc. In fact distinct language editions of Wikipedia can be treated as separate projects. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:18, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
:: This problem may be fixed, BTW.  A common account system has been formally developed and tested, but trying to get it up and running is going to be a big pain in the a*** to try and merge all of the Wikimedia accounts.  Expect to hear more about this in the not too distant future.  As for common templates, yeah, that is going to be a problem.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:24, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

:Giving each book a separate subdomain would mean to break Wikibooks in a thousand of independent projects. This is technically difficult, a redundancy of effort and against maintaining a unified community. On the other hand, it would be easier to request to the developers a different rendering of root page title and subpage title than convince the Wikimedia foundation to provide a different subdomain for every book. And imagine the pain to suffer for starting a new book. If the arguments against subpages are the ugly subpage titles, then there are better ways to improve them than breaking Wikibooks in a thousand of different wikis. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:59, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
:Giving books that want to use different naming conventions/navigation system their own namespace is a lot easier, this has already been done for the [[Cookbook]]. Once a book has become a namespace its ID can then be called in CSS and the backlink disabled, or any other necessary thematic changes made. However you'd have to convince the devs, not us, they're the ones implementing it on the PHP side of things. Personally I disagree with it unless it's really irreconcilable (as the case of the Cookbook), as the backlink is very small and can be easily overpowered by making the book's own navigation system more noticeable. Hopefully one day there will be a &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOBACKLINK__&lt;/nowiki&gt; command, but until then this is the easiest solution.

== [[Wikiversity:School_of_Library_and_Information_Science#Administration]] ==

This is a funny one. I discovered it when I fixed a redirect link. Only after the fix it came to me that [[Fire Officer IV/Human Resource Management|Human Resource Management]] does not actualy belong the the [[Wikiversity:School of Library and Information Science|School of Library and Information Science]] at all (you have to click on edit to actually see the problem ;-) ). But it shows clearly that Wikibooks can not live without an enforced naming convention because the change of overlap is just to great. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:54, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

:And something like this doesn't happen in university settings either, where you have a required class for an engineering course on technical writing that is taught by the English department, but only engineering students attend?  I've even seen dual-listed department classes (English/Engineering in something like this), which would be the equivalent of having a link on a page like this that is then redirected to another page.

:This is also yet another reason why Wikiversity needs its own space, to deal with issues like this on their own terms and not have to be forced into conventions required by dealing with textbooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:25, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

====Construction Strength====

;'''A Pilot Study examining the Strength, Compressibility and Serviceability of Rendered Straw Bale Walls for Two Storey Load Bearing Construction.'''
:&quot;A pilot study of a wall constructed from straw bales was carried out. The objective was to examine the suitability of such walls for two-storey residential construction. The emphases were placed on the strength, compressibility and serviceability of the rendered straw bale wall. The full-scale wall was tested to failure in laboratory conditions. The result shows that it is feasible to construct a two-storey wall using such system. The test results were compared with the recommendation provided by some of the codes of practice. It was found that the wall has adequate capacity for a two-storey wall construction. Other issues, such as constructability, detailing, and compressibility were also examined in this paper.&quot; Michael Faine and Dr. John Zhang, University of Western Sydney, Australia, 2000 [http://www.uws.edu.au/download.php?file_id=7549&amp;filename=Straw20conference.pdf&amp;mimetype=application/pdf Rendered Straw Bale Walls for Two Storey Load Bearing Construction (PDF 507Kb)]

;'''Load-bearing straw bale construction'''
:One hundred years of experience with load-bearing plastered straw bale structures, along with a number of laboratory tests worldwide, show these wall systems to be capable of supporting substantial service loads. When properly baled, stacked, and detailed, and plastered both sides with cement, lime, or earthen renders, straw bale walls can support at least residential scale loads, and meet typical building code criteria for strength, serviceability, creep, and durability.

;'''Structural Testing of Plasters for Straw Bale Construction'''
:Over the past hundred years, plastered straw bale construction has shown itself to be strong and durable in both load-bearing and post-and-beam structures. In load-bearing straw bale systems, the relatively strong, stiff plaster plays a significant role as it works together with the ductile straw bale core to function as a stress skin panel, resisting compressive, in-plane and out-ofplane loading.

This document is made available by the Ecological Building Network, for which they request a donation.

;'''Creep in Bale Walls'''
:The tests are aimed at determining the vertical creep or settlement of various bale walls loaded vertically for 12 months. In the base group are two stacks of 6 unplastered rice 3- string bales which are tested with uniform low (100plf) and high (400plf) loads. Dan Smith, USA, 2003.

;'''In-Plane Cyclic Tests of Plastered Straw Bale Wall Assemblies'''
:The construction and testing of six full-scale plastered straw bale wall assemblies is described in this report. The specimens consisted of three cement stucco skinned walls and three earth plaster skinned walls representing varying levels of reinforcement detailing. All walls were tested in-plane under either cyclic or monotonic lateral loadings. Measured behavior is presented in this report, along with recommendations for future work.

;'''Design Approach for Load-Bearing Strawbale Walls'''
:&quot;In addition to presenting background information about loadbearing strawbale wall systems this paper presents the results of a series of tests conducted to gain more insight into the various parameters needed for the design of strawbale structures. These parameters include: dead load behaviour, bale response to over time, shear between straw and stucco, and axial load capacity of the stucco skin. Based on the test results the paper presents a design example for comparison of test values with design values.&quot; Kris J. Dick, M.G. (Ron) Britton.

;'''The Effects of Plastered Skin Confinement on the Performance of Straw Bale Wall Systems'''
:&quot;This project will continue this investigation and will include the results of compressive tests of confined straw bale specimens. It will also include an evaluation of construction details for confining skins, and how further research can clarify which techniques are most beneficial when building straw bale structures.&quot; Adrianne Wheeler, David Riley and Thomas Boothby.

====Moisture====

;'''Straw Bale House Moisture Research'''
:&quot;Researchers and builders do not know how well straw bale walls deal with moisture. What happens if you build with wet straw? Does it dry out over time? Is straw naturally better able to deal with water than building products such as wood? Will house humidity levels affect straw bale walls—especially during long Canadian winters? Would a vapour barrier help? If rain wets the stucco, does the straw underneath get wet? How do you keep the wall dry by a window when there is no drainage plane behind the stucco to carry the water away?&quot; Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

;'''Monitoring the Hygrothermal Performance of Strawbale Walls'''
:&quot;A California winery, interested in quality buildings and sustainable action, commissioned the construction of a large strawbale building to be used as a tasting room, barrel storage room, and tank farm on a site adjoining one of their vineyards. They offered access to this unique building for a comprehensive enclosure wall monitoring program.&quot; John Straube and Chris Schumacher, USA, 2003.

;'''How Straw Decomposes: Implications for Straw Bale Construction'''
:&quot;Straw is a natural fiber that can last many thousands of years under certain conditions. Intact straw has been found in dry Egyptian tombs and buried in layers of frozen glacial ice. However, under typical conditions straw will slowly degrade as do all natural fiber materials like wood, paper, cotton fabric, etc.&quot; Matthew D. Summers, Sherry L. Blunk and Bryan M.

;Mikrobielle Empfindlichkeit von Bau-Strohballen
:&quot;Im Zuge des zunehmenden Umweltbewußtseins der Bevölkerung hat sich auch ein umweltbewußtes Wohnen verbreitet. Viele legen mehr Wert auf ein gesundes Raumklima da sie begreifen, dass sie einen Großteil ihres Leben in ihren Wohnungen zubringen. Zudem hat es in der letzten Zeit eine Reihe von Umweltskandalen gegeben die zu einem Umdenken geführt haben. Die Folge war eine Hinwendung zu Bauprodukten die sowohl gesundheits- als auch umweltschonend sind. Diese Entwicklung wurde und wird auch von der Bundesregierung gefördert (Gütesiegel Natureplus). Zur diesen Produkten gehören vor allem auch Dämmstoffe aus nachwachsenden Rohstoffen. In diesem Bereich wurde in den letzten 10 Jahren viel Forschungsarbeit geleistet u diese Materialien konkurrenzfähig gegenüber konventionellen Dämmstoffen zu machen.&quot; Hansjörg Wieland, 2004

Currently, the m200 series has a pretty good manual on here. If you've got a player from one of the other series, check the m200 series for tips that might work for your player as well. Then come back and write a version of that trick customized for your player!

The SanDisk Sansa m200 series is a series of flash based [[w:MP3 players|MP3 players]], including one with 4GB capacity. It's currently the only MP3 player besides the [[w:IPod nano|IPod nano]] to have 4GB flash capacity. The Sansa e200 series is the first MP3 player line to have a model with 8GB [[w:flash drive|flash drive]], and is a real iPod killer (video capacity, nice design). 

For more info about the SanDisk Sansa series, refer to the [[w:SanDisk Sansa|SanDisk Sansa]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Driver for Linux ==
Most modern distros support this product right out of the box, as a mass storage device (formatted as vfat). If you are going to use the device from both Linux and Windows, be sure to set your player to USB Mass Storage mode (see [[#Changing USB mode|Changing USB mode]] below), or otherwise you may experience that music uploaded from one system will not be accessible from the other.

Music files (mp3 or wav format) may be uploaded to it (in the root folder and in user created folders) and will be found automatically by the player.

It is also possible to upload playlists, as follows:

# Upload the music files which will be referenced by the playlist to the player.  The advice below suggests placing the music in a &quot;Music&quot;folder, but this does not seem to be necessary.
# Create the playlist in your favorite music management program and save is as a M3U file (EXTM3U format).
# Edit the M3U file (it is just a text file) to eliminate paths from filenames.  That is, a line of the form &quot;/path/to/my_file.mp3&quot; should be replaced by just &quot;my_file.mp3&quot;.
# Convert the newline format of the M3U file from Unix-style newlines to DOS-style newlines.  (There are scripts available to do this, such as 'unix2dos'.  Your favorite text-editor may also be able to do this.)
# Upload the M3U file to your player.  (Again location should not matter.)

== Driver for windows 98 and windows ME ==

SanDisk does not support windows 98 for the m200 series of players, so they will not make a driver available. The e100 series driver does not work.

Refer to a [http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=71&amp;threadID=138427&amp;messageID=1556097 discussion on CNET] about the need for a win98 driver, where a working driver can be found. Someone has made a [http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic=43605 generic driver] for USB mass storage device class that works with the m200 series.  Both links lead to the same patch.

If you've got a windows 98 language version other than English, or have Windows ME, you may need to read the whole thread. It should be possible to use the driver, but it requires special care. Some sub versions have been made, so read the whole thread.

== Changing USB mode ==
If you want to set your player to USB Mass Storage mode, try this:&lt;br&gt;
Menu button - Settings - USB - MSC&lt;br&gt;
There might be a difference in firmware versions (Europe and USA have different firmware), so check if yours is the same.

The American version (USA) has a higher volume setting and Fm reception while the E(Europe version) Has no Fm reception and has a volume Cap On It.

== Playlist creation ==

There's a [http://crichton007.blogspot.com/2006/01/sandisk-sansa-m200-series-mp3-player.html post on the Post No Bills] blog with a response from Sandisk about how you can create playlists.

One approach is to put all the MP3 files in one directory (Music), and create playlists that refer to those files.

The problem is that one directory is hard to maintain when you want to find files and delete them.  The m200 firmware is able to read mp3 ID3 tags versions 1 and 2, including the track number field.  For best results, you should use mp3 ID3 tags version 2 and use the track number field, so the original track order is preserved.

===Solution 1===
In the Sansa drive in Windows Explorer select the songs that you want in the playlist. Right click and create playlist. You can do minimal playlist editing through the playlist file properties. Drag files to the references tab to add files.

There is a free playlist creator which creates playlists for each folder on the sansa player with one click. it is written in .NET and does not alter the music files (http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/staff/cp/playlist_creator.zip). 

There is also one written in Python that should work on both linux and Windows (http://people.ifm.liu.se/yohell/make_playlists.py).

===Solution 2===
Try [[Wikipedia:Musicmatch Jukebox|Musicmatch Jukebox]] or [[Wikipedia:MediaMonkey|MediaMonkey]]. Both of those should be able to create a music library using only files from the device. Then sort them by artist and album, and delete them from the library, deleting the files as well. Transfer new files to the device as files (MSC USB mode on the player), not by syncing. You can create a new music library on the fly if you've made extensive changes. It doesn't take much time. Playlists should not contain drive letters or folder names, so edit them in Notepad, unless you have an app that makes them on the fly (suggestions?).

You can keep your main database in MediaMonkey, and open the Sansa device (see the plus and click on it). You'll be able to delete files from there. But if you double click on a song on the Sansa device, the wrong song will play. Dunno why, but that's what happens on my computer. But deleting files works.

===Solution 3===
Rename all your tracks so artist (look for batch renaming feature in your software. Add example of freeware editor?), album and song name is in the file name. That won't be visible in the player, but can aid administration if you use the player in MSC mode.

===Solution 4===
A how-to for using [[Wikipedia:Windows Media Player|Windows Media Player]] and syncing to make playlists can be found [http://reviews.cnet.com/SanDisk_Sansa_m250_2GB/4864-6490_7-31565927.html?ctype=msgid&amp;messageSiteID=7&amp;messageID=1672505&amp;cval=1672505&amp;tag=uolst here].

===Solution 5===
The following solution appears to allow you to create an extended m3u (EXTM3U) playlist file using Windows Media 9 and allows you to keep album directories.  It is unclear what the maximum file and folder count are on this device.

# SanDisk m200 is set to auto-detect USB mode (MTP).  Also tested and verified on m250.
# Create the &quot;MUSIC&quot; directory on the SanDisk m200, if it's not already there.
# Copy all music files and their respective album directories into the &quot;MUSIC&quot; directory of the device.
# Run Windows Media 9.  Click on Media Library on the left navigation.  Click on the album node in the left window pane.  Click on the Add button near the top of the application window and then click &quot;add from directory&quot; from the resulting  menu.  You are going to add albums to your computer's Media Library from your m200.  Do not load files from your computer.  Add each directory you want to the Media Library.  They will appear as albums in the left window pane.  Windows Media 9 will find all the files within that directory.
# Click on the Playlist node in left window pane.  Click the Playlists button near the top of the application window and create a new playlist.
# Now click on the album you want in the left window pane.  You will see the files belonging to that album in the right window pane.  Drag and drop the file from the right window pane over to the playlist.  That will add the file to the playlist.  Keep doing this until you have the files you want. 
# When you are done, click on the playlist to highlight it.  Then, click File menu and click the Save Playlist As option. Save the playlist to the m200 in the &quot;MUSIC&quot; directory as a m3u playlist (you will need to change the filetype dropdown in the Save File Dialog window).  Windows Media Player 9 will save as an EXTM3U file.
# This m3u playlist is a text file that you can view in a text editor if you want to check if the files are listed correctly.
# Disconnect the m200 from the computer.  The m200 will rebuild its internal database.
# Go through the m200 menus and select the Play Music menu.  Then, pick the Playlists option.  You should see your playlist.

You can add more playlists to the m200, and they will show up individually.  This will allow you to make multiple playlists to suit the occasion.

Note: The m200 does not seem to recognize the regular M3U format.  The music library software must be able to save playlists as EXTM3U format.  It may be possible to use another program besides Windows Media Player to create playlists.  One popular program is Winamp, which creates correct playlists based on the saving directory (saving the playlist directly onto the Sansa device will give correct track paths).

===Solution 6===
Use Winamp. Select SanDisk m200 on left pane of Media Library under Portables. Then select the songs in the media library which you want on the playlist. Right click to save the playlist.

# Connect Sansa in mtp mode 
# Copy all the mp3 files in any subfolder of 'music' folder of sansa say 'rock' subfolder created by you.
# After all mp3 files are copied, select all these by pressing shift key and highlighting the icons.
# Once all selected,finally right click- you will get option of create playlist&amp;mdash;that's it! You can create and rename playlist as you like. But you have to have winamp 5.5 installed on your PC.

===Solution 7===
An MSC format playlist editing trick:&lt;br&gt;
The m3u format that works for me is very simple:&lt;br&gt;

: #EXTM3U&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: 1st_song.mp3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: 2nd_song.mp3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: 3rd_song.mp3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

etc.

Note that there must be a blank line after each song.
Note that there must be two blank lines after the EXTM3U line.
Also note that the folder/path names must not be included in the file name. The sansa will automatically search through all the folders and find the file names.

Copy the playlist to the top folder/directory of the player (MSC format)
(or into the album's folder).

A big benefit of playlists for me is that songs will play in the order specified in the playlist (unless shuffle is on)!

Use a standard text editor like Notepad. If you use custom text editors, make sure they save in LF/CR (DOS) format.

Note 1: If the filename has only numbers in it (eg. 40.mp3), the playlist will cut off at that song. Rename the file to begin with a letter (eg. forty.mp3) and update the playlist.

Note 2: If the Sansa has a problem with the playlist, it will stop reading it in, but will remember all the songs right up to where it found a problem (got confused). Use this knowledge to view the playlist on the Sansa and quickly track down the problem song and fix it in the playlist (this is how I discovered Note 1 above).

===Solution 8===
A playlist editor that lets you actually create the list and name it.  Written in Win32 C++.
Only been tested in MSC mode.  NOTE: You need to have the folder 'Playlists' in the same folder as your music folder.[http://upload2.net/page/download/RNkONEgqmOEm1oD/PlayList+Maker.zip.html]

===Solution 9===
This one is the most easy and most reliable.
A Program that creates Playlists from the directory structure of your mp3 player, without fiddling around wit all that stupid media player stuff...

Download it at http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/Staff/cp/playlist_creator.zip
if you want, its free ;-)

===Solution 10===
I wrote a little .net program to make it easy to create playlists for your sansa.  Creates playlists in the same way as playlist_creator above, but allows you to choose what songs go in a playlist, their order, etc.  Currently only works in MSC mode, but I'm working on adding MTP support.  The program is here  http://www.randomphotos.org/SansaPlaylists.zip , and the source is here http://www.randomphotos.org/SansaPlaylists_source.zip.

===Solution 11===
Place the following script into the root directory of the Sansa player, and run it (i.e. double-click it). Bash is included in OS X and nearly every flavor of Linux. For Windows, you'll need bash, find, sort, and a few others. It would be best to install Cygwin or use one of the other methods above (or switch to a Unix-like OS).

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash

# Written by Jason Gyorog
# Place this script on the device, at the root level.
# Any directories with mp3 files will have playlists created.

cd &quot;`dirname &quot;$0&quot;`&quot; # Set working directory to script directory.

find * -type d -depth 0 | while read DIR; do
        find &quot;$DIR&quot; -iname [^.]*.mp3 | sort | while read TRACK; do
                basename &quot;$TRACK&quot;
        done &gt; playlist.temp

        if [ -s playlist.temp ]; then
                echo -e &quot;#EXTM3U\r\n\r&quot; &gt; &quot;$DIR&quot;.m3u
                while read TRACK; do
                        echo -e &quot;\r\n$TRACK\r&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;$DIR&quot;.m3u
                done &lt; playlist.temp
        fi
done

rm playlist.temp
&lt;/pre&gt;


==Alternative to playlists==
Some prefer to use custom genres in the ID3 tag to create mixes for workout, relaxation or other moods. It's more flexible than playlists and easier to add to. This should work with the e100 series as well, but it's reportedly buggy in that respect.

== Playing tracks in order ==

The m200 series rely on ID3 (Version 1) tags for sorting songs. Most people hit Play All when they've chosen an album. If you do that, the songs will play in alphabetical order. But if you want to play the songs in track order, scroll down to the first song and hit play instead. Make sure shuffle is off. The m200 series was previously believed to not be track tag aware. Thanks to Chip_Leader for the solution.

The m240 (latest firmware) is track tag aware and should play album tracks in track order. However it will ignore both v2 and v1 if any of the MP3s in the Album list have invalid characters in the track tag. The tag must be numeric. For example, if you choose the &quot;Track X of X&quot; option when tagging in ID3TagIt, the software will enter &quot;1/12&quot; for the first track of twelve into the MP3 track tag. The Sansa will ignore this tag because of the &quot;/&quot; and will sort by track name instead, even if the v1 ID3 tag has a valid value in it and even if only one MP3 in the list has an invalid character in the track tag.

Alternatively, use a playlist. If shuffle is off, playlists will play in order.

== Audio Books ==
Extra care should be given when using [[Wikipedia:Audio books|Audio Books]], since chapters could easily play out of sequence. Batch rename the ID3 tags for song title to reflect the numbers from the file name, or create playlists. Some use several folders ([[Wikipedia:directories|directories]]) for easier administration of audio books, and batch rename. I'd actually consider using something like [[Wikipedia:Mp3splt|Mp3splt]] to split into smaller files, if you go back and forth between music and audio books. Audio book files are often way too long.

== File limits ==
The FAT files system used has some file limits. [http://reviews.cnet.com/SanDisk_Sansa_m240_1GB_silver/4869-6490_7-31563923.html?messageSiteID=7&amp;messageID=1638616&amp;cval=1638616;1725028&amp;ctype=msgid;cmsgid&amp;commentMessageID=1725028 One report] appears to say that the limit is 130-140 files in the root directory.

== Unknown Album and or Unknown Artist ==
There is a known issue regarding these players’ tendency to display “unknown artist” or “unknown album” even when Windows Explorer, or Media Player clearly reflect the correct artist and or album of a particular song when the unit is connected via the USB port.  This issue appears to occur randomly and even the most recent beta firmware (version 2.2.5) has not resolved it.

See these threads.
[http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7595-0.html?forumID=71&amp;threadID=170092&amp;messageID=1882466 CNET MP3 players Forums]
[http://forum.ecoustics.com/bbs/messages/15118/209222.html Ecoustics.com/bbs/messages]

Workaround in this thread:
http://forum.ecoustics.com/bbs/messages/15118/209222.html

This issue is actually related to the number of files stored on the device. When using MSC mode every 100'th file uploaded to the device will appear as unknown artist. This appears to be some sort of off by one error in either the ID3 parsing routine or the database creation routine. Breaking large groups of files across multiple directories does not appear to solve this problem.

There is also an issue with the order in which WMP11 (and other converters?) stores the tags when converting from MP3. The version one M200 (and maybe others?) can't read the artist or title tags unless they come before all others as they are in a different format from all other tags except the comment tag. See this thread [http://forums.sandisk.com/sansa/board/message?board.id=m200&amp;thread.id=1673 in the SanDisk user forum.]

Comparing carefully files with a tag editor (I use Mp3tag) that came up as &quot;unknown&quot; and ones that came up correctly I found that all the files in the &quot;Unknown&quot; category had data in the &quot;Album Artist&quot; field and the ones that displayed correctly did not. I deleted the data in the &quot;Album Artist&quot; field and reloaded the files onto my player an they all appeared correctly after that.

== Hidden files ==
A directory with the name &quot;radio&quot; seems to have some special significance. Files placed in a directory with such a name are not indexed by (or hidden from) the player.

== Introduction ==

A large number of MATLAB's functions are operations on two types of numbers: ''rational'' numbers and ''boolean'' numbers.

Rational numbers are what we usually think of when we think of what a number is. 1, 3, and -4.5 are all rational numbers. MATLAB stores rational numbers as ''doubles'' by default, which is a measure of the number of decimal places that are stored in each variable and thus of how accurate the values are. Note that MATLAB represents irrational numbers such as pi with rational approximations, except when using the symbolic math toolbox. See that section for details.

Boolean numbers are either &quot;TRUE&quot; or &quot;FALSE&quot;, represented in MATLAB by a 1 and a 0 respectively. Boolean variables in MATLAB are actually interchangable with doubles, in that boolean operators can be performed with arrays of doubles and vice versa. Any non-zero number in this case is considered &quot;TRUE&quot;.

Most of the rational operators also work with complex numbers. Complex numbers, however, cannot be interchanged with boolean values like the real rationals can. See the complex numbers section for details on how to use them.

== Rational Operators on Single Values ==

MATLAB has all the standard rational operators. It is important to note, however, that ''Unless told otherwise, all rational operations are done on entire arrays, and use the matrix definitions.'' Thus, even though for now we're only talking about operations on a single value, when we get into arrays, it will be important to distinguish between matrix and componentwise multiplication, for example.

Add, Subtract, multiply, divide, exponent operators:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 %addition
 a = 1 + 2

 %subtraction
 b = 2 - 1

 %matrix multiplication
 c = a * b

 %matrix division (pseudoinverse)
 d = a / b

 %exponentiation
 e = a ^ b
&lt;/source&gt;
The modulo function returns the remainder when the arguments are divided together, so a modulo b means the remainder when a is divided by b. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 %modulo
 remainder = mod(a,b)
&lt;/source&gt;
All of these functions except for the modulus work for complex numbers as well.

==Relational Operators==
Equality '==' returns the value &quot;TRUE&quot; (1) if both arguments are equal. This must not be confused with the assignment operator '=' which assigns a value to a variable.
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; %relational 
 &gt;&gt;a=5;b=5;
 &gt;&gt;a==b
 ans = 1
 %Assignment
 &gt;&gt;a=5;b=3;
 &gt;&gt;a=b
 a = 3
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that in the first case, a value of 1 (true) is returned, however for the second case a gets assigned the value of b.

Greater than, less than and greater than or equal to, less than or equal to are given by &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= respectively. All of them return a value of true or false.
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;a=3;b=5;
 &gt;&gt;a&lt;=b
 ans = 1
 &gt;&gt;b&lt;a
 ans = 0
&lt;/source&gt;
==Boolean Operators on Single Values==

The boolean operators are  &amp; (boolean AND) | (boolean OR) and ~ (boolean NOT /negation). A value of zero means false, any non-zero value (usually 1) is considered true.

Here's what they do:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;%boolean AND
 &gt;&gt; y = 1 &amp; 0
 y = 0
 &gt;&gt; y = 1 &amp; 1
 y = 1
 &gt;&gt;%boolean OR
 &gt;&gt; y = 1 | 0
 y = 1
 &gt;&gt; y = 1 | 1
 y = 1
&lt;/source&gt;
The negation operation in MATLAB is given by the symbol ~, which turns any FALSE values into TRUE and vice versa:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; c = (a == b)
 c = 1
 &gt;&gt; ~c
 ans = 0
&lt;/source&gt;
This is necessary because conditionals (IF/SWITCH/TRY) and loops (FOR/WHILE) always look for statements that are TRUE, so if you want it to do something only when the statement is FALSE you need to use the negation to change it into a true statement.

The NOT operator has precedence over the AND and OR operators in MATLAB unless the AND or OR statements are in parenthesis:
&lt;source lang=&quot;MatLab&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; y = ~1 &amp; 0
 y = 0
 &gt;&gt; y = ~(1&amp;0)
 y = 1
&lt;/source&gt;

== Terminology ==
MATLAB refers to Booleans as &quot;logicals&quot; and does not use the word &quot;Boolean&quot; in code or documentation.

      <comment>/* The modal theory */ : Edit in the modal density formula (c0^3 instead of c0^2)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Acoustics fundamentals of room acoustics.JPG|center]]

== Introduction ==

Three theories are used to understand room acoustics :

# The modal theory
# The geometric theory
# The theory of Sabine

== The modal theory ==

This theory comes from the homogeneous Helmoltz equation &lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2 \hat \Phi  + k^2 \hat \Phi  = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Considering a simple geometry of a parallelepiped (L1,L2,L3), the solution of this problem is with separated variables :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x,y,z)=X(x)Y(y)Z(z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Hence each function X, Y and Z has this form :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;X(x) = Ae^{ - ikx}  + Be^{ikx}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
With the boundary condition &lt;math&gt;\frac{{\partial P}}
{{\partial x}} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=L1&lt;/math&gt; (idem in the other directions), the expression of pressure is :

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P\left( {x,y,z} \right) = C\cos \left( {\frac{{m\pi x}}
{{L1}}} \right)\cos \left( {\frac{{n\pi y}}
{{L2}}} \right)\cos \left( {\frac{{p\pi z}}
{{L3}}} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;k^2  = \left( {\frac{{m\pi }}{{L1}}} \right)^2  + \left( {\frac{{n\pi }}{{L2}}} \right)^2  + \left( {\frac{{p\pi }}{{L3}}} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; are whole numbers

It is a three-dimensional stationary wave. Acoustic modes appear with their modal frequencies and their modal forms.
With a non-homogeneous problem, a problem with an acoustic source &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt;, the final pressure in &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the contribution of all the modes described above.

The modal density &lt;math&gt;\frac{{dN}}{{df}}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of modal frequencies contained in a range of 1Hz. It depends on the frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the volume of the room &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and the speed of sound &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{{dN}}{{df}} \simeq \frac{{4\pi V}}{{c_0^3 }}f^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The modal density depends on the square frequency, so it increase rapidly with the frequency. At a certain level of frequency, the modes are not distinguished and the modal theory is no longer relevant.

== The geometry theory ==

For rooms of high volume or with a complex geometry, the theory of acoustical geometry is critical and can be applied. The waves are modelised with rays carrying acoustical energy. This energy decrease with the reflection of the rays on the walls of the room. The reason of this phenomenon is the absorption of the walls.

The problem is this theory needs a very high power of calculation and that is why the theory of Sabine is often chosen because it is easier.

== The theory of Sabine ==

=== Description of the theory ===

This theory uses the hypothesis of the diffuse field, the acoustical field is homogeneous and isotropic. In order to obtain this field, the room has to be sufficiently reverberant and the frequencies have to be high enough to avoid the effects of predominating modes.

The variation of the acoustical energy E in the room can be written as :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{{dE}}{{dt}} = W_s  - W_{abs}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;W_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W_{abs}&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the power generated by the acoustical source and the power absorbed by the walls.

The power absorbed is related to the voluminal energy in the room e :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;W_{abs}  = \frac{{ec_0 }}{4}a&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where a is the equivalent absorption area defined by the sum of the product of the absorption coefficient and the area of each material in the room :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;a = \sum\limits_i {\alpha _i S_i }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The final equation is : &lt;math&gt;V\frac{{de}}{{dt}} = W_s  - \frac{{ec_0 }}{4}a&lt;/math&gt;

The level of stationary energy is : &lt;math&gt;e_{sat}  = 4\frac{{W_{abs} }}{{ac_0 }}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reverberation time ===

With this theory described, the reverberation time can be defined. It is the time for the level of energy to decrease of 60 dB. It depends on the volume of the room V and the equivalent absorption area a :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_{60}  = \frac{{0.16V}}{a}
&lt;/math&gt; Sabine formula
&lt;/center&gt;

This reverberation time is the fundamental parameter in room acoustics and depends trough the equivalent absorption area and the absorption coefficients on the frequency.
It is used for several measurement :

* Measurement of an absorption coefficient of a material
* Measurement of the power of a source
* Measurement of the transmission of a wall

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition and Usage==

Random Numbers   →    ”A sequence of integers or group of numbers which show absolutely no relationship to each other anywhere in the sequence. At any point, all integers have an equal chance of occurring, and they occur in an unpredictable fashion”

Many statistical methods rely on random numbers. The use of random numbers, however, has expanded beyond random sampling or random assignment of treatments to experimental units. More common uses now are in simulation studies of physical processes, of analytically intractable mathematical expressions, or of a population resampling from a given sample from that population. These three general areas of application are sometimes called ''simulation'', ''Monte Carlo'', and ''resampling''.

==Uniform Random Number Generation==

Given an infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;R_0, R_1, . . ., R_n,. . .&lt;/math&gt; most people’s notion of random would include that the numbers be uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1). We denote this distribution by U(0, 1). I will present in this paper the two ways of generating Uniform Random Numbers : ''Linear Congruential Generators'' and ''Tausworthe Generators''.

==Linear Congruential Generators==

D. H. Lehmer in 1948 proposed the linear congruential generator as a source of random numbers. In this generator, each single number determines its successor. The form of the generator is
				
                        &lt;math&gt; X_{i+1} &lt;/math&gt; = (a&lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; + c) mod m   , with  0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; ≤ m .

''m'' is called modulus. &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;, ''a'', and ''c'' are known as the seed, multiplier, and the increment respectively.

For example, consider ''m'' = 31, ''a'' = 7, ''c'' = 0 and begin with  &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; = 19. The next integers in the sequence are
			
                       9, 1, 7, 18, 2, 14, 5, 4, 28, 10, 8, 25, 20, 16, 19,

so, of course, at this point the sequence begins to repeat.

If we would have taken ''a'' = 3 instead of ''a'' = 7, we would have got:

      26, 16, 17, 20, 29, 25, 13, 8, 24, 10, 30, 28, 22, 4, 12, 5, 15,
               14, 11, 2, 6, 18, 23, 7, 21, 1, 3, 9, 27, 19

From the simple example above we can guess that ''modulus'', ''multiplier'', and ''increment'' play a role in the period length of the linear congruential generator.

'''''The Period ''''' →  The period is the smallest positive integer λ for which &lt;math&gt;X_{\lambda}=X_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.
The period can be no greater than ''m''. Therefore, ''m'' is chosen to be equal or nearly equal to the largest representable integer in the computer to get a long period.

A full period generator is one in which the period is ''m'', and it is obtained iff:

1. ''c'' is relatively prime to ''m'';
2. (a-1) is a multiple of q, for each prime factor q of ''m'';
3. (a-1) is a multiple of 4, if ''m'' is.

'''''The Increment'''''  →  

If ''c'' &gt; 0 , we can achieve a full period by such :

1- ''m'' = &lt;math&gt;2^b&lt;/math&gt; →  faster computer arithmetic,

2- Set (a-1) as a multiple of 4,

3- c should be odd-valued,

4- Set b as high as possible. For example b=31 in a 32-bit computer.

If ''c'' = 0, a full period is not possible. A maximum number of random variables, then, can be achieved by such :

1-A maximum period generator, with  λ = m − 1, is one in which a is a primitive element modulo ''m'', if ''m'' is prime.
                            i. a mod m 6= 0
                            ii. a(m−1)/q modm 6= 1 , for each prime q of (m-1)

2-Given preceding comments, ''m'' is often set to the largest prime number less than 2b. The most commonly used modulus is the Mersenne prime &lt;math&gt;2^{31}-1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''maximum period''' → ''m'' = prime, a = primitive element modulo m

==Structure in the Generated Numbers==

The idea behind the generated random number is that the numbers should be really random. That means that the numbers should appear to be distributionally independent of each other; that is, the serial correlations should be small. How bad the structure of a sequence is (that is, how much this situation causes the output to appear nonrandom) depends on the structure of the lattice. 

Consider the output of the generator with ''m'' =31 and ''a'' =3 that begins with &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;=19. Plot the successive pairs
				
                                (27, 19), (19, 26), (26, 16)...

&lt;!-- [[File:lattice1.2.jpg|center|thumb|550px|]]  !!Image deleted!! --&gt;

As it can be seen easly from the Figure 1.2, the successive pairs of random numbers lie only
on three lines. The generated numbers does not seem to be random. They rather seem to be correlated. From a visual perspective we can conclude that a generator with small number of lines does not cover the space well and has a bad lattice structure.

MacLaren and Marsaglia (1965) suggest that the output stream of a linear congruential random number generator be shuffled by using another generator to permuate subsequences from the original generator. 

By this way the period can be increased and the shuffling of the output can also break up the bad lattice structure.

==Bays-Durham Shuffling of Uniform Deviates==

Bays and Durham suggest using a single generator to fill a table of length k and then using a single stream to select a number from the table and replenish the table. After initializing a table T to contain &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,...,x_k,&lt;/math&gt; set i = k+1 and generate &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; to use as an index to the table. Then update the table with &lt;math&gt;x_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, with the generator used in Figure 1.3, which yielded the sequence

              27, 19, 26, 16, 17, 20, 29, 25, 13, 8, 24, 10, 30, 28, 22, 4, 12, 5, 15,
                            14, 11, 2, 6, 18, 23, 7, 21, 1, 3, 9,

we select k = 8, and initialize the table as
				  
                                  27, 19, 26, 16, 17, 20, 29, 25.

We then use the next number, 13, as the first value in the output stream, and also to form a random index into the table. If we form the index as 13 mod8 + 1, we get the sixth tabular value, 20, as the second number in the output stream. We generate the next number in the original stream, 8, and put it in the table, so we now have the table
				 
                                  27, 19, 26, 16, 17, 8, 29, 25.

Now we use 20 as the index to the table and get the fifth tabular value, 17, as the third number in the output stream. By continuing in this manner to yield 10,000 deviates, and plotting the successive pairs, we get Figure 1.6. 

&lt;!-- [[File:lattice1.6.jpg|center|thumb|550px|]] !!Image deleted!! --&gt;
                              
==Tausworthe Generators==

Tausworthe (1965) introduced a generator based on a sequence of 0`s and 1`s generated by a recurrence of the form 

&lt;math&gt;b_{i}\equiv (a_{p}b_{i-p}+a_{p-1}b_{i-p+1}+...+a_{1}b_{i-1})\textit{mod}2&lt;/math&gt;
                    

where all variables take on values of either 0 or 1.

For computational efficiency, most of the a`s in the equation set to be zero. The we get,

                                 &lt;math&gt;b_{i}\equiv (b_{i-p}+b_{i-p+q})\textit{mod}2&lt;/math&gt;

After this recurrence has been evaluated a sufficient number of times, say ''l'', the ''l-tuple'' of a`s is interpreted as a number in base 2. This is referred to as an ''l-wise decimation'' of the sequence of a`s.

As an example take a primitive trinomial modulo 2, 

                                          x4 + x + 1,

and begin with the bit sequence
          
                                          1, 0, 1, 0.

For this polynomial, p = 4 and q = 3 in the recurrence. Operating the generator, we obtain

                           1, 1, 0, 0,1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0,

at which point the sequence repeats. A 4-wise decimation yields the numbers

                                         12, 8, 15, 5, … 

As with the linear congruential generators, different values of the c`s and even the starting values of the a`s can yield either good or bad generators.

'''Goodness-of-Fit Tests'''

In this part, I will introduce you the basic Goodness-of-Fit Tests, with which we can evaluate the sequence of random number we created using the above mentioned methods.

==Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit Tests==

             &lt;math&gt;\chi^{2}=\sum^{k}_{i=1}\frac{(o_{i}-e_{i})^{2}}{e_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;

→  The null hypothesis: A random variable has a uniform (0,1) distribution

→  Count the number of observation in each of the ten intervals

                       (0, 0.1], (0.1, 0.2], ..., (0.9, 1.0)

→  Compare those counts with the expected numbers.

→  If the observed numbers are significantly different from the expected numbers, we have reason to reject the null hypothesis.

==The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test==

This test compares the empirical cumulative distribution function (c.d.f) &lt;math&gt;\hat{F}(.)&lt;/math&gt; with a theoretical c.d.f F(.).

→ H0: F(x) = x, 0 _ x &lt; 1

→ Rank the observation so that &lt;math&gt;R^{(1)}\leq R^{(2)} ... \leq R^{n}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\hat{F}(x)=\frac{i}{n}&lt;/math&gt;      ''',and'''           &lt;math&gt;R^{(n+1)}\equiv1&lt;/math&gt;

→ where &lt;math&gt;R^{(0)}\equiv0&lt;/math&gt;      '''and'''            &lt;math&gt;R^{(n+1)}\equiv1&lt;/math&gt;.

→ The test statistic measures the size of the largest difference
between these two:

&lt;math&gt;D_{n}= max_{0\leq x&lt;1}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\left|\hat{F}(x)- F(x)\right|&lt;/math&gt;

==Linear Dependence Test==

→One way to test for dependencies between numbers in a sequence is to restrict such examination to linear dependence between observations which are separated by k numbers.

→ Given a realization of n random numbers &lt;math&gt;R_{0},R_{1},\ldots,R_{n}&lt;/math&gt; the
sample covariance of lag k is

&lt;math&gt;C_{k}=(n-k)^{-1}\sum^{n-k}_{i=1}(R_{i}-\frac{1}{2})(R_{i+k}-\frac{1}{2}).&lt;/math&gt;

→ Under randomness &lt;math&gt;E[C_{k}]=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Drivers, unlike user-mode programs, have a number of different entry points, and each entry point is specifically designed to handle a single type of interface. In this chapter, we will talk about the required interfaces, and we will also talk about adding additional interfaces.

== DRIVER_OBJECT ==

Driver routines all receive a pointer to a DRIVER_OBJECT structure. The driver must fill in the appropriate fields of this structure, so that Windows can learn the whereabouts of the different access routines, and any other information about the driver.

== I/O Request Packets ==

== Device Object Structures ==

=== DeviceExtensions ===

== DriverEntry and DriverUnload ==

== StartIo and AddDevice ==

== Service Routines ==

It should come as no surprise that kernel mode drivers cannot use the same functions as user-mode applications. Device Drivers, for this reason, must rely on the available kernel mode functions. This page will talk about some of the available libraries and functions that can be utilized in a driver. 

== Function Prefixes ==
# include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
# include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
# include &lt;conio.h&gt;

== Native API ==

== String Functions ==

=== Safe String Library ===

=== UNICODE_STRING ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Convention backwards==
In the diagram, the sides are have upercase labels (A, B, C), and the angles have lowercase labels (a, b, c)... whereas the equations seem to use the opposite naming convention. I think it would be easier to change the image rather than the text. Can whoever uploaded the image upload a new one?[[User:132.206.205.83|132.206.205.83]] 20:40, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

== naming convention ==

that is absolutely right. The convention I've seen in my experience in trigonometry is capital letters for angles and lowercase for (opposite) sides. I think this convention is used throughout other pages of wikipedia too, soo the picture should change :)

== Is there  a need to specify the proofs of sine and cosine? ==

I am studying math on an ordinary level, and I'm revising trigonometry atm. I found these proofs very helpful, even though I used some time to figure out what was exactly happening between the equations. Therefore I think it would be very helpful for me and others to have some text leading the reader on and telling which rules are used, for instance not just &quot;using the triangle&quot;, but &quot;using sine in a right-angled triangle&quot; and so on.
Hope someone will make these changes, as I dont feel qualified enough.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Acoustics how an acoustic guitar works.JPG|center]]

What are sound vibrations that contribute to sound production? First of all, there are the strings.  Any string that is under tension will vibrate at a certain frequency.  The weight and length of the string, the tension in the string, and the compliance of the string determine the frequency at which it vibrates.  The guitar controls the length and tension of six differently weighted strings to cover a very wide range of frequencies.  Second, there is the body of the guitar.  The guitar body is connected is very important for the lower frequencies of the guitar.  The air mass just inside the sound hole oscillates, compressing and decompressing the compliant air inside the body.  In practice this concept is called a Helmholtz resonator.  Without this, it would difficult to produce the wonderful timbre of the guitar.

[[Image:zehme_guitar.jpg]]

== The strings ==

The strings of the guitar vary in linear density, length, and tension.  This gives the guitar a wide range of attainable frequencies.  The larger the linear density is, the slower the string vibrates.  The same goes for the length; the longer the string is the slower it vibrates.  This causes a low frequency.  Inversely, if the strings are less dense and/or shorter they create a higher frequency.  The resonance frequencies of the strings can be calculated by

:&lt;math&gt;f_1 = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{T}{\rho_l}}}{2 L}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = string tension, &lt;math&gt;\rho_l&lt;/math&gt; = linear density, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = string length

The string length, L, in the equation is what changes when a player presses on a string at a certain fret.  This will shorten the string which in turn increases the frequency it produces when plucked.  The spacing of these frets is important.  The length from the nut to bridge determines how much space goes between each fret.  If the length is 25 inches, then the position of the first fret should be located (25/17.817) inches from the nut.  Then the second fret should be located (25-(25/17.817))/17.817 inches from the first fret.  This results in the equation

:&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{L}{17.817}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; = spacing between frets, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = length from previous fret to bridge

When a string is plucked, a disturbance is formed and travels in both directions away from point where the string was plucked.  These &quot;waves&quot; travel at a speed that is related to the tension and linear density and can be calculated by

:&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\rho_l}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = wave speed, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = string tension, &lt;math&gt;\rho_l&lt;/math&gt; = linear density

The waves travel until they reach the boundaries on each end where they are reflected back.  The link below displays how the waves propagate in a string.

[http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/objects/waves&amp;amp;strings2.swf Plucked String @ www.phys.unsw.edu]
  
The strings themselves do not produce very much sound because they are so thin.  They can't &quot;push&quot; the air that surrounds them very effectively.  This is why they are connected to the top plate of the guitar body.  They need to transfer the frequencies they are producing to a large surface area which can create more intense pressure disturbances.

== The body ==

The body of the guitar transfers the vibrations of the bridge to the air that surrounds it.  The top plate contributes to most of the pressure disturbances, because the player dampens the back plate and the sides are relatively stiff.  This is why it is important to make the top plate out of a light springy wood, like spruce.  The more the top plate can vibrate, the louder the sound it produces will be.  It is also important to keep the top plate flat, so a series of braces are located on the inside to strengthen it.  Without these braces the top plate would bend and crack under the large stress created by the tension in the strings.  This would also affect the magnitude of the sound being transmitted.  The warped plate would not be able to &quot;push&quot; air very efficiently.  A good experiment to try, in order to see how important this part of the guitar is in the amplification process, is as follows:

# Start with an ordinary rubber band, a large bowl, adhesive tape, and plastic wrap.
# Stretch the rubber band and pluck it a few times to get a good sense for how loud it is.
# Stretch the plastic wrap over the bowl to form a sort of drum.
# Tape down one end of the rubber band to the plastic wrap.
# Stretch the rubber band and pluck it a few times.
# The sound should be much louder than before.

== The air ==

The final part of the guitar is the air inside the body.  This is very important for the lower range of the instrument.  The air just inside the soundhole oscillates compressing and expanding the air inside the body.  This is just like blowing across the top of a bottle and listening to the tone it produces.  This forms what is called a Helmholtz resonator.  For more information on Helmholtz resonators go to [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/Helmholtz.html Helmholtz Resonance].  This link also shows the correlation to acoustic guitars in great detail.  The acoustic guitar makers often tune these resonators to have a resonance frequency between F#2 and A2 (92.5 to 110.0 Hz).  Having such a low resonance frequency is what aids the amplification of the lower frequency strings.  To demonstrate the importance of the air in the cavity, simply play an open A on the guitar (the fifth string - second lowest note).  Now, as the string is vibrating, place a piece of cardboard over the soundhole.  The sound level is reduced dramatically.  This is because you've stopped the vibration of the air mass just inside the soundhole, causing only the top plate to vibrate.  Although the top plate still vibrates a transmits sound, it isn't as effective at transmitting lower frequency waves, thus the need for the Helmholtz resonator.

Bass-reflex enclosures improve the low-frequency response of loudspeaker systems.  Bass-reflex enclosures are also called &quot;vented-box design&quot; or &quot;ported-cabinet design&quot;.  A bass-reflex enclosure includes a vent or port between the cabinet and the ambient environment.  This type of design, as one may observe by looking at contemporary loudspeaker products, is still widely used today.  Although the construction of bass-reflex enclosures is fairly simple, their design is not simple, and requires proper tuning.  This reference focuses on the technical details of bass-reflex design.  General loudspeaker information can be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker here].

==Effects of the Port on the Enclosure Response==

Before discussing the bass-reflex enclosure, it is important to be familiar with the simpler sealed enclosure system performance.  As the name suggests, the sealed enclosure system attaches the loudspeaker to a sealed enclosure (except for a small air leak included to equalize the ambient pressure inside).  Ideally, the enclosure would act as an acoustical compliance element, as the air inside the enclosure is compressed and rarified.  Often, however, an acoustic material is added inside the box to reduce standing waves, dissipate heat, and other reasons. This adds a resistive element to the acoustical lumped-element model.  A non-ideal model of the effect of the enclosure actually adds an acoustical mass element to complete a series lumped-element circuit given in Figure 1.  For more on sealed enclosure design, see the [[Engineering Acoustics/Sealed Box Subwoofer Design|Sealed Box Subwoofer Design]] page.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 1. Sealed enclosure acoustic circuit.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In the case of a bass-reflex enclosure, a port is added to the construction.  Typically, the port is cylindrical and is flanged on the end pointing outside the enclosure.  In a bass-reflex enclosure, the amount of acoustic material used is usually much less than in the sealed enclosure case, often none at all.  This allows air to flow freely through the port.  Instead, the larger losses come from the air leakage in the enclosure.  With this setup, a lumped-element acoustical circuit has the form shown in the diagram below.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Vented_box_ckt.gif]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 2. Bass-reflex enclosure acoustic circuit.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In this figure, &lt;math&gt;Z_{RAD}&lt;/math&gt; represents the radiation impedance of the outside environment on the loudspeaker diaphragm.  The loading on the rear of the diaphragm has changed when compared to the sealed enclosure case.  If one visualizes the movement of air within the enclosure, some of the air is compressed and rarified by the compliance of the enclosure, some leaks out of the enclosure, and some flows out of the port.  This explains the parallel combination of &lt;math&gt;M_{AP}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_{AL}&lt;/math&gt;.  A truly realistic model would incorporate a radiation impedance of the port in series with &lt;math&gt;M_{AP}&lt;/math&gt;, but for now it is ignored.  Finally, &lt;math&gt;M_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, the acoustical mass of the enclosure, is included as discussed in the sealed enclosure case.  The formulas which calculate the enclosure parameters are listed in [[Engineering Acoustics/Bass_Reflex_Enclosure_Design#Appendix_B:_Enclosure_Parameter_Formulas | Appendix B]].  

It is important to note the parallel combination of &lt;math&gt;M_{AP}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.  This forms a Helmholtz resonator ([[Engineering Acoustics/Acoustics of pipes, enclosures, and cavities at low frequency#Examples of Electro-Acoustical Analogies|click here for more information]]).  Physically, the port functions as the “neck” of the resonator and the enclosure functions as the “cavity.”  In this case, the resonator is driven from the piston directly on the cavity instead of the typical Helmholtz case where it is driven at the “neck.”  However, the same resonant behavior still occurs at the enclosure resonance frequency, &lt;math&gt;f_{B}&lt;/math&gt;.  At this frequency, the impedance seen by the loudspeaker diaphragm is large (see Figure 3 below).  Thus, the load on the loudspeaker reduces the velocity flowing through its mechanical parameters, causing an anti-resonance condition where the displacement of the diaphragm is a minimum.  Instead, the majority of the volume velocity is actually emitted by the port itself instead of the loudspeaker.  When this impedance is reflected to the electrical circuit, it is proportional to &lt;math&gt;1/Z&lt;/math&gt;, thus a minimum in the impedance seen by the voice coil is small.  Figure 3 shows a plot of the impedance seen at the terminals of the loudspeaker.  In this example, &lt;math&gt;f_B&lt;/math&gt; was found to be about 40 Hz, which corresponds to the null in the voice-coil impedance.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Figure 3. Impedances seen by the loudspeaker diaphragm and voice coil.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Quantitative Analysis of Port on Enclosure==

The performance of the loudspeaker is first measured by its velocity response, which can be found directly from the equivalent circuit of the system.  As the goal of most loudspeaker designs is to improve the bass response (leaving high-frequency production to a tweeter), low frequency approximations will be made as much as possible to simplify the analysis.  First, the inductance of the voice coil, &lt;math&gt;\it{L_E}&lt;/math&gt;, can be ignored as long as &lt;math&gt;\omega \ll R_E/L_E&lt;/math&gt;.  In a typical loudspeaker, &lt;math&gt;\it{L_E}&lt;/math&gt; is of the order of 1 mH, while &lt;math&gt;\it{R_E}&lt;/math&gt; is typically 8&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, thus an upper frequency limit is approximately 1 kHz for this approximation, which is certainly high enough for the frequency range of interest.  

Another approximation involves the radiation impedance, &lt;math&gt;\it{Z_{RAD}}&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be shown [1] that this value is given by the following equation (in acoustical ohms):

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Z_{RAD} = \frac{\rho_0c}{\pi a^2}\left[\left(1 - \frac{J_1(2ka)}{ka}\right) + j\frac{H_1(2ka)}{ka}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;J_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; are types of Bessel functions.  For small values of &lt;i&gt;ka&lt;/i&gt;,

&lt;table align=center width=50% cellpadding=10&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;J_1(2ka) \approx ka&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;and&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;H_1(2ka) \approx \frac{8(ka)^2}{3\pi}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow Z_{RAD} \approx j\frac{8\rho_0\omega}{3\pi^2a} = jM_{A1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Hence, the low-frequency impedance on the loudspeaker is represented with an acoustic mass &lt;math&gt;M_{A1}&lt;/math&gt; [1].  For a simple analysis, &lt;math&gt;R_E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_{MD}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_{MS}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_{MS}&lt;/math&gt; (the transducer parameters, or &lt;i&gt;Thiele-Small&lt;/i&gt; parameters) are converted to their acoustical equivalents.  All conversions for all parameters are given in [[Engineering Acoustics/Bass_Reflex_Enclosure_Design#Appendix_A:_Equivalent_Circuit_Parameters | Appendix A]].  Then, the series masses, &lt;math&gt;M_{AD}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_{A1}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, are lumped together to create &lt;math&gt;M_{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.  This new circuit is shown below.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:VB_LF_ckt.gif]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 4.  Low-Frequency Equivalent Acoustic Circuit&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Unlike sealed enclosure analysis, there are multiple sources of volume velocity that radiate to the outside environment.  Hence, the diaphragm volume velocity, &lt;math&gt;U_D&lt;/math&gt;, is not analyzed but rather &lt;math&gt;U_0 = U_D + U_P + U_L&lt;/math&gt;.  This essentially draws a “bubble” around the enclosure and treats the system as a source with volume velocity &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;.  This “lumped” approach will only be valid for low frequencies, but previous approximations have already limited the analysis to such frequencies anyway.  It can be seen from the circuit that the volume velocity flowing &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; the enclosure, &lt;math&gt;U_B = -U_0&lt;/math&gt;, compresses the air inside the enclosure.  Thus, the circuit model of Figure 3 is valid and the relationship relating input voltage, &lt;math&gt;V_{IN}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; may be computed.

In order to make the equations easier to understand, several parameters are combined to form other parameter names.  First, &lt;math&gt;\omega_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_S&lt;/math&gt;, the enclosure and loudspeaker resonance frequencies, respectively, are:

&lt;table align=center width=40%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_{AP}C_{AB}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_{AC}C_{AS}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Based on the nature of the derivation, it is convenient to define the parameters &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;, the Helmholtz tuning ratio:

&lt;table align=center width=25%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \sqrt{\omega_B\omega_S}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{\omega_B}{\omega_S}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

A parameter known as the &lt;i&gt;compliance ratio&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;volume ratio&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{C_{AS}}{C_{AB}} = \frac{V_{AS}}{V_{AB}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Other parameters are combined to form what are known as &lt;i&gt;quality factors&lt;/i&gt;:

&lt;table align=center width=45%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q_L = R_{AL}\sqrt{\frac{C_{AB}}{M_{AP}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q_{TS} = \frac{1}{R_{AE}+R_{AS}}\sqrt{\frac{M_{AC}}{C_{AS}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This notation allows for a simpler expression for the resulting transfer function [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{U_0}{V_{IN}} = G(s) = \frac{(s^3/\omega_0^4)}{(s/\omega_0)^4+a_3(s/\omega_0)^3+a_2(s/\omega_0)^2+a_1(s/\omega_0)+1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where

&lt;table align=center width=70%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{1}{Q_L\sqrt{h}}+\frac{\sqrt{h}}{Q_{TS}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 = \frac{\alpha+1}{h}+h+\frac{1}{Q_L Q_{TS}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_3 = \frac{1}{Q_{TS}\sqrt{h}}+\frac{\sqrt{h}}{Q_L}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Development of Low-Frequency Pressure Response==

It can be shown [2] that for &lt;math&gt;ka &lt; 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, a loudspeaker behaves as a spherical source.  Here, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; represents the radius of the loudspeaker.  For a 15” diameter loudspeaker in air, this low frequency limit is about 150 Hz.  For smaller loudspeakers, this limit increases.  This limit dominates the limit which ignores &lt;math&gt;L_E&lt;/math&gt;, and is consistent with the limit that models &lt;math&gt;Z_{RAD}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;M_{A1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Within this limit, the loudspeaker emits a volume velocity &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;, as determined in the previous section.  For a simple spherical source with volume velocity &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;, the far-field pressure is given by [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p(r) \simeq j\omega\rho_0 U_0 \frac{e^{-jkr}}{4\pi r}&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;/center&gt;

It is possible to simply let &lt;math&gt;r = 1&lt;/math&gt; for this analysis without loss of generality because distance is only a function of the surroundings, not the loudspeaker.  Also, because the transfer function magnitude is of primary interest, the exponential term, which has a unity magnitude, is omitted.  Hence, the pressure response of the system is given by [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{V_{IN}} = \frac{\rho_0s}{4\pi}\frac{U_0}{V_{IN}} = \frac{\rho_0Bl}{4\pi S_DR_EM_AS}H(s)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;H(s) = sG(s)&lt;/math&gt;.  In the following sections, design methods will focus on &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, which is given by:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2 = \frac{\Omega^8}{\Omega^8 + \left(a^2_3 - 2a_2\right)\Omega^6 + \left(a^2_2 + 2 - 2a_1a_3\right)\Omega^4 + \left(a^2_1 - 2a_2\right)\Omega^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{\omega}{\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This also implicitly ignores the constants in front of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|&lt;/math&gt; since they simply scale the response and do not affect the shape of the frequency response curve.

==Alignments==

A popular way to determine the ideal parameters has been through the use of alignments.  The concept of alignments is based upon filter theory.  Filter development is a method of selecting the poles (and possibly zeros) of a transfer function to meet a particular design criterion.  The criteria are the desired properties of a magnitude-squared transfer function, which in this case is &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt;.  From any of the design criteria, the poles (and possibly zeros) of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; are found, which can then be used to calculate the numerator and denominator.  This is the “optimal” transfer function, which has coefficients that are matched to the parameters of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; to compute the appropriate values that will yield a design that meets the criteria.

There are many different types of filter designs, each which have trade-offs associated with them.  However, this design is limited because of the structure of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, it has the structure of a fourth-order high-pass filter with all zeros at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 0.  Therefore, only those filter design methods which produce a low-pass filter with only poles will be acceptable methods to use.  From the traditional set of algorithms, only Butterworth and Chebyshev low-pass filters have only poles.  In addition, another type of filter called a quasi-Butterworth filter can also be used, which has similar properties to a Butterworth filter.  These three algorithms are fairly simple, thus they are the most popular.  When these low-pass filters are converted to high-pass filters, the &lt;math&gt;s \rightarrow 1/s&lt;/math&gt; transformation produces &lt;math&gt;s^8&lt;/math&gt; in the numerator.

More details regarding filter theory and these relationships can be found in numerous resources, including [5].

==Butterworth Alignment==

The Butterworth algorithm is designed to have a &lt;i&gt;maximally flat&lt;/i&gt; pass band.  Since the slope of a function corresponds to its derivatives, a flat function will have derivatives equal to zero.  Since as flat of a pass band as possible is optimal, the ideal function will have as many derivatives equal to zero as possible at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 0.  Of course, if all derivatives were equal to zero, then the function would be a constant, which performs no filtering.  

Often, it is better to examine what is called the &lt;i&gt;loss function&lt;/i&gt;.  Loss is the reciprocal of gain, thus 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(s)|^2 = \frac{1}{|H(s)|^2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The loss function can be used to achieve the desired properties, then the desired gain function is recovered from the loss function.

Now, applying the desired Butterworth property of maximal pass-band flatness, the loss function is simply a polynomial with derivatives equal to zero at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 0.  At the same time, the original polynomial must be of degree eight (yielding a fourth-order function).  However, derivatives one through seven can be equal to zero if [3]

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(\Omega)|^2 = 1 + \Omega^8 \Rightarrow |H(\Omega)|^2 = \frac{1}{1 + \Omega^8}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

With the high-pass transformation &lt;math&gt;\Omega \rightarrow 1/\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|H(\Omega)|^2 = \frac{\Omega^8}{\Omega^8 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

It is convenient to define &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \omega/\omega_{3dB}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\Omega = 1 \Rightarrow |H(s)|^2 = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; or -3 dB.  This definition allows the matching of coefficients for the &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; describing the loudspeaker response when &lt;math&gt;\omega_{3dB} = \omega_0&lt;/math&gt;.  From this matching, the following design equations are obtained [1]:

&lt;table align=center cellspacing=20&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_1 = a_3 = \sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 = 2+\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Quasi-Butterworth Alignment==

The quasi-Butterworth alignments do not have as well-defined of an algorithm when compared to the Butterworth alignment.  The name “quasi-Butterworth” comes from the fact that the transfer functions for these responses appear similar to the Butterworth ones, with (in general) the addition of terms in the denominator.  This will be illustrated below.  While there are many types of quasi-Butterworth alignments, the simplest and most popular is the 3rd order alignment (QB3).  The comparison of the QB3 magnitude-squared response against the 4th order Butterworth is shown below.   

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left|H_{QB3}(\omega)\right|^2 = \frac{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8}{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8 + B^2(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left|H_{B4}(\omega)\right|^2 = \frac{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8}{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Notice that the case &lt;math&gt;B = 0&lt;/math&gt; is the Butterworth alignment.  The reason that this QB alignment is called 3rd order is due to the fact that as &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; increases, the slope approaches 3 dec/dec instead of 4 dec/dec, as in 4th order Butterworth.  This phenomenon can be seen in Figure 5.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:QB3_gradient.GIF]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 5: 3rd-Order Quasi-Butterworth Response for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;math&gt;0.1 \leq B \leq 3&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Equating the system response &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|H_{QB3}(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt;, the equations guiding the design can be found [1]:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;B^2 = a^2_1 - 2a_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2^2 + 2 = 2a_1a_3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_3 = \sqrt{2a_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 &gt; 2 + \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Chebyshev Alignment==

The Chebyshev algorithm is an alternative to the Butterworth algorithm.  For the Chebyshev response, the maximally-flat passband restriction is abandoned.  Now, a &lt;i&gt;ripple&lt;/i&gt;, or fluctuation is allowed in the pass band.  This allows a steeper transition or roll-off to occur.  In this type of application, the low-frequency response of the loudspeaker can be extended beyond what can be achieved by Butterworth-type filters.  An example plot of a Chebyshev high-pass response with 0.5 dB of ripple against a Butterworth high-pass response for the same &lt;math&gt;\omega_{3dB}&lt;/math&gt; is shown below.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Butt_vs_Cheb_HP.gif]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 6: Chebyshev vs. Butterworth High-Pass Response.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The Chebyshev response is defined by [4]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(j\Omega)|^2 = 1 + \epsilon^2C^2_n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C_n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;i&gt;Chebyshev polynomial&lt;/i&gt; and is defined by [4]:

&lt;table align=center&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td valign=center rowspan=2&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_n(\Omega) = \big\lbrace&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rm{cos}[\it{n}\rm{cos}^{-1}(\Omega)]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;|\Omega| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rm{cosh}[\it{n}\rm{cosh}^{-1}(\Omega)]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;|\Omega| &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Fortunately, Chebyshev polynomials satisfy a simple recursion formula [4]:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_0(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_1(x) = x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_n(x) = 2xC_{n-1} - C_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

For more information on Chebyshev polynomials, see the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChebyshevPolynomialoftheFirstKind.html Wolfram Mathworld: Chebyshev Polynomials] page.

When applying the high-pass transformation to the 4th order form of &lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(j\Omega)|^2&lt;/math&gt;, the desired response has the form [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|H(j\Omega)|^2 = \frac{1+\epsilon^2}{1+\epsilon^2C^2_4(1/\Omega)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The parameter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; determines the ripple.  In particular, the magnitude of the ripple is &lt;math&gt;10\rm{log}[1+\epsilon^2]&lt;/math&gt; dB and can be chosen by the designer, similar to &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; in the quasi-Butterworth case.  Using the recursion formula for &lt;math&gt;C_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C_4\left(\frac{1}{\Omega}\right) = 8\left(\frac{1}{\Omega}\right)^4 - 8\left(\frac{1}{\Omega}\right)^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Applying this equation to &lt;math&gt;|H(j\Omega)|^2&lt;/math&gt; [1],

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td colspan=2&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow |H(\Omega)|^2 = \frac{\frac{1 + \epsilon^2}{64\epsilon^2}\Omega^8}{\frac{1 + \epsilon^2}{64\epsilon^2}\Omega^8 + \frac{1}{4}\Omega^6 + \frac{5}{4}\Omega^4 - 2\Omega^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{\omega}{\omega_n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_n = \frac{\omega_{3dB}}{2}\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + 2\sqrt{2+\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Thus, the design equations become [1]:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \omega_n\sqrt[8]{\frac{64\epsilon^2}{1+\epsilon^2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;k = \rm{tanh}\left[\frac{1}{4}\rm{sinh}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{k^4 + 6k^2 + 1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{k\sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt[4]{D}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 = \frac{1 + k^2(1+\sqrt{2})}{\sqrt{D}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_3 = \frac{a_1}{\sqrt{D}}\left[1 - \frac{1 - k^2}{2\sqrt{2}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Choosing the Correct Alignment ==

With all the equations that have already been presented, the question naturally arises, “Which one should I choose?”  Notice that the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt; are not simply related to the parameters of the system response.  Certain combinations of parameters may indeed invalidate one or more of the alignments because they cannot realize the necessary coefficients.  With this in mind, general guidelines have been developed to guide the selection of the appropriate alignment.  This is very useful if one is designing an enclosure to suit a particular transducer that cannot be changed.  

The general guideline for the Butterworth alignment focuses on &lt;math&gt;Q_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the three coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt; are a function of &lt;math&gt;Q_L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, fixing one of these parameters yields three equations that uniquely determine the other three.  In the case where a particular transducer is already given, &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt; is essentially fixed.  If the desired parameters of the enclosure are already known, then &lt;math&gt;Q_L&lt;/math&gt; is a better starting point.  

In the case that the rigid requirements of the Butterworth alignment cannot be satisfied, the quasi-Butterworth alignment is often applied when &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt; is not large enough..  The addition of another parameter, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, allows more flexibility in the design.

For &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt; values that are too large for the Butterworth alignment, the Chebyshev alignment is typically chosen.  However, the steep transition of the Chebyshev alignment may also be utilized to attempt to extend the bass response of the loudspeaker in the case where the transducer properties can be changed.

In addition to these three popular alignments, research continues in the area of developing new algorithms that can manipulate the low-frequency response of the bass-reflex enclosure.  For example, a 5th order quasi-Butterworth alignment has been developed [6].  Another example [7] applies root-locus techniques to achieve results.  In the modern age of high-powered computing, other researchers have focused their efforts in creating computerized optimization algorithms that can be modified to achieve a flatter response with sharp roll-off or introduce quasi-ripples which provide a boost in sub-bass frequencies [8].

==Introduction==

Acoustic filters are used in many devices such as mufflers, noise control materials (absorptive and reactive), and loudspeaker systems to name a few.  Although the waves in simple (single-medium) acoustic filters usually travel in gases such as air and carbon-monoxide (in the case of automobile mufflers) or in materials such as fiberglass, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film, or polyethylene (Saran Wrap), there are also filters that couple two or three distinct media together to achieve a desired acoustic response. General information about basic acoustic filter design can be perused at the following wikibook page [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic_Filter_Design_%26_Implementation  Acoustic Filter Design &amp; Implementation]].  The focus of this article will be on acoustic filters that use multilayer air/polymer film-coupled media as its acoustic medium for sound waves to propagate through; concluding with an example of how these filters can be used to detect and extrapolate audio frequency information in high-frequency &quot;carrier&quot; waves that carry an audio signal.  However, before getting into these specific type of acoustic filters, we need to briefly discuss how sound waves interact with the medium(media) in which it travels and how these factors can play a role when designing acoustic filters.

==Changes in Media Properties Due to Sound Wave Characteristics ==

As with any system being designed, the filter response characteristics of an acoustic filter are tailored based on the frequency spectrum of the input signal and the desired output.  The input signal may be infrasonic (frequencies below human hearing), sonic (frequencies within human hearing range), or ultrasonic (frequencies above human hearing range). In addition to the frequency content of the input signal, the density, and, thus, the characteristic impedance of the medium (media) being used in the acoustic filter must also be taken into account.  In general, the characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt; Z_0 \,&lt;/math&gt; for a particular medium is expressed as...&lt;center&gt; 
      &lt;math&gt; Z_0 = \pm \rho_0 c  \,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt; (Pa \cdot s/m) &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;/center&gt; 

where &lt;center&gt; 
      &lt;math&gt; \pm \rho_0  \,&lt;/math&gt; = (equilibrium) density of medium  &lt;math&gt;(kg/m^3)\,&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; c \,&lt;/math&gt; = speed of sound in medium  &lt;math&gt; (m/s) \,&lt;/math&gt;  
      &lt;/center&gt;

The characteristic impedance is important because this value simultaneously gives an idea of how fast or slow particles will travel as well as how much mass is &quot;weighting down&quot; the particles in the medium (per unit area or volume) when they are excited by a sound source.  The speed in which sound travels in the medium needs to be taken into consideration because this factor can ultimately affect the time response of the filter (i.e. the output of the filter may not radiate or attenuate sound fast or slow enough if not designed properly).  The intensity &lt;math&gt; I_A \,&lt;/math&gt; of a sound wave is expressed as... &lt;center&gt; 

     &lt;math&gt; I_A = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T} pu\quad dt = \pm \frac{P^2}{2\rho_0c}  \,&lt;/math&gt;    &lt;math&gt;(W/m^2) \,&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt; I_A  \,&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as the (time-averaged) rate of energy transmission of a sound wave through a unit area normal to the direction of propagation, and this parameter is also an important factor in acoustic filter design because the characteristic properties of the given medium can change relative to intensity of the sound wave traveling through it.  In other words, the reaction of the particles (atoms or molecules) that make up the medium will respond differently when the intensity of the sound wave is very high or very small relative to the size of the control area (i.e. dimensions of the filter, in this case).   Other properties such as the elasticity and mean propagation velocity (of a sound wave) can change in the acoustic medium as well, but focusing on frequency, impedance, and/or intensity in the design process usually takes care of these other parameters because most of them will inevitably be dependent on the aforementioned properties of the medium.

==Why Coupled Acoustic Media in Acoustic Filters?==

In acoustic transducers, media coupling is employed in acoustic transducers to either increase or decrease the impedance of the transducer, and, thus, control the intensity and speed of the signal acting on the transducer while converting the incident wave, or initial excitation sound wave, from one form of energy to another (e.g. converting acoustic energy to electrical energy).  Specifically, the impedance of the transducer is augmented by inserting a solid structure (not necessarily rigid) between the transducer and the initial propagation medium (e.g. air).   The reflective properties of the inserted medium is exploited to either increase or decrease the intensity and propagation speed of the incident sound wave.  It is the ability to alter, and to some extent, control, the impedance of a propagation medium by (periodically) inserting (a) solid structure(s) such as thin, flexible films in the original medium (air) and its ability to concomitantly alter the frequency response of the original medium that makes use of multilayer media in acoustic filters attractive.  The reflection factor and transmission factor &lt;math&gt; \hat{R} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \hat{T} \, &lt;/math&gt;, respectively, between two media, expressed as...




&lt;center&gt; 

&lt;math&gt; \hat{R} = \frac{\text{pressure of reflected portion of incident wave}}{\text{pressure of incident wave}} = \frac{\rho c - Z_\mathrm{in}}{\rho c + Z_\mathrm{in}}&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;/center&gt; and &lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; \hat{T} = \frac{\text{pressure of transmitted portion of incident wave}}{\text{pressure of incident wave}} = 1 + \hat{R}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/center&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt; 


are the tangible values that tell how much of the incident wave is being reflected from and transmitted through the junction where the media meet.   Note that &lt;math&gt; Z_{in} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the (total) input impedance seen by the incident sound wave upon just entering an air-solid acoustic media layer.  In the case of multiple air-columns as shown in Fig. 2, &lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm{in} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the aggregate impedance of each air-column layer seen by the incident wave at the input.  Below in Fig. 1, a simple illustration explains what happens when an incident sound wave propagating in medium (1) and comes in contact with medium (2) at the junction of the both media (x=0), where the sound waves are represented by vectors.  

As mentioned above, an example of three such successive air-solid acoustic media layers is shown in Fig. 2 and the electroacoustic equivalent circuit for Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. 3 
where &lt;math&gt; L = \rho_s h_s \,&lt;/math&gt; = (density of solid material)(thickness of solid material) = unit-area (or volume) mass, &lt;math&gt; Z = \rho c = \,&lt;/math&gt; characteristic acoustic impedance of medium, and &lt;math&gt; \beta = k = \omega/c = \,&lt;/math&gt; wavenumber.    Note that in the case of a multilayer, coupled acoustic medium in an acoustic filter, the impedance of each air-solid section is calculated by using the following general purpose impedance ratio equation (also referred to as transfer matrices)...


&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; \frac{Z_a}{Z_0} = \frac{\left( \frac{Z_b}{Z_0} \right) + j\ \tan(kd)}{1 + j\ \left( \frac{Z_b}{Z_0} \right) \tan(kd)} \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;  

where &lt;math&gt; Z_b \,&lt;/math&gt; is the (known) impedance at the edge of the solid of an air-solid layer (on the right) and &lt;math&gt; Z_a \,&lt;/math&gt; is the (unknown) impedance at the edge of the air column of an air-solid layer.  



&lt;center&gt;

==Effects of High-Intensity, Ultrasonic Waves in Acoustic Media in Audio Frequency Spectrum==


When an ultrasonic wave is used as a carrier to transmit audio frequencies, three audio effects are associated with extrapolating the audio frequency information from the carrier wave: (a) beating effects, (b) parametric array effects, and (c) radiation pressure.   


Beating occurs when two ultrasonic waves with distinct frequencies  &lt;math&gt; f_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; f_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; propagate in the same direction, resulting in amplitude variations which consequently make the audio signal information go in and out of phase, or “beat”, at a frequency of  &lt;math&gt; f_1 - f_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;.   


Parametric array [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_array]] effects occur when the intensity of an ultrasonic wave is so high in a particular medium that the high displacements of particles (atoms) per wave cycle changes properties of that medium so that it influences parameters like elasticity, density, propagation velocity, etc. in a non-linear fashion.  The results of parametric array effects on modulated, high-intensity, ultrasonic waves in a particular medium (or coupled media) is the generation and propagation of audio frequency waves (not necessarily present in the original audio information) that are generated in a manner similar to the nonlinear process of amplitude demodulation commonly inherent in diode circuits (when diodes are forward biased).  


Another audio effect that arises from high-intensity ultrasonic beams of sound is a static (DC) pressure called radiation pressure.  Radiation pressure is similar to parametric array effects in that amplitude variations in the signal give rise to audible frequencies via amplitude demodulation.  However, unlike parametric array effects, radiation pressure fluctuations that generate audible signals from amplitude demodulation can occur due to any low-frequency modulation and not just from pressure fluctuations occurring at the modulation frequency  &lt;math&gt; \omega_M \,&lt;/math&gt; or beating frequency  &lt;math&gt; f_1 - f_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;.

==An Application of Coupled Media in Acoustic Filters==

Figs. 1 - 3 were all from a research paper entitled [http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~vgant/AcousticFilterPaper.pdf New Type of Acoustics Filter Using Periodic Polymer Layers for Measuring Audio Signal Components Excited by Amplitude-Modulated High_Intensity Ultrasonic Waves]submitted to the Audio Engineering Society (AES) by Minoru Todo, Primary Innovator at Measurement Specialties, Inc., in the October 2005 edition of the AES Journal.  Figs. 4 and 5 below, also from this paper, are illustrations of test setups referred to in this paper.  Specifically, Fig. 4 is a test setup used to measure the transmission (of an incident ultrasonic sound wave) through the acoustic filter described by Figs. 1 and 2.  Fig. 5 is a block diagram of the test setup used for measuring radiation pressure, one of the audio effects mentioned in the previous section.  It turns out that out of all of the audio effects mentioned in the previous section that are caused by high-intensity ultrasonic waves propagating in a medium, sound waves produced from radiated pressure are the hardest to detect when microphones and preamplifiers are used in the detection/receiver system.  Although nonlinear noise artifacts occur due to overloading of the preamplifier present in the detection/receiver system, the bulk of the nonlinear noise comes from the inherent nonlinear noise properties of microphones.  This is true because all microphones, even specialized measurement microphones designed for audio spectrum measurements that have sensitivity well beyond the threshold of hearing, have nonlinearities artifacts that (periodically) increase in magnitude with respect to increase at ultrasonic frequencies.  These nonlinearities essentially mask the radiation pressure generated because the magnitude of these nonlinearities are orders of magnitude greater than the radiation pressure.  The acoustic (low-pass) filter referred to in this paper was designed in order to filter out the &quot;detrimental&quot; ultrasonic wave that was inducing high nonlinear noise artifacts in the measurement microphones.  The high-intensity, ultrasonic wave was producing radiation pressure (which is audible) within the initial acoustic medium (i.e. air).  By filtering out the ultrasonic wave, the measurement microphone would only detect the audible radiation pressure that the ultrasonic wave was producing in air.  Acoustic filters like these could possibly be used to detect/receive any high-intensity, ultrasonic signal that may carry audio information which may need to be extrapolated with an acceptable level of fidelity.

==Noise in Hydraulic Systems==
Hydraulic systems are the most preferred source of power transmission in most of the industrial and mobile equipments due to their power density, compactness, flexibility, fast response and efficiency. The field hydraulics and pneumatics is also known as 'Fluid Power Technology'. Fluid power systems have a wide range of applications which include industrial, off-road vehicles, automotive systems, and aircraft. But, one of the main problems with the hydraulic systems is the noise generated by them. The health and safety issues relating to noise have been recognized for many years and legislation is now placing clear demands on manufacturers to reduce noise levels [1]. Hence, noise reduction in hydraulic systems demands lot of attention from the industrial as well as academic researchers. It needs a good understanding of how the noise is generated and propagated in a hydraulic system in order to reduce it.


== Sound in fluids ==
The speed of sound in fluids can be determined using the following relation.

&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt {\frac{K}{\rho}} &lt;/math&gt;
where K - fluid bulk modulus, &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt;- fluid density, c - velocity of sound

Typical value of bulk modulus range from '''2e9 to 2.5e9 N/m2'''. For a particular oil, with a density of '''889 kg/m3''',
 
speed of sound &lt;math&gt; c = \sqrt {\frac{2e9}{889}}= 1499.9 m/s &lt;/math&gt;

== Source of Noise ==
The main source of noise in hydraulic systems is the pump which supplies the flow. Most of the pumps used are positive displacement pumps. Of the positive displacement pumps, axial piston swash plate type is mostly preferred due to their reliability and efficiency. 

The noise generation in an axial piston pump can be classified under two categories 
(i) fluidborne noise and
(ii) Structureborne noise

==&lt;center&gt;Fluidborne Noise (FBN) &lt;/center&gt;==

Among the positive displacement pumps, highest levels of FBN are generated by axial piston pumps and lowest levels by screw pumps and in between these lie the external gear pump and vane pump [1]. The discussion in this page is mainly focused on '''axial piston swash plate type pumps'''. An axial piston pump has a fixed number of displacement chambers arranged in a circular pattern separated from each other by an angular pitch equal to &lt;math&gt; \phi = \frac {360}{n} &lt;/math&gt; where n is the number of displacement chambers. As each chamber discharges a specific volume of fluid, the discharge at the pump outlet is sum of all the discharge from the individual chambers. The discontinuity in flow between adjacent chambers results in a kinematic flow ripple. The amplitude of the kinematic ripple can be theoretical determined given the size of the pump and the number of displacement chambers. The kinematic ripple is the main cause of the fluidborne noise. The kinematic ripples is a theoretical value. The actual '''flow ripple''' at the pump outlet is much larger than the theoretical value because the '''kinematic ripple''' is combined with a '''compressibility component''' which is due to the fluid compressibility. These ripples (also referred as flow pulsations) generated at the pump are transmitted through the pipe or flexible hose connected to the pump and travel to all parts of the hydraulic circuit. 

The pump is considered an ideal flow source. The pressure in the system will be decided by resistance to the flow or otherwise known as system load. The flow pulsations result in pressure pulsations. The pressure pulsations are superimposed on the mean system pressure. Both the '''flow and pressure pulsations''' easily travel to all part of the circuit and affect the performance of the components like control valve and actuators in the system and make the component vibrate, sometimes even resonate. This vibration of system components adds to the noise generated by the flow pulsations. The transmission of FBN in the circuit is discussed under transmission below.

A typical axial piston pump with 9 pistons running at 1000 rpm can produce a sound pressure level of more than 70 dBs.

==&lt;center&gt; Structureborne Noise (SBN)&lt;/center&gt;==
In swash plate type pumps, the main sources of the structureborne noise are the fluctuating forces and moments of the swash plate. These fluctuating forces arise as a result of the varying pressure inside the displacement chamber. As the displacing elements move from suction stroke to discharge stroke, the pressure varies accordingly from few bars to few hundred bars. These pressure changes are reflected on the displacement elements (in this case, pistons) as forces and these force are exerted on the swash plate causing the swash plate to vibrate. This vibration of the swash plate is the main cause of '''structureborne noise'''. There are other components in the system which also vibrate and lead to structureborne noise, but the swash is the major contributor.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Pump_noise.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; ''' Fig. 1 shows an exploded view of axial piston pump. Also the flow pulsations and the oscillating forces on the swash plate, which cause FBN and SBN respectively are shown for one revolution of the pump. '''&lt;/center&gt;

==Transmission==

==='''FBN'''===
The transmission of FBN is a complex phenomenon. Over the past few decades, considerable amount of research had gone into mathematical modeling of pressure and flow transient in the circuit. This involves the solution of wave equations, with piping treated as a distributed parameter system known as a transmission line [1] &amp; [3].

Lets consider a simple pump-pipe-loading valve circuit as shown in Fig. 2. The pressure and flow ripple at any location in the pipe can be described by the relations:


&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; \frac {}{} P = Ae^{-i k x} + Be^{+i k x}&lt;/math&gt; .........(1) &lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; Q = \frac {1}{Z_{0}}(Ae^{-i k x} - Be^{+i k x})&lt;/math&gt;.....(2)&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\frac {}{} A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac {}{} B &lt;/math&gt; are frequency dependent complex coefficients which are directly proportional to pump (source) flow ripple, but also functions of the source impedance &lt;math&gt;\frac {}{} Z_{s}&lt;/math&gt;, characteristic impedance of the pipe &lt;math&gt;\frac {}{} Z_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and the termination impedance &lt;math&gt;\frac {}{} Z_{t}&lt;/math&gt;. These impedances ,usually vary  as the system operating pressure and flow rate changes, can be determined experimentally.

For complex systems with several system components, the pressure and flow ripples are estimated using the transformation matrix approach. For this, the system components can be treated as lumped impedances (a throttle valve or accumulator), or distributed impedances (flexible hose or silencer). Various software packages are available today to predict the pressure pulsations.

==='''SBN'''===
The transmission of SBN follows the classic source-path-noise model. The vibrations of the swash plate, the main cause of SBN, are transferred to the pump casing which encloses all the rotating group in the pump including displacement chambers (also known as cylinder block), pistons, and the swash plate. The pump case, apart from vibrating itself, transfers the vibration down to the mount on which the pump is mounted. The mount then passes the vibrations down to the main mounted structure or the vehicle. Thus the SBN is transferred from the swash plate to the main structure or vehicle via pumpcasing and mount. 

Some of the machine structures, along the path of transmission, are good at transmitting this vibrational energy and they even resonate and reinforce it. By converting only a fraction of 1% of the pump structureborne noise into sound, a member in the transmission path could radiate more ABN than the pump itself [4].

==Airborne noise (ABN)==
Both FBN and SBN , impart high fatigue loads on the system components and make them vibrate. All of these vibrations are radiated as '''airborne noise''' and can be heard by a human operator. Also, the flow and pressure pulsations make the system components such as a control valve to resonate. This vibration of the particular component again radiates airborne noise.

==Noise reduction==
The reduction of the noise radiated from the hydraulic system can be approached in two ways.

(i) '''Reduction at Source''' - which is the reduction of noise at the pump. A large amount of open literature are available on the reduction techniques with some techniques focusing on reducing FBN at source and others focusing on SBN. Reduction in FBN and SBN at the source has a large influence on the ABN that is radiated. Even though, a lot of progress had been made in reducing the FBN and SBN separately, the problem of noise in hydraulic systems is not fully solved and lot need to be done. The reason is that the FBN and SBN are interrelated, in a sense that, if one tried to reduce the FBN at the pump, it tends to affect the SBN characteristics. Currently, one of the main researches in noise reduction in pumps, is a systematic approach in understanding the coupling between FBN and SBN and targeting them simultaneously instead of treating them as two separate sources. Such an unified approach, demands not only well trained researchers but also sophisticated computer based mathematical model of the pump which can accurately output the necessary results for optimization of pump design. The amplitude of fluid pulsations can be reduced, at the source, with the use of an hydraulic attenuator(5). 


(ii) '''Reduction at Component level''' - which focuses on the reduction of noise from individual component like hose, control valve, pump mounts and fixtures. This can be accomplished by a suitable design modification of the component so that it radiates least amount of noise. Optimization using computer based models can be one of the ways.

==Introduction==
One of my favorite instruments is the marimba.  Like a xylophone, a marimba has octaves of wooden bars that are struck with mallets to produce tones.  Unlike the harsh sound of a xylophone, a marimba produces a deep, rich tone.  Marimbas are not uncommon and are played in most high school bands.

Now, while all the trumpet and flute and clarinet players are busy tuning up their instruments, the marimba player is back in the percussion section with her feet up just relaxing.  This is a bit surprising, however, since the marimba is a melodic instrument that needs to be in tune to sound good.  So what gives?  Why is the marimba never tuned?  How would you even go about tuning a marimba?  To answer these questions, the acoustics behind (or within) a marimba must be understood.

==Components of sound==

What gives the marimba its unique sound?  It can be boiled down to two components:  the bars and the resonators.  Typically, the bars are made of rosewood (or some synthetic version of wood).  They are cut to size depending on what note is desired, then the tuning is refined by shaving wood from the underside of the bar.  

===Example===

Rosewood bar, middle C, 1 cm thick

The equation that relates the length of the bar with the desired frequency comes from the theory of modeling a bar that is free at both ends.  This theory yields the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; Length = \sqrt{\frac{3.011^2\cdot \pi \cdot t \cdot c}{8 \cdot \sqrt{12}\cdot f}}&lt;/math&gt;

where t is the thickness of the bar, c is the speed of sound in the bar, and f is the frequency of the note.

For rosewood, c = 5217 m/s. For middle C, f=262 Hz.

Therefore, to make a middle C key for a rosewood marimba, cut the bar to be: 

&lt;math&gt; Length = \sqrt{\frac{3.011^2\cdot \pi \cdot .01 \cdot 5217}{8 \cdot \sqrt{12}\cdot 262}}= .45 m = 45 cm&lt;/math&gt; ***

The resonators are made from metal (usually aluminum) and their lengths also differ depending on the desired note.  It is important to know that each resonator is open at the top but closed by a stopper at the bottom end.

===Example===

Aluminum resonator, middle C

The equation that relates the length of the resonator with the desired frequency comes from modeling the resonator as a pipe that is driven at one end and closed at the other end.  A &quot;driven&quot; pipe is one that has a source of excitation (in this case, the vibrating key) at one end.  This model yields the following:

&lt;math&gt;Length = \frac {c}{4\cdot f}&lt;/math&gt;

where c is the speed of sound in air and f is the frequency of the note.

For air, c = 343 m/s.  For middle C, f = 262 Hz.

Therefore, to make a resonator for the middle C key, the resonator length should be:

&lt;math&gt; Length = \frac {343}{4 \cdot 262} = .327m = 32.7 cm &lt;/math&gt;

===Resonator shape===
The shape of the resonator is an important factor in determining the quality of sound that can be produced.  The ideal shape is a sphere.  This is modeled by the Helmholtz resonator. However, mounting big, round, beach ball-like resonators under the keys is typically impractical.   The worst choices for resonators are square or oval tubes.  These shapes amplify the non-harmonic pitches sometimes referred to as “junk pitches”.  The round tube is typically chosen because it does the best job (aside from the sphere) at amplifying the desired harmonic and not much else.  

As mentioned in the second example above, the resonator on a marimba can be modeled by a closed pipe. This model can be used to predict what type of sound (full and rich vs dull) the marimba will produce.  Each pipe is a &quot;quarter wave resonator&quot; that amplifies the sound waves produced by of the bar.  This means that in order to produce a full, rich sound, the length of the resonator must exactly match one-quarter of the wavelength.  If the length is off, the marimba will produce a dull or off-key sound for that note.

==Why would the marimba need tuning?==
In the theoretical world where it is always 72 degrees with low humidity,  a marimba would not need tuning.  But, since weather can be a factor (especially for the marching band) marimbas do not always perform the same way.  Hot and cold weather can wreak havoc on all kinds of percussion instruments, and the marimba is no exception.  On hot days, the marimba tends to be sharp and for cold days it tends to be flat.  This is the exact opposite of what happens to string instruments.  Why? The tone of a string instrument depends mainly on the tension in the string, which decreases as the string expands with heat.  The decrease in tension leads to a flat note.  Marimbas on the other hand produce sound by moving air through the resonators.  The speed at which this air is moved is the speed of sound, which varies proportionately with temperature!  So, as the temperature increases, so does the speed of sound.  From the equation given in example 2 from above, you can see that an increase in the speed of sound (c) means a longer pipe is needed to resonate the same note.  If the length of the resonator is not increased, the note will sound sharp.  Now, the heat can also cause the wooden bars to expand, but the effect of this expansion is insignificant compared to the effect of the change in the speed of sound.

==Tuning myths==
It is a common myth among percussionists that the marimba can be tuned by simply moving the resonators up or down (while the bars remain in the same position.)  The thought behind this is that by moving the resonators down, for example, you are in effect lengthening them.  While this may sound like sound reasoning, it actually does not hold true in practice.  
Judging by how the marimba is constructed (cutting bars and resonators to specific lengths), it seems that there are really two options to consider when looking to tune a marimba: shave some wood off the underside of the bars, or change the length of the resonator.  For obvious reasons, shaving wood off the keys every time the weather changes is not a practical solution.  Therefore, the only option left is to change the length of the resonator.  

As mentioned above, each resonator is plugged by a stopper at the bottom end.  So, by simply shoving the stopper farther up the pipe, you can shorten the resonator and sharpen the note.  Conversely, pushing the stopper down the pipe can flatten the note.  Most marimbas do not come with tunable resonators, so this process can be a little challenging.  (Broomsticks and hammers are common tools of the trade.) 

===Example===
 
Middle C Resonator lengthened by 1 cm

For ideal conditions, the length of the middle C (262 Hz) resonator should be 32.7 cm as shown in example 2.  Therefore, the change in frequency for this resonator due to a change in length is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta Frequency = 262 Hz - \frac {c}{4\cdot (.327 + \Delta L)} &lt;/math&gt;

If the length is increased by 1 cm, the change in frequency will be:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta Frequency = \frac {343}{4\cdot (.327 + .01)} - 262 Hz = 7.5 Hz&lt;/math&gt;

The acoustics behind the tuning a marimba go back to the design that each resonator is to be ¼ of the total wavelength of the desired note.  When marimbas get out of tune, this length is no longer exactly equal to ¼ the wavelength due to the lengthening or shortening of the resonator as described above.  Because the length has changed, resonance is no longer achieved, and the tone can become muffled or off-key.

==Conclusions==
Some marimba builders are now changing their designs to include tunable resonators.  Since any leak in the end-seal will cause major loss of volume and richness of the tone, this is proving to be a very difficult task.   At least now, though, armed with the acoustic background of their instruments, percussionists everywhere will now have something to do when the conductor says, “tune up!”

==Introduction==

In class, we have begun to discuss the solutions of multidimensional wave equations. A particularly interesting aspect of these multidimensional solutions are those of bessel functions for circular boundary conditions. The practical application of these solutions is the kettledrum. This page will explore in qualitative and quantitative terms how the kettledrum works. More specifically, the kettledrum will be introduced as a circular membrane and its solution will be discussed with visuals (e.g. visualization of bessel functions, video of kettledrums and audio forms (wav files of kettledrums playing. In addition, links to more information about this material, including references will be included.

==The math behind the kettledrum: the brief version==

When one looks at how a kettledrum produces sound, one should look no farther than the drum head. The vibration of this circular membrane (and the air in the drum enclosure) is what produces the sound in this instrument. The mathematics behind this vibrating drum are relatively simple.  If one looks at a small element of the drum head, it looks exactly like the mathematical model for a vibrating string (see:). The only difference is that there are two dimensions where there are forces on the element, the two dimensions that are planar to the drum. As this is the same situation, we have the same equation, except with another spatial term in the other planar dimension. This allows us to model the drum head using a helmholtz equation. The next step (solved in detail below) is to assume that the displacement of the drum head (in polar coordinates) is a product of two separate functions for theta and r. This allows us to turn the PDE into two ODES which are readily solved and applied to the situation of the kettledrum head. For more info, see below.

==The math behind the kettledrum: the derivation==

So starting with the trusty general Helmholtz equation:

&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\Psi+k^2\Psi=0&lt;/math&gt;

Where k is the wave number, the frequency of the forced oscillations divided by the speed of sound in the membrane.

Since we are dealing with a circular object, it make sense to work in polar coordinates (in terms of radius and angle) instead of rectangular coordinates. For polar coordinates the Laplacian term of the helmholtz relation (&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt;) becomes &lt;math&gt;\partial^2 \Psi/ \partial r^2 + 1/r \partial\Psi/ \partial r +1/r^2 \partial^2 \Psi /\partial \theta^2&lt;/math&gt;

Now lets assume that: &lt;math&gt;\Psi (r,\theta) = R(r) \Theta(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

This assumption follows the method of separation of variables. (see Reference 3 for more info) Substituting this result back into our trusty Helmholtz equation gives the following:

&lt;math&gt;r^2 / R (d^2 R/dr^2 + 1/r dR/dr) + k^2 r^2 = -1/\Theta d^2 \Theta /d\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since we separated the variables of the solution into two one-dimensional functions, the partial derivatives become ordinary derivatives. Both sides of this result must equal the same constant. For simplicity, I will use &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2&lt;/math&gt; as this constant. This results in the following two equations:

&lt;math&gt; d^2 \Theta / d\theta^2 = -\lambda^2 \Theta &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; d^2 R / dr^2 + 1/r dR/dr + (k^2 - \lambda^2 / r^2) R = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The first of these equations readily seen as the standard second order ordinary differential equation which has a harmonic solution of sines and cosines with the frequency based on &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt;. The second equation is what is known as Bessel's Equation. The solution to this equation is cryptically called Bessel functions of order &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; of the first and second kind. These functions, while sounding very intimidating, are simply oscillatory functions of the radius times the wave number that are unbounded when kr (for the function of the second kind) approaches zero and diminish as kr get larger. (For more information on what these functions look like see References 1,2, and 3)

Now that we have the general solution to this equation, we can now model a infinite radius kettledrum head. However, since i have yet to see an infinite kettle drum, we need to constrain this solution of a vibrating membrane to a finite radius. We can do this by applying what we know about our circular membrane: along the edges of the kettledrum, the drum head is attached to the drum. This means that there can be no displacement of the membrane at the termination at the radius of the kettle drum. This boundary condition can be mathematically described as the following:

&lt;math&gt; R(a) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Where a is the arbitrary radius of the kettledrum. In addition to this boundary condition, the displacement of the drum head at the center must be finite.  This second boundary condition removes the bessel function of the second kind from the solution. This reduces the R part of our solution to:

&lt;math&gt; R(r) = AJ_{\lambda}(kr) &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; J_{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt; is a bessel function of the first kind of order &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt;. Apply our other boundary condition at the radius of the drum requires that the wave number k must have discrete values, (&lt;math&gt;j_{mn}/a&lt;/math&gt;) which can be looked up. Combining all of these gives us our solution to how a drum head behaves (which is the real part of the following):

&lt;math&gt; y_{\lambda n}(r,\theta,t) = A_{\lambda n} J_{\lambda n}(k_{\lambda n} r)e^{j \lambda \theta+j w_{\lambda n} t} &lt;/math&gt;

==The math behind the kettledrum: the entire drum==

The above derivation is just for the drum head. An actual kettledrum has one side of this circular membrane surrounded by an enclosed cavity. This means that air is compressed in the cavity when the membrane is vibrating, adding more complications to the solution. In mathematical terms, this makes the partial differential equation non-homogeneous or in simpler terms, the right side of the Helmholtz equation does not equal zero. This result requires significantly more derivation, and will not be done here. If the reader cares  to know more, these results are discussed in the two books under references 6 and 7.

==Introduction==

Acoustic filters, or mufflers, are used in a number of applications requiring the suppression or attenuation of sound.  Although the idea might not be familiar to many people, acoustic mufflers make everyday life much more pleasant.  Many common appliances, such as refrigerators and air conditioners, use acoustic mufflers to produce a minimal working noise.  The application of acoustic mufflers is mostly directed to machine components or areas where there is a large amount of radiated sound such as high pressure exhaust pipes, gas turbines, and rotary pumps.

Although there are a number of applications for acoustic mufflers, there are really only two main types which are used.  These are absorptive and reactive mufflers.  Absorptive mufflers incorporate sound absorbing materials to attenuate the radiated energy in gas flow.  Reactive mufflers use a series of complex passages to maximize sound attenuation while meeting set specifications, such as pressure drop, volume flow, etc.  Many of the more complex mufflers today incorporate both methods to optimize sound attenuation and provide realistic specifications. 

In order to fully understand how acoustic filters attenuate radiated sound, it is first necessary to briefly cover some basic background topics.  For more information on wave theory and other material necessary to study acoustic filters please refer to the references below.

== Basic wave theory ==

Although not fundamentally difficult to understand, there are a number of alternate techniques used to analyze wave motion which could seem overwhelming to a novice at first.  Therefore, only 1-D wave motion will be analyzed to keep most of the mathematics as simple as possible.  This analysis is valid, with not much error, for the majority of pipes and enclosures encountered in practice.

=== Plane-wave pressure distribution in pipes ===

The most important equation used is the wave equation in 1-D form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of acoustics|last1=Kinsler|first1=Lawrence E.|last2=Frey|first2=Austin R.|last3=Coppens|first3=Alan B.|last4=Sanders|first4=James V.|isbn=978-0471847892|publisher=Wiley|language=en|pages=560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acoustics: An Introduction to Its Physical Principles and Applications|last=Pierce|first=Allan D.|isbn=978-0883186121|date=June 1989|pages=678|publisher=Acoustical Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WaveEquation1-Dimensional.html|title=Wave Equation--1-Dimensional.|publisher=MathWorld|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest, if plane waves are propagating, that the pressure distribution in a pipe is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=\mathbf{Pi}e^{j[\omega t-kx]}+\mathbf{Pr}e^{j[\omega t+kx]}&lt;/math&gt;

where Pi and Pr are incident and reflected wave amplitudes respectively.  Also note that bold notation is used to indicate the possibility of complex terms.  The first term represents a wave travelling in the +x direction and the second term, -x direction.

Since acoustic filters or mufflers typically attenuate the radiated sound power as much as possible, it is logical to assume that if we can find a way to maximize the ratio between reflected and incident wave amplitude then we will effectively attenuated the radiated noise at certain frequencies.  This ratio is called the reflection coefficient and is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=\left( \frac{\mathbf{Pr}}{\mathbf{Pi}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to point out that wave reflection only occurs when the impedance of a pipe changes.  It is possible to match the end impedance of a pipe with the characteristic impedance of a pipe to get no wave reflection.  For more information see [1] or [2].

Although the reflection coefficient isn't very useful in its current form since we want a relation describing sound power, a more useful form can be derived by recognizing that the power intensity coefficient is simply the magnitude of reflection coefficient square [1]:

&lt;math&gt;R_{\pi}=\left|\mathbf{R}\right|^2&lt;/math&gt;

As one would expect, the power reflection coefficient must be less than or equal to one.  Therefore, it is useful to define the transmission coefficient as:

&lt;math&gt;T_{\pi}=\left(1-R_{\pi}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is the amount of power transmitted.  This relation comes directly from conservation of energy.  When talking about the performance of mufflers, typically the power transmission coefficient is specified.

== Basic filter design ==

For simple filters, a long wavelength approximation can be made to make the analysis of the system easier.  When this assumption is valid (e.g. low frequencies) the components of the system behave as lumped acoustical elements.  Equations relating the various properties are easily derived under these circumstances.

The following derivations assume long wavelength.  Practical applications for most conditions are given later.

=== Low-pass filter ===
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_lpass.jpg|thumb|Tpi for Low-Pass Filter]]
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_lpass1.svg|thumb]]

These are devices that attenuate the radiated sound power at higher frequencies.  This means the power transmission coefficient is approximately 1 across the band pass at low frequencies(see figure to right).

This is equivalent to an expansion in a pipe, with the volume of gas located in the expansion having an acoustic compliance (see figure to right).  Continuity of acoustic impedance (see Java Applet at: [http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Ultrasonics/Physics/acousticimpedance.htm Acoustic Impedance Visualization]) at the junction, see [1], gives a power transmission coefficient of:

&lt;math&gt;T_{\pi} \approx \frac{1}{1+\left(\displaystyle\frac{S_{1}-S}{2S}kL\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where k is the wavenumber (see [[Engineering_Acoustics/Boundary_Conditions_and_Forced_Vibrations#Wave_Properties|Wave Properties]]), L &amp; &lt;math&gt;S_{1}&lt;/math&gt; are length and area of expansion respectively, and S is the area of the pipe.

The cut-off frequency is given by:

&lt;math&gt;f_{c}=\left(\frac{c S}{\pi L(S_{1}-S)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== High-pass filter ===
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_hpass.jpg|thumb|Tpi for High-Pass Filter]]
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_hpass1.jpg|thumb]]

These are devices that attenuate the radiated sound power at lower frequencies.  Like before, this means the power transmission coefficient is approximately 1 across the band pass at high frequencies (see figure to right).

This is equivalent to a short side branch (see figure to right) with a radius and length much smaller than the wavelength (lumped element assumption).  This side branch acts like an acoustic mass and applies a different acoustic impedance to the system than the low-pass filter.  Again using continuity of acoustic impedance at the junction yields a power transmission coefficient of the form [1]:

&lt;math&gt;T_{\pi}=\left(\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{\pi a^2}{2SLk}\right)^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where a and L are the area and effective length of the small tube, and S is the area of the pipe.

The cut-off frequency is given by:

&lt;math&gt;f_{c}=\left(\frac{ca^2}{2SL}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Band-stop filter ===
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_bstop.jpg|thumb|Tpi for Band-Stop Filter]]
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_bstop1.jpg|thumb]]

These are devices that attenuate the radiated sound power over a certain frequency range (see figure to right).  Like before, the power transmission coefficient is approximately 1 in the band pass region.

Since the band-stop filter is essentially a cross between a low and high pass filter, one might expect to create one by using a combination of both techniques.  This is true in that the combination of a lumped acoustic mass and compliance gives a band-stop filter.  This can be realized as a helmholtz resonator (see figure to right).  Again, since the impedance of the helmholtz resonator can be easily determined, continuity of acoustic impedance at the junction can give the power transmission coefficient as [1]:

&lt;math&gt;T_{\pi}=\left(\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{c/2S}{\omega L/S_{b}-c^2/\omega V}\right)^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the neck, L is the effective length of the neck, V is the volume of the helmholtz resonator, and S is the area of the pipe.  It is interesting to note that the power transmission coefficient is zero when the frequency is that of the resonance frequency of the helmholtz.  This can be explained by the fact that at resonance the volume velocity in the neck is large with a phase such that all the incident wave is reflected back to the source [1].

The zero power transmission coefficient location is given by:

&lt;math&gt;f_{c}=\left(\frac{c}{2\pi}\right)\sqrt{\left(\frac{S_{b}}{LV}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

This frequency value has powerful implications.  If a system has the majority of noise at one frequency component, the system can be &quot;tuned&quot; using the above equation, with a helmholtz resonator, to perfectly attenuate any transmitted power (see examples below).

|}

=== Design ===

If the long wavelength assumption is valid, typically a combination of methods described above are used to design a filter.  A specific design procedure is outlined for a helmholtz resonator, and other basic filters follow a similar procedure (see [[http://www.silex.com/pdfs/Exhaust%20Silencers.pdf 1]]).

Two main metrics need to be identified when designing a helmholtz resonator [3]:

# Resonance frequency desired: &lt;math&gt;f_{c}=\frac{c}{2\pi}\frac{\sqrt{C_{o}}}{V}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;C_{o}=\frac{S}{L}&lt;/math&gt;.
# - Transmission loss: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{C_{o}V}}{2S}=const&lt;/math&gt; based on TL level.  This constant is found from a TL graph (see [http://mecheng.osu.edu/~selamet/docs/2003_JASA_113(4)_1975-1985_helmholtz_ext_neck.pdf HR] pp. 6).

This will result in two equations with two unknowns which can be solved for the unknown dimensions of the helmholtz resonator.  It is important to note that flow velocities degrade the amount of transmission loss at resonance and tend to move the resonance location upwards [3].

In many situations, the long wavelength approximation is not valid and alternative methods must be examined.  These are much more mathematically rigorous and require a complete understanding acoustics involved.  Although the mathematics involved are not shown, common filters used are given in the section that follows.

== Actual filter design ==

As explained previously, there are two main types of filters used in practice: absorptive and reactive.  The benefits and drawback of each will be briefly explained, along with their relative applications (see [[Engineering Acoustics/Specific application-automobile muffler#Absorptive_muffler|Absorptive Mufflers]].

=== Absorptive ===

These are mufflers which incorporate sound absorbing materials to transform acoustic energy into heat.  Unlike reactive mufflers which use destructive interference to minimize radiated sound power, absorptive mufflers are typically straight through pipes lined with multiple layers of absorptive materials to reduce radiated sound power.  The most important property of absorptive mufflers is the attenuation constant.  Higher attenuation constants lead to more energy dissipation and lower radiated sound power.

{| width:75%; height:200px border=&quot;1&quot;
|- 
| Advantages of Absorptive Mufflers [3]:
|- 
| (1) - High amount of absorption at larger frequencies.
(2) - Good for applications involving broadband (constant across the spectrum) and [[w:narrowband|narrowband]] noise.

(3) - Reduced amount of back pressure compared to reactive mufflers.
|-
| Disadvantages of Absorptive Mufflers [3]:
|-
| (1) - Poor performance at low frequencies.
(2) - Material can degrade under certain circumstances (high heat, etc.).
|}

==== Examples ====
[[Image:Cherrybomb_muffler.jpg|thumb|Absorptive Muffler]]

There are a number of applications for absorptive mufflers.  The most well known application is in race cars, where engine performance is desired.  Absorptive mufflers don't create a large amount of back pressure (as in reactive mufflers) to attenuate the sound, which leads to higher muffler performance.  It should be noted however, that the radiate sound is much higher.  Other applications include plenum chambers (large chambers lined with absorptive materials, see picture below), lined ducts, and ventilation systems.

=== Reactive ===

Reactive mufflers use a number of complex passages (or lumped elements) to reduce the amount of acoustic energy transmitted.  This is accomplished by a change in impedance at the intersections, which gives rise to reflected waves (and effectively reduces the amount of transmitted acoustic energy).  Since the amount of energy transmitted is minimized, the reflected energy back to the source is quite high.  This can actually degrade the performance of engines and other sources.  Opposite to absorptive mufflers, which dissipate the acoustic energy, reactive mufflers keep the energy contained within the system.  See [[Engineering Acoustics/Car Mufflers|#The_reflector_muffler Reactive Mufflers]] for more information.

{| width:75%; height:200px border=&quot;1&quot;
|- 
| Advantages of Reactive Mufflers [3]:
|- 
| (1) - High performance at low frequencies.
(2) - Typically give high insertion loss, IL, for stationary tones.

(3) - Useful in harsh conditions.
|-
| Disadvantages of Reactive Mufflers [3]:
|-
| (1) - Poor performance at high frequencies.
(2) - Not desirable characteristics for broadband noise.

==== Examples ====
[[Image:EXHAUSTCUT-OUTsm.jpg|thumb|Reflective Muffler]]

Reactive mufflers are the most widely used mufflers in combustion engines[[http://www.eiwilliams.com/steel/index.php?p=EngineSilencers#All 1]].  Reactive mufflers are very efficient in low frequency applications (especially since simple lumped element analysis can be applied).  Other application areas include: harsh environments (high temperature/velocity engines, turbines, etc.), specific frequency attenuation (using a helmholtz like device, a specific frequency can be toned to give total attenuation of radiated sound power), and a need for low radiated sound power (car mufflers, air conditioners, etc.).

=== Performance ===

There are 3 main metrics used to describe the performance of mufflers; Noise Reduction, Insertion Loss, and Transmission Loss.  Typically when designing a muffler, 1 or 2 of these metrics is given as a desired value.


==== Noise Reduction (NR) ====

Defined as the difference between sound pressure levels on the source and receiver side.  It is essentially the amount of sound power reduced between the location of the source and termination of the muffler system (it doesn't have to be the termination, but it is the most common location) [3].

&lt;math&gt;NR = \left(L_{p1}-L_{p2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L_{p1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{p2}&lt;/math&gt; is sound pressure levels at source and receiver respectively.  Although NR is easy to measure, pressure typically varies at source side due to standing waves [3].

==== Insertion Loss (IL) ====

Defined as difference of sound pressure level at the receiver with and without sound attenuating barriers.  This can be realized, in a car muffler, as the difference in radiated sound power with just a straight pipe to that with an expansion chamber located in the pipe.  Since the expansion chamber will attenuate some of the radiate sound power, the pressure at the receiver with sound attenuating barriers will be less.  Therefore, a higher insertion loss is desired [3].

&lt;math&gt;IL = \left(L_{p,without}-L_{p,with}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L_{p,without}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{p,with}&lt;/math&gt; are pressure levels at receiver without and with a muffler system respectively.  Main problem with measuring IL is that the barrier or sound attenuating system needs to be removed without changing the source [3].

==== Transmission Loss (TL) ====

Defined as the difference between the sound power level of the incident wave to the muffler system and the transmitted sound power.  For further information see [[http://freespace.virgin.net/mark.davidson3/TL/TL.html Transmission Loss]] [3].

&lt;math&gt;TL = 10log\left(\frac{1}{\tau}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\tau =\left(\frac{I_{t}}{I_{i}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are the transmitted and incident wave power respectively.  From this expression, it is obvious the problem with measure TL is decomposing the sound field into incident and transmitted waves which can be difficult to do for complex systems (analytically).

==== Examples ====

(1) - For a plenum chamber (see figure below):

&lt;math&gt;TL = -10 \log\left(S\left(\frac{\cos\theta}{2\pi d^2}+\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha S_{w}}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt; in dB

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is average absorption coefficient.

{|

| [[image:acoustics_filter_implem_plenum.jpg|none|thumb|Transmission Loss vs. Theta]] 
|}

(2) - For an expansion (see figure below):

&lt;math&gt;NR = 10 \log\left[ \frac{1}{2}\left| e^{-ikx_{s}}+\left( \frac{1-S}{1+S} \right)e^{ikx_{s}} \right|^2\left( 1+S \right)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;IL = 10 \log\left[ \frac{\left( 1+S \right)^2}{4} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;TL = 10 \log\left[ \frac{\left( 1+S \right)^2}{4S} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S=\left( \frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

(3) - For a helmholtz resonator (see figure below):

&lt;math&gt;TL = 10 \log\left[ 1+\left( \frac{\left( \frac{c}{2S_{b}} \right)}{\omega LS - \left( \frac{c^2}{\omega V} \right)} \right)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt; in dB

==Introduction==
The importance of flow excited acoustic resonance lies in the large number of applications in which it occurs. Sound production in organ pipes, compressors, transonic wind tunnels, and open sunroofs are only a few examples of the many applications in which flow excited resonance of Helmholtz resonators can be found.[4] An instability of the fluid motion coupled with an acoustic resonance of the cavity produce large pressure fluctuations that are felt as increased sound pressure levels.

Passengers of road vehicles with open sunroofs often experience discomfort, fatigue, and dizziness from self-sustained oscillations inside the car cabin. This phenomenon is caused by the coupling of acoustic and hydrodynamic flow inside a cavity which creates strong pressure oscillations in the passenger compartment in the 10 to 50 Hz frequency range. Some effects experienced by vehicles with open sunroofs when buffeting include: dizziness, temporary hearing reduction, discomfort, driver fatigue, and in extreme cases nausea. The importance of reducing interior noise levels inside the car cabin relies primarily in reducing driver fatigue and improving sound transmission from entertainment and communication devices.

This Wikibook page aims to theoretically and graphically explain the mechanisms involved in the flow-excited acoustic resonance of Helmholtz resonators. The interaction between fluid motion and acoustic resonance will be explained to provide a thorough explanation of the behavior of self-oscillatory Helmholtz resonator systems. As an application example, a description of the mechanisms involved in sunroof buffeting phenomena will be developed at the end of the page.

==Feedback loop analysis==
As mentioned before, the self-sustained oscillations of a Helmholtz resonator in many cases is a continuous interaction of hydrodynamic and acoustic mechanisms. In the frequency domain, the flow excitation and the acoustic behavior can be represented as transfer functions. The flow can be decomposed into two volume velocities. 

: qr:  flow associated with acoustic response of cavity
: qo:  flow associated with excitation

==Acoustical characteristics of the resonator==

===Lumped parameter model===
The lumped parameter model of a Helmholtz resonator consists of a rigid-walled volume open to the environment through a small opening at one end. The dimensions of the resonator in this model are much less than the acoustic wavelength, in this way allowing us to model the system as a lumped system.

Figure 2 shows a sketch of a Helmholtz resonator on the left, the mechanical analog on the middle section, and the electric-circuit analog on the right hand side. As shown in the Helmholtz resonator drawing, the air mass flowing through an inflow of volume velocity includes the mass inside the neck (Mo) and an end-correction mass (Mend). Viscous losses at the edges of the neck length are included as well as the radiation resistance of the tube. The electric-circuit analog shows the resonator modeled as a forced harmonic oscillator. [1] [2][3]

&lt;center&gt;'''''Figure 2'''''&lt;/center&gt;

V: cavity volume

&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;: ambient density

c: speed of sound

S: cross-section area of orifice

K: stiffness

&lt;math&gt;M_a&lt;/math&gt;: acoustic  mass

&lt;math&gt;C_a&lt;/math&gt;: acoustic  compliance

The equivalent stiffness K is related to the potential energy of the flow compressed inside the cavity. For a rigid wall cavity it is approximately:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; K = \left(\frac{\rho c^2}{V}\right)S^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The equation that describes the Helmholtz resonator is the following:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; S \hat{P}_e =\frac{\hat{q}_e}{j\omega S}(-\omega ^2 M + j\omega R + K) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\hat{P}_e&lt;/math&gt;: excitation pressure

M: total mass (mass inside neck Mo plus end correction, Mend)

R: total resistance (radiation loss plus viscous loss)

From the electrical-circuit we know the following:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; M_a = \frac{L \rho}{S} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; C_a = \frac{\pi V}{\rho c^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; L ' = \ L + \ 1.7 \ re &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The main cavity resonance parameters are resonance frequency and quality factor which can be estimated using the parameters explained above (assuming free field radiation, no viscous losses and leaks, and negligible wall compliance effects) 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \omega_r^2 = \frac{1}{M_a C_a} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; f_r = c 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{S}{L' V}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The sharpness of the resonance peak is measured by the quality factor Q of the Helmholtz resonator as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; Q = 2 \pi \sqrt{V (\frac{L'} {S})^3} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f_r&lt;/math&gt;: resonance frequency in Hz

&lt;math&gt;\omega_r&lt;/math&gt;: resonance frequency in radians 

: L: length of neck
: L': corrected length of neck 

From the equations above, the following can be deduced:

* The greater the volume of the resonator, the lower the resonance frequencies.
* If the length of the neck is increased, the resonance frequency decreases.

===Production of self-sustained oscillations===
The acoustic field interacts with the unstable hydrodynamic flow above the open section of the cavity, where the grazing flow is continuous. The flow in this section separates from the wall at a point where the acoustic and hydrodynamic flows are strongly coupled. [5]

The separation of the boundary layer at the leading edge of the cavity (front part of opening from incoming flow) produces strong vortices in the main stream. As observed in Figure 3, a shear layer crosses the cavity orifice and vortices start to form due to instabilities in the layer at the leading edge.

&lt;center&gt;'''''Figure 3'''''&lt;/center&gt;

From Figure 3, L is the length of the inner cavity region, d denotes the diameter or length of the cavity length, D represents the height of the cavity, and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; describes the gradient length in the grazing velocity profile (boundary layer thickness).

The velocity in this region is characterized to be unsteady and the perturbations in this region will lead to self-sustained oscillations inside the cavity. Vortices will continually form in the opening region due to the instability of the shear layer at the leading edge of the opening.

==Applications to Sunroof Buffeting==
===How are vortices formed during buffeting?===
In order to understand the generation and convection of vortices from the shear layer along the sunroof opening, the animation below has been developed. At a certain range of flow velocities, self-sustained oscillations inside the open cavity (sunroof) will be predominant. During this period of time, vortices are shed at the trailing edge of the opening and continue to be convected along the length of the cavity opening as pressure inside the cabin decreases and increases. Flow visualization experimentation is one method that helps obtain a qualitative understanding of vortex formation and conduction.

The animation below, shows in the middle, a side view of a car cabin with the sunroof open. As the air starts to flow at a certain mean velocity Uo, air mass will enter and leave the cabin as the pressure decreases and increases again. At the right hand side of the animation, a legend shows a range of colors to determine the pressure magnitude inside the car cabin. At the top of the animation, a plot of circulation and acoustic cavity pressure versus time for one period of oscillation is shown. The symbol x moving along the acoustic cavity pressure plot is synchronized with pressure fluctuations inside the car cabin and with the legend on the right. For example, whenever the x symbol is located at the point where t=0 (when the acoustic cavity pressure is minimum) the color of the car cabin will match that of the minimum pressure in the legend (blue).

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:theplot.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

The perturbations in the shear layer propagate with a velocity of the order of 1/2Uo which is half the mean inflow velocity. [5] After the pressure inside the cavity reaches a minimum (blue color) the air mass position in the neck of the cavity reaches its maximum outward position. At this point, a vortex is shed at the leading edge of the sunroof opening (front part of sunroof in the direction of inflow velocity). As the pressure inside the cavity increases (progressively to red color) and the air mass at the cavity entrance is moved inwards, the vortex is displaced into the neck of the cavity. The maximum downward displacement of the vortex is achieved when the pressure inside the cabin is also maximum and the air mass in the neck of the Helmholtz resonator (sunroof opening) reaches its maximum downward displacement. For the rest of the remaining half cycle, the pressure cavity falls and the air below the neck of the resonator is moved upwards. The vortex continues displacing towards the downstream edge of the sunroof where it is convected upwards and outside the neck of the resonator. At this point the air below the neck reaches its maximum upwards displacement.[4] And the process starts once again.

===How to identify buffeting===
Flow induced tests performed over a range of flow velocities are helpful to determine the change in sound pressure levels (SPL) inside the car cabin as inflow velocity is increased. The following animation shows typical auto spectra results from a car cabin with the sunroof open at various inflow velocities. At the top right hand corner of the animation, it is possible to see the inflow velocity and resonance frequency corresponding to the plot shown at that instant of time. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:curve.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

It is observed in the animation that the SPL increases gradually with increasing inflow velocity. Initially, the levels are below 80 dB and no major peaks are observed. As velocity is increased, the SPL increases throughout the frequency range until a definite peak is observed around a 100 Hz and 120 dB of amplitude. This is the resonance frequency of the cavity at which buffeting occurs. As it is observed in the animation, as velocity is further increased, the peak decreases and disappears.

In this way, sound pressure level plots versus frequency are helpful in determining increased sound pressure levels inside the car cabin to find ways to minimize them. Some of the methods used to minimize the increased SPL levels achieved by buffeting include: notched deflectors, mass injection, and spoilers.

== How does a violin make sound? ==

=== General concept ===
When a violinist bows a string, which can produce vibrations with abundant harmonics, the vibrations of the strings are structurally transmitted to the bridge and the body of the instrument through the bridge.  The bridge transmits the vibrational energy produced by the strings to the body through its feet, further triggering the vibration of body. The vibration of the body determines sound radiation and sound quality, along with the resonance of the cavity.

[[Image:procedure.jpg]]

=== String ===
The vibration pattern of the strings can be easily be observed. To the naked eye, the string appears to move back and forth in a parabolic shape (see figure), which resembles the first mode of free vibration of a stretched string. The vibration of strings was first investigated by [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Helmholtz.html Hermann Von Helmholtz], the famous mathematician and physicist in 19th century. A surprising scenario was discovered that the string actually moves in an inverse “V” shape rather than parabolas (see figure). What we see is just an envelope of the motion of the string. To honor his findings, the motion of bowed strings had been called “Helmholtz motion.”

[[Image:String.jpg]] [[Image:Helmholtzmotion.jpg]]

== Bridge ==
The primary role of the bridge is to transform the motion of vibrating strings into periodic driving forces by its feet to the top plate of the violin body. The configuration of the bridge can be referred to the figure. The bridge stands on the belly between f holes, which have two primary functions. One is to connect the air inside the body with outside air, and the other one is to make the belly between f holes move more easily than other parts of the body. The fundamental frequency of a violin bridge was found to be around 3000 Hz when it is on a rigid support, and it is an effective energy-transmitting medium to transmit the energy from the string to body at frequencies from 1 kHz to 4kHz, which is in the range of keen sensitivity of human hearing. In order to darken the sound of violin, the player attaches a mute on the bridge. The mute is actually an additional mass which reduces the fundamental frequency of the bridge. As a result, the sound at higher frequencies is diminished since the force transferred to the body has been decreased. On the other hand, the fundamental frequency of the bridge can be raised by attaching an additional stiffness in the form of tiny wedges, and the sound at higher frequencies will be amplified accordingly.

The sound post connects the flexible belly to the much stiffer back plate. The sound post can prevent the collapse of the belly due to high tension force in the string, and, at the same time, couples the vibration of the plate. The bass bar under the belly extends beyond the f holes and transmits the force of the bridge to a larger area of the belly. As can be seen in the figure, the motion of the treble foot is restricted by the sound post, while, conversely, the foot over bass bar can move up and down more easily. As a result, the bridge tends to move up and down, pivoting about the treble foot. The forces appearing at the two feet remain equal and opposite up to 1 kHz. At higher frequencies, the forces become uneven. The force on the soundpost foot predominates at some frequencies, while it is the bass bar foot at some.

[[Image:crossview.jpg]]

=== Body ===
The body includes top plate, back plate, the sides, and the air inside, all of which serve to transmit the vibration of the bridge into the vibration of air surrounding the violin. For this reason, the violin needs a relatively large surface area to push enough amount of air back and forth. Thus, the top and back plates play important roles in the mechanism. Violin makers have traditionally paid much attention to the vibration of the top and back plates of the violin by listening to the tap tones, or, recently, by observing the vibration mode shapes of the body plates. The vibration modes of an assembled violin are, however, much more complicated. 

The vibration modes of top and back plates can be easily observed in a similar technique first performed by Ernest Florens Friedrich Chaldni (1756 – 1827), who is often respectfully referred “the father of acoustics.” First, the fine sand is uniformly sprinkled on the plate. Then, the plate can be resonated, either by a powerful sound wave tuned to the desired frequencies, by being bowed by a violin bow, or by being excited mechanically or electromechanically at desired frequencies. Consequently, the sand disperses randomly due to the vibration of plate. Some of the sand falls outside the region of plate, while some of the sand is collected by the nodal regions, which have relatively small movement, of the plate. Hence, the mode shapes of the plate can be visualized in this manner, which can be referred to the figures in the reference site, [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/patterns2.html Violin Acoustics]. The first seven modes of the top and back plates of violin are presented, with nodal lines depicted by using black sands.

The air inside the body is also important, especially in the range of lower frequencies. It is like the air inside a bottle when you blow into the neck, or, as known as Helmholtz resonance, which has its own modes of vibration. The air inside the body can communicate with air outside through the f holes, and the outside air serves as medium carrying waves from the violin.

See [http://www.violinbridges.co.uk www.violinbridges.co.uk] for more articles on bridges and acoustics.

=== Sound radiation ===
A complete description of sound radiation of a violin should include the information about radiation intensity as functions both of frequency and location. The sound radiation can be measured by a microphone connected to a pressure level meter which is rotatably supported on a stand arm around the violin, while the violin is fastened at the neck by a clip. The force is introduced into the violin by using a miniature impact hammer at the upper edge of the bridge in the direction of bowing. The detail can be referred to [http://www.schleske.de/index.php?lang=en&amp;http://www.schleske.de/06geigenbauer/en_akustik3schall3messmeth.shtml  Martin Schleske, master studio for violinmaking ]. The radiation intensity of different frequencies at different locations can be represented by directional characteristics, or acoustic maps. The directional characteristics of a violin can be shown in the figure in the website of [http://www.schleske.de/picshoch/a0044_abstr_netz.gif Martin Schleske], where the radial distance from the center point represents the absolute value of the sound level (re 1Pa/N) in dB, and  the angular coordinate of the full circle indicates the measurement point around the instrument. According to the directional characteristics of violins, the principal radiation directions for the violin in the horizontal plane can be established. For more detail about the principal radiation direction for violins at different frequencies, please refer to reference (Meyer 1972).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Acoustics noise from cooling fans.JPG]]&lt;/center&gt;

== Proposal ==
As electric/electronic devices get smaller and functional, the noise of cooling device becomes important. This page will explain the origins of noise generation from small axial cooling fans used in electronic goods like desktop/laptop computers. The source of fan noises includes aerodynamic noise as well as operating sound of the fan itself. This page will be focused on the aerodynamic noise generation mechanisms.

== Introduction ==
If one opens a desktop computer, they may find three (or more) fans. For example, a fan is typically found on the heat sink of the CPU, in the back panel of the power supply unit, on the case ventilation hole, on the graphics card, and even on the motherboard chipset if it is a recent one. Computer noise which annoys many people is mostly due to cooling fans, if the hard drive(s) is fairly quiet. When Intel Pentium processors were first introduced, there was no need to have a fan on the CPU, however, contemporary CPUs cannot function even for several seconds without a cooling fan. As CPU densities increase, the heat transfer for nominal operation requires increased airflow, which causes more and more noise.
The type of fans commonly used in desktop computers are axial fans, and centrifugal blowers  in laptop computers. Several fan types are shown [http://www.etrinet.com/tech/pdf/aerodynamics.pdf here (pdf format)]. Different fan types have different characteristics of noise generation and performance. The axial flow fan is mainly considered in this page.

== Noise Generation Mechanisms ==
The figure below shows a typical noise spectrum of a 120 '''mm''' diameter electronic device cooling fan. One microphone was used at a point 1 '''m''' from the upstream side of the fan. The fan has 7 blades, 4 struts for motor mounting and operates at 13V. Certain amount of load is applied. The blue plot is background noise of anechoic chamber, and the green one is sound loudness spectrum when the fan is running.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Noisespectrum.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
(*BPF = Blade Passing Frequency)&lt;br&gt;
Each noise elements shown in this figure is caused by one or more of following generation mechanisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=== Blade Thickness Noise - Monopole (But very weak) ===
Blade thickness noise is generated by volume displacement of fluid. A fan blade has its thickness and volume. As the rotor rotates, the volume of each blade displaces fluid volume, then they consequently fluctuate pressure of near field, and noise is generated. This noise is tonal at the running frequency and generally very weak for cooling fans, because their RPM is relatively low. Therefore, thickness of fan blades hardly affects to electronic cooling fan noise. &lt;br&gt;(This kind of noise can become severe for high speed turbomachines like helicopter rotors.)

=== Tonal Noise by Aerodynamic Forces - Dipole ===
==== Uniform Inlet Flow (Negligible) ====
The sound generation due to uniform and steady aerodynamic force has a characteristic very similar to the blade thickness noise. It is very weak for low speed fans, and depends on fan RPM. Since some steady blade forces are necessary for a fan to do its duty even in an ideal condition, this kind of noise is impossible to avoid. It is known that this noise can be reduced by increasing the number of blades.

==== Non-uniform Inlet Flow ====
Non-uniform (still steady) inlet flow causes non-uniform aerodynamic forces on blades as their angular positions change. This generates noise at blade passing frequency and its harmonics. It is one of the major noise sources of electronic cooling fans.

==== Rotor-Casing interaction ====
If the fan blades are very close to a structure which is not symmetric, unsteady interaction forces to blades are generated. Then the fan experiences a similar running condition as lying in non-uniform flow field.
See [[Acoustics/Rotor Stator Interactions]] for details.

==== Impulsive Noise (Negligible) ====
This noise is caused by the interaction between a blade and blade-tip-vortex of the preceding blade, and not severe for cooling fans.
==== Rotating Stall ====
: [[w:Stall_%28flight%29|Click here]] to read the definition and an aerodynamic description of '''stall'''.
The noise due to stall is a complex phenomenon that occurs at low flow rates. For some reason, if flow is locally disturbed, it can cause stall on one of the blades.
As a result, the upstream passage on this blade is partially blocked. Therefore, the mean flow is diverted away from this passage. This causes increasing of the angle of attack on the closest blade at the upstream side of the originally stalled blade, the flow is again stalled there. On the other hand, the other side of the first blade is un-stalled because of reduction of flow angle.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Stall.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
repeatedly, the stall cell turns around the blades at about 30~50% of the running frequency, and the direction is opposite to the blades. This series of phenomenon causes unsteady blade forces, and consequently generates noise and vibrations.

==== Non-uniform Rotor Geometry ====
Asymmetry of rotor causes noise at the rotating frequency and its harmonics (not blade passing frequency obviously), even when the inlet flow is uniform and steady.

==== Unsteady Flow Field ====
Unsteady flow causes random forces on the blades. It spreads the discrete spectrum noises and makes them continuous. In case of low-frequency variation, the spread continuous spectral noise is around rotating frequency, and narrowband noise is generated. The stochastic velocity fluctuations of inlet flow generates broadband noise spectrum. The generation of random noise components is covered by the following sections.

=== Random Noise by Unsteady Aerodynamic Forces ===
==== Turbulent Boundary Layer ====
Even in the steady and uniform inlet flow, there exist random force fluctuations on the blades. That is from turbulent blade boundary layer. Some noise is generated for this reason, but dominant noise is produced by the boundary layer passing the blade trailing edge. The blade trailing edges scatter the non-propagating near-field pressure into a propagatable sound field. 


==== Incident Turbulent ====
Velocity fluctuations of the intake flow with a stochastic time history generate random forces on blades, and a broadband spectrum noise.


==== Vortex Shedding ====
For some reason, a vortex can separate from a blade. Then the circulating flow around the blade starts to be changed. This causes non-uniform forces on blades, and noises. A classical example for this phenomenon is [http://www.galleryoffluidmechanics.com/vortex/karman.htm 'Karman vortex street']. ([http://www2.icfd.co.jp/menu1/karmanvortex/karman.html some images and animations].)
Vortex shedding mechanism can occur in a laminar boundary layer of low speed fan and also in a turbulent boundary layer of high frequency fan.


==== Flow Separation ====
Flow separation causes stall explained above. This phenomenon can cause random noise, which spreads all the discrete spectrum noises, and turns the noise into broadband.

==== Tip Vortex ====
Since cooling fans are ducted axial flow machines, the annular gap between the blade tips and the casing is important parameter for noise generation. While rotating, there is another flow through the annular gap due to pressure difference between upstream and downstream of fan. Because of this flow, tip vortex is generated through the gap, and broadband noise increases as the annular gap gets bigger.

== Installation Effects ==
Once a fan is installed, even though the fan is well designed acoustically, unexpected noise problem can come up. It is called as installation effects, and two types are applicable to cooling fans.

=== Effect of Inlet Flow Conditions ===
A structure that affects the inlet flow of a fan causes installation effects. For example Hoppe &amp; Neise [3] showed that with and without a bellmouth nozzle at the inlet flange of 500'''mm''' fan can change the noise power by 50'''dB''' (This application is for much larger and noisier fan though).


=== Acoustic Loading Effect ===
This effect is shown on duct system applications. Some high performance graphic cards apply duct system for direct exhaustion.&lt;br&gt;
The sound power generated by a fan is not only a function of its impeller speed and operating condition, but also depends on the acoustic impedances of the duct systems connected to its inlet and outlet. Therefore, fan and duct system should be matched not only for aerodynamic noise reasons but also because of acoustic considerations.

== Closing Comment ==
Noise reduction of cooling fans has some restrictions:&lt;br&gt;
1. Active noise control is not economically effective. 80mm cooling fans are only 5~10 US dollars. It is only applicable for high-end electronic products.&lt;br&gt;
2. Restricting certain aerodynamic phenomenon for noise reduction can cause serious performance reduction of the fan. Increasing RPM of the fan is of course much more dominant factor for noise.&lt;br&gt;
Different stories of fan noise are introduced at some of the linked sites below like active RPM control or noise comparison of various bearings used in fans.
If blade passing noise is dominant, a muffler would be beneficial.

== Move/Merge ==

&quot;Preparing for an Employment Interview&quot;:
I think that this book should be merged with the [[Writing a Résumé]] book, and simultaneously moved to a better namespace, such as &quot;Getting A Job&quot;, or something like that. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:51, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

I think it was right to merge in the resume part. I am not so sure about the title though. The current title &quot;Find Employment&quot; is very descriptive, I like that.

== Offer ==

Hi there Whiteknight, that was fast! :) Nice.
I will send you an email.

:If you send me an email, make sure it has &quot;Wikibooks&quot; or something similar in the subject, or it is liable to be deleted as spam. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC)


Please note that I have stated adding information to this book project from:
Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH), 2006-07 Edition
http://www.bls.gov/oco/
This book is provided by the Department of Labor and everything in it is in the public domain, as seen here (bottom of page):
http://www.bls.gov/oco/oohinfo_faq.htm?/oco/home.htm#pub3
&quot;# May I reproduce material from the Occupational Outlook Handbook or Career Guide to Industries sites?
Material on these sites is in the public domain and, with appropriate credit, may be reproduced without permission.&quot;

== Information that might be added ==

We should look into good tips and advice around the web and other places to find material and best practices that we can write into the book. Here are some sources that deserves investigating.

[http://www.thetechjobber.com/2005/09/22/get-invited-to-a-job/ Get invited to the interview]

Books: What colour is you parashute?
This is the industry classic, it has a lot of good advice in it.
The advice as such is not proprietary and some of it can we rewritten.


Ideas for other topics in the book:
- How to use the various online services like Monster, Job.com etc.
Tricks and what to expect.
- How to use the different career companies.
- Tips and tricks and advice from more professionals.
- How to dress for sucess.
- Specifics for different industries, The Handbook has a lot of material on this.
I have not so far started adding this, but it might be a good idea.
- Statistics on salaries.
- How to negotiate wages.
- How to stay motivated during the job search.
- Advice on moving.

In the extension a book like this can easily border into self improvement.
Where does the line go between &quot;Dress well, dont swear...&quot; and pure self improvement advice.
Is self improvement something this book should do, or is it that a topic for a different book?

== Rearanging Content ==
I have taken the initiative (being bold) to rearrange content into chapters that seem more appropriate.  For example, in the &quot;your career&quot; chapter, there is/was a lot of info about finding prospects, which seems to make more sense to be in the finding prospects chapter...  Feel free to give feedback if I am on the wrong track.  But it seems that there is a lot of good content in this wikibook, it just isn't well organized yet. --[[User:Jacob Walker|Jacob Walker]] 00:00, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

== Disagreement about Audience ==
I think the note that this textbook is geared for the highschool level is too limiting.  I teach adults, and I find many of them really need this knowledge.   Unless someone is independently wealthy from an outside source, or an entrepreneur, then they will need to find employment. --[[User:Jacob Walker|Jacob Walker]] ([[User talk:Jacob Walker|talk]]) 04:58, 2 February 2008 (UTC)

==Physiology of vocal fold==

The human vocal fold is a set of lip-like tissues located inside the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx larynx], and is the source of sound for humans and many animals. 

The larynx is located at the top of the trachea. It is mainly composed of cartilages and muscles, and the largest cartilage, thyroid, is well known as the &quot;Adam's Apple.&quot;

The organ has two main functions; to act as the last protector of the airway, and to act as a sound source for voice. This page focuses on the latter function.

==Voice production==

Although the science behind sound production for a vocal fold is complex, it can be thought of as similar to a brass player's lips, or a whistle made out of grass. Basically, vocal folds (or lips or a pair of grass) make a constriction to the airflow, and as the air is forced through the narrow opening, the vocal folds oscillate. This causes a periodical change in the air pressure, which is perceived as sound. 

[http://www.entusa.com/normal_larynx.htm Vocal Folds Video]

When the airflow is introduced to the vocal folds, it forces open the two vocal folds which are nearly closed initially. Due to the stiffness of the folds, they will then try to close the opening again. And now the airflow will try to force the folds open etc... This creates an oscillation of the vocal folds, which in turn, as I stated above, creates sound. However, this is a damped oscillation, meaning it will eventually achieve an equilibrium position and stop oscillating. So how are we able to &quot;sustain&quot; sound?

As it will be shown later, the answer seems to be in the changing shape of vocal folds. In the opening and the closing stages of the oscillation, the vocal folds have different shapes. This affects the pressure in the opening, and creates the extra pressure needed to push the vocal folds open and sustain oscillation. This part is explained in more detail in the &quot;Model&quot; section.

This flow-induced oscillation, as with many fluid mechanics problems, is not an easy problem to model. Numerous attempts to model the oscillation of vocal folds have been made, ranging from a single mass-spring-damper system to finite element models. In this page I would like to use my single-mass model to explain the basic physics behind the oscillation of a vocal fold. 

Information on vocal fold models: [http://www.ncvs.org/ncvs/tutorials/voiceprod/tutorial/model.html National Center for Voice and Speech]

==Model==

[[image: Schematics.png|thumb|Figure 1: Schematics]]

The most simple way of simulating the motion of vocal folds is to use a single mass-spring-damper system as shown above. The mass represents one vocal fold, and the second vocal fold is assumed to be symmetry about the axis of symmetry. Position 3 represents a location immediately past the exit (end of the mass), and position 2 represents the glottis (the region between the two vocal folds). 

===The pressure force===

The major driving force behind the oscillation of vocal folds is the pressure in the glottis. The Bernoulli's equation from fluid mechanics states that: 

&lt;math&gt;P_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho U^2 + \rho gh = Constant&lt;/math&gt;  -----EQN 1

Neglecting potential difference and applying EQN 1 to positions 2 and 3 of Figure 1, 

&lt;math&gt;P_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho U_2^2 = P_3 + \frac{1}{2}\rho U_3^2&lt;/math&gt;  -----EQN 2

Note that the pressure and the velocity at position 3 cannot change. This makes the right hand side of EQN 2 constant. Observation of EQN 2 reveals that in order to have oscillating pressure at 2, we must have oscillation velocity at 2. The flow velocity inside the glottis can be studied through the theories of the orifice flow.

The constriction of airflow at the vocal folds is much like an orifice flow with one major difference: with vocal folds, the orifice profile is continuously changing. The orifice profile for the vocal folds can open or close, as well as change the shape of the opening. In Figure 1, the profile is converging, but in another stage of oscillation it takes a diverging shape. 

The orifice flow is described by Blevins as:

&lt;math&gt; U = C\frac{2(P_1 - P_3)}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;  -----EQN 3

Where the constant C is the orifice coefficient, governed by the shape and the opening size of the orifice. This number is determined experimentally, and it changes throughout the different stages of oscillation.

Solving equations 2 and 3, the pressure force throughout the glottal region can be determined.

===The Collision Force===

As the video of the vocal folds shows, vocal folds can completely close during oscillation. When this happens, the Bernoulli equation fails. Instead, the collision force becomes the dominating force. For this analysis, Hertz collision model was applied. 

&lt;math&gt; F_H = k_H delta^{3/2} (1 + b_H delta')&lt;/math&gt;  -----EQN 4

where

&lt;math&gt; k_H = \frac{4}{3} \frac{E}{1 - \mu_H^2} \sqrt{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Here delta is the penetration distance of the vocal fold past the line of symmetry. 

==Simulation of the model==

The pressure and the collision forces were inserted into the equation of motion, and the result was simulated. 

[[image: matlab.png|thumb|Figure 2: Area Opening and Volumetric Flow Rate]]

Figure 2 shows that an oscillating volumetric flow rate was achieved by passing a constant airflow through the vocal folds. When simulating the oscillation, it was found that the collision force limits the amplitude of oscillation rather than drive the oscillation. Which tells us that the pressure force is what allows the sustained oscillation to occur. 

==The acoustic output==

This model showed that the changing profile of glottal opening causes an oscillating volumetric flow rate through the vocal folds. This will in turn cause an oscillating pressure past the vocal folds. This method of producing sound is unusual, because in most other means of sound production, air is compressed periodically by a solid such as a speaker cone. 

Past the vocal folds, the produced sound enters the vocal tract. Basically this is the cavity in the mouth as well as the nasal cavity. These cavities act as acoustic filters, modifying the character of the sound. These are the characters that define the unique voice each person produces.

=Introduction=

Piezoelectricity from the Greek word &quot;piezo&quot; means pressure electricity.  Certain crystalline substances generate electric charges under mechanical stress and conversely experience a mechanical strain in the presence of an electric field.  The piezoelectric effect describes a situation where the transducing material senses input mechanical vibrations and produces a charge at the frequency of the vibration.  An AC voltage causes the piezoelectric material to vibrate in an oscillatory fashion at the same frequency as the input current.

Quartz is the best known single crystal material with piezoelectric properties.  Strong piezoelectric effects can be induced in materials with an ABO3, Perovskite crystalline structure.  'A' denotes a large divalent metal ion such as lead and 'B' denotes a smaller tetravalent ion such as titanium or zirconium.  

For any crystal to exhibit the piezoelectric effect, its structure must have no center of symmetry.  Either a tensile or compressive stress applied to the crystal alters the separation between positive and negative charge sights in the cell causing a net polarization at the surface of the crystal.  The polarization varies directly with the applied stress and is direction dependent so that compressive and tensile stresses will result in electric fields of opposite voltages.

=Vibrations &amp; Displacements=

Piezoelectric ceramics have non-centrosymmetric unit cells below the Curie temperature and centrosymmetric unit cells above the Curie temperature.  Non-centrosymmetric structures provide a net electric dipole moment.  The dipoles are randomly oriented until a strong DC electric field is applied causing permanent polarization and thus piezoelectric properties.

A polarized ceramic may be subjected to stress causing the crystal lattice to distort changing the total dipole moment of the ceramic.  The change in dipole moment due to an applied stress causes a net electric field which varies linearly with stress.

=Dynamic Performance=

The dynamic performance of a piezoelectric material relates to how it behaves under alternating stresses near the mechanical resonance. The parallel combination of C2 with L1, C1, and R1 in the equivalent circuit below control the transducers reactance which is a function of frequency.

==Equivalent Electric Circuit==

==Frequency Response==

The graph below shows the impedance of a piezoelectric transducer as a function of frequency.  The minimum value at fn corresponds to the resonance while the maximum value at fm corresponds to anti-resonance.
&lt;sup&gt;[[Superscript text]]''Italic text''&lt;/sup&gt;

=Resonant Devices=

Non resonant devices may be modeled by a capacitor representing the capacitance of the piezoelectric with an impedance modeling the mechanically vibrating system as a shunt in the circuit.  The impedance may be modeled as a capacitor in the non resonant case which allows the circuit to reduce to a single capacitor replacing the parallel combination.

For resonant devices the impedance becomes a resistance or static capacitance at resonance.  This is an undesirable effect.  In mechanically driven systems this effect acts as a load on the transducer and decreases the electrical output.  In electrically driven systems this effect shunts the driver requiring a larger input current.  The adverse effect of the static capacitance experienced at resonant operation may be counteracted by using a shunt or series inductor resonating with the static capacitance at the operating frequency.

=Applications=

==Mechanical Measurement==

Because of the dielectric leakage current of piezoelectrics they are poorly suited for applications where force or pressure have a slow rate of change.  They are, however, very well suited for highly dynamic measurements that might be needed in blast gauges and accelerometers.  

==Ultrasonic==

High intensity ultrasound applications utilize half wavelength transducers with resonant frequencies between 18 kHz and 45 kHz.  Large blocks of transducer material is needed to generate high intensities which is makes manufacturing difficult and is economically impractical.  Also, since half wavelength transducers have the highest stress amplitude in the center the end sections act as inert masses.  The end sections are often replaced with metal plates possessing a much higher mechanical quality factor giving the composite transducer a higher mechanical quality factor than a single-piece transducer.

The overall electro-acoustic efficiency is:

              Qm0 = unloaded mechanical quality factor
              QE  = electric quality factor
              QL  = quality factor due to the acoustic load alone

The second term on the right hand side is the dielectric loss and the third term is the mechanical loss.

Efficiency is maximized when:

The maximum ultrasonic efficiency is described by:

Applications of ultrasonic transducers include:
  Welding of plastics
  Atomization of liquids
  Ultrasonic drilling
  Ultrasonic cleaning
  Ultrasonic foils in the paper machine wet end for more uniform fibre distribution
  Ultrasound
  Non-destructive testing
  etc.

== General technique ==

# A microphone should be used whose frequency response will suit the frequency range of the voice or instrument being recorded.
# Vary microphone positions and distances until you achieve the monitored sound that you desire.
# In the case of poor room acoustics, place the microphone very close to the loudest part of the instrument being recorded or isolate the instrument.
# Personal taste is the most important component of microphone technique.  Whatever sounds right to you, ''is'' right.

== Types of microphones ==

=== Dynamic microphones ===

These are the most common general-purpose microphones.  They do not require power to operate.  If you have a microphone that is used for live performance, it is probably a dynamic mic.  

They have the advantage that they can withstand very high sound pressure levels (high volume) without damage or distortion, and tend to provide a richer, more intense sound than other types.  Traditionally, these mics did not provide as good a response on the highest frequencies (particularly above 10 kHz), but some recent models have come out that attempt to overcome this limitation.  

In the studio, dynamic mics are often used for high sound pressure level instruments such as drums, guitar amps and brass instruments.  Models that are often used in recording include the Shure SM57 and the Sennheiser MD421.

=== Condenser microphones ===

These microphones are often the most expensive microphones a studio owns.  They require power to operate, either from a battery or phantom power, provided using the mic cable from an external mixer or pre-amp.  These mics have a built-in pre-amplifier that uses the power.  Some vintage microphones have a tube amplifier, and are referred to as tube condensers.

While they cannot withstand the very high sound pressure levels that dynamic mics can, they provide a flatter frequency response, and often the best response at the highest frequencies.  Not as good at conveying intensity, they are much better at providing a balanced accurate sound.

Condenser mics come with a variety of sizes of transducers.  They are usually grouped into smaller format condensers, which often are long cylinders about the size of a nickel coin in diameter, and larger format condensers, the transducers of which are often about an inch in diameter or slightly larger.

In the studio, condenser mics are often used for instruments with a wide frequency range, such as an acoustic piano, acoustic guitar, voice, violin, cymbals, or an entire band or chorus.  On louder instruments they do not use close miking with condensers.  Models that are often used in recording include the Shure SM81 (small format), AKG C414 (large format) and Neumann U87 (large format).

=== Ribbon microphones ===

Ribbon microphones are often used as an alternative to condenser microphones.  Some modern ribbon microphones do not require power, and some do.  The first ribbon microphones, developed at RCA in the 1930s, required no power, were quite fragile and could be destroyed by just blowing air through them.  Modern ribbon mics are much more resiliant, and can be used with the same level of caution as condenser mics.

Ribbon microphones provide a warmer sound than a condenser mic, with a less brittle top end.  Some vocalists (including Paul McCartney) prefer them to condenser mics.  In the studio they are used on vocals, violins, and even drums.  Popular models for recording include the Royer R121 and the AEA R84.

== Working distance ==

=== Close miking ===

When miking at a distance of 1 inch to about 1 foot from the sound source, it is considered close miking.  This technique generally provides a tight, present sound quality and does an effective job of isolating the signal and excluding other sounds in the acoustic environment.

==== Bleed ====

Bleeding occurs when the signal is not properly isolated and the microphone picks up another nearby instrument.  This can make the mixdown process difficult if there are multiple voices on one track.  Use the following methods to prevent leakage:

* Place the microphones closer to the instruments.
* Move the instruments farther apart.
* Put some sort of acoustic barrier between the instruments.
* Use directional microphones.

==== A B miking ====

The A B miking distance rule (ratio 3 - 1) is a general rule of thumb for close miking.  To prevent phase anomalies and bleed, the microphones should be placed at least three times as far apart as the distance between the instrument and the microphone.

[[Image:Threetoone.gif|A B Miking]]

=== Distant miking ===

Distant miking refers to the placement of microphones at a distance of 3 feet or more from the sound source.  This technique allows the full range and balance of the instrument to develop and it captures the room sound.  This tends to add a live, open feeling to the recorded sound, but careful consideration needs to be given to the acoustic environment.

=== Accent miking ===

Accent miking is a technique used for solo passages when miking an ensemble.  A soloist needs to stand out from an ensemble, but placing a microphone too close will sound unnaturally present compared the distant miking technique used with the rest of the ensemble.  Therefore, the microphone should be placed just close enough to the soloist so that the signal can be mixed effectively without sounding completely excluded from the ensemble.

=== Ambient miking ===

Ambient miking is placing the microphones at such a distance that the room sound is more prominent than the direct signal.  This technique is used to capture audience sound or the natural reverberation of a room or concert hall.

== Stereo and surround technique ==

=== Stereo ===

Stereo miking is simply using two microphones to obtain a stereo left-right image of the sound.  A simple method is the use of a spaced pair, which is placing two identical microphones several feet apart and using the difference in time and amplitude to create the image.  Great care should be taken in the method as phase anomalies can occur due to the signal delay.  This risk of phase anomaly can be reduced by using the X/Y method, where the two microphones are placed with the grills as close together as possible without touching.  There should be an angle of 90 to 135 degrees between the mics.  This technique uses only amplitude, not time, to create the image, so the chance of phase discrepancies is unlikely.

[[Image:Spacedpair.gif|Spaced Pair]] [[Image:Xypair.gif|X/Y Method]]

=== Surround ===

To take advantage of 5.1 sound or some other surround setup, microphones may be placed to capture the surround sound of a room.  This technique essentially stems from stereo technique with the addition of more microphones.  Because every acoustic environment is different, it is difficult to define a general rule for surround miking, so placement becomes dependent on experimentation.  Careful attention must be paid to the distance between microphones and potential phase anomalies.

== Placement for varying instruments ==

=== Amplifiers ===

When miking an amplified speaker, such as for electric guitars, the mic should be placed 2 to 12 inches from the speaker.  Exact placement becomes more critical at a distance of less than 4 inches.  A brighter sound is achieved when the mic faces directly into the center of the speaker cone and a more mellow sound is produced when placed slightly off-center.  Placing off-center also reduces amplifier noise.

A bigger sound can often be achieved by using two mics.  The first mic should be a dynamic mic, placed as described in the previous paragraph.  Add to this a condenser mic placed at least 3 times further back (remember the 3:1 rule), which will pickup the blended sound of all speakers, as well as some room ambience.  Run the mics into separate channels and combine them to your taste.

=== Brass instruments ===

High sound-pressure levels are produced by brass instruments due to the directional characteristics of mid to mid-high frequencies.  Therefore, for brass instruments such as trumpets, trombones, and tubas, microphones should face slightly off of the bell's center at a distance of one foot or more to prevent overloading from wind blasts.

=== Guitars ===

Technique for acoustic guitars is dependent on the desired sound.  Placing a microphone close to the sound hole will achieve the highest output possible, but the sound may be bottom-heavy  because of how the sound hole resonates at low frequencies.  Placing the mic slightly off-center at 6 to 12 inches from the hole will provide a more balanced pickup.  Placing the mic closer to the bridge with the same working distance will ensure that the full range of the instrument is captured.

A technique that some engineers use places a large-format condenser mic 12-18 inches away from the 12th fret of the guitar, and a small-format condenser very close to the strings nearby.  Combining the two signals can produce a rich tone.

=== Pianos ===

Ideally, microphones would be placed 4 to 6 feet from the piano to allow the full range of the instrument to develop before it is captured.  This isn't always possible due to room noise, so the next best option is to place the microphone just inside the open lid.  This applies to both grand and upright pianos.

=== Percussion ===

One overhead microphone can be used for a drum set, although two are preferable.  If possible, each component of the drum set should be miked individually at a distance of 1 to 2 inches as if they were their own instrument.  This also applies to other drums such as congas and bongos.  For large, tuned instruments such as xylophones, multiple mics can be used as long as they are spaced according to the 3:1 rule.  Typically, dynamic mics are used for individual drum miking, while small-format condensers are used for the overheads.

=== Voice ===

Standard technique is to put the microphone directly in front of the vocalist's mouth, although placing slightly off-center can alleviate harsh consonant sounds (such as &quot;p&quot;) and prevent overloading due to excessive dynamic range.

=== Woodwinds ===

A general rule for woodwinds is to place the microphone around the middle of the instrument at a distance of 6 inches to 2 feet.  The microphone should be tilted slightly towards the bell or sound hole, but not directly in front of it.

== Sound Propagation ==

It is important to understand how sound propagates due to the nature of the acoustic environment so that microphone technique can be adjusted accordingly.  There are four basic ways that this occurs:

=== Reflection ===

Sound waves are reflected by surfaces if the object is as large as the wavelength of the sound.  It is the cause of echo (simple delay), reverberation (many reflections cause the sound to continue after the source has stopped), and standing waves (the distance between two parallel walls is such that the original and reflected waves in phase reinforce one another).

=== Absorption ===

Sound waves are absorbed by materials rather than reflected.  This can have both positive and negative effects depending on whether you desire to reduce reverberation or retain a live sound.

=== Diffraction ===

Objects that may be between sound sources and microphones must be considered due to diffraction.  Sound will be stopped by obstacles that are larger than its wavelength.  Therefore, higher frequencies will be blocked more easily than lower frequencies.

=== Refraction ===

Sound waves bend as they pass through mediums with varying density.  Wind or temperature changes can cause sound to seem like it is literally moving in a different direction than expected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A sealed or closed box baffle is the most basic but often the cleanest sounding sub-woofer box design.  The sub-woofer box in its most simple form, serves to isolate the back of the speaker from the front, much like the theoretical infinite baffle.  The sealed box provides simple construction and controlled response for most sub-woofer applications.  The slow low end roll-off provides a clean transition into the extreme frequency range.  Unlike ported boxes, the cone excursion is reduced below the resonant frequency of the box and driver due to the added stiffness provided by the sealed box baffle.

Closed baffle boxes are typically constructed of a very rigid material such as MDF (medium density fiber board) or plywood .75 to 1 inch thick.  Depending on the size of the box and material used, internal bracing may be necessary to maintain a rigid box.  A rigid box is important to design in order to prevent unwanted box resonance. 

As with any acoustics application, the box must be matched to the loudspeaker driver for maximum performance.  The following will outline the procedure to tune the box or maximize the output of the sub-woofer box and driver combination.  

==Closed baffle circuit==
The sealed box enclosure for sub-woofers can be modeled as a lumped element system if the dimensions of the box are significantly shorter than the shortest wavelength reproduced by the sub-woofer.  Most sub-woofer applications are crossed over around 80 to 100 Hz.  A 100 Hz wave in air has a wavelength of about 11 feet.  Sub-woofers typically have all dimensions much shorter than this wavelength, thus the lumped element system analysis is accurate.  Using this analysis, the following circuit represents a sub-woofer enclosure system.

[[Image:Circuit.jpg|center]]

where all of the following parameters are in the mechanical mobility analog

: V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; - voltage supply
: R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; - electrical resistance
: M&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; - driver mass
: C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; - driver compliance
: R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; - resistance
: R&lt;sub&gt;Ar&lt;/sub&gt; - rear cone radiation resistance into the air 
: X&lt;sub&gt;Af&lt;/sub&gt; - front cone radiation reactance into the air
: R&lt;sub&gt;Br&lt;/sub&gt; - rear cone radiation resistance into the box 
: X&lt;sub&gt;Br&lt;/sub&gt; - rear cone radiation reactance into the box

== Driver parameters==
In order to tune a sealed box to a driver, the driver parameters must be known.  Some of the parameters are provided by the manufacturer, some are found experimentally, and some are found from general tables.  For ease of calculations, all parameters will be represented in the SI units meter/kilogram/second.  The parameters that must be known to determine the size of the box are as follows:

: f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - driver free-air resonance
: C&lt;sub&gt;MS&lt;/sub&gt; - mechanical compliance of the driver
: S&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; - effective area of the driver

==== Resonance of the driver ====
The resonance of the driver is usually either provided by the manufacturer or must be found experimentally.  It is a good idea to measure the resonance frequency even if it is provided by the manufacturer to account for inconsistent manufacturing processes.

The following diagram shows verga and  the setup for finding resonance:

&lt;!--[[Image:Frequency.jpg|center]]--&gt;

Where voltage V1 is held constant and the variable frequency source is varied until V2 is a maximum.  The frequency where V2 is a maximum is the resonance frequency for the driver.

==== Mechanical compliance ====
By definition compliance is the inverse of stiffness or what is commonly referred to as the spring constant.  The compliance of a driver can be found by measuring the displacement of the cone when known masses are place on the cone when the driver is facing up.  The compliance would then be the displacement of the cone in meters divided by the added weight in newtons.  

====Effective area of the driver====
The physical diameter of the driver does not lead to the effective area of the driver.  The effective diameter can be found using the following diagram:

[[Image:Effective area.jpg|center]]

From this diameter, the area is found from the basic area of a circle equation.

==Acoustic compliance==
From the known mechanical compliance of the cone, the acoustic compliance can be found from the following equation:

C&lt;sub&gt;AS&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;MS&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

From the driver acoustic compliance, the box acoustic compliance is found.  This is where the final application of the sub-woofer is considered.  The acoustic compliance of the box will determine the percent shift upwards of the resonant frequency.  If a large shift is desire for high SPL applications, then a large ratio of driver to box acoustic compliance would be required.  If a more flattened response is desire for high fidelity applications, then a lower ratio of driver to box acoustic compliance would be required.  Specifically, the ratios can be found in the following figure using line (b) as reference.

C&lt;sub&gt;AS&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;*r

r - driver to box acoustic compliant ratio

[[Image:Compliance.jpg|center]]

==Sealed box design==

====Volume of box====
The volume of the sealed box can now be found from the box acoustic compliance.  The following equation is used to calculate the box volume

V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;= C&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gam

====Box dimensions====
From the calculated box volume, the dimensions of the box can then be designed.  There is no set formula for finding the dimensions of the box, but there are general guidelines to be followed.  If the driver was mounted in the center of a square face, the waves generated by the cone would reach the edges of the box at the same time, thus when combined would create a strong diffracted wave in the listening space.  In order to best prevent this, the driver should be either be mounted offset of a square face, or the face should be rectangular.

The face  of the box which the driver is set in should not be a square.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Acoustics basic room acoustic treatments.JPG|center]]

==Introduction==
Many people use one or two rooms in their living space as &quot;theatrical&quot; rooms where theater or music room activities commence.  It is a common misconception that adding speakers to the room will enhance the quality of the room acoustics.  There are other simple things that can be done to increase the room's acoustics to produce sound that is similar to &quot;theater&quot; sound.  This site will take you through some simple background knowledge on acoustics and then explain some solutions that will help improve sound quality in a room.

==Room sound combinations==
The sound you hear in a room is a combination of direct sound and indirect sound.  Direct sound will come directly from your speakers while the other sound you hear is reflected off of various objects in the room.

[[Image:sound_lady.jpg]]

The Direct sound is coming right out of the TV to the listener, as you can see with the heavy black arrow.  All of the other sound is reflected off surfaces before they reach the listener.

==Good and bad reflected sound==
Have you ever listened to speakers outside?  You might have noticed that the sound is thin and dull.  This occurs because when sound is reflected, it is fuller and louder than it would if it were in an open space. So when sound is reflected, it can add a fullness, or spaciousness.  The bad part of reflected sound occurs when the reflections amplify some notes, while cancelling out others, making the sound distorted.  It can also affect tonal quality and create an echo-like effect.  There are three types of reflected sound, pure reflection, absorption, and diffusion.  Each reflection type is important in creating a &quot;theater&quot; type acoustic room.

[[Image:sound.jpg]]

===Reflected sound===
Reflected sound waves, good and bad, affect the sound you hear, where it comes from, and the quality of the sound when it gets to you.  The bad news when it comes to reflected sound is [[standing waves]].

These waves are created when sound is reflected back and forth between any two parallel surfaces in your room, ceiling and floor or wall to wall.

Standing waves can distort noises 300Hz and down.  These noises include the lower mid frequency and bass ranges.  Standing waves tend to collect near the walls and in corners of a room, these collecting standing waves are called room resonance modes.

====Finding your room resonance modes====
First, specify room dimensions (length, width, and height).
'''Then follow this example:'''

[[Image:equationandexample.jpg]][[Image:resmodelpic.jpg]][[Image:exampletable.jpg]]

====Working with room resonance modes to increase sound quality====

=====There are some room dimensions that produce the largest amount of standing waves.=====  

# Cube  
# Room with 2 out of the three dimensions equal
# Rooms with dimensions that are multiples of each other

=====Move chairs or sofas away from the walls or corners to reduce standing wave effects=====

===Absorbed===
The sound that humans hear is actually a form of acoustic energy. Different materials absorb different amounts of this energy at different frequencies.  When considering room acoustics, there should be a good mix of high frequency absorbing materials and low frequency absorbing materials.  A table including information on how different common household absorb sound can be found [http://www.crutchfield.com/learn/learningcenter/home/speakers_roomacoustics.html  here].

===Diffused sound===
Using devices that diffuse sound is a fairly new way of increasing acoustic performance in a room.  It is a means to create sound that appears to be &quot;live&quot;.  They can replace echo-like reflections without absorbing too much sound.  

Some ways of determining where diffusive items should be placed were found on this [http://www.crutchfieldadvisor.com/S-hpU9sw2hgbG/learningcenter/home/speakers_roomacoustics.html?page=4: website].

# If you have carpet or drapes already in your room, use diffusion to control side wall reflections.
# A bookcase filled with odd-sized books makes an effective diffuser. 
# Use absorptive material on room surfaces between your listening position and your front speakers, and treat the back wall with diffusive material to re-distribute the reflections.

==How to find overall trouble spots in a room==
Every surface in a room does not have to be treated in order to have good room acoustics.  Here is a simple method of finding trouble spots in a room.

# Grab a friend to hold a mirror along the wall near a certain speaker at speaker height.
# The listener sits in a spot of normal viewing.
# The friend then moves slowly toward the listening position (stay along the wall).
# Mark each spot on the wall where the listener can see any of the room speakers in the mirror.
# Congratulations!  These are the trouble spots in the room that need an absorptive material in place.  Don't forget that diffusive material can also be placed in those positions.

[[Image:Sonic_boom_050817-N-3488C-151.jpg|thumb|Warplane passing the sound barrier.]]

A '''sonic boom''' is the audible component of a shock wave in air. The term is commonly used to refer to the air shocks caused by the supersonic flight of military aircraft or passenger transports such as Concorde (Mach 2.2, no longer flying) and the Space Shuttle (Mach 27). Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy, sounding much like an explosion; typically the shock front may approach 100 megawatts per square meter, and may exceed 200 decibels.

[[File:FA-18 Hornet breaking sound barrier (7 July 1999) - filtered.jpg|thumb|200px|When an aircraft is near the sound barrier, an unusual cloud sometimes forms in its wake. A Prandtl-Glauert Singularity results from a drop in pressure, due to shock wave formation.  This pressure change causes a sharp drop in temperature, which in humid conditions leads the water vapor in the air to condense into droplets and form the cloud.]]

== Cause of sonic booms ==

As an object moves through the air it creates a series of pressure waves in front and behind it, similar to the bow and stern waves created by a boat. These waves travel at the speed of sound, and as the speed of the aircraft increases the waves are forced together or 'compressed' because they cannot &quot;get out of the way&quot; of each other, eventually merging into a single shock wave at the speed of sound. This critical speed is known as Mach 1 and is approximately 1,225 km/h (761 mph) at sea level.

In smooth flight, the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail. There is a sudden drop in pressure at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, where it suddenly returns to normal. This &quot;overpressure profile&quot; is known as the N-wave due to its shape. We experience the &quot;boom&quot; when there is a sudden drop in pressure, so the N-wave causes two booms, one when the initial pressure rise from the nose hits, and another when the tail passes and the pressure suddenly returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive &quot;double boom&quot; from supersonic aircraft. When maneuvering the pressure; distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape. Since the boom is being generated continually as long as the aircraft is supersonic, it traces out a path on the ground following the aircraft's flight path, known as the '''boom carpet'''.

A sonic boom or &quot;tunnel boom&quot; can also be caused by high-speed trains in tunnels (e.g. the Japanese Shinkansen). In order to reduce the sonic boom effect, a special shape of the train car and a widened opening of the tunnel entrance is necessary. When a high speed train enters a tunnel, the sonic boom effect occurs at the tunnel exit. In contrast to the (super)sonic boom of an aircraft, this &quot;tunnel boom&quot; is caused by a rapid change of subsonic flow (due to the sudden narrowing of the surrounding space) rather than by a shock wave. In close range to the tunnel exit this phenomenon can causes disturbances to residents.

== Characteristics ==

The power, or volume, of the shock wave is dependent on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and weight of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shocks grow &quot;tighter&quot; around the craft, and do not become much &quot;louder&quot;. At very high speeds and altitudes the cone does not intersect the ground, and no boom will be heard. The &quot;length&quot; of the boom from front to back is dependent on the length of the aircraft, although to a factor of 3:2 not 1:1. Longer aircraft therefore &quot;spread out&quot; their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.

The nose shockwave compresses and pulls the air along with the aircraft so that the aircraft behind its shockwave sees subsonic airflow.

However, this means that several smaller shock waves can, and usually do, form at other points on the aircraft, primarily any convex points or curves, the leading wing edge and especially the inlet to engines. These secondary shockwaves are caused by the subsonic air behind the main shockwave being forced to go supersonic again by the shape of the aircraft (for example due to the air's acceleration over the top of a curved wing).

The later shock waves are somehow faster than the first one, travel faster and add to the main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined N-wave shape. This maximizes both the magnitude and the &quot;rise time&quot; of the shock, which makes it seem louder. On most designs the characteristic distance is about 40,000ft, meaning that below this altitude the sonic boom will be &quot;softer&quot;. However the drag at this altitude or below makes supersonic travel particularly inefficient, which poses a serious problem.

== Abatement ==

In the late 1950s when SST designs were being actively pursued, it was thought that although the boom would be very large, they could avoid problems by flying higher. This premise was proven false when the North American B-70 ''Valkyrie'' started flying and it was found that the boom was a very real problem even at 70,000ft (21,000m). It was during these tests that the N-wave was first characterized.

Richard Seebass and his colleague Albert George at Cornell University studied the problem extensively, and eventually defined a &quot;figure of merit&quot;, '''FM''', to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft. FM is proportional to the aircraft weight divided by the three-halves of the aircraft length, FM = W/(3/2&amp;middot;L) = 2W/3L. The lower this value, the less boom the aircraft generates, with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable. Using this calculation they found FM's of about 1.4 for Concorde, and 1.9 for the Boeing 2707. This eventually doomed most SST projects as public resentment, somewhat blown out of proportion, mixed with politics eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft impractical (flying only over water for instance).

Seebass-George also worked on the problem from another angle, examining ways to reduce the &quot;peaks&quot; of the N-wave and therefore smooth out the shock into something less annoying. Their theory suggested that body shaping might be able to use the secondary shocks to either &quot;spread out&quot; the N-wave, or interfere with each other to the same end. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from 40,000ft to 60,000, which is where most SST designs fly. The design required some fairly sophisticated shaping in order to achieve the dual needs of reducing the shock and still leaving an aerodynamically efficient shape, and therefore had to wait for the advent of computer-aided design before being able to be built.

This remained untested for decades, until DARPA started the '''Quiet Supersonic Platform''' project and funded the '''Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration''' aircraft to test it. SSBD used a F-5 Freedom Fighter modified with a new body shape, and was tested over a two year period in what has become the most extensive study on the sonic boom to date. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a chase plane, the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third. Although one-third is not a huge reduction, it could reduce Concorde below the FM = 1 limit for instance.

There are theoretical designs that do not appear to create sonic booms at all, such as the Busemann's Biplane. Nobody has been able to suggest a practical implementation of this concept, as yet.

== Perception and noise ==

The sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double &quot;boom&quot; as the aircraft is usually some distance away. However, as those who have witnessed landings of space shuttles have heard, when the aircraft is nearby the sonic boom is a sharper &quot;bang&quot; or &quot;crack&quot;. The sound is much like the &quot;aerial bombs&quot; used at firework displays.

In 1964, NASA and the FAA began the Oklahoma City sonic boom tests, which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months.  Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a class action lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.

In late October 2005, Israel began using nighttime sonic boom raids against civilian populations in the Gaza Strip [http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1607450,00.html] as a method of psychological warfare.  The practice was condemned by the United Nations.  A senior Israeli army intelligence source said the tactic was intended to break civilian support for armed Palestinian groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''SONAR''' ('''so'''und '''n'''avigation '''a'''nd '''r'''anging) is a technique that uses sound propagation under water to navigate or to detect other vessels. There are two kinds of sonar: active and passive.  

== History ==

The French physicist Paul Langevin, working with a Russian émigré electrical engineer, Constantin Chilowski, invented the first active sonar-type device for detecting submarines in 1915.  Although piezoelectric transducers later superseded the electrostatic transducers they used, their work influenced the future of sonar designs. In 1916, under the British Board of Inventions and Research, Canadian physicist Robert Boyle took on the project, which subsequently passed to the '''Anti-''' (or '''Allied''') '''Submarine Detection Investigation Committee''', producing a prototype for testing in mid-1917, hence the British acronym '''ASDIC'''.

By 1918, both the U.S. and Britain had built active systems. The UK tested what they still called ASDIC on ''HMS Antrim'' in 1920, and started production of units in 1922.  The 6th Destroyer Flotilla had ASDIC-equipped vessels in 1923.  An anti-submarine school, ''HMS Osprey'', and a training flotilla of four vessels were established on Portland in 1924.

The U.S. Sonar QB set arrived in 1931. By the outbreak of World War II, the Royal Navy had five sets for different surface ship classes, and others for submarines. The greatest advantage came when it was linked to the Squid anti-submarine weapon.

== Active sonar ==
Active sonar creates a pulse of sound, often called a &quot;ping&quot;, and then listens for reflections of the pulse.  To measure the distance to an object, one measures the time from emission of a pulse to reception.  To measure the bearing, one uses several hydrophones, and measures the relative arrival time to each in a process called beamforming.

The pulse may be at constant frequency or a chirp of changing frequency.  For a chirp, the receiver correlates the frequency of the reflections to the known chirp. The resultant processing gain allows the receiver to derive the same information as if a much shorter pulse of the same total energy were emitted.  In practice, the chirp signal is sent over a longer time interval; therefore the instantaneous emitted power will be reduced, which simplifies the design of the transmitter.  In general, long-distance active sonars use lower frequencies.  The lowest have a bass &quot;BAH-WONG&quot; sound.  

The most useful small sonar looks roughly like a waterproof flashlight.  One points the head into the water, presses a button, and reads a distance.  Another variant is a &quot;fishfinder&quot; that shows a small display with shoals of fish.  Some civilian sonars approach active military sonars in capability, with quite exotic three-dimensional displays of the area near the boat.  However, these sonars are not designed for stealth.

When active sonar is used to measure the distance to the bottom, it is known as echo sounding.

Active sonar is also used to measure distance through water between two sonar transponders. A transponder is a device that can transmit and receive signals but when it receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transponder transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transponder's reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two transponders. This technique, when used with multiple transponders, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.

===Analysis of active sonar data===

Active sonar data is obtained by measuring detected sound for a short period of time after the issuing of a ping; this time period is selected so as to ensure that the ping's reflection will be detected.  The distance to the seabed (or other acoustically reflective object) can be calculated from the elapsed time between the ping and the detection of its reflection.  Other properties can also be detected from the shape of the ping's reflection:
* When collecting data on the seabed, some of the reflected sound will typically reflect off the air-water interface, and then reflect off the seabed a second time.  The size of this second echo provides information about the acoustic hardness of the seabed.
* The roughness of a seabed affects the variance in reflection time.  For a smooth seabed, all of the reflected sound will take much the same path, resulting in a sharp spike in the data.  For a rougher seabed, sound will be reflected back over a larger area of seabed, and some sound may bounce between seabed features before reflecting to the surface. A less sharp spike in the data therefore indicates a rougher seabed.

=== Sonar and marine animals ===
Some marine animals, such as whales and dolphins, use echolocation systems similar to active sonar to locate predators and prey.  It is feared that sonar transmitters could confuse these animals and cause them to lose their way, perhaps preventing them from feeding and mating.  A recent article on the BBC Web site (see below) reports findings published in the journal ''Nature'' to the effect that military sonar may be inducing some whales to experience decompression sickness (and resultant beachings).

High-powered sonar transmitters may indirectly harm marine animals, although scientific evidence suggests that a confluence of factors must first be present.  In the Bahamas in 2000, a trial by the United States Navy of a 230 decibel transmitter in the frequency range 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 7 kHz resulted in the beaching of sixteen whales, seven of which were found dead.  The Navy accepted blame in a report published in the Boston Globe on 1 January, 2002.  However, at low powers, sonar can protect marine mammals against collisions with ships.

A kind of sonar called mid-frequency sonar has been correlated with mass cetacean strandings throughout the world’s oceans, and has therefore been singled out by environmentalists as causing the death of marine mammals.  International press coverage of these events can be found at this [http://www.anon.org/lfas_news.jsp active sonar news clipping] Web site.  A lawsuit was filed in Santa Monica, California on 19 October, 2005 contending that the U.S. Navy has conducted sonar exercises in violation of several environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act.  
== Passive sonar ==
Passive sonar listens without transmitting.  It is usually employed in military settings, although a few are used in science applications.

=== Speed of sound ===
Sonar operation is affected by sound speed. Sound speed is  slower in fresh water than in sea water.  In all water sound velocity is affected by density (or the mass per unit of volume).  Density is affected by temperature, dissolved molecules (usually salinity), and pressure.  The speed of sound (in feet per second) is approximately equal to 4388 + (11.25 &amp;times; temperature (in &amp;deg;F)) + (0.0182 &amp;times; depth (in feet) + salinity (in parts-per-thousand)).  This is an empirically derived approximation equation that is reasonably accurate for normal temperatures, concentrations of salinity and the range of most ocean depths.  Ocean temperature varies with depth, but at between 30 and 100 metres there is often a marked change, called the thermocline, dividing the warmer surface water from the cold, still waters that make up the rest of the ocean. This can frustrate sonar, for a sound originating on one side of the thermocline tends to be bent, or refracted, off the thermocline. The thermocline may be present in shallower coastal waters, however, wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the thermocline. Water pressure also affects sound propagation. Increased pressure increases the density of the water and raises the sound velocity. Increases in sound velocity cause the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher velocity. The mathematical model of refraction is called Snell's law.

Sound waves that are radiated down into the ocean bend back up to the surface in great arcs due to the effect of pressure on sound. The ocean must be at least 6000 feet (1850 meters) deep, or the sound waves will echo off the bottom instead of refracting back upwards.  Under the right conditions these waves will then be focused near the surface and refracted back down and repeat another arc. Each arc is called a convergence zone. Where an arc intersects the surface a CZ annulus is formed. The diameter of the CZ depends on the temperature and salinity of the water.  In the North Atlantic, for example, CZs are found approximately every 33 nautical miles (61 km), depending on the season, forming a pattern of concentric circles around the sound source. Sounds that can be detected for only a few miles in a direct line can therefore also be detected hundreds of miles away. Typically the first, second and third CZ are fairly useful; further out than that the signal is too weak, and thermal conditions are too unstable, reducing the reliability of the signals. The signal is naturally attenuated by distance, but modern sonar systems are very sensitive.

=== Identifying sound sources ===
Military sonar has a wide variety of techniques for identifying a detected sound. For example, U.S. vessels usually operate 60 Hz alternating current power systems. If transformers are mounted without proper vibration insulation from the hull, or flooded, the 60 Hz sound from the windings and generators can be emitted from the submarine or ship, helping to identify its nationality.  In contrast, most European submarines have 50 Hz power systems.  Intermittent noises (such as a wrench being dropped) may also be detectable to sonar.

Passive sonar systems may have large sonic databases, however most classification is performed manually by the sonar operator.  A computer system frequently uses these databases to identify classes of ships, actions (i.e., the speed of a ship, or the type of weapon released), and even particular ships. Publications for classification of sounds are provided by and continually updated by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence.

===Sonar in warfare===

Modern naval warfare makes extensive use of sonar. The two types described before are both used, but from different platforms, i.e., types of water-borne vessels.

Active sonar is extremely useful, since it gives the exact position of an object.  Active sonar works the same way as radar: a signal is emitted.  The sound wave then travels in many directions from the emitting object. When it hits an object, the sound wave is then reflected in many other directions. Some of the energy will travel back to the emitting source. The echo will enable the sonar system or technician to calculate, with many factors such as the frequency, the energy of the received signal, the depth, the water temperature, etc., the position of the reflecting object.  Using active sonar is somewhat hazardous however, since it does not allow the sonar to identify the target, and any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the type of sonar (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave's energy).  Moreover, active sonar, similar to radar, allows the user to detect objects at a certain range but also enables other platforms to detect the active sonar at a far greater range.

Since active sonar does not allow an exact identification and is very noisy, this type of detection is used by fast platforms (planes, helicopters) and by noisy platforms (most surface ships) but rarely by submarines. When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines, it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods, to reduce the risk of detection by an enemy's passive sonar. As such, active sonar is normally considered a backup to passive sonar. In aircraft, active sonar is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft's patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts.

Passive sonar has fewer drawbacks. Most importantly, it is silent. Generally, it has a much greater range than active sonar, and allows an identification of the target.  Since any motorized object makes some noise, it may be detected eventually.  It simply depends on the amount of noise emitted and the amount of noise in the area, as well as the technology used.  To simplify, passive sonar &quot;sees&quot; around the ship using it.  On a submarine, the nose mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270°, centered on the ship's alignment, the hull-mounted array of about 160° on each side, and the towed array of a full 360°. The no-see areas are due to the ship's own interference.  Once a signal is detected in a certain direction (which means that something makes sound in that direction, this is called broadband detection) it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received (narrowband analysis).  This is generally done using a Fourier transform to show the different frequencies making up the sound. Since every engine makes a specific noise, it is easy to identify the object.

Another use of the passive sonar is to determine the target's trajectory. This process is called Target Motion Analysis (TMA), and the resultant &quot;solution&quot; is the target's range, course, and speed. TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times, and comparing the motion with that of the operator's own ship. Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases.

Passive sonar is stealthy and very useful. However, it requires high-tech components (band pass filters, receivers) and is costly. It is generally deployed on expensive ships in the form of arrays to enhance the detection.  Surface ships use it to good effect; it is even better used by submarines, and it is also used by airplanes and helicopters, mostly to a &quot;surprise effect&quot;, since submarines can hide under thermal layers.  If a submarine captain believes he is alone, he may bring his boat closer to the surface and be easier to detect, or go deeper and faster, and thus make more sound.

In the United States Navy, a special badge known as the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System Badge is awarded to those who have been trained and qualified in sonar operation and warfare.

In World War II, the Americans used the term '''SONAR''' for their system. The British still called their system '''ASDIC'''.  In 1948, with the formation of NATO, standardization of signals led to the dropping of ASDIC in favor of sonar.

&lt;!--[[image:ath-soundpressure.png|thumb|200px|right|Fig. 1: A typical ATH curve]]--&gt;
[[image:FletcherMunson_ELC.svg|thumb|350px|right|Fig. 1: The Fletcher-Munson equal-loudness contours.  The lowest of the curves is the ATH.]]

The '''threshold of hearing''' is the Sound pressure level SPL of 20 µPa (micropascals) = 2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; pascal (Pa). This low threshold of amplitude (strength or sound pressure level) is frequency dependent. See the frequency curve in Fig. 2 below

The '''absolute threshold of hearing''' (ATH) is the minimum amplitude (level or strength) of a pure tone that the average ear with normal hearing can hear in a noiseless environment.

The '''threshold of pain''' is the SPL beyond which sound becomes unbearable for a human listener.  This threshold varies only slightly with frequency. Prolonged exposure to sound pressure levels in excess of the threshold of pain can cause physical damage, potentially leading to hearing impairment.

Different values for the threshold of pain:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|colspan=&quot;3&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | '''Threshold of pain'''

| 134    dBSPL || '''100 Pa'''
|-
| '''137.5 dBSPL''' || 150 Pa
|-
| 140    dBSPL|| 200 Pa
|}

The '''Threshold of hearing''' is frequency dependent, and typically shows a minimum (indicating the ear's maximum sensitivity) at frequencies between 1 kHz and 5 kHz.  A typical ATH curve is pictured in Fig. 1.  The absolute threshold of hearing represents the lowest curve amongst the set of equal-loudness contours, with the highest curve representing the threshold of pain.

In psychoacoustic audio compression, the ATH is used, often in combination with masking curves, to calculate which spectral components are inaudible and may thus be ignored in the coding process; any part of an audio spectrum which has an amplitude (level or strength) below the ATH may be removed from an audio signal without any audible change to the signal.

The ATH curve rises with age as the human ear becomes more insensitive to sound, with the greatest changes occurring at frequencies higher than 2 kHz.  Curves for subjects of various age groups are illustrated in Fig. 2.  The data is from the United States ''Occupational Health and Environment Control, Standard Number:1910.95 App F''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Unknown artist, unknown album ==

Some have complained of lots of songs having unknown artist and unknown album. That problem has been tentatively tracked down to a [[Wikipedia:Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cable that truncates the files. Since the [[Wikipedia:ID3|ID3]] tags are at the end of the files, those could easily be missing if the last 1Kb of the file is truncated. Try another cable, and see if that fixes the problem.

The purpose of the acoustic transducer is to convert electrical energy into acoustic energy. Many variations of acoustic transducers exist, although the most common is the moving coil-permanent magnet transducer. The classic loudspeaker is of the moving coil-permanent magnet type.

The classic electrodynamic loudspeaker driver can be divided into three key components:

# The Magnet Motor Drive System
# The Loudspeaker Cone System
# The Loudspeaker Suspension

[[Image:loud_speaker.gif|thumb|center|Figure 1 Cut-away of a moving coil-permanent magnet loudspeaker]]

==The Magnet Motor Drive System==
The main purpose of the Magnet Motor Drive System is to establish a symmetrical magnetic field in which the voice coil will operate.  The Magnet Motor Drive System is comprised of a front focusing plate, permanent magnet, back plate, and a pole piece.  In figure 2, the assembled drive system is illustrated.  In most cases, the back plate and the pole piece are built into one piece called the yoke.  The yoke and the front focusing plate are normally made of a very soft cast iron.  Iron is a material that is used in conjunction with magnetic structures because the iron is easily saturated when exposed to a magnetic field. Notice in figure 2, that an air gap was intentionally left between the front focusing plate and the yoke. The magnetic field is coupled through the air gap. The magnetic field strength (B) of the air gap is typically optimized for uniformity across the gap. [1]

&lt;center&gt;Figure 2 Permanent Magnet Structure&lt;/center&gt;

When a coil of wire with a current flowing is placed inside the permanent magnetic field, a force is produced. B is the magnetic field strength, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the coil, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the current flowing through the coil. The electro-magnetic force is given by the expression of Laplace :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;d\underline F  = I\underline {dl}  \times \underline B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\underline B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\underline {dl}&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal, so the force is obtained by integration on the length of the wire (Re is the radius of a spire, n is the number of spires and &lt;math&gt;\underline e_x&lt;/math&gt; is on the axis of the coil):

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\underline F  = 2\pi R_eBnI\underline e_x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This force is directly proportional to the current flowing through the coil.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Magnet2.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 3 Voice Coil Mounted in Permanent Magnetic Structure&lt;/center&gt;

The coil is excited with the AC signal that is intended for sound reproduction, when the changing magnetic field of the coil interacts with the permanent magnetic field then the coil moves back and forth in order to reproduce the input signal.  The coil of a loudspeaker is known as the voice coil.

==The loudspeaker cone system==

On a typical loudspeaker, the cone serves the purpose of creating a larger radiating area allowing more air to be moved when excited by the voice coil.  The cone serves a piston that is excited by the voice coil. The cone then displaces air creating a sound wave.  In an ideal environment, the cone should be infinitely rigid and have zero mass, but in reality neither is true.  Cone materials vary from carbon fiber, paper, bamboo, and just about any other material that can be shaped into a stiff conical shape.  The loudspeaker cone is a very critical part of the loudspeaker. Since the cone is not infinitely rigid, it tends to have different types of resonance modes form at different frequencies, which in turn alters and colors the reproduction of the sound waves. The shape of the cone directly influences the directivity and frequency response of the loudspeaker.  When the cone is attached to the voice coil, a large gap above the voice coil is left exposed.  This could be a problem if foreign particles make their way into the air gap of the voice coil and the permanent magnet structure.  The solution to this problem is to place what is known as a dust cap on the cone to cover the air gap. Below a figure of the cone and dust cap are shown.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:loud_cone.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 6 Cone and Dust Cap attached to Voice Coil&lt;/center&gt;

The speed of the cone can be expressed with an equation of a mass-spring system with a damping coefficient \xi :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;m\frac{{dv}}{{dt}} + \xi v + k\int {vdt}  = Bli&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The current intensity i and the speed v can also be related by this equation (U is the voltage, R the electrical resistance and &lt;math&gt;L_b&lt;/math&gt; the inductance) :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;L_b \frac{{di}}{{dt}} + Ri = U - Blv&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

By using a harmonic solution, the expression of the speed is :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{{Bli}}{{\xi  + j(m\omega  - \frac{k}{\omega })}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The electrical impedance can be determined as the ratio of the voltage on the current intensity :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{U}{i} = R + jL\omega  + \frac{{B^2 l^2 }}{{\xi  + j(m\omega  - \frac{k}{\omega })}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The frequency response of the loudspeaker can be ploted.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Electreson.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 7 Electrical impedance&lt;/center&gt;

A phenomena of electrical resonance is observable around the frequency of 100 Hz. Besides, the inductance of the coil makes the impedance increase from the frequency of 400 Hz. So the range of frequency where the loudspeaker is used is 100 - 4000 Hz

==The loudspeaker suspension==
Most moving coil loudspeakers have a two piece suspension system, also known as a flexure system.  The combination of the two flexures allows the voice coil to maintain linear travel as the voice coil is energized and provide a restoring force for the voice coil system. The two piece system consists of large flexible membrane surrounding the outside edge of the cone, called the surround, and an additional flexure connected directly to the voice coil, called the spider.  The surround has another purpose and that is to seal the loudspeaker when mounted in an enclosure.  Commonly, the surround is made of a variety of different materials, such as, folded paper, cloth, rubber, and foam.  Construction of the spider consists of different woven cloth or synthetic materials that are compressed to form a flexible membrane. The following two figures illustrate where the suspension components are physically at on the loudspeaker and how they function as the loudspeaker operates. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:loud_suspension.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 8 Loudspeaker Suspension System&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:loudspk.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 9 Moving Loudspeaker &lt;/center&gt;

==Modeling the loudspeaker as a lumped system==
Before implementing a loudspeaker into a specific application, a series of parameters characterizing the loudspeaker must be extracted. The equivalent circuit of the loudspeaker is key when developing enclosures. The circuit models all aspects of the loudspeaker through an equivalent electrical, mechanical, and acoustical circuit. Figure 9 shows how the three equivalent circuits are connected. The electrical circuit is comprised of the DC resistance of the voice coil, Re, the imaginary part of the voice coil inductance, Le, and the real part of the voice coil inductance, Revc. The mechanical system has electrical components that model different physical parameters of the loudspeaker. In the mechanical circuit, Mm, is the electrical capacitance due to the moving mass, Cm, is the electrical inductance due to the compliance of the moving mass, and Rm, is the electrical resistance due to the suspension system. In the acoustical equivalent circuit, Ma models the air mass and Ra models the radiation impedance[2]. This equivalent circuit allows insight into what parameters change the characteristics of the loudspeaker. Figure 10 shows the electrical input impedance as a function of frequency developed using the equivalent circuit of the loudspeaker.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Eq_circuit.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 9 Loudspeaker Analogous Circuit&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Freq_resp.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 10 Electrical Input Impedance&lt;/center&gt;

==The acoustical enclosure==

===Function of the enclosure===

The loudspeaker emits two waves : a front wave and a back wave. With a reflection on a wall, the back wave can be added with the front wave and produces destructive interferences. As a result, the sound pressure level in the room is not uniform. At certain positions, the interaction is additive, and the sound pressure level is higher. On the contrary, certain positions offer destructive interaction between the waves and the sound pressure level is lower. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:louds_without_baffle.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 11 Loudspeaker without baffle producing destructive interferences&lt;/center&gt;

The solution is to put a baffle round the loudspeaker in order to prevent the back wave from interfering with the front wave. The sound pressure level is uniform in the room and the quality of the loudspeaker is higher.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:loudspeakers_baffled.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 12 Loudspeakers with infinite baffle and enclosure&lt;/center&gt;

===Loudspeaker-external fluid interaction===

The external fluid exerts a pressure on the membrane of the loudspeaker cone. This additive force can be evaluate as an additive mass and an additive damping in the equation of vibration of the membrane.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; - (m + MS)\omega ^2 \xi  + i\omega (C + RS)\xi  + K\xi  = fe^{i\omega t} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

When the fluid is the air, this additive mass and additive damping are negligible. For example, at the frequency of 1000 Hz, the additive mass is 3g.

===Loudspeaker-internal fluid interaction===

The volume of air in the enclosure constitutes an additive stiffness. This is called the acoustic load. In low frequencies, this additive stiffness can be four times the stiffness of the loudspeaker cone. The internal air stiffness is very high because of the boundary conditions inside the enclosure. The walls impose a condition of zero airspeed that makes the stiffness increase.

&lt;center&gt;Figure 13 Stiffness of the loudspeaker cone and stiffness of the internal air&lt;/center&gt;

The stiffness of the internal air (in red) is fourth time higher than the stiffness of the loudspeaker cone (in blue). That is why the design of the enclosure is relevant in order to improve the quality of the sound and avoid a decrease of the sound pressure level in the room at some frequencies.

==Introduction==

A car muffler is a component of the exhaust system of a car. The exhaust system has mainly 3 functions:

# Getting the hot and noxious gas from the engine away from the vehicle
# Reduce exhaust emission
# Attenuating the noise output from the engine

The last specified function is the function of the car muffler. It is necessary because the gas coming from the combustion in the pistons of the engine would generate an extremely loud noise if it were sent directly in the ambient air surrounding engine through the exhaust valves. There are 2 techniques used to dampen the noise: absorption and reflection. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages. 

[[Image:cherrybomb_muffler.jpg|150px|Muffler type &quot;Cherry bomb&quot;|right]]

==The absorber muffler==

The muffler is composed of a tube covered by sound absorbing material. The tube is perforated so that some part of the sound wave goes through the perforation to the absorbing material. The absorbing material is usually made of fiberglass or steel wool. 
The dampening material is protected from the surrounding by a supplementary coat made of a bend metal sheet. 

The advantage of this method is low back pressure with a relatively simple design.
The inconvenience of this method is low sound damping ability compared to the other techniques, especially at low frequency.
 
The mufflers using the absorption technique are usually sports vehicle because they increase the performances of the engine because of their low [[#Back pressure|back pressure]]. A trick to improve their muffling ability consists of lining up several &quot;straight&quot; mufflers.

==The reflector muffler==

Principle: Sound wave reflection is used to create a maximum amount of destructive interferences

[[Image:Destructive_interference_.png|400px|Destructive interference|right]]

===Definition of destructive interferences===

Let's consider the noise a person would hear when a car drives past. This sound would physically correspond to the pressure variation of the air which would make his ear-drum vibrate. The curve A1 of the graph 1 could represent this sound. The pressure amplitude is a function of the time at a certain fixed place. If another sound wave A2 is produced at the same time, the pressure of the two waves will add. If the amplitude of A1 is exactly the opposite of the amplitude A2, then the sum will be zero, which corresponds physically to the atmospheric pressure. The listener would thus hear nothing although there are two radiating sound sources. A2 is called the destructive interference.

[[Image:Wave_reflection_medium.png|250px|Wave reflection|right]]

===Definition of the reflection===

The sound is a traveling wave i.e. its position changes in function of the time. As long as the wave travels in the same medium, there is no change of speed and amplitude. When the wave reaches a frontier between two mediums which have different impedances, the speed, and the pressure amplitude change (and so does the angle if the wave does not propagate perpendicularly to the frontier). The figure 1 shows two medium A and B and the 3 waves: incident transmitted and reflected.

===Example===

If plane sound waves are propagating across a tube and the section of the tube changes, the impedance of the tube will change. Part of the incident waves will be transmitted through the discontinuity and the other part will be reflected. 

[[Engineering Acoustics/Car Mufflers:Animation|Animation]]

Mufflers using the reflection technique are the most commonly used because they dampen the noise much better than the absorber muffler. However they induce a higher [[#Back pressure|back pressure]], lowering the performance of the engine (an engine would be most efficient or powerful without the use of a muffler).

[[Image:Muffler reflection schema.png|400px|Schema]]

The upper right image represents a car muffler's typical architecture. It is composed of 3 tubes. There are 3 areas separated by plates, the part of the tubes located in the middle area are perforated. A small quantity of pressure &quot;escapes&quot; from the tubes through the perforation and cancel one another.

Some mufflers using the reflection principle may incorporate cavities which dampen noise. These cavities are called [[Engineering Acoustics/Filter_Design_%26_Implementation#Band-Stop Filter|Helmholtz Resonators]] in acoustics. This feature is usually only available for up market class mufflers.

[[Image:Muffler_resonator.png|300px]]

==Back pressure==

Car engines are 4 stroke cycle engines. Out of these 4 strokes, only one produces the power, this is when the explosion occurs and pushes the pistons back. The other 3 strokes are necessary evil that don't produce energy. They on the contrary consume energy. During the exhaust stroke, the remaining gas from the explosion is expelled from the cylinder. The higher the pressure behind the exhaust valves (i.e. back pressure), the higher the effort necessary to expel the gas out of the cylinder. So, a low back pressure is preferable in order to have a higher engine horsepower.

==Muffler modeling by transfer matrix method==

This method is easy to use on computer to obtain theoretical values for the transmission loss of a muffler. 
The transmission loss gives a value in dB that correspond to the ability of the muffler to dampen the noise.

===Example===

[[Image:transfer_matrice_muffler.png|500px|Muffler working with waves reflections]]

P stands for Pressure [Pa] and U stand for volume velocity [m3/s]

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} P1 \\ U1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}  T1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} P2 \\ U2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;   and   &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} P2 \\ U2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}  T2 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} P3 \\ U3 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;   and   &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} P3 \\ U3 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}  T3 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} P4 \\ U4 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So, finally:
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} P1 \\ U1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} T1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} T2 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} T3 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} P4 \\ U4 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

with 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} T_i \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}  cos (k L_i) &amp; j sin (k L_i) \frac{\rho c}{S_i}  \\ j sin (k L_i) \frac{S_i}{\rho c} &amp; cos (k L_i) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Si stands for the cross section area

k is the [[Engineering Acoustics/Boundary Conditions and Forced Vibrations#Wave Properties|wave number]]

&lt;math&gt;\ \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the medium density

c is the speed of sound of the medium

===Results ===

[[Image:transmission loss.png|400px|Schema]]

[[Media:matlab code.jpg|Matlab code]] of the graph above.

===Comments===
The higher the value of the transmission loss and the better the muffler.

The transmission loss depends on the frequency. The sound frequency of a car engine is approximately between 50 and 3000Hz. At resonance frequencies, the transmission loss is zero. These frequencies correspond to the lower peaks on the graph. 

The transmission loss is independent of the applied pressure or velocity at the input.

The temperature (about 600 Fahrenheit) has an impact on the air properties : the speed of sound is higher and the mass density is lower.

The elementary transfer matrix depends on the element which is modelled. For instance the transfer matrix of a Helmotz Resonator is 
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ \frac{1}{Z} &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
with 
&lt;math&gt;\ Z = j \rho ( \frac{\omega L_i}{S_i} - \frac{c^2}{\omega V})&lt;/math&gt;

The transmission loss and the insertion loss are different terms.
The transmission loss is 10 times the logarithm of the ratio output/input. 
The insertion loss is 10 times the logarithm of the ratio of the radiated sound power with and without muffler.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Acoustics active control.JPG|center]]

== Introduction ==

The principle of active control of noise, is to create destructive interferences using a secondary source of noise. Thus, any noise can theoretically disappear.  But as we will see in the following sections, only low frequencies noises can be reduced for usual applications, since the amount of secondary sources required increases very quickly with frequency. Moreover, predictable noises are much easier to control than unpredictable ones. The reduction can reach up to 20dB for the best cases. But since good reduction can only be reached for low frequencies, the perception we have of the resulting sound is not necessarily as good as the theoretical reduction. This is due to psychoacoustics considerations, which will be discussed later on.

== Fundamentals of active control of noise ==

=== Control of a monopole by another monopole ===

Even for the free space propagation of an acoustic wave created by a punctual source it is difficult to reduce noise in a large area, using active noise control, as we will see in the section.

In the case of an acoustic wave created by a monopolar source, the Helmholtz equation becomes:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta p + k^2 p =  - j\omega \rho _0 q&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where q is the flow of the noise sources.

The solution for this equation at any M point is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p_p (M) = \frac{{j\omega \rho _0 q_p }}{{4\pi }}\frac{{e^{ - jkr_p } }}{{r_p }}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where the p mark refers to the primary source.

Let us introduce a secondary source in order to perform active control of noise. The acoustic pressure at that same M point is now:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\rm{p(M) = }}\frac{{{\rm{j}}\omega \rho _{\rm{0}} q_p }}{{4\pi }}\frac{{e^{ - jkr_p } }}{{r_p }} + \frac{{{\rm{j}}\omega \rho _{\rm{0}} q_s }}{{4\pi }}\frac{{e^{ - jkr_s } }}{{r_s }}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 
It is now obvious that if we chose &lt;math&gt;q_s  =  - q_p \frac{{r_s }}{{r_p }}e^{ - jk(r_p  - r_s )}&lt;/math&gt; there is no more noise at the M point. This is the most simple example of active control of noise.
But it is also obvious that if the pressure is zero in M, there is no reason why it should also be zero at any other N point. This solution only allows to reduce noise in one very small area.

However, it is possible to reduce noise in a larger area far from the source, as we will see in this section. In fact the expression for acoustic pressure far from the primary source can be approximated by:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(M) = \frac{{j\omega \rho _0 }}{{4\pi }}\frac{{e^{ - jkr_p } }}{{r_p }}(q_p  + q_s e^{ - jkD\cos \theta } )&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ca1.JPG|thumb|Control of a monopole by another monopole]]&lt;/center&gt;

As shown in the previous section we can adjust the secondary source in order to get no noise in M. In that case, the acoustic pressure in any other N point of the space remains low if the primary and secondary sources are close enough. More precisely, it is possible to have a pressure close to zero in the whole space if the M point is equally distant from the two sources and if:
&lt;math&gt;D &lt; \lambda /6&lt;/math&gt;
where D is the distance between the primary and secondary sources.
As we will see later on, it is easier to perform active control of noise with more than on source controlling the primary source, but it is of course much more expensive.

A commonly admitted estimation of the number of secondary sources which are necessary to reduce noise in an R radius sphere, at a frequency f is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{{36\pi R^2 f^2 }}{{c^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This means that if you want no noise in a one meter diameter sphere at a frequency below 340Hz, you will need 30 secondary sources. This is the reason why active control of noise works better at low frequencies.

=== Active control for waves propagation in ducts and enclosures ===

This section requires from the reader to know the basis of modal propagation theory, which will not be explained in this article.

==== Ducts ====

For an infinite and straight duct with a constant section, the pressure in areas without sources can be written as an infinite sum of propagation modes:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(x,y,z,\omega ) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^N {a_n (\omega )\phi _n (x,y)e^{ - jk_n z} }&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; are the eigen functions of the Helmoltz equation and a represent the amplitudes of the modes.

The eigen functions can either be obtained analytically, for some specific shapes of the duct, or numerically. By putting  pressure sensors in the duct and using the previous equation, we get a relation between the pressure matrix P (pressure for the various frequencies) and the A matrix of the amplitudes of the modes. Furthermore, for linear sources, there is a relation between the A matrix and the U matrix of the signal sent to the secondary sources: &lt;math&gt;A_s  = KU&lt;/math&gt; and hence: &lt;math&gt;A = A_p  + A_s  = A_p  + KU&lt;/math&gt;.

Our purpose is to get: A=0, which means: &lt;math&gt;A_p  + KU = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This is possible every time the rank of the K matrix is bigger than the number of the propagation modes in the duct.

Thus, it is theoretically possible to have no noise in the duct in a very large area not too close from the primary sources if the there are more secondary sources than propagation modes in the duct. Therefore, it is obvious that active noise control is more appropriate for low frequencies. In fact the more the frequency is low, the less propagation modes there will be in the duct. Experiences show that it is in fact possible to reduce the noise from over 60dB.

==== Enclosures ====

The principle is rather similar to the one described above, except the resonance phenomenon has a major influence on acoustic pressure in the cavity. In fact, every mode that is not resonant in the considered frequency range can be neglected. In a cavity or enclosure, the number of these modes rise very quickly as frequency rises, so once again, low frequencies are more appropriate. 
Above a critical frequency, the acoustic field can be considered as diffuse. In that case, active control of noise is still possible, but it is theoretically much more complicated to set up.

=== Active control and psychoacoustics ===

As we have seen, it is possible to reduce noise with a finite number of secondary sources. Unfortunately, the perception of sound of our ears does not only depend on the acoustic pressure (or the decibels). In fact, it sometimes happen that even though the number of decibels has been reduced, the perception that we have is not really better than without active control.

== Active control systems ==

Since the noise that has to be reduced can never be predicted exactly, a system for active control of noise requires an auto adaptable algorithm.
We have to consider two different ways of setting up the system for active control of noise depending on whether it is possible or not to detect the noise from the primary source before it reaches the secondary sources. If this is possible, a feed forward technique will be used (aircraft engine for example). If not a feed back technique will be preferred.

=== Feedforward ===

In the case of a feed forward, two sensors and one secondary source are required. The sensors measure the sound pressure at the primary source (detector) and at the place we want noise to be reduced (control sensor). Furthermore, we should have an idea of what the noise from the primary source will become as he reaches the control sensor. Thus we approximately know what correction should be made, before the sound wave reaches the control sensor (forward). The control sensor will only correct an eventual or residual error. The feedforward technique allows to reduce one specific noise (aircraft engine for example) without reducing every other sound (conversations, …).
The main issue for this technique is that the location of the primary source has to be known, and we have to be sure that this sound will be detected beforehand. Therefore portative systems based on feed forward are impossible since it would require having sensors all around the head.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ca2.JPG|thumb|Feedforward System]]&lt;/center&gt;

=== Feedback ===

In that case, we do not exactly know where the sound comes from; hence there is only one sensor. The sensor and the secondary source are very close from each other and the correction is done in real time: as soon as the sensor gets the information the signal is treated by a filter which sends the corrected signal to the secondary source. The main issue with feedback is that every noise is reduced and it is even theoretically impossible to have a standard conversation.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ca3.JPG|thumb|Feedback System]]&lt;/center&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Noise cancelling headphone ===

Usual headphones become useless when the frequency gets too low.
As we have just seen active noise cancelling headphones require the feedback technique since the primary sources can be located all around the head. This active control of noise is not really efficient at high frequencies since it is limited by the Larsen effect. Noise can be reduced up to 30dB at a frequency range between 30Hz and 500Hz.

=== Active control for cars ===

Noise reduction inside cars can have a significant impact on the comfort of the driver. There are three major sources of noise in a car: the motor, the contact of tires on the road, and the aerodynamic noise created by the air flow around the car. In this section, active control for each of those sources will be briefly discussed.

==== Motor noise ====

This noise is rather predictable since it a consequence of the rotation of the pistons in the motor. Its frequency is not exactly the motor’s rotational speed though. However, the frequency of this noise is in between 20Hz and 200Hz, which means that an active control is theoretically possible.
The following pictures show the result of an active control, both for low and high regime.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ca4.JPG|thumb|Low regime]]&lt;/center&gt;

Even though these results show a significant reduction of the acoustic pressure, the perception inside the car is not really better with this active control system, mainly for psychoacoustics reasons which were mentioned above. Moreover such a system is rather expensive and thus are not used in commercial cars.

==== Tires noise ====

This noise is created by the contact between the tires and the road. It is a broadband noise which is rather unpredictable since the mechanisms are very complex. For example, the different types of roads can have a significant impact on the resulting noise. Furthermore, there is a cavity around the tires, which generate a resonance phenomenon. The first frequency is usually around 200Hz.
Considering the multiple causes for that noise and its unpredictability, even low frequencies become hard to reduce. But since this noise is broadband, reducing low frequencies is not enough to reduce the overall noise. In fact an active control system would mainly be useful in the case of an unfortunate amplification of a specific mode.

==== Aerodynamic noise ====

This noise is a consequence of the interaction between the air flow around the car and the different appendixes such as the rear views for example. Once again, it is an unpredictable broadband noise, which makes it difficult to reduce with an active control system. However, this solution can become interesting in the case an annoying predictable resonance would appear.

=== Active control for aeronautics ===

The noise of aircraft propellers is highly predictable since the frequency is quite exactly the rotational frequency multiplied by the number of blades. Usually this frequency is around some hundreds of Hz. Hence, an active control system using the feedforward technique provides very satisfying noise reductions. The main issues are the cost and the weigh of such a system.
The fan noise on aircraft engines can be reduced in the same manner.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some comments on this:
:1. It might be easier if you could make the source code available separately.
:2. Traditionally lex/flex files are *.l, yacc/bison file *.y (make has rules to deal with these file extensions automatically).
:3. A Makefile would be nice at some point.
:4. In order to be used, the code should be under a different license to GFDL.  I would suggest licensing it to be used by anyone for any purpose, as its purpose is merely to be a tutorial/guide to compiler constuction.

Apart from that, it looks great.

[[User:Jonmmorgan|Jonmmorgan]] 03:03, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

After further thought, I withdraw some of these comments.  What is there is good for a tutorial.  Incidental details like a Makefile are probably outside the scope of this book, though they need to be bundled with separately available source code for greater usefulness.

The licensing should not be a problem as you dual-license with Creative Commons.

I really like this tutorial. 

Unfortunately the &quot;Interpreting&quot; section has not been finished yet and i have a question how to build this interpreter. 
(By the way I do not know if this is the right place to ask my question.)

When interpreting, what's the best way to make a goto (goto, gotosub) jump?
Will I have to parse the ast again to find the node with the matching line number and continue execution there?
I could imagine that this might be difficult to code in one recursive function.

Can somebody help me?

Benign soft tissue tumors are classified using the musculoskeletal tumor society staging system.  Arabic numerals denote benign condidtions and Roman numerals malignant.
Stage 1 inactive
Stage 2 active
Stage 3 locally aggressive.
Marginal section is appopriate for the first two categories whereas wide local excision is appropriate for the third.

Superficial lesions less than 1.5 cm especially with slow growth characteristics,assymtomatic, non-fixed and soft are suitable for excisional biopsy, otherwise incisional biopsy if fine needle or core biopsy is not your preferred approach.
Beware the ganglion cyst that is'nt. Upon encountering instead a solid tumor which does not appear to be a giant cell tumor of tendon sheath or a schwannoma, or a hemangioma which have fairly characteristic appearances, avoid the temptation to proceed directly to marginal resection, instead, perform an incisional biopsy.  If a malignant lesion is encountered then close, observing meticulous hemostasis.  Layered closure, tourniquet deflated first to confirm hemostasis, compressive bulky dressing.  
 
After the fact is the wrong time to then check for adenopathy. It is also too late to take back that esmarch exsanguination. It is also too late to take back the transverse incision and the subcutaneous flap, and the exposure of major neurovascular structure that might have been avoided.  In other words, plan the approach to even benign lesions as if you are about to encounter an unexpected malignant fibrous histiocytoma, or synovial sarcoma or epithelioid sarcoma.

*Immune response

The ability of our bodies to distinguish self from non-self is essential to our survival but under certain circumstances inter alia rheumatoid arthritis, this defense aparatus can be turned on the bodies normal tissues.

*Inflammation

Inflammation is a term which has ancient origins, which originally describe the characteristic clinical manifestations of calor, rubror, dolor, tumor and functio laesa. Inflammation is a stereotypical set of cellular responses that give rise to local and systemic physiologic changes, classically in response to infection but also in response to injury and irritation. All are circumstances which warrant a change in behavior and a shift in priorities in a timely manner to confront a threat which may not be entirely evident absent this response. Indeed when the immune system is compromised this early warning system fails to promote the necessary cascade of events that give rise to a robust response to the offending agent, actual or potentially injurious circumstance.  Inflammation plays a propitious role in all normal healing responses and thus it is not the enemy but rather the messenger albeit the bearer of bad news which is ignored at our peril. 

The ubiquitous nature of this cellular response may lead us to conclude that it is always the source of pain where it occurs without aparent cause and thus we tend to assume this mechanism is at work for any malady involving pain even if dolor and functio laesa i are the only manifestations, tendinopathies may be an example of this tendency.

Message in a bottle. 

We inject a glucocorticoid without giving it much thought. It is our one blunt instrument for influencing the immune system which is slowly revealing its secrets through the laborious efforts of clinical investigators and basic scientists. Meanwhile, if it hurts and it is not getting better and if a surgery does not seem warranted then odds are we are likely to see if bathing the problem area in glucocorticoid will help out.
The practice came into being on the premise that many painful conditions were caused by inflammation and thus might respond to an anti-inflammatory. Many conditions previously felt to involve inflammation are later found to be some other process for which we stuggle even to find a suitable name.Yet we are left without an explanation for what seems at least to be a substantial degree of effectiveness to the injection of a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoid effects  a variety of cell types unrelated to inflammation. Its influence in these cases may be via some other mechanism, involving the gene expression of the targeted cells. The influence of the glucocorticoid is not necessarily helpful or neutral, it may also be harmful beyond simply side effects like fat atrophy and skin depigmentation. Cellular apoptosis, tendon rupture or a more insidious state of arrested remodeling, halting a productive healing process in the interest of alleviating acute symptoms and in the process creating a cycle of chronic or recurrent difficulties if not inciting the rupture of a tendon or the deterioration of joint cartilage.  
  
Approaching 60 years since the discovery of a glucocorticoid receptor and the first clinical use of systemic steroids for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and we as yet to not have complete knowledge of the molecular mechanism of action of glucocorticoids. A dermatologist may use a short course of systemic steroids 30 times a week in his office population, a rheumatologist may have innumerable patients on low dose prednisone for years.  Chronic COPD for the pulmonologists.

Glucocorticoids act on most cells, the molecule binds to a carrier molecule within the cell and is transported to the nucleus where it influences, usually down regulates DNA transcription.  

Cyclooxygenase COX is the major enzymatic target of most of the anti-inflammatory medications we use as clinicians.  This enzyme controls the arachidonic acid metabolism and is present in three isoforms; types 1 and 2 are periferal and type 3 central.

Tendinopathy of the common extensor origin also referred to as tendinosis, has replaced the previous moniker, tennis elbow and lateral epicondylitis. In what seems to be a trend to make our nomenclature less assertive  as to our professed understanding of the workings of this condition we hope to take a step back and give a broader more fundamental look at the issue. In light of the lack of histologic evidence implicating inflammation it seems appropriate to defenestrate the term epicondylitis from our working clinical vocabulary. 
  
Steroid injections work frequently enough that they are commonly perceived as useful and certainly something to try at least a time or two before any surgical intervention. Histology usually does not include evidence for acute or chronic inflammation. Why then do we use steroid injection?  Two reasons seem likely, first it has been the traditional recommendation and secondly, it seems to work by golly, not always but pretty often.  

How is this possible in view of the science which tells us there is no inflammation. Recent efforts attempt to tease out an answer. It seems that needling alone, or needling with injection of blood can also meet with success in alleviating symptoms. While this seems to have merit, it has yet to be adopted widely. This may be that the process of drawing blood is inconvenient in the clinic setting, or it may be that it does not work so well.  Lidocaine injection takes place from time to time to verify relief of symptoms when considering whether a patient can be predicted to improve with a surgery.  The usual scenario is the patient referred having had umpteen cortisone injections and unwilling to have another. I don't believe I have ever seen lidocaine alone, with needling of the tendon origing to affect a lasting benefit.
 
Is it in fact the needling rather than the steroid. Are we rebooting the healing computer by micotrauma to the tendinous origin, seems doubtful but maybe at some point in the subacute phase this could play a role.

Alternatively, does the steroid in fact cause the partially ruptured fibers which are the source of the symptoms to rupture thus relieving the symptoms. I am reminded of the chymopapain era though, or the clostridial enzyme era (has that passed?) how does it know when to stop dissolving tissue? 

Surgery often seems ultimately successful and accomplishes in essence the completion of a tear with variable degrees of removal of grossly abnormal appearing tissue on the assumption that the tissue in situ is a potential source for the pain.  Studies seem to indicate that release whether arthroscopic or percutaneous or open seem about equivalent. In view of this success, it seems reasonable to conclude that when steroid injection works it is in essence accomplishing the same thing. When it does not work it may be that while completing some tear it may be setting the ground work for the adjacent tissue to fail and herein lies the concern.  

Steroids are often used very early within days or weeks of symptom onset and indeed sometimes a quick cure is achieved.  How efficient.  What we do not know is whether the early injection of steroid might in some cases interfere with normal healing processes and prevent the successful resolution of the problem in a time frame like 3 to 4 months.  Instead with injection at 3 weeks we have a period of relief and then relapse and eventually a chronic problem, perhaps one requiring surgery.

That same sound is also similar to English &quot;d'''uh'''&quot;, but not as open.  Many unstressed syllables in Chinese use the [[w:schwa|schwa]] (ide'''a'''), and this is also written as ''e''.

== Using Tones ==
[[Image:Pinyin_Tone_Chart.svg|l|thumb|150px|Relative pitch changes of the four tones]]
Every syllable in Chinese has a clearly defined pitch of voice associated with it to distinguish characters with the same sound from each other. Unfortunately, there is no indication of the tone given when reading a character, so the tones for words must be individually memorized. To help with this, pinyin uses four easily-remembered diacritical marks to tell you what the tones of words are. The diagram to the right shows the pitch changes of the four tones on a five-bar scale going from lowest (1), to highest (5), while the five tone marks are:

# '''First tone (阴平)( ˉ )''', high level.
# '''Second tone (阳平)(ˊ)''', middle rising.
# '''Third tone (上声)( ˇ )''', low dipping.
# '''Fourth tone (去声)(ˋ)''', high falling.
# '''Tone of unstressed syllable (轻声)(without any marks)''', low level.


Tone marks are always placed over vowels, never consonants. If there is more than one vowel in the syllable, the mark placement is determined by three simple rules.  
# If there is an a or an e, the tone goes on the a or the e.  No pinyin syllable contains both an a and an e.
# In the ou combination, the o takes the tone mark.
# In all other cases, the final vowel gets the tone mark.

===Pronouncing the tones===
[[Image:Mandarin tones in musical notation.svg|thumb|400px|right|Each bar of this musical staff represents the relative pitch changes when saying tones 1, 2, 3 and 4]]
Say the first tone as if you were singing a high note. The second tone is pronounced like a question in English, with your pitch rising at the end of the syllable. Third tones are low and extended, noticeably longer than the other tones because of the dip. The fourth tone is said abruptly and forcefully, like a curt command in English. The neutral tone's pitch depends on the tone that precedes it. It is described more fully below, but in general, they are pronounced quickly and softly. The classic example used to show the difference tones make is:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
||
{{Ruby-big|妈|mā}}
{{Ruby-big|麻|má}}
{{Ruby-big|马|mǎ}}
{{Ruby-big|骂|mà}}
{{Ruby-big|吗|·ma}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(Being &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;hemp&quot;, &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;scold&quot; and a question particle, respectively.)
||
{{Listen|filename=zh-pinyin_tones_with_ma.ogg |title=mā má mǎ mà |description=A sound sample of the four tones|plain=yes}}
|}

[[Image:Half-third_Pinyin_Tone_Chart.svg|right|thumb|150px|The shape of the 3rd tone when before 1st, 2nd and 4th tones]]

In many cases, several characters can have exactly the same syllable and tone. For example, along with 马, the characters 码 and 蚂 are also pronounced exactly the same (mǎ). 马 can be used alone to mean the animal &quot;horse.&quot; It can also be combined with other characters for new meanings. 马上mǎshàng-immediately; 马球mǎqiú-polo; 马路mǎlù-street; etc. Other characters with the same pronunciation will be used differently as well. 数码相机shùmǎ xiàngjī-digital camera; 蚂蚁mǎyǐ-ant; etc. Since these characters alone sound exactly the same in conversation, the only way to distinguish them is through context.

===Tone changes===
The third tone, with its dip-and-rebound, is hard to fit into a continuous sentence. This is why the third-tone ''changes'' depending on its environment. There are two rules:

# If a third tone comes ''before another third tone'', then it is pronounced as a second tone.
# If a third tone comes ''before any other tone'', then it only dips, and doesn't rebound and is called a half-third tone (see image).

Because of these broad rules, ''the majority'' of third tones you encounter will be spoken as second tones or half-third tones. Be mindful of this because the written tone marks remain unchanged despite the differences in actual pronunciation.

===Neutral Tones===

Some syllables don't have a tone and carry no tone mark. They are not stressed, and they take their tone from the syllable before them:

# If it follows a first- or second-tone syllable, then the toneless syllable is mid-range.
# If it follows a third-tone syllable, then the toneless syllable is high, as if the dip-and-rebound of the third-tone continues right into it.
# If it follows a fourth-tone syllable, then the toneless syllable is low, as if the fall of the fourth-tone continues right into it.

Dear Zocky, thanks for all your additions and corrections to the maps.  You seem to know Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian quite well, so you might be just the one to translate some sentences we still need, especially the ones at the head of [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist]]. Also, if you like and have some time, look at the translations needed for [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Croatian#Translations needed|Croatian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Bosnian#Translations needed|Bosnian]], [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Serbian#Translations needed|Serbian]] and [[Talk:False Friends of the Slavist/Slovenian#Translations needed|Slovenian]].

      <comment>moved [[Understanding darcs/More patch theory]] to [[Understanding Darcs/More patch theory]]: naming convention</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== It's all patches ==

{{Side note|side=right|Prior to darcs 1.0.6, '''changes''' were also called '''patches''', but we decided it was too confusing.}}
Before moving on, we would like to make one very minor point clear: in the day to day operation of darcs, we talk about pulling and pushing '''patches''', and of recording and reverting '''changes'''.  This is just a user interface convention.  In patch theory terms, all of these are just patches.  The patches which you pull and push are '''named patches''', patches which contain a name and a list of unnamed patches.  So in fact, when you pull a single named patch from somebody else's repository, you are pulling a sequence of potentially many primitive patches.  What does this mean for merging?

== Merging a sequence of patches ==

In the last chapter, we saw that dealing with simple, non-conflicting merges consists mainly of making an inverse patch and commuting that inverse with the other side's patches.  Let us now explore a slightly more complicated scenario, where we have to merge against a non-conflicting sequence of patches.  We do this with a variant of the darcs hackathon shopping list.  As usual, Arjan and Ganesh are working together to write the shopping list.  They both start from a common file ''shplst'' containing
 apples
 bananas
 cookies

As before, Arjan inserts &quot;beer&quot; in line 3 of ''shplst'' and records the change.  He then decides to add another item on the end of the list, this time, &quot;pasta&quot; and records his second change.  In darcs notation, Arjan has brought us from an initial context &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, to a new context &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; with beer in it, and then to yet another context &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; with pasta as well..

''FIXME: will be fleshed out: i want to show what happens when Ganesh pulls two patches in''


&lt;!-- Arjan says this will mostly contain stuff Ganesh is working on --&gt;

== Sequences of patches ==

&lt;!--''Explain here how this works out over many non-conflicting commutes''--&gt;

== Permutivity ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like its predecessor, Visual Basic .NET excels in creating graphical user interfaces.  Although the programmer still has the option of creating controls and setting their properties programatically (i.e., by hand writing the code), he usually will create many, if not all of the controls in the interface by selecting items from the toolbox and adding to a particular form.  While working with forms, you can use the toolbox to drag different controls to the form you are designing, resize them and relocate them using the mouse, and set the control's properties in a corresponding properties window to quickly develop the user interface.  Events handlers for each control's most common event can be quickly created by double-clicking on the control to create a new event handler and be send to that event handler in the code window.

Some of these controls are described below.

==Visible controls==

===TextBox===
A TextBox is used to get and display text, this one can be in several fonts, size and color. By default, a TextBox will only display text on a single line. If you require more than one line you can set it's Multiline property to true.

====Passwords====
If you need a TextBox for accepting a password you should set it's PasswordChar property to a character. The character you choose will be displayed in the TextBox instead of what is actually typed. Good characters to choose include * and ● and any letter you will type.

====Clipboard====
You can copy the '''selected text''' to the clipboard by using the TextBox.Copy method. Use the TextBox.Paste method to paste text into the Textbox from the clipboard. TextBox.Cut places the selected text into the clipboard and removes the text from the TextBox.

====To restrict text====
To restrict text from being entered into a TextBox create an event handler for the KeyPress event.

This example is for a TextBox named TextBox1. It will allow only numbers (0 - 9), 1 decimal point and 1 minus sign to be entered.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Private Sub SubName (ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs) Handles TextBox1.KeyPress
    Select Case Asc(e.KeyChar)
        Case 48 To 57, 8
        Case 45
            If InStr(sender.text, &quot;-&quot;) &lt;&gt; 0 Or sender.selectionStart &lt;&gt; 0 Then
                e.Handled = True
            End If
        Case 46
            If InStr(sender.Text, &quot;.&quot;) &lt;&gt; 0 Then
                e.Handled = True
            End If
        Case Else
            e.Handled = True
    End Select
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

===Labels===
Labels are used to display text.  Unlike the textbox, it is not meant to accept input from the user.  Often a Label is used to describe another control, and is often used as a prompt for a Textbox.label display read-only text as far as the user is concerned

===Buttons===
Buttons are controls that are usually raised that the user most often can click on to perform some action defined by the programmer.  Once the programmer has added the button control to a form, he can define an event handler to perform an action when the button is clicked.

===Checkboxes===
A check box indicates a two-way choice or state (true/false) which can be edited by the user. Check boxes are shown on the screen as a square box that can contain white space (for false) or a check mark (for true). Adjacent to the check box is normally shown a caption describing the meaning of the check box. Inverting the state of a check box is done by clicking the mouse on the button, or the caption.  Visual Basic allows the programmer to set the caption through the check box's text property.

===Radio Buttons===
A radio button allows the user to choose exactly one of a predefined set of options. Radio buttons are arranged in groups of two or more and displayed on screen a list of circular holes that can contain white space (for unselected) or a dot (for selected). Each radio button can show a caption describing the choice that this radio button represents.  This is done by setting the radio button's text property.

===RichTextBox===
Can easily save Richtext files with Colours and Fonts. Has all the qualities of a textbox but with built in save method(richtextbox1.savefile(pathname)) and openfile(Richtextbox1.openfile(filename)).

==Other controls not visible at design time==
Some of the controls you can add while designing your form do not actually appear on the form, but you can still use the toolbox to add them to the form, where they are keep in a tray below the form for easy reference.
===Dialogs===
====OpenFileDialog====
An OpenFileDialog displays the standard &quot;Open&quot; dialog. It lets the user browse for a file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Dim DialogResult As Int32 = OpenFileDialog1.ShowDialog()
Dim strFileName = OpenFileDialog1.FileName()
&lt;/source&gt;

====SaveFileDialog====
A SaveFileDialog displays the standard &quot;Save&quot; dialog. It lets the user browse for a directory to save files and enter a filename. It can (optionally) automatically append extensions to the filename.

====FontDialog====
A FontDialog lets the user to select a font from a list of installed fonts.

====ColorDialog====
A ColorDialog lets the user select predefined color or specify a custom color..
so when are you going to save it will show saved item and then it will show the dialog box

====Timer Control====
A Timer Control is a control that will execute code at intervals. It is not visible at runtime. The interval can be set in the properties in the measurement of milliseconds. The timer control will continue to repeat its code at your interval until the control is disabled.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My chapter seems to be pretty good as far as the content goes.  I think I need to go through the checklist to make its appearance consistent with the rest of the chapters.

== Editorial Board Suggestions ==

I admit that I didn't fully understand this chapter; some of the information is a little too technical for me. I understood the chapter better when I saw the VoiceXML code examples and their corresponding dialogs. It made me think of automated phone menus or surveys that prompt callers for voice responses--scenarios that are more familiar to me. Even though the chapter explains that inputs can be in more forms than just speech, such as touch tone inputs, I think more familiar examples will help the reader understand the concepts of VoiceXML. Based on my initial reading of the chapter, here are my questions/suggestions:

'''Overall'''

* Definitely use the checklist.
* The chapter should have learning objectives.
* Provide more familiar details of VoiceXML applications. In particular, correct and flesh out the following segment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''VoiceXML is created to generate audio dialogs that allows the use of synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF(Dual Tone Multi-Frequency Touch-tone or push-button dialing. Pushing a button on a telephone keypad generates a sound that is a combination of two tones, one high frequency and the other low frequency) key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, and mixed initiative conversations. The major goal of VoiceXML is to bring the advantages of the XML language to generate interactive voice response applications. VoiceXML sets an integration environment between voice services and data services taking advantage of the client-server paradigm.''&lt;br&gt;
The parentheses need to be corrected, but aside from that, what are some examples of using synthesized speech, digitized audio, etc. in relation to VoiceXML? This didn't really ring clear to me.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* Just an idea--I wonder if it would make more sense to move the VoiceXML code examples before the VoiceXML elements. This may help reinforce the concepts, and when you discuss the VoiceXML elements, you could refer to the example code elements the reader has already previewed. Also, then there would be no need for the ''&lt;vxml&gt; element'' code example because it already exists in the form and menu code examples, and both of these examples simply can be referenced when discussing the ''&lt;vxml&gt; element'' and the rest of the elements.
* Other element examples--even though the form and menu examples include the vxml, field, grammar, block, and prompt elements, the samples of code do not always include one of the listed attributes for these elements (might be nice). Furthermore, the ''&lt;grammar&gt; element'' in the sample code includes ''&lt;grammar src=&quot;drink.grxml&quot; type=&quot;application/srgs+xml&quot;/&gt;'' and I didn't see any content in the chapter that explains the src and type attributes for the ''&lt;grammar&gt; element''. Perhaps some comments in the code or more explanation in the chapter would be helpful.
* In the '''Form example''', there is ''&lt;property name=&quot;inputmodes&quot; value=&quot;dtmf&quot;/&gt;''--should the property element be explained further in its own section, as are the vxml, field, grammar, etc. elements?
* Provide additional comments for all code examples and tables to help transition between content.
* The exercises mention choosing options from a keyboard. Maybe I'm not familiar enough with the chapter, but I didn't understand how this is using VoiceXML.  

'''Implementation platform requirements'''&lt;br&gt;
This section kind of lost me. The bolded terms confused me. Is &quot;document acquisition&quot; the hardware/software requirements? Similarly, I wasn't too sure what &quot;audio output&quot; and &quot;audio input&quot; were correlated with--it could just be the way these terms are being referenced (i.e. colon, comma, period). The bulleted list confused me as well. There doesn't seem to be a sentence that transitions to the bulleted list. Is the list a summary of implementation platform requirements? The list also contains a few ambiguous ''It''s that should be clarified.

'''VoiceXML architectural model'''

* The model references component titles with capital letters (e.g. '''D'''ocument '''S'''erver). Should this style be continued throughout the chapter? There are times these components are referenced with capital and lowercase letters, and the way these are referenced should remain consistent throughout the chapter. I think the component references are more distinguished when they're used like titles with capital letters.
* The last bullet in this section doesn't seem as though it should be a part of the list. It's an example of how the model works, so it probably should just be a paragraph after the list.
* The graphic is a little blurry. You could replace it with the following graphic:

==Professor==

The editorial board has provided much good advice, and it should be considered carefully when making the revision.

It would be useful to have links to topics such as synthesized speech, which is probably in Wikipedia.

I agree with moving the examples before listing all the elements. Give people concrete examples before abstract notions.

Remove details of the prior authors.

For the class presentations, see if you can find a live example to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">﻿{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Intermediate Haskell}}

Haskell relies on indentation to reduce the verbosity of your code.  Despite some complexity in practice, there are really only a couple fundamental layout rules.&lt;ref&gt;See section 2.7 of [http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/lexemes.html#sect2.7 The Haskell Report (lexemes)] on layout.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The golden rule of indentation ==

'''Code which is part of some expression should be indented further in than the beginning of that expression''' (even if the expression is not the leftmost element of the line).

The easiest example is a 'let' binding group. The equations binding the variables are part of the 'let' expression, and so should be indented further in than the beginning of the binding group: the 'let' keyword. When you start the expression on a separate line, you only need to indent by one space (although more than one space is also acceptable and may be more clear).

 let
  x = a
  y = b

You may also place the first clause alongside the 'let' as long as you indent the rest to line up:

{|border=&quot;0&quot;
!|wrong
!|wrong
!|right
|-
||&lt;pre&gt;
 let x = a
  y = b&lt;/pre&gt;
||&lt;pre&gt;
 let x = a
      y = b&lt;/pre&gt;
||&lt;pre&gt;
 let x = a
     y = b&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
This tends to trip up a lot of beginners: All ''grouped'' expressions must be exactly aligned. On the first line, Haskell counts everything to the left of the expression as indent, even though it is not whitespace.


Here are some more examples:

 do
   foo
   bar
   baz
 
 do foo
    bar
    baz
 
 where x = a
       y = b
 
 case x of
   p  -&gt; foo
   p' -&gt; baz

Note that with 'case' it is less common to place the first subsidiary expression on the same line as the 'case' keyword (although it would still be valid code). Hence, the subsidiary expressions in a case expression tend to be indented only one step further than the 'case' line. Also note how we lined up the arrows here: this is purely aesthetic and is not counted as different layout; only ''indentation'' (i.e. whitespace beginning on the far-left edge) makes a difference to the interpretation of the layout. 

Things get more complicated when the beginning of the expression doesn't start at the left-hand edge. In this case, it's safe to just indent further than the line containing the expression's beginning. So,

 myFunction firstArgument secondArgument = do -- the 'do' doesn't start at the left-hand edge
   foo                                        -- so indent these commands more than the beginning of the line containing the 'do'.
   bar
   baz

Here are some alternative layouts which all work:

 myFunction firstArgument secondArgument = 
   do foo
      bar
      baz
 
 myFunction firstArgument secondArgument = do foo
                                              bar
                                              baz
 myFunction firstArgument secondArgument = 
   do
      foo
      bar
      baz

== Explicit characters in place of indentation ==

Indentation is actually optional if you instead separate things using semicolons and curly braces such as in &quot;one-dimensional&quot; languages like C. It may be occasionally useful to write code in this style, and understanding how to convert from one style to the other can help understand the indentation rules. The entire layout process can be summed up in three translation rules (plus a fourth one that doesn't come up very often):

# If you see one of the layout keywords, (&lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;of&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;), insert an open curly brace (right before the stuff that follows it)
# If you see something indented to the SAME level, insert a semicolon
# If you see something indented LESS, insert a closing curly brace
# If you see something unexpected in a list, like &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt;, insert a closing brace before instead of a semicolon.

{{Haskell stub}}
''There is need for a concrete, useful example of applying these explicit characters. There should be both a given example and a realistic exercise. If you have time and ability, please help contribute here.''

== Layout in action ==

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!|wrong
!|wrong
!|right
!|right
|-
||
  do first thing
  second thing
  third thing
||
  do first thing
   second thing
   third thing
||
  do first thing
     second thing 
     third thing
||
  do
    first thing
    second thing 
    third thing
|}

=== Indent to the first ===

Due to the &quot;golden rule of indentation&quot; described above, a curly brace within a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block depends not on the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; itself but the thing that immediately follows it.  For example, this weird-looking block of code is totally acceptable:

          do
 first thing
 second thing
 third thing

As a result, you could also write combined if/do combination like this:

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!|Wrong
!|Right
!|Right
|-
||
  if foo
     then do first thing
          second thing
          third thing
     else do something else
||
  if foo
     then do first thing
             second thing
             third thing
     else do something else
||
  if foo
     then do 
      first thing
      second thing
      third thing
     else do something else
|}

It isn't about the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;, it's about lining up all the items that are at the same level within the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;.

Thus, all of the following are acceptable:
 main = do
  first thing
  second thing
or
 main = 
  do
    first thing
    second thing
or
 main = 
  do first thing
     second thing

=== &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; ===

This is a combination which trips up many Haskell programmers.  Why does the following block of code not work?

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!|sweet but wrong
!|unsweet and wrong
|-
||
 -- why is this bad?
 do first thing
    if condition
    then foo
    else bar
    third thing
||
 -- still bad, just explicitly so
 do { first thing
    ; if condition
    ; then foo
    ; else bar
    ; third thing }
|}

Naturally, the Haskell compiler is confused because it thinks that you never finished writing your &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression, before writing a new statement.  The compiler sees that you have written something like &lt;code&gt;if condition;&lt;/code&gt;, which is bad because it is unfinished.  In order to fix this, we need to indent the bottom parts of this if block so that &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; become part of the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement.

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!|sweet and correct
!|unsweet and correct
|-
||
 -- whew, fixed it!
 do first thing
    if condition
      then foo
      else bar
    third thing
||
 -- the fixed version without sugar
 do { first thing
    ; if condition
       then foo
       else bar
    ; third thing }
|}

Now, the do block sees the whole if statement as one item. When if-then-else statements are not within do blocks, this specific indentation isn't technically necessary, but it never hurts, so it is a good habit to always indent if-then-else in this way.

{{Exercises|1=
The if-within-do issue has tripped up so many Haskellers that one programmer has posted a [http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/ticket/23 proposal] to the Haskell prime initiative to add optional semicolons between &lt;code&gt;if then else&lt;/code&gt;. How would that help?}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Online demonstrations are particularly useful to show how a piece of software works or how it can be used to instruct or teach in a classroom environment. This usually involves some sort of interaction with the learning experience. As the title of this subject implies the learner has to log onto the web to take part in the learning opportunity.

A good example of this form of learning is through an online demonstration, Macromedia offer live one hour on line demonstrations. The benefit of these short interventions is that they are interactive and the learner can join education experts as they conduct live, online product demonstrations. These demonstrations are aimed at Key Stage 12 and higher education teachers, faculty, staff, and administrators that may wish to use the software as part of their teaching/learning. The software also let’s the learner combine existing learning materials such as text books or hand-outs with real-time interactivity which enables collaborative teaching and learning experiences (Macromedia Website 2006)

The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) offer a range of on-line learning resources for education and research purposes. JISC has commissioned a series of five exemplars which demonstrate how Further Education (FE) practitioners can use content found in online resources to support their teaching. Each of the exemplars showcases available electronic resource material for the teacher and it demonstrates how each of these materials can be used to assist in delivering the core syllabus to students/learners (JISC Website 2006)

The following link is the ‘Leisure’ exemplar; http://restricted.jisc.ac.uk/exemplars_fe/exemplars/leisure/index.html

Another good example of online collaborative methods of teaching and learning is through the use of Blogs. These are private web pages which are published by either an individual or a group of individuals. They can be personal journals/diaries and are used to comment on all sorts of topics depending on the interests of the author, often referred to as a Blogger. Most Blogs enable the visitors to post comments and/or suggestions allowing interactivity between the Blogger and the visitors. So from this it can be argued that the exemplars that JISC use, product online demonstrations and Blogs are excellent mediums for online educational purposes.

The following link is extremely useful to view live demonstrations on various e-learning products; http://elearningcentre.typepad.com/whatsnew/

      <text xml:space="preserve">What anarchy is a simple question; just life, the point is; what it is not. Anarchy is not the vandalism by loading arms or explosives as in the chaotic nature of 1790s France but it is a simplicity philosophy of far east that sourced of lao-tze or Taoism. But still on the contrary to the others, anarchy is not a style of constructing general agreement(choosing the one of the sames)

Wars are very unlikely to occur within an anarchist system, which may sound like zealous wishful thinking because it appears to imply that there will be no conflict between people because of an absence of authority (many would consider this paradoxical in itself). The reason wars are unlikely to happen is because to start and continue a war an individual must have a personal interest in it, kings, presidents, popes, lords and generals (autocrats and oligarchs) all have such an interest in practicing warfare for various reasons. Insurrectionists will also have an interest in continuing a war but will only have the objective of ending it, autocrats and oligarchs will usually wish to continue the war for as long as possible. The more important distinction between the two is that an insurrectionist is likely to be in personal danger of being killed during the war whilst the autocrat or oligarch have the possibilty of assasination but are otherwise not in danger. To illustrate the distinction of an anarchist society, suppose there was an anarchist city with two neighbourhoods, for whatever reason they do not share what they have with each other, so neighbourhood A decides that they want to take what they like from neighbourhood B and to do so they will go to war with neighbourhood B (incidentally this is capitalist/fascist rather than anarchist reasoning not but it will have to suffice for the example). Everyone in neighbourhood A that wants to go to war will have to be involved, to play the part of the insurrectionist, to kill and probably die for what they want. This is a very different scenario to the one the autocrat/oligarch find themselves in where they are not personally willing to die for what they want but are willing to sacrifice others for it. So it can be seen that in an anarchist system someone would have to be willing to die for their desire to start a war in order for one to begin at all.

&lt;!-- EDITORS PLEASE NOTE --&gt;
&lt;!-- (Feel free to add things you can't find a definition for but please keep items in alphabetical order) --&gt;
;Bale Needle
:A pointed metal rod or plate with a handle at one end and a hole at the other used to push twine through the bales and stitch them from one side to the other, holding mesh tightly to each surface.
;BTU or British Thermal Unit
:This is a unit for measuring energy which is now mostly replaced by the joule. One BTU is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound avoirdupois of water by one degree Fahrenheit. One BTU is approximately 1054–1060 joules.
;Cold bridge
:If a structure is made a various materials some of which insulate more than others, any part of the structure which is a potential path warmth can use to escape is a cold bridge. A common example is a well insulated house with solid aluminium windows which transfer large amounts of heat throght the structure.
;Ecological footprint
:The land, air and water that a city or nation needs to produce all of its resources and to dispose of all its waste. It is a way to determine if the lifestyle of a community is sustainable. It shows if a city or nation is utilizing more or less than its fair sustainable share of the world’s resources.
;Embodied energy
:The total energy used to bring a product or material to its present phase in its life cycle. It includes the energy required to extract or produce raw materials, their transport to the place of production, and the energy used for manufacturing. It can also include the energy used in the distribution and retail chain, for maintenance processes, for repair, etc. It is measured in MJ per kg or GJ per tonne. There is a list of the embodied energy of verious material on the [http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/yourhome/technical/fs31.htm Embodied energy] page of Australians Governments [http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/yourhome/index.htm Your Home Design Guide].
;End-of-Life (EoL)
:The moment when a product ceases to fulfil the tasks it was designed for. The end-of-life
of a product is not the end of its life cycle, since its environmental impact has not yet come
to an end; the disassembly, recycling, incineration, and/or disposal phases still remain.
;Gabion
:A metal cage full of some hard material, typically stones. Often used for retaining wall especially on river sides. Can be succesfully used as part of a building foundation.
;HVAC
:'''H'''eating, '''V'''entilation and '''A'''ir '''C'''onditioning.
;Infill
:Straw bales used between the vertical elements of a structure to form non-bearing walls and act as insulation. Often an option where building regulations are otherwise too restrictive.
;Life Cycle Analysis or Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
:A calculation of the environmental impact of a product over its complete life cycle. It starts with an inventory of the ’input’ (all resources and energy consumption) and ’output’ (emissions, solid waste, waste water). The elements in this inventory are grouped into environmental categories, which are quantified according to their environmental impact. The goal is to compare different design strategies within a category.
;Load-bearing
:A load bearing wall is one where all or most of the weight of the building is taken by the straw bale walls. The walls are 'bearing' the 'load'.
;Modified Post and Beam
:See Post and Beam. Modified simply means that the dimensions are modified to suit the dimensions of your straw bales.
;Post and Beam
:A construction using vertical elements (posts) and horizontal elements (beams) to form a structural framework. The term often refers to using a smaller number of larger than normal timbers compared to conventional 'baloon' timber framing.
;R value
:Standard insulation value which measures the '''R'''esistance in a material to the passage of heat. An R-value is the inverse of a U-value which measures the conductance in a material of heat.
;Rubble trench foundation
:A trench dug into the ground and filled with a rigid material such as demolition rubble, gravel or sea shells. Important functions of such a wall are: it cannot be further compressed, and moisture will not rise through the rubble into the wall.
;Precompression
:When stress it put into your structure some elements will be compressed. ''Pre''-compression adds this stress to the building before it is finished to stop the structure suddenly settling, or the plaster suddely cracking, once finished.
;Stem walls
:A stemwall is the part of the foundation between the floor level and ground level, and may rest on and be attached to a rubble trench or whatever else is in the ground. It can be made of concrete blocks or such or be concrete poured into forms. Think raised foundation. 
;Subgrade
:The ground of the site and anything below the surface. Subgrade foundation insulations is therefore insulation below the finished ground level to insulate the foundation from the surrounding temperature.
;Top Plate
:plate (normally wood) used to precompress bale wall, use as a roof connection, and help distribute roof weight.
;web-beam
:A beam made up of a large number of small elements, typically in a criss-cross pattern, which together perform as one large beam.

These heating specific definitions should be edited and added into the rest ''alphabetically''

A.F.U.E.: Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency represents the percentage of fuel that is converted into usable heating energy - the balance is vented through your chimney or other venting systems. It is an industry agreed upon standard. All furnaces and brands are tested the same way to provide &quot;apples to apples&quot; comparisons.

Air Conditioner - a device used to decrease the temperature and humidity of air, which moves through it. Typical air conditioners include central air conditioning which utilizes existing forced air ductwork and “Ductless Splits”.

Anode Rod - a sacrificial metal used to protect against corrosion in a hot water heater.

Baseboard Heating - heating elements located around the perimeter of a room, used to warm room air by transferring the heat from the hot water circulating through them.

Blower – an air handling device used with a furnace to circulate air through a network of ducts.

Boiler: A heating appliance that heats water to a pre-set temperature and feeds it to a circulator, which transfers the water to radiant heating units including some or all of cast iron radiators, slim baseboard radiators, under floor tubing or wall panels. Some boilers produce steam for heating purposes.

B.T.U.: British Thermal Units are the standard efficiency comparison between heating fuels. One BTU is the amount of heating energy that will raise one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit.

B.T.U./Hr.: British Thermal Units Per Hour. Used to express capacities of furnaces and boilers.

Burner - a device which supplies a mixture of air and fuel to the combustion area.

Cast Iron - a durable metal with an exceptional capability to hold and transfer heat.

Chimney Liner: A clay-tile or metal liner that is inserted into a chimney.

Chimney Venting - a vertical vent used to transfer products of combustion from a furnace or boiler to the outdoors.

Combustion - the process of converting fuel into heat. This requires oxygen.

Combustion Air: An air supply brought into the furnace's combustion chamber - supplied from within the basement, or from outdoors. Combustion air is necessary to burn fuel.

Controls: Devices such as a thermostat that regulate a heating or cooling system.

Convection: The transfer of heat through a moving gas (air) and a surface, or the transfer of heat from one point to another within a gas. In hydronic heating, cool air falls to the floor where it is heated by metal fins in a baseboard radiator and then rises to transfer heat to the environment through natural convection.

Convective Heat: the natural circulation of air across a heat source to heat the air.

Degree Days: A system by which heating oil dealers measure and record the daily temperature. This information is compared to what they know about your heating system to ensure automatic delivery before your system uses all of the oil in the storage tank.

Direct Venting: A process in which the products of combustion are vented to the outdoors via sidewall venting, (without the use of a chimney).

Direct Vent - a furnace or boiler design where all the air for combustion is taken from the outdoors and all exhaust products are released to the outdoors, also known as sealed combustion. Direct Vent is also known as balanced flue venting in oil furnaces and boilers.

Distribution System: The component of a heating or cooling system that delivers warmed or cooled air, or warmed water, to the living space.

Draft Hood - a device that prevents a backdraft from entering the heating unit or excessive chimney draw from affecting the operation of the boiler or furnace.

Ductless Split A/C System - A system that cools and dehumidifies air without the use of conventional duct work. The equipment location is split, with the condenser and heat pump outside of the home and the air handler and controls inside.

Efficiency Rating - the ratio of heat actually generated versus the amount of heat Theoretically possible from the amount of fuel inputted.

Flame Retention Burner: A modern oil burner which retains the flame near the mouth of the burner, for improved efficiency and operational savings.

Flue: An enclosed passage that is designed to convey hot flue gases. (Also known as a breech).

Flue Gases: The gases (eg. carbon dioxide, water vapour and nitrogen) that are formed when the fuel oil, natural gas, or propane is burned with the air. (Products of combustion are technically all of the flue gases less the nitrogen that was present before combustion).

Forced Air: A distribution system in which a fan circulates air from the heating or cooling unit to the rooms through a network of supply air and return air ducts.

Furnace: A heating appliance that warms air around a heat exchanger. The air is conveyed by fan, into a central duct system to distribute warm air to all areas of the home or building.

Heat Exchanger: A structure that transfers heat from the hot combustion gases inside the furnace heat exchanger to the circulating room air flowing across the exterior of the heat exchanger.

Heat Loss: Term used for all areas of your home where heated air may escape due to construction styles, age of house, windows, weather-stripping, etc. All homes will experience some level of heat loss.

Heat Loss Calculation: This is the means by which a heating contractor will determine the required capacity of a furnace or boiler to adequately heat the home (or building).

Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV): A device used in central ventilation systems to reduce the amount of heat that is lost as household air is replaced with outside air. As fresh air enters the house, it is warmed as it passes through a heat exchanger, heated by the warm outgoing air stream.

Heat Transfer: the transmission of heat from the source (flame) to air or water.

Heating Capacity: the amount of usable heat produced by a heating unit.

High-boy: a term used to describe a furnace which has a small &quot;footprint&quot; but is tall. The blower is under the heat exchanger. This is also known as an upflow furnace.

Hot Water Boiler: a heating unit that uses water circulated throughout the home in a system of baseboard heating units, radiators, and/or in-floor radiant tubing.

Hot Water Heater: a unit with its own energy source that generates and stores hot water.

Hydronics: Hydronics, or heating with water, consists of a compact boiler (fired by any fuel) that heats water, which is distributed to a network of slim baseboard, panel or space radiators, or under floor tubing by a circulator. This term also applies to the science of heating (or cooling) with water.

Indirect Hot Water Storage Tank: a unit that works in conjunction with a boiler to generate and store domestic hot water, it does not require its own energy source.

In-floor Radiant Tubing: tubing, typically plastic or rubber, used in conjunction with heated boiler water to heat floors.

Low-boy: a term used to describe a furnace which has a low profile. The blower is located on the same level plane as the heat exchanger. This furnace style has both the return air plenum and the supply air plenum on the top of the furnace. This furnace style is sometimes called a console style furnace.

Low Water Cut-off: a device used to shut down a boiler in the event that a low water condition exists. This is required whenever radiators are located at a lower level than the boiler. Some jurisdictions require them on all boiler installations.

Natural Gas: any gas found in the earth (e.g. methane gas) as opposed to gases which are manufactured.

Nozzle: A burner component that atomizes, meters and patterns fuel oil into the heat exchanger / fire-pot.

Oil Heating: the production of heat by burning oil.

Propane: a manufactured gas typically used for cooking or heating. This is also known as L.P. gas. (liquid petroleum).

Push Nipples: machined metal sleeves used to join adjacent sections of a boiler.

Radiant Floor Heating: Under floor heat is provided by flexible, long-lasting tubing. The continuous tubing can be placed under any flooring, and circulated hot water provides invisible heat anywhere in the home, swimming pool or driveway.

Radiant Heating: the method of heating the walls, floors or ceilings in order to transfer heat to the occupants of a room.

Radiator: a heating element, typically metal, used in conjunction with water or steam to give off heat.

Retrofit: Replacement of one or more components of an existing system.

Safety Shut-off Device: any device used to shut down a heating appliance in the event an unsafe condition exists.

Seasonal Efficiency: A performance rating that considers the heat actually delivered to the living space, the total energy available in the fuel consumed, and the impact the equipment itself has on the total heating load through an entire heating season.

S.E.E.R.: Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating. The standards by which equipment is measured. The higher the S.E.E.R., the more efficient the equipment (especially air conditioning).

Sealed Combustion: a furnace or boiler design where all the air for combustion is taken from the outside atmosphere and all exhaust products are released to the outside atmosphere, also known as direct vent.

Steam Boiler: a heating unit designed to heat by boiling water, producing steam, and circulating it to radiators or steam baseboard units throughout the home.

Stack Damper: a device installed in the venting system that will automatically close when the appliance shuts down. This device is used to reduce the amount of warm indoor air being drawn up the chimney between heating cycles.

Supply Tapping: opening in a boiler by which hot water enters the heating system.
Setback Thermostat: A programmable thermostat with a built-in timer. You can adjust it to vary household temperature automatically.

Tankless Heater: a copper coil submerged into the heated boiler water used to transfer heat to domestic water.

Venting: An opening for combustion gases to exit the house. Can be a chimney or a vent
through the wall of the house. Includes all parts of the venting system - vent connector, chimney, etc.

Zone Control: A heating control system in which the space to be heated is divided into zones and each zone is controlled by a separate thermostat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Adam, but you can call me L0g1c (clever, I know ;). That's a zero and not an &quot;O&quot; by the way. Don't let the l33t sp33k fool you, I am by no means a script kiddie. My interests lie in the realm of computer networks - namely on the logic side of that realm, but I have been known to step over onto the hardware side from time to time. I have an Associate's Degree in Network Administration and have completed my CCNA with (possible) plans on a CCNP. I am currently attending the University of Northern Iowa, where I am studying for a degree in Computer Science with a system administration focus, and where I work as a student technician. I have a couple more years yet, but I hope to earn a Master's Degree in something network related!

Out of boredrom and intrigue, I have created a WikiBooks account and am beginning by making a few grammatical/punctuation changes to some network-esque articles. I've been spending some time on WhiteKnight's awesome Communication Systems book. It's like a tasty McDonalds meal minus the grease: I'm lovin' it!</text>

The exam consists of 4 questions. There are 72 marks available on the paper, with 18 marks for each question. It is split into two sections, Section A and Section B. Section A consists of three questions. Section B contains 1 question on hyperbolic functions The time allowed for the paper is 1 hour 30 minutes. The Investigation of Curves chapter is included in the textbook but there is no longer an option to choose to answer a question on this topic and so section B is just one question on hyperbolic functions.

      <comment>/* Determinant of a 3x3 Matrix */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This section aims to expand upon information gathered about matrices in [[../FP1 | FP1]], dealing with 3x3 matrices, eigenvectors and eigenvalues as well as the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.

==Determinant of a 3x3 Matrix==
===How to find the determinant===
The determinant of a 3x3 matrix &lt;math&gt;M = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 &amp; b_1 &amp; c_1 \\ a_2 &amp; b_2 &amp; c_2 \\ a_3 &amp; b_3 &amp; c_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|M| = \begin{vmatrix} a_1 &amp; b_1 &amp; c_1 \\ a_2 &amp; b_2 &amp; c_2 \\ a_3 &amp; b_3 &amp; c_3 \end{vmatrix} = a_1 \begin{vmatrix} b_2 &amp; c_2 \\ b_3 &amp; c_3 \end{vmatrix} - a_2 \begin{vmatrix} b_1 &amp; c_1 \\ b_3 &amp; c_3 \end{vmatrix} + a_3 \begin{vmatrix} b_1 &amp; c_1 \\ b_2 &amp; c_2 \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

To find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix, it is necessary to choose a row or column to start with. In the above example, the first column (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) was selected. The first entry in this column is selected (i.e. &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;) and multiplied by its ''minor''. The minor of &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by crossing off the row and column which contains &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, in this case to leave the matrix &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} b_2 &amp; c_2 \\ b_3 &amp; c_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. The 'minor' is the determinant of this matrix. The minors of &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} b_1 &amp; c_1 \\ b_3 &amp; c_3 \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} b_1 &amp; c_1 \\ b_2 &amp; c_2 \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. To determine the sign which precedes the term of the expansion, the following matrix is used: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} + &amp; - &amp; + \\ - &amp; + &amp; - \\ + &amp; - &amp; + \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. A minor along with its corresponding sign is known as a ''cofactor''. The cofactor of &lt;math&gt;a_1\,&lt;/math&gt; may be written as &lt;math&gt;A_1\,&lt;/math&gt;.

So if you were to select the second column (&lt;math&gt;b\,&lt;/math&gt;), the determinant would be found by:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|M| = \begin{vmatrix} a_1 &amp; b_1 &amp; c_1 \\ a_2 &amp; b_2 &amp; c_2 \\ a_3 &amp; b_3 &amp; c_3 \end{vmatrix} = -b_1 \begin{vmatrix} a_2 &amp; c_2 \\ a_3 &amp; c_3 \end{vmatrix} + b_2 \begin{vmatrix} a_1 &amp; c_1 \\ a_3 &amp; c_3 \end{vmatrix} - b_3 \begin{vmatrix} a_1 &amp; c_1 \\ a_2 &amp; c_2 \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. This may be re-written as &lt;math&gt;b_1B_1 + b_2B_2 + b_3B_3\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
Find the determinant of  the matrix &lt;math&gt;M\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M = \begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 9 &amp; 4 \\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;:

Solution:-
&lt;math&gt;|M| = \begin{vmatrix} 5 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 9 &amp; 4 \\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \end{vmatrix} = &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5 \begin{vmatrix} 9 &amp; 4 \\ 6 &amp; 3 \end{vmatrix}
- 1 \begin{vmatrix} 7 &amp; 2 \\ 6 &amp; 3 \end{vmatrix}
+ 2 \begin{vmatrix} 7 &amp; 2 \\ 9 &amp; 4 \end{vmatrix} =&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5(9\times3 - 6\times4) - 1(7\times3 - 6\times2) + 2(7\times4 - 9\times2) =\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5(27-24) - 1(21 - 12) + 2(28 - 18) = \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;15 - 9 + 20 =\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\underline{26}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the Sarrus Method can also be used to find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Note that the Sarrus method doesn't work with larger dimensions (eg. 4x4 matrices).

==Inverse of a 3x3 Matrix==
The inverse of a 3x3 matrix is found in a similar way to that of a 2x2 Matrix. To recap, the inverse of the 2x2 matrix &lt;math&gt;M = \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; c \\ b &amp; d \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is found via:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}^{-1} = {1 \over det\mathbf{M}}\begin{pmatrix} d &amp; -c \\ -b &amp; a \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown (using the properties of determinants) that &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} A_1 &amp; A_2 &amp; A_3 \\ B_1 &amp; B_2 &amp; B_3 \\ C_1 &amp; C_2 &amp; C_3 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} a_1 &amp; b_1 &amp; c_1 \\ a_2 &amp; b_2 &amp; c_2 \\ a_3 &amp; b_3 &amp; c_3\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} |\mathbf{M}| &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; |\mathbf{M}| &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; |\mathbf{M}|\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, by factoring out |M|, &lt;math&gt;{1 \over |\mathbf{M}|}\begin{pmatrix} A_1 &amp; A_2 &amp; A_3 \\ B_1 &amp; B_2 &amp; B_3 \\ C_1 &amp; C_2 &amp; C_3 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} a_1 &amp; b_1 &amp; c_1 \\ a_2 &amp; b_2 &amp; c_2 \\ a_3 &amp; b_3 &amp; c_3\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This shows that &lt;math&gt;{1 \over |\mathbf{M}|}\begin{pmatrix} A_1 &amp; A_2 &amp; A_3 \\ B_1 &amp; B_2 &amp; B_3 \\ C_1 &amp; C_2 &amp; C_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of &lt;math&gt;M\,&lt;/math&gt;.
The matrix &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} A_1 &amp; A_2 &amp; A_3 \\ B_1 &amp; B_2 &amp; B_3 \\ C_1 &amp; C_2 &amp; C_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''adjoint''' or '''adjugate''' matrix of '''M'''. It is found by replacing each element of the matrix with its corresponding co-factor and then transposing (swapping the rows for columns of) the matrix.

==Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues==

Consider a transformation achieved through a matrix - for the sake of argument, an enlargement - of scale factor two. If we think of lines through the origin, upon undergoing the transformation, each point on each line through the origin maps to another point on its line, but the origin maps to itself. We can say that, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix responsible for the transformation, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; the 'point' on the line (in column-vector form - i.e., that of a 1x2 matrix), then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ms}=\lambda \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;; in the case of our example of scale factor two, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; would be 2. Every point undergoing the matrix would become a multiple of itself; that multiple would be two.

We can generalise this further to situations beyond mere enlargements.  Formally, we can say that if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-zero vector such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ms} = \lambda \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''eigenvector'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt;. The scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is known as an ''eigenvalue''. 

Let us illustrate this with an example: 

Since:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 10 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = 5 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

it must be that &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; are eigenvectors of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively corresponding to the eigenvalues 5 and 2. It will become evident shortly that these are the ''only'' two eigenvalues. 

Notice that all non-zero scalar multiples of these two eigenvectors are also eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt;, with the same respective eigenvalues. Likewise, under the transformation, the eigenvector is enlarged by a scale factor equal to its eigenvalue, and that the direction of an eigenvector is unchanged by the transformation. 

When finding eigenvectors, you need to be able to solve the equation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ms}=\lambda \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;: 

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ms}=\lambda \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ms} - \lambda \mathbf{s} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ms} - \lambda \mathbf{Is} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt; (The use of the identity matrix is not necessary here)
* &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{M} - \lambda I)\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt; (But it is vital here!)

Clearly, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; is always a solution, but is rather pointless. For non-zero solutions, we require &lt;math&gt;\mbox{det(}\mathbf{M-I}\lambda\mbox{)} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;. This equation is called the '''characteristic equation''', and the resultant polynomial (from finding the determinant) is called the '''characteristic polynomial'''. 

This leads to three steps to finding eigenvectors: 

# Form the characteristic equation &lt;math&gt;\mbox{det(}\mathbf{M-I}\lambda\mbox{)} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
# Solve the characteristic equation to find the ''eigenvalues'', &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
# For ''each'' eigenvector, find a corresponding eigenvalue '''by solving''' &lt;math&gt;\mbox{det(}\mathbf{M-I}\lambda\mbox{)} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;. 

This is true irrespective of the size of M.

==Introduction==

Acoustic filters are used in many devices such as mufflers, noise control materials (absorptive and reactive), and loudspeaker systems to name a few.  Although the waves in simple (single-medium) acoustic filters usually travel in gases such as air and carbon-monoxide (in the case of automobile mufflers) or in materials such as fiberglass, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film, or polyethylene (Saran Wrap), there are also filters that couple two or three distinct media together to achieve a desired acoustic response. General information about basic acoustic filter design can be perused at the following wikibook page [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic_Filter_Design_%26_Implementation  Acoustic Filter Design &amp; Implementation]].  The focus of this article will be on acoustic filters that use multilayer air/polymer film-coupled media as its acoustic medium for sound waves to propagate through; concluding with an example of how these filters can be used to detect and extrapolate audio frequency information in high-frequency &quot;carrier&quot; waves that carry an audio signal.  However, before getting into these specific type of acoustic filters, we need to briefly discuss how sound waves interact with the medium(media) in which it travels and how these factors can play a role when designing acoustic filters.

==Changes in Media Properties Due to Sound Wave Characteristics ==

As with any system being designed, the filter response characteristics of an acoustic filter are tailored based on the frequency spectrum of the input signal and the desired output.  The input signal may be infrasonic (frequencies below human hearing), sonic (frequencies within human hearing range), or ultrasonic (frequencies above human hearing range). In addition to the frequency content of the input signal, the density, and, thus, the characteristic impedance of the medium (media) being used in the acoustic filter must also be taken into account.  In general, the characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt; Z_0 \,&lt;/math&gt; for a particular medium is expressed as...&lt;center&gt; 
      &lt;math&gt; Z_0 = \pm \rho_0 c  \,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt; (Pa \cdot s/m) &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;/center&gt; 

where &lt;center&gt; 
      &lt;math&gt; \pm \rho_0  \,&lt;/math&gt; = (equilibrium) density of medium  &lt;math&gt;(kg/m^3)\,&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; c \,&lt;/math&gt; = speed of sound in medium  &lt;math&gt; (m/s) \,&lt;/math&gt;  
      &lt;/center&gt;

The characteristic impedance is important because this value simultaneously gives an idea of how fast or slow particles will travel as well as how much mass is &quot;weighting down&quot; the particles in the medium (per unit area or volume) when they are excited by a sound source.  The speed in which sound travels in the medium needs to be taken into consideration because this factor can ultimately affect the time response of the filter (i.e. the output of the filter may not radiate or attentuate sound fast or slow enough if not designed properly).  The intensity &lt;math&gt; I_A \,&lt;/math&gt; of a sound wave is expressed as... &lt;center&gt; 

     &lt;math&gt; I_A = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T} pu\quad dt = \pm \frac{P^2}{2\rho_0c}  \,&lt;/math&gt;    &lt;math&gt;(W/m^2) \,&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt; I_A  \,&lt;/math&gt; is intrepreted as the (time-averaged) rate of energy transmission of a sound wave through a unit area normal to the direction of propagation, and this parameter is also an important factor in acoustic filter design because the characteristic properties of the given medium can change relative to intensity of the sound wave traveling through it.  In other words, the reaction of the particles (atoms or molecules) that make up the medium will respond differently when the intensity of the sound wave is very high or very small relative to the size of the control area (i.e. dimensions of the filter, in this case).   Other properties such as the elasticity and mean propagation velocity (of a sound wave) can change in the acoustic medium as well, but focusing on frequency, impedance, and/or intensity in the design process usually takes care of these other parameters because most of them will inevitably be dependent on the aforementioned properties of the medium.

==Why Coupled Acoustic Media in Acoustic Filters?==

In acoustic transducers, media coupling is employed in acoustic transducers to either increase or decrease the impedance of the transducer, and, thus, control the intensity and speed of the signal acting on the transducer while converting the incident wave, or initial excitation sound wave, from one form of energy to another (e.g. converting acoustic energy to electrical energy).  Specifically, the impedance of the transducer is augmented by inserting a solid structure (not necessarily rigid) between the transducer and the initial propagation medium (e.g. air).   The reflective properties of the inserted medium is exploited to either increase or decrease the intensity and propagation speed of the incident sound wave.  It is the ability to alter, and to some extent, control, the impedance of a propagation medium by (periodically) inserting (a) solid structure(s) such as thin, flexible films in the original medium (air) and its ability to concomitantly alter the frequency response of the original medium that makes use of multilayer media in acoustic filters attractive.  The reflection factor and transmission factor &lt;math&gt; \hat{R} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \hat{T} \, &lt;/math&gt;, respectively, between two media, expressed as...




&lt;center&gt; 

&lt;math&gt; \hat{R} = \frac{pressure\ of\ reflected\ portion\ of\ incident\ wave}{pressure\ of\ incident\ wave} = \frac{\rho c - Z_{in}}{\rho c + Z_{in}} \, &lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;/center&gt; and &lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; \hat{T} = \frac{pressure\ of\ transmitted\ portion\ of\ incident\ wave}{pressure\ of\ incident\ wave} = 1 + \hat{R} \,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/center&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt; 


are the tangible values that tell how much of the incident wave is being reflected from and transmitted through the junction where the media meet.   Note that &lt;math&gt; Z_{in} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the (total) input impedance seen by the incident sound wave upon just entering an air-solid acoustic media layer.  In the case of multiple air-columns as shown in Fig. 2, &lt;math&gt; Z_{in} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the aggregate impedance of each air-column layer seen by the incident wave at the input.  Below in Fig. 1, a simple illustration explains what happens when an incident sound wave propagating in medium (1) and comes in contact with medium (2) at the junction of the both media (x=0), where the sound waves are represented by vectors.  

As mentioned above, an example of three such successive air-solid acoustic media layers is shown in Fig. 2 and the electroacoustic equivalent circuit for Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. 3 
where &lt;math&gt; L = \rho_s h_s \,&lt;/math&gt; = (density of solid material)(thickness of solid material) = unit-area (or volume) mass, &lt;math&gt; Z = \rho c = \,&lt;/math&gt; characteristic acoustic impedance of medium, and &lt;math&gt; \beta = k = \omega/c = \,&lt;/math&gt; wavenumber.    Note that in the case of a multilayer, coupled acoustic medium in an acoustic filter, the impedance of each air-solid section is calculated by using the following general purpose impedance ratio equation (also referred to as transfer matrices)...


&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; \frac{Z_a}{Z_0} = \frac{\left( \frac{Z_b}{Z_0} \right) + j\ \tan(kd)}{1 + j\ \left( \frac{Z_b}{Z_0} \right) \tan(kd)} \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;  

where &lt;math&gt; Z_b \,&lt;/math&gt; is the (known) impedance at the edge of the solid of an air-solid layer (on the right) and &lt;math&gt; Z_a \,&lt;/math&gt; is the (unknown) impedance at the edge of the air column of an air-solid layer.  



&lt;center&gt;

==Effects of High-Intensity, Ultrasonic Waves in Acoustic Media in Audio Frequency Spectrum==


When an ultrasonic wave is used as a carrier to transmit audio frequencies, three audio effects are associated with extrapolating the audio frequency information from the carrier wave: (a) beating effects, (b) parametric array effects, and (c) radiation pressure.   


Beating occurs when two ultrasonic waves with distinct frequencies  &lt;math&gt; f_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; f_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; propagate in the same direction, resulting in amplitude variations which consequently make the audio signal information go in and out of phase, or “beat”, at a frequency of  &lt;math&gt; f_1 - f_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;.   


Parametric array effects occur when the intensity of an ultrasonic wave is so high in a particular medium that the high displacements of particles (atoms) per wave cycle changes properties of that medium so that it influences parameters like elasticity, density, propagation velocity, etc. in a non-linear fashion.  The results of parametric array effects on modulated, high-intensity, ultrasonic waves in a particular medium (or coupled media) is the generation and propagation of audio frequency waves (not necessarily present in the original audio information) that are generated in a manner similar to the nonlinear process of amplitude demodulation commonly inherent in diode circuits (when diodes are forward biased).  


Another audio effect that arises from high-intensity ultrasonic beams of sound is a static (DC) pressure called radiation pressure.  Radiation pressure is similar to parametric array effects in that amplitude variations in the signal give rise to audible frequencies via amplitude demodulation.  However, unlike parametric array effects, radiation pressure fluctuations that generate audible signals from amplitude demodulation can occur due to any low-frequency modulation and not just from pressure fluctuations occurring at the modulation frequency  &lt;math&gt; \omega_M \,&lt;/math&gt; or beating frequency  &lt;math&gt; f_1 - f_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;.

==An Application of Coupled Media in Acoustic Filters==

Figs. 1 - 3 were all from a research paper entitled [http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~vgant/AcousticFilterPaper.pdf New Type of Acoustics Filter Using Periodic Polymer Layers for Measuring Audio Signal Components Excited by Amplitude-Modulated High_Intensity Ultrasonic Waves]submitted to the Audio Engineering Society (AES) by Minoru Todo, Primary Innovator at Measurement Specialties, Inc., in the October 2005 edition of the AES Journal.  Figs. 4 and 5 below, also from this paper, are illustrations of test setups referred to in this paper.  Specifically, Fig. 4 is a test setup used to measure the transmission (of an incident ultrasonic sound wave) through the acoustic filter described by Figs. 1 and 2.  Fig. 5 is a block diagram of the test setup used for measuring radiation pressure, one of the audio effects mentioned in the previous section.  It turns out that out of all of the audio effects mentioned in the previous section that are caused by high-intensity ultrasonic waves propagating in a medium, sound waves produced from radiated pressure are the hardest to detect when microphones and preamplifiers are used in the detection/receiver system.  Although nonlinear noise artifacts occur due to overloading of the preamplifier present in the detection/receiver system, the bulk of the nonlinear noise comes from the inherent nonlinear noise properties of microphones.  This is true because all microphones, even specialized measurement microphones designed for audio spectrum measurements that have sensitivity well beyond the threshold of hearing, have nonlinearities artifacts that (periodically) increase in magnitude with respect to increase at ultrasonic frequencies.  These nonlinearities essentially mask the radiation pressure generated because the magnitude of these nonlinearities are orders of magnitude greater than the radiation pressure.  The acoustic (low-pass) filter referred to in this paper was designed in order to filter out the &quot;detrimental&quot; ultrasonic wave that was inducing high nonlinear noise artifacts in the measurement microphones.  The high-intensity, ultrasonic wave was producing radiation pressure (which is audible) within the initial acoustic medium (i.e. air).  By filtering out the ultrasonic wave, the measurement microphone would only detect the audible radiation pressure that the ultrasonic wave was producing in air.  Acoustic filters like these could possibly be used to detect/receive any high-intensity, ultrasonic signal that may carry audio information which may need to be extrapolated with an acceptable level of fidelity.

While there is no hard and fast rule a common guideline divides the evaluation of wrist pain into acute &lt;1 week, subacute 1-6 weeks and chronic &gt;6 weeks. 
Approxmately 60 % of chronic wrist pain can be diagnosed by history physical exam and and standard x-rays an ultrasound and a bone scan. The addition of an MRI or an arthrogram may add another 10% to the total of definable causes for pain. 

Presumably more elaborate imaging will continue to improve upon this success rate but no diagnostic study will provide for a correction of the problem. False positive studies may create an impetus for needless surgical intervention even if the finding does not correlate with the clinical impression.  False negative studies may unduely delay treatment and the optimal window for definitive treatment may be lost.

An experienced hand surgeon can use history, physical, selective lidocaine injection, and standard x-rays and from that alone conclude who is likely to benefit from an arthoscopic procedure. The scope may not achieve the desired goal of establishing the diagnosis definitively in more than 70% of cases but it does inform all concerned as to whether a correctable problem is present. At the time of arthroscopy, where feasible, definitive treatment can be rendered with an open procedure if need be. Imaging is best used selectively to augment the surgical judgement at the surgeons discretion. Sometimes it is clear that the patient is not going to benefit from a surgery and yet something more concrete than a history and physical is required to establish the absence of organic pathology. What to do with a positive finding that the surgeon feels is of no clinical significance can mean that the imaging compounds the problem rather than helping.

Economics, referral patterns, precertification requirements, and medico-legal considerations appear to be the major reason for profligate use of imaging studies especially MRI. There is also the matter of an imaging study enhancing the image of the specialty physician who  appears to validate the patients complaint by caring enough to pursue the study appearing thereby to be more thorough. The review of the images with the patient has some teaching value, though typically the patient is at a loss as to what they are looking at. The teaching moment is enhanced if the image can be viewed on a monitor scrolling through the image, but at the cost of several credit hours at any community college this is a rather costly exercise for educational purposes alone let alone for the purpose of physician image enhancement.

A Managed Learning Environment (MLE) goes one stage further than a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) by providing facilities for managing, tracking and delivering teaching and learning (LSC Website 2006)

So what is an MLE? A Managed Learning Environment is a term that started to be used around 1999. Using the University/educational establishment scenario an example an MLE is;
“MLE is the taking advantage of the potential of new technology based learning environments to integrate information systems around the learner. These learners may be working in different modes at different times, on campus, off campus, part time or full time. To support this, information systems will need to be student centred and fully accessible from multiple locations. They will need to be integrated at multiple levels, ensuring interoperability between administrative and financial systems, learning support and learning environments, and between collaborating institutions.” (JISC website 2006)

Before thinking of setting up an MLE, organisations or institutions need to be aware of what is involved and may want to ask themselves a series of questions. For example who will the MLE benefit? and what will the overall cost be to the organisation? If it is to be used as part of the learning process what will be the direct benefits to the end user i.e. the student?

Furthermore the main question that needs addressing is what will be the actual benefit to the working relationships of the different departments in a college/university structure. For e.g. Student Records, Admissions and ICT department and more importantly Blackboard where students are using a VLE to communicate with their peers and lecturers on a day to day basis and to access course work.

The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) offer a useful toolkit in order to address some of the fundamental issues that need to be overcome when setting up an MLE. The following link takes you to the toolkit;
[1]

So what are the overall advantages of setting up an MLE? JISC were commissioned to carry out a study in 2002, it was completed recently and one of the top three advantages that came through was the access to learning has been made much wider. On the downside one of the main disadvantages is the cost and time involved of implementing such a huge system.

== 6. The priests were from which of the 12 tribes? Why? ==
They were from the tribe of Levi. They had refused to bow down and worship the golden calf.
It may be interesting to show here that there were actually 13 tribes of Israel. You will find various tribe lists in scripture showing various statistical numbers such as how many soldiers from each tribe. At the time of the building of the tabernacles the Tribe of Joseph had been divided into the 2 tribes ones Ephraim and Manasseh. The Levites did not provide soldiers to the army or have a portion of the land of Israel, they did have responsibilities for various towns scattered throughout Israel. When the Israelites were camped around the wilderness Tabernacle careful details were given where each of the 12 other tribes were to camp; which 3 on the north, which 3 on the South, east and West. The Levites camped close to and around the Tabernacle. The Levites were made up of 4 main family groups each responsible wore various duties. Looking after the poles, golden items, cloth etc. One family were the Guards and camped at the gate entrance. It is also interesting to note that Jesus had 12 disciples. Jesus representing our High Priest and the 12 others making a group of 13. 
{{Bible verse
|book=Exodus
|chapter=32
|verse=25-29
|version=NIV
|text=
Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies. So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the LORD, come to me.” And all the Levites rallied to him.

Then he said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.’” The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died. Then Moses said, “You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day.”

== 7. Describe the robe of: ==
=== a. The common priest. ===
The priests wore linen breeches as an undergarment. The garments were woven of one piece, spotless, and without any blemish. All the common priests wore a plain, white linen robe and turban. They always removed their sandals before entering the Sanctuary. [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2028; (Exodus 28 and 39)]

=== b. The high priest. ===
[[File:PLATE4DX.jpg|thumb|400px|Jewish High Priest wearing the sacred vestments. The ephod is depicted here in yellow.]]
Like all priests, the high priest wore linen breeches as an undergarment. The garments were woven of one piece, spotless, without any blemish. Over the undergarment, he wore an embroidered linen coat, again woven of one piece of fabric. The coat was tied with an embroidered girdle. Over this the High Priest wore a one-piece sleeveless solid blue robe. On the hem of the blue robe hung tinkling little golden bells and bright pomegranates. 

The ephod, was worn outside the blue robe - a shorter garment of gold, blue, purple and scarlet, and fine twined linen. The ephod was fastened at the shoulders with two onyx stones, on each were engraved the names of six of the tribes of Israel. On the ephod the High Priest wore a breastplate made of two pieces of fabric fastened together. In the breastplate, next to the heart of the High Priest, were two onyx stones called the Urim and the Thummim, through which God made known His will.

On the outside of the breastplate were 12 precious stones. They were arranged as four rows of three. Their sequence, from left to right and from top to bottom were: sardis (brownish red), topaz (yellow to yellowish red), carbuncle (red), emerald (clear green), sapphire (deep blue), diamond (sparkling clear), jacinth (bright yellow), agate (delicate blue), amethyst (violet), beryl (green-yellow), onyx (bright yellow), jasper (red, brown, or yellow).

He wore a mitre (a crown) on his head. Fastened to the forefront of it with a ribbon of blue, was a plate of pure gold on which was engraved the inscription 'HOLINESS TO THE LORD'
[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2028; (Exodus 28 and 39)]

== 8. Read and discuss The Great Controversy page 488 and Hebrews 4:14-16. ==
;The Great Controversy: &quot;The subject of the sanctuary and the investigative judgment should be clearly understood by the people of God. All need a knowledge for themselves of the position and work of their great High Priest. Otherwise it will be impossible for them to exercise the faith which is essential at this time or to occupy the position which God designs them to fill. Every individual has a soul to save or to lose. Each has a case pending at the bar of God. Each must meet the great Judge face to face. How important, then that every mind contemplate often the solemn scene when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened, when, with Daniel, every individual must stand in his lot, at the end of days.&lt;p&gt;All who have received the light upon these subjects are to bear testimony of the great truths which God has committed to them. The sanctuary in heaven is the very center of Christ's work in behalf of men. It concerns every soul living upon the earth. It opens to view the plan of redemption, bringing us down to the very close of time and revealing the triumphant issue of the contest between righteousness and sin. It is of the utmost importance that all should thoroughly investigate these subjects and be able to give an answer to everyone that asketh them a reason of the hope that is in them.&quot;

{{Bible verse
| book = Hebrews
| chapter = 4
| verse = 14-16
| version = NIV
| text =
&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens,Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin. &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.&quot;
}}

== 9. What kinds of animals were brought daily to the courtyard? ==
A young bull, rams, heifers, lambs, goats, and pigeons or doves were brought to the sanctuary daily. All were ceremonially clean, without spot or blemish (John 1:29)

== 10. Write a paragraph or tell how you see Christ represented in the sanctuary and its services. ==

Is anybody using this page to learn Croatian?


'''Warning: This is NOT a political forum; any political ranting, incitements of ethno-religious hatred, insults, debates, and derogatory comments will be ommitted without hesitation'''.

== Order ==

Can anyone write something about word order?

*Kiša je pala. (A rain fell)
*Pala je kiša. (Fell the rain)

*On to mora učiniti. (He that/it must do)
*Mora to učiniti. (He must that/it do)

== Third lesson ==

What should a third lesson be about?

:If you speak Croatian, feel free to contribute to the book and write the lessons by yourself. And if you want to learn Croatian, well you'll just have to wait for somebody else to start contributing to this module, which is currently inactive. --[[User:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|George D. Bozovic]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:40, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, I speak Croatian. But I don't know what to write about.

:I'm learning... I have begun to add stuff that I found helpful. Hoping you recognise this as homage, as the pages are helpful! [[User:82.46.44.139|82.46.44.139]] 13:27, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

== Fixing up the article ==

I thought that the article looked a bit bland, so I edited the front page. It's not really changed, but I added a title. I'm hoping to make a proper front page soon, so the article looks more attractive, but before I start, does anyone have any suggestions that I could add in, or for others to edit?

UPDATE: I've updated the pages quite a lot. I'm going to try to add more pages, and make some more lessons. If you want to see the old page, it's at the bottom of the new front page.

*We should add an FAQ for some words or differences that aren't explained in dictionaries (for example; the difference between &quot;zato&quot; and &quot;jer&quot;)

UPDATE: I've transfered everything to the level pages, but I'm not sure whether all the links are working. I know where every page is, so if anyone finds any pages with links sending them some-where else, please tell me, and I'll sort it out

Hi I just wanted to know if someone is still working on this since I noticed the last edit was last year. Thank you, it's been helpful so far.[[Special:Contributions/186.10.41.99|186.10.41.99]] ([[User talk:186.10.41.99|discuss]]) 21:25, 28 September 2011 (UTC)</text>

Arepas are fried or baked yellow or white corn pancakes, either plain or with a filling. Most Venezuelans and Colombians eat them as part of their daily diet in place of bread, mostly at breakfast, at least in Colombia. They are one of the national dishes of Venezuela and there are many food stands or small restaurants called ''areperas'' which specialise in the making of these small delights.

Arepas have been an important staple in the diets of the poor Venezuelan's diet for centuries; today they are eaten by rich and poor alike. Originally they were made from dried corn kernels which were soaked in water and lime to remove the skins, then cooked, drained, dried and ground into flour. Thanks to modern technology, it is now possible to buy the &quot;harina de maíz precocida&quot; (corn flour) ready to use, cutting out the lengthy soaking and drying process, which means they can be prepared in just a few minutes. 

Arepas can be eaten for breakfast; at any time of the day as a snack; as an appetiser or starter, especially when accompanied with a sauce; or as an accompaniment to a main course, much like bread rolls. They can be eaten plain; cooked with a filling of meat, poultry or cheese; simply split open and buttered; or filled like a sandwich. They can be poached, grilled, baked, griddled or (most often)  fried,  making them not only of the most traditional but also one of the most versatile foods in Venezuela.

==Ingredients==

* 2 2/5 cup (500 g) [[cookbook:Corn Flour|corn flour]] for arepas 
* 1 1/5 tsp [[cookbook:salt|salt]] 
* 3/5 (140 g) cup grated white [[cookbook:cheese|cheese]] 
* 2 2/5 (500 g) cup cool [[cookbook:water|water]] (or more if needed) 

==Procedure==
# In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and white cheese. Stir in enough water to make a firm, slightly moist dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 10 pieces and form each piece into a ball. Flatten the ball slightly.
# Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 °C).
# Oil a griddle very lightly and warm it over medium heat. Cook the arepas on the griddle for about 5 minutes on each side, until a golden brown crust forms. Transfer the arepas to a baking sheet and bake 20 to 25 minutes, turning them several times as they bake. 

Serve immediately, with cheese, ham and black beans.

'''Cachapas''' are traditionally made with fresh corn, and are a summer favorite, but this easy recipe uses canned cream corn, pancake mix and whatever cheese you have on hand. Try this simple appetizer for a taste of Venezuela whenever you like. 

== Ingredients ==
* 1 can creamed corn (14 fl oz, 398 g)
* 3/4 cup [[cookbook:Batter|pancake mix]]
* 1/4 cup [[cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 [[cookbook:egg|egg]]
* 2 tablespoons melted [[cookbook:butter|butter]] or [[cookbook:margarine|margarine]]
* 2 tablespoons [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]], or to taste
* [[cookbook:cheese|cheese]] of your choice

== Procedure ==
# Mix all the ingredients in a [[cookbook:blender|blender]]. The mix should become thick and heavy. If not, add more corn. 
# Shape the mix into small pancakes approximately 1/2 inch thick and about 5 inches in diameter. Let them cook on medium heat for about one minute on each side, or until small bubbles form on the top. 
# Cachapas should be served hot, and may be accompanied with cheese (feta cheese is one option, Mexican white cheese &quot;Cotija&quot;, Venezuelan or Columbian &quot;Queso Blanco&quot; ,&quot;Queso de Mano&quot; or &quot;Queso Guayanes&quot; where available).

'''Pabellón Criollo''' is Venezuela's national dish and no visit to this South American country will be complete unless you try it. This flavorful dish consists of shredded flank steak, black beans, rice, plantains or bananas, onions, tomatoes, and spices.

* 1 tsp finely chopped [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 x 400g/14oz tin chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* ½ tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 900g/2lb [[Cookbook:Beef|lean steak]], (sirloin or rump) about 12mm/½ - inch thick 

==Procedure==
# Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onions and garlic and cook over a medium heat for about 5 minutes until the onions are soft and transparent.
# Add the tomatoes, cumin and salt, mix well, reduce the heat to low and cook uncovered, for about 30 minutes, stirring often, until the tomato juices evaporate and the sauce becomes thick. 
# 15 minutes before the end of the cooking time, preheat the grill to hot, place the steak on the grill pan and cook under the grill for 5 minute on each side. 
# Remove from the grill and cut into pieces about 12mm/ ½ -inch long and 6mm/ ¼ -inch wide then add the strips of beef to the sauce, mixing well.

TEQUEÑOS. Yields 12 tequeños

This highly addictive appetizer originated in Los Teques, Venezuela (hence the name). Pronounced &quot;teh-kehn-yos&quot;

== Ingredients ==
* 2 lb (900g) all-purpose flour 
* 4 x egg yolks 
* 1/2 lb (225g) butter room temperature 
* 1 cup (240ml) water 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1 tbl sugar 
* 2 lb (900g) farmer's cheese 

== Procedure ==
# Dissolve the salt and sugar in the water.
# Mix all ingredients except the cheese together. Knead to form a dough. Let rest.
# Meanwhile, cut cheese into sticks about 2&quot; x 1/2&quot; x 1/2&quot; (5cm x 1.25cm x 1.25cm).
# Stretch the dough with a rolling pin, as thin as possible. 
# Cut in strips about 1&quot; x 6&quot; (2.5cm x 15cm). 
# Wrap each strip around a cheese stick, going around the stick in a spiral, overlapping each turn so that the cheese is completely covered. 
# Pinch the ends so that the cheese is fully covered and can't run out when fried.
# Roll each tequeno in flour, to keep them from sticking. 
# Deep fry the tequenos in very hot oil, until golden in color. 
# Place on paper towels to absorb any excess oil.

Serve right away. Should be eaten piping hot, so that the cheese runs out when bitten.

Requires 2 days of advanced preparation. 

The '''hallaca''' (pronounced AH-YA-KAH) is the main Venezuelan Christmas dinner dish. It was created by the slaves during the colony times. They put the left-overs of their master's Christmas festivities in a bit of cornmeal dough, wrapped this with banana leaves and cooked to mix the flavors. As many things in my country, the hallaca has the influence of three cultures, the white one (European ingredients like raisins, nuts and olives), the native one (the corn meal colored with annatto seeds), and the black one (banana leaves used to cook the food). The original hallaca is made with meat (pork, poultry, beef, lard, crisp pork rind, etc) and boiled eggs. The hallaca tastes better once it has cooled. It requires hours of preparation, but it is usually prepared by the whole family. Its preparation is a celebration by itself. Music and drinks make up the festive atmosphere. Mothers nagging children as they steal bits of fillings from the table, and the guys complaining of being relegated to the leaf cleaning and last minute shopping are typical during the hallaca making party. 

''Please note: the banana leaves are not intended to be eaten, they are just for cooking!'' 

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Ingredientes fundamentales de una hallaca.JPG|right|thumb|Just some of the ingredients for Hallaca]]

* 1 Tsp of [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]]
* 1 tsp of [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seeds]]
* 1 tsp of [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
* 1 Tsp of [[Cookbook:Annatto|annatto seeds]] (also called &quot;achiote&quot; or &quot;onoto&quot;) 
* 1 kg of instant [[Cookbook:Polenta|polenta meal]] (coarse corn meal)

* 1 kg of [[Cookbook:Banana|banana leaves]] (for wrapping, not for eating!)
* 250 ml of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 vegetable [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|stock cube]]
* 1 mushroom stock cube 

[[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]], [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soya sauce]] and [[Cookbook:Hot Pepper Sauce|chili sauce]] to season 

** OPTIONAL for overseas expatriates and daring cooks: 20mx30cm roll of strong [[Cookbook:Aluminum foil|aluminum foil]] (unless you are rich enough or have access to a Sedano's supermarket as to buy triple quantity of banana leaves and wrap the hallacas exclusively with banana leaves, in the Old Fashioned Way)(See Goya.Com for provenance within the US) Hallacas are the best ever!

==Procedure==
Make sure you have enough friends and family to help you with the procedure below, and that they include people who know how to fold them once filled, wrap them and tie them properly... no kidding.

===Leaves===
# With a damp cloth wipe the banana leaves. 
# Heat the banana leaves with a flame (gas cooker, camping fire, etc). The leaves turn softer and darker, with a distinctive smoky smell. 
# Cut the hard rim without shredding the leaves. Cut in 30 cm segments along the transversal veins

===Polenta dough===
# In a small pan, warm (at very low heat) 5 Tsp of olive oil with the annatto seeds for 20 minutes. The oil should turn red. 
# In the meantime, fry in a deep pan the spices (cumin, black pepper, and coriander seeds) in 2-3 Tsp of olive oil. Cut the white onions in slices and add to the pan. Add 5 cups of boiling water. Add the stock cubes and a Tsp of Marmite to season. Add the green part of the leeks plus the white part of 2 leeks in 1-inch chunks. Cut 1 and a half packet of spring onions and add to the pan. Add all the herbs (keep some parsley to garnish) and the garlic head cut in halves. 
# Simmer this broth for 15 minutes. 
# Put the content of the pan in a food processor and liquidise it. 
# Strain it very well keeping the liquid and discarding the solid waste (may want it to make vegetable cakes, up to you). Put the broth in a large bowl and add the red oil (previously strained to remove the annatto seeds). 
# Pour the water content of the olive and the caper jars in the bowl. Add the polenta meal, 1 cup at a time, stirring very well. The consistency should be smooth. Mix the mashed potatoes with the polenta dough. 
# Make a small test for the consistency of the dough. Wrap 1 Tsp of dough with a small segment of banana leaf. Wrap it in aluminum foil and boil it in water for 15 minutes. If the cooked dough maintain the shape of the banana leaf &quot;package&quot;, the dough is OK. If it crumbles or comes out half dissolved in water, then add more polenta meal. If it comes out rock hard, then add more water to the dough. Rectify the salt as well. 

===Fillings===
# Grill peppers: Rub olive oil in two red bell peppers and grill them. 
# Remove the skin and seeds and cut in 1cm wide strips. 
# Put them apart in a small bowl. 

===Sauce===
# Slice two red onions. Chop the rest of the spring onions and a leek. 
# Stir fry quickly. 
# Liquidise the ''mi-cuit'' tomatoes, two red peppers and two green peppers and add to the stir fry onions and leek. Stir for a minute. 
# Add soya sauce, chili sauce and ground cumin to season. Add some cooking wine if you want. Let it simmer for another minute. 
# Add some wheat or corn flour to thicken. Put the sauce apart in a bowl. 

===Small bowls===

# Vegetables: shred the carrots and Brussels sprouts, mix with the green beans, chopped. Put them apart in a bowl. 
# Soak the vine fruit in cooking wine or replacement. Put it apart in a small bowl. 
# Soak prunes in cooking wine or replacement. Put in a small bowl. 
# Drain chickpeas and put them apart in a small bowl. 
# Put pickles apart in a small bowl. 
# Blanch and toast the almonds, and put them apart in a small bowl. 
# Drain and chop the mock duck into 1cm cubes and put them in a small bowl. 
# Put the olives apart in a small bowl. 
# Put the capers apart in a small bowl. 
# Drain the artichoke hearts, cut in quarters and put them in a small bowl. 
# Drain the asparagus and put it in a plate. 

===Hallaca===
[[Image:Ingredientes fundamentales de la Hallaca.JPG|right|thumb|Wrapping the hallaca]]
# Cut a 35 cm long piece of aluminum foil and put it over the table. Cover with a banana leaf, the transversal veins along the horizontal axis. Rub oil on front face of the banana leaf. Put a bit more than half a ladle of dough in the centre of the leaf. Extend with a spoon to cover a 14cm-diameter circle. 
# Put 1 Tsp of Sauce in the middle. Put 1½ Tsp of shredded vegetables over the sauce. Put 2 olives and 2 capers, one on each corner of the dough. Keep placing the rest of the fillings as in a collage: 1 tsp. of vine fruit, 1 prune, 2 tsp. of pickles, 1 Tsp of chickpeas, 3 cubes of mock duck, 1 asparagus, 2 strips of grill pepper and some leaves of parsley. 
# Wrap this with the banana leaf (not against the veins). Fold the foil to seal the ends of the banana leaf packet. Then, fold the foil to wrap the whole packet. Tie it with kitchen string. Repeat for the rest of the dough (see diagrams below). 
# Boil the hallacas covered in water for 20-30 minutes. You may have to do this in batches unless you have a huge cauldron. Drain the hallacas and let them cool for 10 hours. Put them in the fridge or freezer. Heat the hallacas in boiling water, simmering for 10 minutes before eat them. Enjoy your meal!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Add content to my edits as you wish. I have removed only stuff which I found superflous. Real tipps and important notes such as 'big boom doesn't make the mobs attack the dwarf' or 'spoil is essential for dwarves' have been preserved. But endless discussions if the Bronze Set is better than the Wooden Set or the Hard Leather set should go into a newsgroup and not into a wiki book, IMHO. Or at least they should go into a general 'warrior' category and not into the 'Human Warrior' class description.

And actually, the skills are NOT listed this way anywhere else in the net, at least not that I know of. On the official site, one even has to operate a combobox to actually get to the information about the skills of a class, once one has managed to navigate to it. Of course, there are also details listed which are now gone in the representation here, such as how much mp are needed and which &quot;power&quot; a skill has. Still the representation there is a LOT less accessible than the compact form found here.

Hi, I've been following your edits in the Lineage II wikibook and I only recently took a look at your older edits. As the original starting contributor, I think we need to reach an agreement on certain things.

I really do appreciate your efforts in the wikibook; it's not easy to keep up with the changes. I do hope that you would continue to contribute regardless of the outcome of this discussion

However, I do need to point out that for the PC Classes &amp; Character Guides, merely stating the skills and effects is not adding any value to this wikibook; the information is readily available elsewhere ''including'' the official Lineage 2 site. 

The original intent I had for creating that section is to write character guides -- guides on the quests, armour, skills to take, that kind of thing. Merely stating statistics is not very useful as they are available elsewhere.

Also, I would like to point out that the previous contributors (myself included) spent considerable effort to bring up some of the content. In your rewrites, you have overwritten these content without shifting the information elsewhere as far as I can tell. As far as possible I would like to keep all the meaningful contributions for use... ''eventually''.

Again, I thank you for your efforts and would appreciate it if you continue to contribute. I just ask that you spare some considerations for the efforts of the other contributors.

      <comment>Restoring current version</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the state of New Hampshire, the first thing you have to do is take courses preparing you for the State and National Real Estate exams. Even if you study independently, proof of 40 hours of training from an accredited training class is necessary before the [[w:New Hampshire Real Estate Commission|New Hampshire Real Estate Commission]] will allow you to take the test, per [[w:New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated|New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated]] 331a. 

At the NH Real Estate Commission website, there's a list of accredited instructors that can prepare you for the test, be prepared for an investment of several hundred dollars, both for the courses, books you'll need to study from, and for the test dues to the Commission. 

The class consists mostly of how to take the test rather than what is necessary to be a Real Estate agent, particularly the two portions, the National and State parts.

There are 100 randomly selected questions on the National Portion, along with 5 more questions in the National Portion that are added within the test, but not counted. The 5 extra questions are within the test, but you, as a test taker do not know which ones are which. 

The State Portion is similar, but smaller, with 40 questions along with 5 phantom extra questions like the National Portion. However, the state portion deals solely with issues regarding state law in regards to Real Estate practices (90% of which is dealt with in RSA 331a), as well as the makeup of the New Hampshire Real Estate Commission and some of the bylaws of local Realtor boards. 

In order to pass the test, you need to get a 70%(70 National Questions or 30 State Questions) on each portion, although each portion is scored separately, you could pass one and not pass the other and then just have to take the part you failed over again. 

Upon successful completion of both tests, you are issued a license to practice Real Estate within the State of New Hampshire, as detailed in RSA 331a. If you wish to practice Real Estate in other states, you only need to take the State Portion tests within their states, similar to the New Hampshire State Portion taken during your initial licensure. 

Licenses are held under the aegis of a person with a Broker's license, usually the owner of a Real Estate Agency or the head of a satellite branch of a Real Estate Agency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Black Mariah''' is a variant of [[../7-stud|Seven Card Stud]]. 

==How to Play==
Black Mariah is dealt and played just like basic [[../7-stud|Seven Card Stud]], with the caveat that if the queen of spades comes as an up card to any player, the hand is over. All cards are thrown in, the money remains in the pot, and the game is dealt again. Any player who folds cannot come back in and is out until the game is complete.

The game continues in this way until either the queen of spades does not come face up or until all players but one fold. If more than one player remains, the winner (high hand) splits the pot with the hand with the high spade in the hole (Ace is high).

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: pronounciation → pronunciation, Middle ages → Middle Ages, unecessary → unnecessary using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is the difference between ''i'', ''te'' and ''a''?==
They're all translated as &quot;and&quot;, but there is a difference in how to use them.

*Of all three, '''i''' suits its translation the best and can replace ''te'' and ''a'' in any case except when ''a'' means &quot;what about&quot; (see below). &quot;I&quot; is often used as &quot;too&quot; or &quot;also&quot; (''I on?'' - Him too?) It is used the most.
*'''Te''' is usually used to avoid sounding too repetitive (that is why it is more often found in literature).
*'''A''' is more of and/but. It is also often used as &quot;and what about..?&quot; (''A on?'' What about him?). It is also more often used at the beginnings of the sentences than &quot;i&quot;.
Unlike ''i'' that can indicate curiosity e.g.''i kada će to biti?'' (and when will that be?) ''a'' can bring a little sarcastic tone to a conversation e.g. ''a kada će to biti?'' (and just when will that be?). When writing, unlike te and i, a always has a comma behind it.

Note that when listing things:
*''i'' is used for normal listing e.g. mačke ''i'' psi (cats and dogs)
*''a'' can carry the meaning of &quot;and what about?!&quot; e.g. A mačke? A psi? (And what about cats and dogs?)
*''te'' is rarely used

Native speakers tend to use &quot;and&quot; a lot, even when it's unnecessary, mostly following words such as 'čak', 'kad' etc. and some sentences can even sound strange if they lack &quot;and&quot; such as &quot;Došli bi čak kada ne bi morali&quot;
''Došli bi čak i kada ne bi morali'' - They'd come even if they wouldn't have to.

Can also be used
''A možda i ne bi.'' - And [then again], maybe they wouldn't.

==Two words are the same but one has an &quot;a&quot; at the end. Why?==

Some rare words can have ''navezak'', a letter &quot;a&quot; at the end that doesn't have to be used if the speaker doesn't want to. It is usually added to make pronunciation easier and more understandable (s sjekirom =&gt; s'''a''' sjekirom). Some of the words include s/sa, kad/kada, kud/kuda, nikog/nikoga, svakog/svakoga...

==What does ''šetati'' and what does ''hodati'' mean?==
They both mean &quot;to walk&quot;, however ''šetati'' indicates walking for pleasure, in a park or on the beach while ''hodati'' indicates the action itself or, more precisely  the movement. Note: Don't use ''hodati'' if you want to say you're going for a walk with someone because you'll sound strange (especially because it can also mean &quot;to date&quot;)

==What is the difference between ''no'' and ''ali''?==

They both mean &quot;but&quot;, but ''no'' has more of &quot;however&quot; meaning and is not used as often as ''ali''.

==Do words for months, seasons, weekdays and holidays have any meaning?==

Mostly. For literal translations of months go to [[Croatian/Main Contents/Level 1/Lesson 5|Months]].

Nedjelja (Sunday) is derived from ''ne djelati'', slavic word meaning not to work, ponedjeljak (Monday) could roughly mean &quot;after sunday&quot;, četvrtak (Thursday) is derived from ''četvrti'' which means the fourth and petak (Friday) is derived from ''peti'' meaning fifth.

As for the holidays, ''Božić'' (Christmas) could be roughly translated as little god, ''Uskrs'' (Easter) is derived from ''uskrsnuti'', meaning &quot;to resurrect&quot; and Nova godina does indeed mean New year.

Two of the four season-names appear to have meaning:
     Summer (&quot;ljeto&quot;):
         A word appearing to have the same root is &quot;ljetina&quot;, which means &quot;crop/harvest/yield.&quot;
         Summer might well have been considered the season of crops/harvesting/yields.
     Winter (&quot;zima&quot;):
         The same word means &quot;cold,&quot; and Winter is certainly the cold season.

==What are the differences between standard Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian?==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differences_between_standard_Serbian%2C_Croatian_and_Bosnian Differences between standard Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian]is the article in Wikipedia.

==When do you use ''kamo'', when ''kuda'' and when ''gdje''?==

All of them mean ''where'', but the difference is often ignored even by native speakers themselves as they tend to use only &quot;gdje&quot;.

*'''Gdje''' is used when you want to ask where a person was/is/will be.
*'''Kuda''' is used when asking which way a person will go.
*'''Kamo''' is used when asking about a destination.

==What is the difference between ''zato'' and ''jer''?==

They both mean because, but are used differently.

Zato is used the most, but is usually followed by ''što''.. If it's not followed by any of the two it can also mean &quot;and that's why...&quot;. Zato can also be used as an answer (Zato! - Because!) while jer can't. Also, jer is never followed by ''što'' or ''zato''.

==Which words in Croatian are the shortest?==

The shortest words in Croatian are a (and, but), o (about), u (in), i (and), k (to), s (with).

==Is the word &quot;of&quot; used in the same way as it is in English?==

The use is similar but there are a few rules which aren't in English grammar.
The word &quot;of&quot; is used if it describes what the object is made of, for example &quot;Kolač '''od''' jabuka&quot; which means &quot;A cake made of apples&quot;. But the sentence ''Kuća'' '''od''' ''bake'' which literally translates as &quot;house '''of''' grandma&quot; is wrong because it means a house is made of grandma. The right sentence would be: ''Bakina kuća''. So, if it's describing possession, '''od''' is not usually used (there are a few exceptions).
''Od'' can also mean &quot;from&quot; but use it only when referring to places.

==When do you use ''sa''?==

Sa (with) is only used when the next word in the sentence starts with a letter &quot;s&quot;. For example: &quot;Popravljam igračku sa sestrom&quot; (&quot;I'm repairing a toy with my sister&quot;). Normally, it would be &quot;Popravljam igračku s prijateljem&quot; (&quot;I'm repairing a toy with my friend&quot;).

The word &quot;with&quot; is only used if it's describing a person with whom the work is preformed. For example: &quot;Popravljam igračku '''s''' prijateljem (I'm repairing a toy '''with''' my friend&quot;). If it's describing a tool with which a job is done, then it's not used.

''S/Sa'' can also mean &quot;of&quot; (for example: ''skočiti s litice'' means &quot;to jump off the cliff&quot;).
 
==Does Croatian have its own writing system?==

Not today, but Croatian did have its own writing system a few centuries ago. It was a form of Glagolitic alphabet (''uglata glagoljica''), the squared one and was in use in Middle Ages.

==What is the difference between ''sjećati'' and ''pamtiti''?==

The difference is huge but a little hard to explain. Both words translate as remember but sjećati refers to remembering something from the past, reminiscing (e.g. Sjećam ga se-I remember him). Pamtiti however refers more to remembering a piece of information for future use (e.g. Upamti to-Remember that)

==Formality==
As with other languages, there is a formal and informal method of speech with people. When speaking formally, the person is referred to in the plural sense, as opposed to singular when informally speaking. For example: ''Kako ste?'' (formal: How are you?), as opposed to ''Kako si?'' (informal: How are you?). Formal speech is used when talking to much older person, teacher, or stranger. Informal speech is used for friends, family and children. It's normal to say ''što?'' (What) but it can sometimes be considered rude when speaking more or less formally(especially if it's &quot;šta&quot; or &quot;kaj&quot;), but more formal is ''molim?''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You must know that Croatian is very hard to learn because most of the words can have different forms and then sound like other ones. But you're in for a pleasant surprise.

Croatian is well suited for the Roman alphabet, and its pronunciation is therefore quite easy to master. It does possess noun cases, and the verbs inflect rather liberally, but the learner will get used to these new concepts rather quickly.

== The nominative case of Masculine and Feminine nouns ==
=== Singular/Jednìna ===
Masculine nouns in the nominative case usually do not have a fixed ending. Student, Pilot, Profesor are all Masculine nouns.

Feminine nouns have a fixed ending. If the Student is female, the noun would change to Studentica. The fixed ending is ica, or occasionally, just an a is there, like Škola/Plaža.

Neuter nouns end with -o or -e. Neuter nouns can't be changed to Masculine or Feminine usually.

|- 
| Stùdent || Student + ica = Stùdentica || Víno
|-
| Pròfesor || Profesor + ica = Profesòrica || Jáje
|}

=== Plural/Množina ===
Masculine nouns when plural, add -i onto the end of the word, although if masculine nouns of one syllable ending end with a &quot;hard consonant&quot;, -ovi is added instead of -i, like Gradovi (towns). The singular is Grad (towns)

Feminine nouns when plural, replace the -a, and add -e onto the end of the word.

Neuter nouns when plural replace the -o or -e and add -a onto the end of the word. Some nouns insert -en- between the stem and the plural, like ramena (shoulders). Also, some nouns in Neuter only exist in plural form, such as Vrata (door), Novine (newspaper). Finally, some nouns have an irregular plural, meaning they don't always end with -a in plural form, such as Uho (ear) = Uši (ears) or Oko (eye) = Oči (eyes)

Other resources [http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/solarsystem/uranus/ariel.shtml] mention William Shakespeares play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, where a spirit called Ariel plays an important part. [[User:Knightowld|Knightowld]] 19:59, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:Keep in mind that all of the moons of Uranus are named after Shakespearian characters.... it is (strangely enough) a part of the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) standard for Uranian satellites.  The astronomers involved decided to have some fun and use some of their liberal arts knowledge for a more practical use, since they needed names for these moons anyway.  I'm sure the Bard wouldn't mind, and indeed this is a great honor.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:01, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Line Graphs==
Basically, a '''line graph''' can be, for example, a picture of what happened by/to something (a variable) during a specific time period (also a variable).

On the left side of such a graph usually is as an indication of that &quot;something&quot; in the form of a scale, and at the bottom is an indication of the specific time involved.

Usually a '''line graph''' is plotted after a table has been provided showing the relationship between the two variables in the form of pairs. Just as in (x,y) graphs, each of the pairs results in a specific point on the graph, and being a LINE graph these points are connected to one another by a LINE.

Many other line graphs exist; they all CONNECT the points by LINEs, not necessarily straight lines. Sometimes polynomials, for example, are used to describe approximately the basic relationship between the given pairs of variables, and between these points. The higher the degree of the polynomial, the more accurate is the &quot;picture&quot; of that relationship, but the degree of that polynomial must never be higher than ''n-1'', where ''n'' is the number of the given points.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The history of Residential Real Estate dates back to prehistory when one caveman said to another &quot;So, I hear you're looking for a cave with good ventilation and easy access to the Mastodon Hunts!&quot; Unfortunately, cave sales have been slow this quarter, so we'll skip ahead to more contemporary homes.

==Architecture==
When you're on the outside of a house, your client will no doubt ask you &quot;What's this?&quot; or &quot;What's that?&quot; Here's where you'll hopefully find the answers to those questions. 

===Types of homes===
*'''Colonial''': Also known as a &quot;neo-colonial&quot;, a colonial home is an asymmetrical house, usually with the garage being the asymmetrical part. 
*'''Cape''': A home where the second floor doubles as an attic/loft. The most common sub-style of Cape is the Cape Cod.
*'''Garrison''': A home with one floor slightly larger than the other, usually with a small overhang.
*'''Greek Revival''': Also an architectural period during the first half of the 19th Century, Greek Revivals often have columns, parallel and symmetrical floor plans, obtuse-angled gable roofs, and a kind of farmhouse-turned-mansion kind of feel. They were indicative of the period in American architecture when the country was trying to establish its own identity unique from that of England and looked to the Democratic ideals of Ancient Greece, copying their love for the [[w:Golden Mean|Golden Mean]] common in Ancient Greek architecture.
*'''Georgian''': The first style widespread in America before the Revolution, the Georgian style is fairly simple and symmetrical, often with double chimneys, and usually having a gable roof.
*'''Federal''': Think Georgian, with a bit more pizazz -- arches, balconies, hip and mansard roofs are more common than with Georgians, but the symmetry is still there.

===Types of roofs===
*''[[w:Gable|Gable]]'': Your standard, triangular looking roof. Sometimes, a gable may come with dormers, a small jutting portion of a floor that looks like an extension. A very steep gable is also known as an &quot;A Frame&quot;. 
*''[[w:Gambrel|Gambrel]]'': Half of a [[w:Decagon|Decagon]], it looks kind of like half a stop sign.
*''Saltbox'': Not having anything actually to do with salt or boxes, it's basically a gable with a short side and a long(usually at least twice as long)side.
*''[[w:Mansard|Mansard]]'': Think of the roofs you see at [[w:Pizza Hut|Pizza Hut]], they're basically just the &quot;non-brim of the hat&quot; portion of those roofs.

&lt;big&gt;'''Ewing's Sarcoma'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*Tumor of neuroectodermal origin, part of the Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors
*Usually presents in adolescents (40%), but 30% in &lt;10 year olds
*Second most common bone tumor in children, after osteosarcoma
*Approximately 225 cases annually in U.S.
*Primarily in white children; black and Asian children rarely affected


==Clinical Presentation==
*Localized pain and swelling
*Systemic symptoms (fever, low appetite, weight loss) in ~30%
*Distribution
**Lower extremity 40-45% (femur 22%, tibia 11%, fibula 9%)
**Pelvis 20-25%
**Chest wall 15-20%
**Upper extremity 10% (humerus 10%)
*Metastatic disease (20-25%)
**Primary spread is hematogenous
**Most commonly to lungs, bones, BM, soft tissue, brain, spine
**Bilateral bone marrow biopsy part of staging, regardless of tumor size


==Radiologic Findings==
*Should include bone scan, CXR, CT or MRI of primary, CT of chest
*Plain films show &quot;onion skinning&quot; (soft tissue mass growing out from the bone, giving rise to multilamellated periosteal reaction) vs &quot;sunburst&quot; pattern seen in osteosarcoma.


==Staging==
*Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Bone/Staging|bone tumors staging]] page


==Pathology==
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Small_round_blue_cell_tumors|Small round blue cell tumor]], likely arising in the bone marrow 
*Fusion between [[w:Ewing_sarcoma_breakpoint_region_1|EWS]] gene and a partner gene which presumably dysregulates cell growth
**t(11;22) EWS-FLI1 (85%)
**t(21;22) EWS-ERF (10-15%)
**Other EWS fusions occur rarely (ETV1, E1AF, FEV)


==Prognostic factors==
*''Disease site:'' non-pelvic is favorable, with distal, ribs and other having the best prognosis. Pelvic site is unfavorable. Proximal sites are intermediate.
*''Age:'' younger is favorable
*''Size:'' &gt;8cm is unfavorable
*''Labs:'' anemia, elevated ESR, leukocytosis, and elevated LDH associated with worse prognosis
*''Not prognostic:'' sex and time from onset of symptoms


==Treatment Overview==
*Ewing's sarcoma is essentially an occult metastatic disease, and chemotherapy is the backbone of treatment
**Radiation alone had cure rate ~10%, with majority failing distally
*Chemotherapy is typically given for 12-15 weeks prior to local therapy
*Local control is imperative, either with surgery, or radiation therapy, or both
**No randomized studies comparing the two treatment approaches
**Surgery favored if complete resection is feasible without significant morbidity and functional loss
**Radiation favored for central lesions
*Radiation dose
**Doses &gt;60 Gy result in unacceptable risk of secondary bone malignancies
**Doses &lt;40 Gy have unacceptable local failures
**Currently, ~45 Gy are given for microscopic disease and ~55.8 Gy for gross disease (DeVita 8th ed)
**Whole lung radiation used for consolidation after chemotherapy


==Chemotherapy regimens==
*Standard 5-drug U.S. regimen (VCD + IE): vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide x48 weeks
*Original IESS regimen (VAC): vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide
*VAC + ADR - vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide + adriamycin

==Radiation==
===Localized disease===
*'''St. Jude''' (1978-88) -- used chemo before surgery
**Prospective, non-randomized. 60 pts. Localized osseous Ewing's. 
***Induction chemo (ACx5) -&gt; Resection (if possible) -&gt; RT with concurrent chemo -&gt; more chemo (total 57 wks).
***''RT'' to initial (pre-chemotherapy) osseous tumor and residual soft tissue tumor extension. 3 cm margins. No RT given if resection with negative margins. 35-41 Gy for positive margins. 35 Gy for those with CR after chemo. 50.4 Gy for those with residual tumor after chemo or a tumor &gt;8 cm initially. 1.5-1.8 Gy/fx. ''Chemo'' consisted of VCR/DAC during RT, followed by CYC/ADR and VCR/DAC. 
**PMID 1938559, 1991 &amp;mdash; &quot;Ewing's sarcoma: local tumor control and patterns of failure following limited-volume radiation therapy.&quot; Arai Y et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1991 Nov;21(6):1501-8. 
***5-yr EFS 59%, similar to other studies. 64% achieved CR to induction chemo. LC 68% at 5-yrs. LC depended on tumor size, +/- 8 cm.

*'''POG 8346''' (1983-88)
**Randomized. 178 pts. Osseous Ewing's only (excluded PNET and extraosseous).
***Induction chemotherapy: CYC/ADR x 5.
***Assess response: 
***:If PD, XRT and salvage chemo
***:If CR/PR and tumor involved expendable bone (proximal fibular, distal 4/5 of clavicle, body of scapula, iliac wing, ribs), had surgery. Received post-op RT for microscopic or gross residual disease.
***:If not receive surgery, received 55.8 Gy RT and randomized to whole bone RT (39.6 Gy + boost with 2 cm margin) vs a tailored, involved field (same as boost). 
***During RT, received VAC chemo followed by weekly VCR. Maintenance chemo given for a total of 50 wks. 
**PMID 9747829, 1998 &amp;mdash; &quot;A multidisciplinary study investigating radiotherapy in Ewing's sarcoma: end results of POG #8346. Pediatric Oncology Group.&quot; Donaldson SS et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Aug 1;42(1):125-35.
***5-yr LC for resected tumors was 88% vs 65% with RT alone. No difference in LC between those randomized to whole bone vs involved field. LF was in-field in 62% vs outside in 24%. 
**Conclusion: Most failures are systemic rather than local. Thus, interpretation of local failures is difficult due to competing risks.

===Disseminated disease===
*'''EURO-EWING 99''' (1998-2006) PMID 19924786 -- &quot;The value of local treatment in patients with primary, disseminated, multifocal Ewing sarcoma (PDMES).&quot; (Haeusler J, Cancer. 2010 Jan 15;116(2):443-50.)
**Retrospective. 120 patients. Local treatment of the primary with surgery 22%, surgery + RT 17% or definitive RT 33%. Local treatment of mets surgery 5%, surgergy + RT 7%, definitive RT 27%. No local therapy in 27%
**Outcome: 3-year EFS 24%; by modality surgery 25% vs surgery + RT 47% vs RT 23% vs no local therapy 13% (SS). 3-year EFS if treatment of primary and met 39% vs either primary or met 17% vs no local therapy 14% (SS)
**Conclusion: Local therapy of involved sites important for patients with disseminated Ewing sarcoma and should complement systemic treatment whenever possible

==Intergroup IESS Trials==
*'''IESS-III''' (1988-92)
**518 pts. Ewings's, PNET of bone, or primitive sarcoma of bone. Allowed both localized and metastatic (23%). 
***Randomized to VAC+ADR or VAC+ADR alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide. 
***''Chemotherapy'' was given q3weeks x 17 courses, total of 49 weeks. At week 12, radiation therapy or surgery was performed. ''RT'' was 45 Gy to initial tumor volume (with 3 cm margin) + 1080 cGy boost = 5580 cGy. For those undergoing resection, RT was to 45 Gy for microscopic residual (with 1 cm margin).

***For non-metastatic pts, 5-yr EFS 69% vs 54% for VAC+ADR+IE vs VAC+ADR; RR=1.6. 5-yr OS 72% vs 61%; RR=1.6. Greater reduction in LR than in distant mets. Greater benefit for large primary tumors or pelvic tumors. For pts with mets, no difference between regimens: 5-yr EFS 22% and OS 34%. 
**Conclusion: improved survival with addition of ifosfamide and etoposide (in non-metastatic pts).

Tapas are often defined as bite-sized Spanish hors-d'oeuvres, and many people think of them as appetizers.  Tapas are more than just appetizers; they are an integral part of Spanish cuisine and customs.  Tapas originated many centuries ago in the southern region of Spain known as Andalucía.

The most popular explanation for the origin of tapas is that they began when innkeepers began placing saucers or pieces of bread atop their customers' wine glasses as a way to prevent flies from swarming in.  &quot;Tapa&quot; is the Spanish word for &quot;cover&quot; or &quot;lid&quot;.  These small portions of food that were used to cover glasses proved to be a good way of attracting customers into bars, which is why tapas have evolved from a simple piece of bread into more intricate culinary works.

Although tapas originated in the south, they are served in every region of Spain.  Some bars serve tapas for free when a drink is ordered, for example olives or nuts are commonly free of charge.  

Tapas are an important part of Spanish tradition and culture because they bring families and friends together.  It is common for Spaniards to gather at bars or bodegas for drinks and conversation, while sharing &quot;raciones&quot;, or portions of tapas.

There are many different varieties of tapas, but some of the most well known include:

Green olives marinated in hers and garlic are very common in Spanish restaurants. They are commonly served free when you order a drink, and are often served with toasted, salted nuts.

This recipe makes 1 pound (450 G).  Preparation time is about 10 minutes, and takes 3-7 days to marinate.

==Ingredients==

*2 cups (16oz/450g) unpitted large green Spanish olives
*7 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
*2 bay leaves
*1/2 medium lemon, sliced
*1 teaspoon dried oregano
*1 teaspoon ground fennel seeds
*1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
*1/2 teaspoon ground cumin seeds
*1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
*1/2 teaspoon Spanish paprika
*1/2 teaspoon black pepper

==Procedure==

# Lightly crush the olives with a mallet, or make slight slits on each olive with a knife, to ensure that the marinade permeates them.  
# Place the olives in a sealable glass jar and add the remaining ingredients.  
# Fill the jar with water and shake well.  
# Marinate at room temperature for several days to a week.

Serve the olives with toasted almonds and fresh bread.

BTW, I also want to give you a personal welcome to Wikibooks.  Seriously.  Every new contributor is valued and I hope that you will continue to develop content for Wikibooks and help this project succeed.

One point I wanted to bring up is that you uploaded an image to Wikibooks that already existed on [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]].  It is unnecessary to do this, and counter productive to Wikimedia projects.  If you want to add an image from the Wikimedia Commons, all you have to do (now) is to simply put the name of the image as it appears in commons.  That also gives the proper copyright attribution for the image (which for [[:Image:Ford escape hybrid.jpg]] is not public domain... please be careful about copyright notices like that... this image is copyrighted).  The Mediawiki software (the computer software running Wikibooks) automatically brings in the image from commons if it can't be found on Wikibooks.

If you do upload an image, please make sure you do note where you obtained the image, or make it clear that you were the original photographer and have given permission to Wikibooks to use the image.  It is strongly recommended that you upload most images to Wikimedia Commons instead unless there are special circumstances about the use of those images.

Please, have fun here on Wikibooks, and I hope that your Wikibook is going to be a success.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:52, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

==1. Properly start an automobile or light truck engine with an automatic transmission and one with a standard transmission. Explain why it is necessary for the engine to have the proper oil, water, fuel, and battery pressures and levels for proper engine operation.==
===Starting an Automatic===
To start a vehicle with an automatic transmission, sit in the driver's seat and make sure the vehicle is in ''Park''.  Insert the key in the ignition and turn it clockwise as far as it will go.  The engine should crank.  Do not depress the gas pedal.  As soon as the engine starts, release the key.  To turn it off, turn the key counter-clockwise.

===Starting a Manual===
To start a vehicle with a manual transmission, sit in the driver's seat and push the clutch pedal all the way in with the left foot.  The clutch pedal is the third one from the right, and this is often the one farthest to the left (although some vehicles have the parking brake to the left of the clutch).

Make sure the parking brake has been applied.  Inexperienced drivers should also shift the vehicle into neutral so that if the foot slips off the clutch after the engine starts, the car does not move.  Even with the vehicle in neutral, it is still important to depress the clutch, as many autos have a switch in the clutch which prevents the engine from starting unless the clutch is depressed.  Insert the key in the ignition and turn it clockwise as far as it will go.  The engine should crank.  Do not depress the gas pedal, but leave the clutch pedal depressed.  As soon as the engine starts, release the key.  To turn it off, turn the key counter-clockwise.

===Importance of Proper Pressures and Levels===
'''Oil''' keeps the engine lubricated and reduces friction between the moving parts of the engine.  Friction causes heat, so if there is insufficient oil pressure in the engine, it will quickly overheat.  Running an engine without oil for any amount of time will damage it, and doing so for an extended period will destroy it.

'''Water''' circulates through the engine to cool it.  Running an engine too hot will damage it.

'''Fuel''' is what makes the engine go.  If the vehicle has insufficient fuel pressure, the fuel will not flow into the combustion chamber at the proper rate.

The '''Battery''' provides energy to run the engine's starter.  If the battery's voltage level is low, it may not be able to turn the starter.

==2. Explain the principles of four- and two-cycle engines and the difference between gasoline and diesel engines. Explain the major differences between carburetor fuel systems and fuel-injection systems.==
=== Four-cycle Engine===
[[Image:4-Stroke-Engine.gif|right|Four-cycle engine]]
A four-cycle engine is so named because it makes four strokes to generate power.  These strokes are as follows:
# '''Intake Stroke:''' During this stroke, the piston draws a mixture of fuel and air into the cylinder.  The fuel and air enters through an intake valve which opens during this stroke.
# '''Compression Stroke:''' Once the fuel and air have been drawn into the cylinder, the intake valve close and the piston returns towards the engine's head.  This compresses the fuel.
# '''Power Stroke:''' When the piston reaches the top of the cylinder, the spark plug fires, igniting the compressed fuel and air mixture and causing an explosion.  This explosion causes the gases to expand which powers the piston downwards again.  This is where the engines power (and noise!) comes from.
# '''Exhaust Stroke:''' When the piston reaches the bottom of the cylinder, the exhaust valve opens, and as the piston returns to the top of the cylinder again, the exhaust gases are pushed out.  When the cylinder reaches the top again, the four cycles are ready to repeat.

=== Two-cycle Engine===
[[Image:Two-Stroke_Engine.gif|right|Two-cycle engine]]

'''Power and Exhaust Stroke:''' In a two-cycle engine, the spark plug fires every time the piston reaches the top of the cylinder.  This is the beginning of the power and exhaust cycle.  As in the four cycle engine, the spark plug firing causes a compressed air/fuel mixture in the cylinder to explode, and the expanding gases drive the piston downward.  As the cylinder goes down, it compresses another air/fuel mixture inside the ''crankcase'' - not inside the cylinder as in the four-stroke engine.  The crankcase is the area beneath the piston, and the cylinder is the area above the piston.  When the piston nears the bottom of this stroke, it uncovers an exhaust outlet and it also uncovers a passage between the crankcase and the cylinder.  The compressed air-fuel mixture in the crankcase then rushes through this passage-way into the cylinder, forcing the exhaust gases out of the cylinder though the exhaust outlet.  Some of the air/fuel mixture is ''also'' forced out the exhaust outlet, and this unfortunately decreases the engine's fuel efficiency and increases its pollution output.  The piston's head is shaped in such a way as to minimize this waste, but it does not entirely eliminate it.

'''Intake and Compression Stroke:''' After the piston reaches the bottom of the stroke, it begins traveling upwards again, compressing the air/fuel mixture that rushed into the cylinder from the crankcase during the previous stroke, and simultaneously drawing ''more'' air and fuel into the crankcase.  By the time the piston reaches the top of the cylinder, the air/fuel mixture is very highly compressed - much more compressed than it was in the crankcase.  It is at this point in the cycle that the intake valve closes and the spark plug fires.

Because the crankcase is opened to the cylinder during its operation, oil in the crankcase makes its way into the cylinder where it is compressed and combusted along with the fuel.  If this situation were ignored, the engine would soon burn up all its oil, leaving itself unlubricated.  The engine would soon get so hot that its parts would fuse together and destroy itself.  This is addressed by adding oil to the fuel (often one part oil to sixteen parts fuel).  Thus the engine's oil supply is refreshed on every stroke of the piston.  This unfortunately increases the pollution levels generated by two-stroke engines.

===Gasoline verses Diesel Engines===
In many respects, the four-stroke gasoline engine and the four-stroke diesel engine are very similar.  They both follow an operating cycle that consists of intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes.  They also share in the same system for intake and exhaust valves.  The  fuel and air mixture is ignited by the heat generated by the compression stroke in a diesel engine versus the use of a spark ignition system on a gasoline engine.  The diesel engine needs no ignition system.  For this reason, the gasoline engine is referred to as a spark  ignition engine and a diesel engine is referred to as a compression ignition engine.  

The  fuel and air mixture is compressed to about one-twentieth of its original volume in a diesel engine.  In contrast, the fuel and air mixture in a gasoline engine is compressed to about one-eighth of its original volume.  The diesel engine must compress the mixture this tightly to generate enough heat to ignite the fuel and air  mixture.

The gasoline engine mixes the fuel and air before it reaches the combustion chamber.  A diesel engine takes in only air through the intake port.  Fuel is put into the combustion chamber directly through an injection system.  The air and fuel then mix in the combustion chamber. 

The engine speed and the power output of a diesel engine are controlled by the quantity of fuel admitted to the combustion chamber.  The amount of air is constant.  This contrasts with the  gasoline engine where the speed and power output are regulated by limiting the air entering the  engine.

===Carburetor verses Fuel Injection Systems===
'''The carburetor''' serves the following basic functions: 
#The carburetor mixes fuel and air Into the correct proportions for the most efficient use by the engine.  The carburetor  also must constantly vary the mixture proportions to meet the engine’s needs as Its speed and load requirements vary. 
#The carburetor regulates engine speed and power output. 
#The carburetor atomizes the fuel as it mixes it with the air.

'''Fuel injection systems''' are an increasingly popular alternative to the carburetor for providing    an air-fuel mixture.  They inject, under pressure, a measured amount of fuel into the Intake air, usually at a point near the intake valve.  Fuel injection systems provide the following advantages. 
#Fuel delivery can be measured with extreme accuracy, giving the potential for improved fuel economy and performance. 
#Because the fuel is injected at the intake port of each cylinder, fuel distribution will be much better and fuel condensing in the manifold will not be a problem. 
#The fuel injector, working under pressure, can atomize the fuel much finer than the carburetor, resulting in improved fuel vaporization.

==3. Describe the construction of a typical gasoline engine and explain briefly the function of these units:==
===a. Engine: crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, camshaft, valves, oil pump, carburetor, fuel injectors, ignition distributor, fuel distributor, electrical system including alternator, battery, and regulator===
[[Image:Cshaft.gif|thumb|300px|Crankshaft, connecting rods, and four pistons]]
As can be seen in the diagram to the right, the '''pistons''' drive the '''crankshaft''' via the '''connecting rods'''.  The connecting rods and crankshaft convert the back-and-forth motion of the pistons into rotary motion.

The '''camshaft''' is a smaller rotating shaft with small &quot;bumps&quot; on it called cams.  As the cams rotate, they lift and lower the valves at just the right time to allow gasses to either flow into the cylinder or escape from it.

The '''oil pump''' moves oil through the engine to keep the internal parts well lubricated.

The function of the '''carburetor''' and '''fuel injector''' were covered in requirement 3.

The '''ignition distributor''' has several jobs to do in the ignition system.  First, it must close and open the primary circuit to produce the magnetic buildup and collapse in the ignition coil.  Second, it times these actions so the resultant high-voltage surges from the secondary will be produced at the right time.  Third, it must establish a timing sequence to direct the high-voltage surges to the proper spark plugs. 

The distributor injection system used in automotive diesel engines is classed as a low-pressure system in that pumping, metering, and distribution operations take place at low pressure.  The high pressure required for injection is built up by the injector at each cylinder.  A suction pump lifts fuel from the tank and delivers it to the float chamber.   From here a second low-pressure pump delivers the fuel to the '''fuel distributor'''.   Fuel passes through the distributor to the metering pump, where it is divided into measured charges.  The fuel charges then are delivered back to the distributor, where they are sent to the injectors in the proper sequence.  

====Electrical system====

The '''alternator''' is an electrical generator.  As the engine turns a shaft in the alternator, it generates electricity to run everything in the car's electrical system, including the headlights, on-board computers, radio, and more.  It also recharges the battery.

The '''battery''' is used primarily for starting the vehicle.  When the car is not running, the alternator cannot generate any electricity, so the battery must do this.  It will also power the headlights, radio, and a few other things.  The most common way a battery &quot;dies&quot; is when someone leaves the headlights on for too long with the engine off.  

The '''regulator''' evens out the voltage coming out of the alternator before it is fed to the rest of the electrical system.  The voltage from the alternator can vary depending on a lot of different factors, and it is the regulator's job to make sure that none of the other components have to deal with varying amounts of power.  Without the regulator, the headlights would brighten and dim as the alternator's voltage varied.

===b. Difference between standard transmission and automatic transmission and how the engine torque is transmitted to both kinds of transmissions; the purpose of overdrive===
The transmission couples the engine to the drive shaft and has two main functions: 
#Control direction of travel (forward or revers)
#Provide the operator with a selection of gear ratios between engine and wheels so that the vehicle can operate at best efficiency under a variety of driving conditions and loads.

In a vehicle with a '''standard transmission''' the driver selects the desired gear manually.   In a vehicle with an '''automatic transmission''' the transmission makes the gear selection itself depending on throttle position, vehicle speed, and the position of the shift control lever.  

In both cases, engine torque is transmitted to the wheels via a clutch.  Automotive clutches depend on friction for their operation, whether it be solid friction as in the conventional clutch (found on a standard transmission), or fluid friction and inertia as utilized in the fluid coupling and torque converter (found on an automatic transmission).

'''Overdrive''' can refer to two different things. An overdrive is a device which was commonly used on rear-wheel drive automobiles to allow the choice of an extra-high overall gear ratio for high speed cruising, thus saving fuel, at the cost of less torque.

It also refers to a combination of gearing inside a transmission or transaxle which results in the output speed being greater than the input speed. In the latter case, &quot;overdrive&quot; does not refer to a physically separate identifiable part/assembly.

===c. Difference between rear wheel drive and front wheel drive===
If you put a car on a hydraulic lift, raised all four wheels off the ground, turned on the engine, and put it in gear, the rear wheels of rear-wheel drive vehicle would turn, while the front wheels of a front-wheel drive vehicle would turn.  In a four-wheel drive vehicle, all four wheels would spin.  The terms simply indicate which wheels are connected to the engine via the transmission.

===d. Difference between drum brakes and disk brakes, standard brakes and power brakes, and the parking brake===
[[Image:Drum Brake parts.jpg|thumb|400px|Drum Brakes]]
The diagram on the right shows the parts of a '''drum brake''' system.  The brake is taken apart in this photo showing the brake drum on the left, and the brake shoes on the right.  In operation, the shoes fit inside the drum.  The drum rotates with the wheel, and the shoes are held stationary.  When the brakes are applied, the shoes press against the inside surface of the drum, and the friction produced slows the wheels, stopping them ultimately.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Disk brake dsc03680.jpg|thumb|400px|Disc Brakes]]
The diagram on the right shows the parts of a '''disk brake''' system.  Here, the disk (gold) rotates with the wheel, and a stationary pair of ''calipers'' (red) squeeze both sides of the disc.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
In '''standard brakes''' the energy supplied by the operator’s foot in pushing down on the brake pedal is transferred to the brake mechanism on the wheels by various means.  A mechanical  hookup has been used since the earliest motor vehicles, but hydraulic pressure is used most extensively at the present time. Mechanically operated braking systems are obsolete on today’s automobiles, but these systems may be used for a portion of the braking systems in many vehicles.

'''Power braking''' systems are designed to reduce the effort required to depress the brake    pedal when stopping or holding a vehicle stationary. Most power brake systems use the difference in pressure between intake manifold vacuum and atmospheric pressure to develop the  additional force required to decrease brake pedal pressure.  When a vehicle is powered by a diesel engine, the absence of intake manifold vacuum requires the use of an auxiliary vacuum pump.  This type of pump usually is driven by the engine or by an electric motor.

The '''parking brake''' usually is operated by an auxiliary foot pedal or hand lever located in the driver compartment.  This brake mechanism is designed to keep the vehicle stationary when the operator is not present.  It is usually integrated into the disk or drum brake system (which ever is used) and locks in place until released by the operator.

==4. Perform typical automotive maintenance as listed below:==
===a. Check engine and transmission oil levels.===
There are usually two dipsticks in the engine compartment for checking the engine oil and transmission oil levels.  Once the dipstick is located, simply pull it out, wipe it clean on a rag or paper towel, reinsert it, pull it out again and check the level.  The dipstick will be wet with oil up to the level of the fluid, and fluid levels are marked on the stick itself.

===b. Check water/anti-freeze level. Change and flush the cooling system.===
The coolant level (also known as antifreeze) can be checked by looking in a plastic reservoir off the dise of the engine.  This reservoir is usually mounted on the fender or on the front grill.  It has markings on the side and an overflow area.  It is also semi-transparent so that you can see the level of the coolant inside.

====Flushing the cooling system====
#The first thing you will need to do is make sure the engine is cool.  It is very dangerous to open the cooling system on a hot engine, as serious burns can result.  While you're waiting for the engine to cool, get a container that will hold at least two gallons.  You will drain the coolant into this.  Apply the parking brake.
#Set the vehicles temperature control to ''Hot''.  This opens a valve in some vehicles, connecting (or isolating) the car's heater and the cooling system.
#Open the radiator cap and locate the valve at the bottom of the radiator.  If there is no valve, you may have to disconnect the hose at the bottom of the radiator.  Get the catch container ready, open the valve, and maneuver the catch container into position to catch the coolant which should begin flowing as soon as you open the valve.
#Allow the radiator to drain.  This may take a while.  When coolant stops coming out, close the valve again.
#Fill the radiator with water - not with coolant.  Turn on the engine, let it run until the engine's cooling fan turns on.  This means the thermostat has opened and has allowed the coolant to flow into the engine.  Turn off the engine.  Drain the water out using the same steps as outlined above.
#Add a 50-50 mixture of water and antifreeze to the radiator until it is about an inch from the fill neck.  Add more coolant to the reservoir, filling it to the &quot;full&quot; line.  Then - with the radiator cap off - turn the engine on again while monitoring the coolant level.  Add more coolant as the level drops, until it quits dropping.  Replace the radiator cap.
#Take the waste coolant to a service station for recycling.
#After driving the vehicle for the first time after flushing the cooling system, let it cool and check the coolant level - both in the reservoir and by removing the radiator cap.  Add coolant if it is necessary.

===c. Change engine oil and filter.===
When an engine is not running, the oil collects in an oil pan or sump at the bottom of the crankcase. There is an oil drain plug normally screwed into a drain hole at the bottom of the oil pan which is accessible from underneath the vehicle. To change the oil in a vehicle's engine, the drain plug is unscrewed to let the oil drain out of the oil pan and into a container. After the used oil drains out, the plug is screwed back into the drain hole. Some drain plugs have a replaceable washer to prevent leakage due to corrosion, rust or worn threads in the drain hole. The removable oil filter can be unscrewed at this time, often with the help of an oil filter removal tool, or in some cases, by hand.  Then a new oil filter screwed back in after applying fresh oil to the sealing surface of the new filter. Then new oil is poured in through an otherwise capped opening at the top of the engine. For many cars, 4 to 5 quarts or liters of oil are needed to fill the engine.  Take the old motor oil to a service station for recycling.  '''It is illegal to dispose of used motor oil in the trash or dump it into the environment!'''

===d. Change a tire/wheel assembly, following proper safety procedure.===
#Locate the point on the car designed to take the jack.  This is usually illustrated in the owner's manual, and is often a point on the chassis a few inches behind the front tire, or a few inches in front of the rear tire.  
#Place ''chocks'' around two of the car's tires.  If changing a front tire, place the chocks on the two rear tires.  If changing a rear tire, place them on the front tires.  Chocks are brick-sized blocks that prevent the car from rolling.  Indeed, you can use about anything for a chock, so long as it will stand up to the pressure of a car being parked on it, and if it is tall enough to prevent the car from rolling over it.  Bricks, blocks, blocks of wood, or even large rocks can be used as chocks, or you can use store-bought ones.
#Set the parking brake.
#Loosen the lug nuts, but do not remove them yet.  It is easier to loosen them before jacking up the vehicle because the tires will remain stationary.  Once the vehicle is jacked up, the wheels will easily rotate, making it more difficult to loosen the lug nuts.  It may be necessary to remove the hubcap to get at the lug nuts.  The hubcap usually prys off with a screw driver or with the end of the jack handle.  Be careful not to damage the hubcap.
#Place the jack beneath the jack point and use it to lift the vehicle.  '''Do not ever lift more than one tire from the ground at a time!'''  This is a very dangerous thing to do, because it makes it ''very'' easy to knock a car off the jacks.  
#Stop lifting the vehicle as soon as the tire is lifted from the ground.
#Finish removing the lug nuts.
#Once all the lug nuts have been removed, you may pull the tire/wheel assembly towards yourself and off the wheel mount.  Once it's off, you can carefully roll it out of the way and get the new tire (or the same tire since this is likely an exercise, and there is likely nothing wrong with the tire in the first place).
#Lift the new tire onto the wheelmount, aligning the holes in the wheel with the bolts on the wheel mount.  Push the tire into position and quickly put a lug nut or two in place.  Get them all on, and finger-tight first, and then get the lug wrench out and begin tightening the first lugnut.  
#After the first lug nut is tightened, move to the one on the opposite side of the wheel (or as near to opposite as you can get) and tighten it.  Continue tightening the other nuts, going to opposite sides of the wheel each time so that they are tightened evenly.  When they are all right, lower the jack.
#Remove the jack.
#Go around the lug nuts again, tightening them further.  With the car's weight preventing the tires from rotating, you should be able to tighten them a little more (but don't overdo it).
#Congratulate yourself on a job well done.

===e. Lubricate the chassis according to the vehicle service manual.===
[[Image:Grease Gun US Dep. of Labour.jpg|thumb|200px|Grease gun]]
Lubrication of the chassis is accomplished by using a grease gun.  Grease guns have a tube on them through which the grease is forced.  At the end of this tube is a fitting that attaches to a grease nipple.  The vehicle service manual will show you where to find the grease nipples.  First wipe any dirt or foreign material from the grease nipple.  Then place the grease gun on the grease nipple and force grease into it.  Remove the grease gun and wipe the grease nipple clean so that no dirt accumulates there.  Do this to all the grease nipples on the vehicle.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==5. How often should the engine oil, transmission oil, and cooling fluid be changed?==
The manufacturer specifies how often the '''oil changes''' should be made. For example, most people believe that the oil change frequency should be every 3000 miles or every 3 months, whichever comes sooner. This 3000 mile oil change interval has been relentlessly promoted by oil changing companies for decades. It had a scientific basis when engines used non-multi-weight, non-detergent oil. It no longer has any scientific basis, but it is still being promoted by certain entities, most notably the oil change industry in the United States (including car dealerships). Most manufacturers recommend oil change intervals of 6,000 miles or more for modern cars. For convenience, the oil filter is usually also replaced at the time the oil is changed. 

'''Transmission fluid''' change frequency is specified in the owner's manual, but is most often every 15,000 miles.  

How often the '''coolant''' should be flushed and changed is also spelled out in the owner's manual.  30,000 miles or three years is typical.

==6. Give some pointers on proper care of the vehicle and its finish, both interior and exterior.==
The owner's manual has a service schedule in it, telling you how often to change the oil, various filters, and other maintenance items.  You also need to check tire inflation and tread wear on a regular basis.  If you have ever pedaled a bicycle with low tires, you know that it requires ''much'' more effort to propel a vehicle with improperly inflated tires.  

Keep your vehicle clean, and wax it at least once per year (in the autumn is best so the car's finish is protected from any road salt).  Vacuum the interior as often as you change the oil, as any dirt that stays in the carpet will accelerate carpet wear.  Wipe vinyl and leather seats down with an appropriate cleaner and vacuum cloth seats.  You should also clean the dashboard and interior door panels regularly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intro==

A flip-flop is a circuit which exists in one of two states and so can store information. A simple flip-flop can be defined in terms of two NAND logic gates. Flip-flops are non linear circuits, meaning the output from one of its gates is fed 'back' to be processed with the input signal. Because flip-flops operate on an input signal mixed with this previous output signal their own outputs are dependent upon their previous state.


A flip flop (F/F) is a device made out of digital gates that uses feedback to store the state (1 or 0) of its input(s). Flip Flops are frequently used to latch input data. Meaning that in a circuit they are fed some binary value and then hold it until the latch is turned off. All flip flops have at least one output labeled Q. Frequently they have a complement, labeled /Q. The 4 basic flip flops are SR, D, Toggle and JK.


A latch is an example of a bistable multivibrator, that is, a device with exactly two stable states.  These states are high-output and low-output.  A latch has a feedback path, so information can be retained by the device. Therefore latches can be memory devices, and can store one bit of data for as long as the device is powered. As the name suggests, latches are used to &quot;latch onto&quot; information and hold in place. Latches are very similar to [[Digital Circuits/Flip-Flops|flip-flops]], but are not synchronous devices, and do not operate on clock edges as flip-flops do.

==SR latch==
An '''SR latch''' (Set/Reset) is an asynchronous device: it works independently of control signals and relies only on the state of the S and R inputs.  In the image we can see that an SR flip-flop can be created with two NOR gates that have a cross-feedback loop. SR latches can also be made from NAND gates, but the inputs are swapped and negated. In this case, it is sometimes called an '''{{overline|SR}} latch'''.


[[File:RS Flip-flop (NOR).svg|An SR latch made from two NOR gates.]]&lt;br&gt;
[[File:SR Flip-flop Diagram.svg|An {{overline|SR}} latch made from two NAND gates.]]

When a high is applied to the ''Set'' line of an SR latch, the ''Q'' output goes high (and {{overline|Q}} low). The feedback mechanism, however, means that the ''Q'' output will remain high, even when the ''S'' input goes low again. This is how the latch serves as a memory device.  Conversely, a high input on the ''Reset'' line will drive the ''Q'' output low (and {{overline|''Q''}} high), effectively resetting the latch's &quot;memory&quot;. When both inputs are low, the latch &quot;latches&quot; – it remains in its previously set or reset state.

When both inputs are high at once, however, there is a problem: it is being told to simultaneously produce a high ''Q ''and a low ''Q''. This produces a &quot;race condition&quot; within the circuit - whichever flip flop succeeds in changing first will feedback to the other and assert itself. Ideally, both gates are identical and this is &quot;metastable&quot;, and the device will be in an undefined state for an indefinite period. In real life, due to manufacturing methods, one gate will always win, but it's impossible to tell which it will be for a particular device from an assembly line. The state of ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is therefore &quot;illegal&quot; and should never be entered.

When the device is powered up, a similar condition occurs, because both outputs, ''Q'' and {{overline|Q}}, are low. Again, the device will quickly exit the metastable state due to differences between the two gates, but it's impossible to predict which of ''Q'' and {{overline|''Q''}} will end up high. To avoid spurious actions, you should always set SR flip-flops to a known initial state before using them - you must not assume that they will initialise to a low state.

In general, RS Flip Flop has a symbol and a truth table as shown

===Gated SR latch===
In some situations it may be desirable to dictate when the latch can and cannot latch.  The '''gated SR latch''' is a simple extension of the SR latch which provides an ''Enable'' line which must be driven high before data can be latched.  Even though a control line is now required, the SR latch is not synchronous, because the inputs can change the output even in the middle of an enable pulse.

When the ''Enable'' input is low, then the outputs from the AND gates must also be low, thus the ''Q'' and {{overline|''Q''}} outputs remain latched to the previous data.  Only when the enable input is high can the state of the latch change, as shown in the truth table. When the enable line is asserted, a gated SR latch is identical in operation to an SR latch.

The ''Enable'' line is sometimes a clock signal, but is usually a read or write [[Digital Circuits/Glossary#S|strobe]].

==D latch==
The '''D latch''' (D for &quot;data&quot;) or '''transparent latch''' is a simple extension of the gated SR latch that removes the possibility of invalid input states.

Since the gated SR latch allows us to latch the output without using the ''S'' or ''R'' inputs, we can remove one of the inputs by driving both the ''Set'' and ''Reset'' inputs with a complementary driver: we remove one input and automatically make it the inverse of the remaining input.

The D latch outputs the ''D'' input whenever the ''Enable'' line is high, otherwise the output is whatever the ''D'' input was when the ''Enable'' input was last high. This is why it is also known as a transparent latch - when ''Enable'' is asserted, the latch is said to be &quot;transparent&quot; - it signals propagate directly through it as if it isn't there.

D latches are often used in I/O ports of integrated circuits and are available as discrete devices, often multiply packaged. An example is the 74HC75, part of the 7400 series of ICs, containing four separate D latches.



===RS Flip Flops===
[[Image:SR (NAND) Flip-flop.svg|The symbol for an SR latch.]]

The fundamental latch is the simple ''SR flip-flop '', where S and R stand for ''set'' and ''reset'' respectively. It can be constructed from a pair of cross-coupled NOR logic gates.  The stored bit is present on the output marked  Q.

Normally, in storage mode, the S and R inputs are both low, and feedback maintains the Q and &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt; outputs in a constant state, with &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt; the complement of Q.  If S (''Set'') is pulsed high while R is held low, then the Q output is forced high, and stays high even after S returns low; similarly, if R (''Reset'') is pulsed high while S is held low, then the Q output is forced low, and stays low even after R returns low.

===D Flip Flops===
[[Image:D-Type Flip-flop.svg|D flip-flop symbol]]

The Q output always takes on the state of the D input at the moment of a rising clock edge. (or falling edge if the clock input is active low)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.play-hookey.com/digital/d_nand_flip-flop.html The D Flip-Flop&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is called the '''D''' flip-flop for this reason, since the output takes the value of the '''D''' input or ''Data'' input, and ''Delays'' it by one clock count.  The D flip-flop can be interpreted as a primitive memory cell, zero-order hold, or delay line. 

Truth table:

[[File:4_Bit_Shift_Register_001.svg|thumb|right|4-bit serial-in, serial-out shift register]]

These flip flops are very useful, as they form the basis for shift registers, which are an essential part of many electronic devices.  The advantage of the D flip-flop over the D-type latch is that it &quot;captures&quot; the signal at the moment the clock goes high, and subsequent changes of the data line do not influence Q until the next rising clock edge. An exception is that some flip-flops have a 'reset' signal input, which will reset Q (to zero), and may be either asynchronous or synchronous with the clock.

The above circuit shifts the contents of the register to the right, one bit position on each active transition of the clock. The input X is shifted into the leftmost bit position.

===Toggle Flip Flops===

[[Image:T-Type Flip-flop.svg|A circuit symbol for a T-type flip-flop, where &gt; is the clock input, T is the toggle input and Q is the stored data output.]]
If the T input is high, the T flip-flop changes state (&quot;toggles&quot;) whenever the clock input is strobed. If the T input is low, the flip-flop holds the previous value. This behavior is described by the characteristic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{next} = T \oplus Q&lt;/math&gt; (or, without benefit of the XOR operator, the equivalent: &lt;math&gt;Q_{next} = T\overline{Q} + \overline{T}Q&lt;/math&gt;)

and can be described in a truth table:

|-

|}

When T is held high, the toggle flip-flop divides the clock frequency by two; that is, if clock frequency is 4 MHz, the output frequency obtained from the flip-flop will be 2 MHz. This 'divide by' feature has application in various types of digital counters.  A T flip-flop can also be built using a JK flip-flop (J &amp; K pins are connected together and act as T) or D flip-flop (T input and Q&lt;sub&gt;previous&lt;/sub&gt; is connected to the D input through an XOR gate).

===JK Flip Flops===
[[Image:JK Flip-flop.svg|A circuit symbol for a JK flip-flop, where &gt; is the clock input, J and K are data inputs, Q is the stored data output, and Q' is the inverse of Q.]]
[[Image:JK timing diagram.svg|JK flip-flop timing diagram]]



The '''JK''' flip-flop augments the behavior of the SR flip-flop (J=Set, K=Reset) by interpreting the S = R = 1 condition as a &quot;flip&quot; or toggle command. Specifically, the combination J = 1, K = 0 is a command to set the flip-flop; the combination J = 0, K = 1 is a command to reset the flip-flop; and the combination J = K = 1 is a command to toggle the flip-flop, i.e., change its output to the logical complement of its current value. Setting J = K = 0 does NOT result in a D flip-flop, but rather, will hold the current state.  To synthesize a D flip-flop, simply set K equal to the complement of J. The JK flip-flop is therefore a universal flip-flop, because it can be configured to work as an SR flip-flop, a D flip-flop, or a T flip-flop.
NOTE: The flip flop is positive edge triggered (Clock Pulse) as seen in the timing diagram.


The characteristic equation of the JK flip-flop is:

&lt;math&gt;Q_{next} = J\overline Q + \overline KQ&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding truth table is:

==Edward the Confessor (1042-1066)==

'''Edward the Confessor''' was born in Islip, Oxfordshire around the year 1004. He was the penultimate Anglo-Saxon King of England and the last of the House of Wessex, ruling from 1042 until his death in 1066. His reign marked the continuing disintegration of royal power in England, which was replaced by more power going to the great territorial earls.

Edward, along with his brothers, was taken to Normandy by his mother Emma, the sister of the Duke of Normandy, Richard II, in 1013 to escape the Danish invasion of England. In his quarter-century of Norman exile, Edward developed an intense personal piety and gained a familiarity with Normandy and its leaders that was to influence his later rule. 

In 1036 he returned to England with his brother Alfred to try to displace Harold Harefoot as king, but this failed, Alfred was caught and brutally killed by Earl Godwin with a red hot poker. Luckily, Edward escaped back to Normandy. In 1041 he was invited back by the Anglo-Saxon lay and ecclesiastical nobility to be co-ruler with Harthacanute, and when Harthacanute died in June 1042, Edward ascended the throne. He was crowned at Winchester Cathedral on 3 April 1043.

===Edward's Reign===

Edward's reign was marked by peace and prosperity, but to rule effectively Edward had to come to terms with three powerful nobles. The first of these was Godwin, Earl of Wessex, who was firmly in control of Wessex which had formerly been the heart of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy. Next there was Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and in the north there was Siward, Earl of Northumbria. 

Edward favoured Normans, however, and this frustrated both Saxon and Danish nobles and fueled the growth of anti-Norman opinion led by Godwin, who had become the king's father-in-law in 1045. The breaking point came when Edward appointed the then Bishop of London, the Norman Robert Jumièges, as Archbishop of Canterbury rather than Godwin's preferred choice. There was a bloody riot at Dover between the townsfolk and Edward's kinsman, Eustace, Count of Boulogne. After Godwin refused to punish the townsfolk, Leofric and Siward backed King Edward and Godwin and his family were all exiled in September 1051. Edward's queen, Eadgyth, who was also Godwin's daughter, was sent to a nunnery at Wherwell. Godwin returned with an army a year later forcing the king to restore his title and send away his Norman advisors. Godwin died in 1053 and a Norman, Ralph the Timid, was given Herefordshire but his son Harold accumulated even greater territories for the Godwins and later became Edward's successor.

===Marriage and Heirs===

Edward married Godwin's daughter, Eadyth of Wessex, on 23 January 1045. They had no children. His nearest heir would have been a nephew, also called Edward, who was born in England but spent most of his life in Hungary. He had returned from exile in 1056 and died not long after, in February the following year. So Edward made his great nephew Edgar Atheling his heir, but Edgar did not have much of a following among the nobles and this led to Harold Godwinson being declared king

===Death and Legacy===

Edward died in January 1066. The cult that grew up around him in the mediaeval period under the later Plantagenet kings has had a lasting impact on English history. Edward had founded Westminster Abbey, where he was buried, sometime between 1045 and 1050, and it was consecrated on 28 December 1065. When Henry II came to the throne in 1154, he united the Saxon and Norman royal lines. To reinforce his legitimacy, the cult of King Edward the Confessor was promoted. Westminster Abbey was redesigned to contain a shrine to Edward, which remains there to this day. After much lobbying, Edward was made a saint by Pope Alexander III in 1161. At the time when Edward was made a saint, there were two types: martyrs and confessors. Martyrs were people who died in the service of the Lord, and confessors were people who died natural deaths. Since Edward died a natural death, he was styled Edward the Confessor.

The Roman Catholic Church now regards Edward the Confessor as the patron saint of kings, difficult marriages and separated spouses. After the reign of Henry II, Edward was considered the patron saint of England until 1348 when he was replaced in this role by Saint George. He remains the patron saint of the Royal Family.

==Harold Godwinson (1066)==
[[Image:Harold2.jpg|210px|thumb|right|King Harold II]]
'''Harold Godwinson''' or '''Harold II of England''' was born around the year 1022 in Wessex. He ruled from 5 January to 14 October 1066, when he was killed at the Battle of Hastings. Harold's father was Godwin, the powerful Earl of Wessex. Godwin married twice and it was his second marriage that produced Harold, Tostig and Edith. 

Harold was made Earl of East Anglia in 1045, and then accompanied his father, Godwin, into exile in 1051. A year later he helped Godwin regain his position. When Godwin died in 1053, Harold inherited the earldom of Wessex, which made him the second most powerful figure in England after the king. In 1058 Harold also became Earl of Hereford, and he replaced his late father as the focus of opposition to growing Norman influence in England under the restored Saxon monarchy of Edward the Confessor. In 1062 and 1063 Harold then successfully fought a series of campaigns against the ruler of Gwynedd, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, who had conquered all of Wales. About 1064, Harold married Aldith, daughter of the Earl of Mercia, and widow of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn.  By Harold, Aldith had two sons, Harold and Ulf. Harold also had several illegitimate children by his mistress, Eadgyth.

In 1064, Harold was shipwrecked in Normandy and was turned over to the court of Duke William. William considered himself to be the successor of the childless Edward the Confessor, and got Harold to swear an oath to support William as the future king of England. In 1065 Harold supported a Northumbrian rebellion against taxes levied by his brother Tostig and replaced him with Morcar, the Earl of Northumbria. This strengthened his acceptability as Edward's successor, but divided his own family. Tostig went into alliance with King Harald Hardrada of Norway. In January 1066, upon Edward's death, Harold was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot who, under Anglo-Saxon law held the ultimate authority to convey kingship. 

===Harold's Reign===

Harold's position as king, though, was much disputed and the country was invaded, first by Harald Hardrada of Norway and then by William, Duke of Normandy. Harold offered his brother, Tostig, a third of the kingdom, and Tostig asked what Harold would offer the king of Norway. &quot;''Six feet of ground or as much more as he needs, as he is taller than most men'',&quot; was Harold's response according to Henry of Huntingdon. Invading what is now Yorkshire in September, 1066, Harald Hardrada and Tostig defeated the English earls, Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria, at the Battle of Fulford near York on 20 September. But they were in turn defeated and killed by Harold's army five days later at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Harold now forced his army to march 240 miles to meet William, who had landed about 7,000 men in Sussex, on 28 September. Harold established his army near Hastings, and on 14 October the two armies clashed at the Battle of Hastings, near the present town of Battle. Harold was killed and his forces routed. According to tradition, Harold was killed by an arrow in the eye, but the victim depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry is anonymous.  Whether he did, indeed, die in this manner, or was killed by the sword, is unknown.

==Edgar Atheling (1066)==
'''Edgar Atheling''' was born around the year 1051. Born in Hungary, he was also known as '''Edgar the Outlaw'''. The Anglo-Saxon name ''Atheling'' means ''&quot;man of noble blood, chief, prince&quot;'' and was used to designate the sons of the king. Edgar was the only son of Edward the Exile, heir to the English throne and grandson of King Edmund II Ironside. Upon his father's death in 1057, Edgar was nominated as heir apparent by the King Edward the Confessor. Edgar was brought up at Edward's court, together with his sisters Margaret and Christina. However he was too young at the time of the king's death in January 1066 to defend the country against invasion and his election as king after Harold's death was no more than a symbolic token of defiance against the invading Norman forces. After Harold II's death he was proclaimed, but never crowned, King of England. Edgar relied largely for his support upon Archbishop Stigand and upon Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria and, when this weakened within a matter of days of the witan that proclaimed him king, Edgar was forced to submit to William at Berkhamstead in either late November or early December 1066.

William treated Edgar well. Seeing political advantage, he kept him in his custody and eventually took him back to his court in Normandy. Edgar joined in the rebellion of the earls Edwin and Morcar in 1068 and, defeated, he fled to the court of Malcolm III of Scotland. The next year Malcolm married Edgar's sister Margaret, and agreed to support Edgar in his attempt to claim the English crown. In exchange, Edgar married Malcolm's sister, another Margaret. Edgar now made common cause with Sweyn Estridson, the king of Denmark and nephew of Canute, who believed he was the rightful king of England. Their combined forces invaded England in 1069, and they captured York. William marched on the north, devastating the land as he went. He paid the Danes to leave, and Edgar fled back to Scotland. He remained there till 1072 when William forced Malcolm to accept a peace treaty that also required Edgar to be exiled. Edgar eventually made his peace with William in 1074, but he never fully gave up his dreams of regaining the throne of England. He supported Robert, Duke of Normandy, against William II in 1091 and again found himself seeking refuge in Scotland. He also supported his nephew, Edgar, in gaining the Scottish throne, overthrowing Donald III. 

Around 1098 he went to Constantinople, where he may have joined the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Empire. Later that year he was given a fleet by Emperor Alexius I so he could help in the First Crusade, and Edgar brought reinforcements to the crusaders at the Siege of Antioch. He was taken prisoner during battle in 1106 whilst fighting for Duke Robert against King Henry I of England. He returned to England where Henry pardoned him, and he retired to his country estate in Hertfordshire. His niece Edith (renamed Matilda) had married Henry I in 1100. Edgar is believed to have returned to the Kingdom of Scotland late in life, perhaps around the year 1120, and was still alive in 1125, but may have died soon after, in his early seventies.

== Syllabary ==

Is there are list of words that could be used as either a syllabary or a glossary (non-copyrighted... if that is possible)?  That seems like a key feature that is missing from this textbook right now.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:03, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

:Rob, there's little complete evidence of corresponding canon quenya vocabulary. The most complete that I have heard is a document from the old/primitive quenya (spelt 'qenya', but pronounced the same).

:I don't know about legal status on these documents:

:* http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/qlindex1.htm
:* http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/qlindex2.htm

:But we could definitely link to them, and see what the author feels about making derivative works of them (reproducing them, in a revised presentation, on this site). —[[User:Auk|Auk]] 00:52, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

== Wikiversity course ==

There is now a Wikiversity course being developed for Quenya.  See [[wikiversity:Quenya]].  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 18:39, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

== Stress markings ==

Which syllable to stress is one of the harder things to get right when learning a language; it's more an innate 'feel' than calculating based upon known rules. I suggest we (in addition to providing the rules) emphasize the stressed syllables of words, especially when modifying with prefixes and suffixes and in the lower chapters. This would ease the student (it would help me a lot) into a more natural feel to the rhythm of the language. 

Comments on the style in which to do this? (Bold, italics, underline, capitals?)

—[[User:Auk|Auk]] 21:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)


I think this will make these pages more complicated than needed.

It might however be useful on the paradigms page.
I don't know how it would best be indicated as underlines are already use to indicate irregularities.

—[[User:Dirk_math]] 12 November 2006


A user of the Elfling mailing list has sent a link to this WikiBook. It generated so far criticism from one of the authors cited as the source of this WikiBook, Thorsten Renk. You can read it at Elfling message http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/33860

I do not agree with his vision that &quot;in this situation, the Wikipedia concept is bound to fail&quot;, but it surely can be much improved. The Book, as it is, may mislead the reader into thinking that Quenya is a fully developed and completely usable language, when in fact Tolkien apparently never had such intentions. For example, the scope of this WikiBook could be shifted from a &quot;how do I learn Quenya&quot; type of book (there are two well-written ones already) to a &quot;how did Tolkien develop his ideas on Quenya through the course of his lifetime.&quot; I can find Quenya courses in a snap on Google, but I can't say the same about comparative analysis of the various stages of the Quenya development.

If this shift doesn't happen, at least change the name of the WikiBook to &quot;Neo-Quenya,&quot; which is more accurate.

-[[User:Jaroszewski]] 23 February 2007

== Book name change ==

Should this book maybe rather be called [[Neo-Quenya]] since it's on that topic, rather than Quenya. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:52, 26 October 2008 (UTC)

:[[File:Yes_check.svg|15px|link=|alt=]] '''Done'''. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:03, 3 February 2011 (UTC)

Disclaimer stating this book is on Neo-Quenya was added back onto the main page of the book.  Thus it seems contrary to not have the book named ''Neo-Quenya''. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:03, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

:The disclaimer doesn't mean that in any way. It is simply a reminder that it is about a version of the language as it is now used and not as Tolkien has left it in 1973. I rewrote it to make that clearer.
:And would it have been so difficult to ask about the change before rushing in? Someone now renamed the main page back to Quenya, but this is even worse as the book is now inconsistent as all the other pages and the category are still called Neo-Quenya.

I have found this book useful - up to a point.  It presents some information that is not included in other prominent books on Quenya  including the page on &quot;special verbs&quot;, however it is generally lacking in citations to Tolkein's work and any discussion of controversy or period-relevance of words (are they 'Qenya'? are they 'LotR era Quenya'? or late Quenya developments?  At least a footnote would be good, for canon words a citation back to the Tolkein work where they appear and for inferred words an explanation of the rationale behind the inference.  Certainly the addition of references would give it better academic credence and separate it from the dross &quot;elvish&quot; courses that take whatever they can from Quenya, Sindarin, Telerin etc. [[User:Ecthelion|Ecthelion]] 22:45, 20 March 2013 (UTC)</text>

An integrated development environment (IDE), also known as integrated design environment and integrated debugging environment, is a type of computer software that assists computer programmers to develop software.  In the case of Visual Basic .NET, that IDE is Visual Studio.

== IDE Contents ==
The Visual Studio IDE consists of several sections, or tools, that the developer uses while programming. As you view the IDE for a new project you generally have three sections in view:
* The ''Toolbox'' on the left
* The ''Solution Explorer'' on the right
* The Code / Design view in the middle

=== Toolbox ===
The Toolbox is a palette of developer objects, or controls, that are placed on forms or web pages, and then code is added to allow the user to interact with them. An example would be ''TextBox'', ''Button'' and ''ListBox'' controls. With these three controls added to a Windows Form object the developer could write code that would take text, input by the application user, and add it to the ''ListBox'' when the button is clicked.

=== Solution Explorer ===
This is a section that is used to view and modify the contents of the project. A Visual Studio Windows Application Project will generally have a Form object with a code page, references to System components and possibly other modules with special code that is used by the application.

===Properties Windows===
The properties windows shows all the control (like ''TextBox'') properties to be change at design time. Most of this properties can be change at run time with some code, but basically most of this properties change the way the control is display on your application.

=== Code / Design view ===
This is where the magic takes place. Forms are designed graphically. In other words, the developer has a form on the screen that can be sized and modified to look the way it will be displayed to the application users. Controls are added to the form from the Toolbox, the color and caption can be changed along with &lt;u&gt;many other items&lt;/u&gt;.

This center window of the IDE is also where developers write the code that makes everything in the application work. The code is written in modules, or files, that are either connected to an object (Forms) or called specifically when needed.

=== Object Browser ===
By pressing F2 or selecting it into the ''View'' menu, it's possible to explore all the available objects of the libraries (types, functions...).

== Review ==
The Visual Studio IDE is a complex and exciting work space for developers, providing many enhancements and upgrades from the days of Visual Basic 4.0 or the introduction of C++. This section only serves as a mere introduction to this multi-functional interface.

[[User:80.221.213.232|80.221.213.232]] 16:44, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

---------

Should it be noted that this is mainly for street fighting, not for tournament based fighting matches (boxing, martial arts, etc)

-------------

Obviously the writer/editor is devoted to one style of fighting - his - only. Some of the advice given is truly dangerous if applied in the real world.

-------------

I'm noticing so rather counter-intitutive statements here. I'm fairly sure, for example, that handguns are more restricted than rifles or shotguns in most areas, as well as that combat metal knuckles usually features aiming for harder parts of the body to break bones rather than softer areas like the belly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I personally do not think that all the advice given here is impractical and cannot be used in the real world. I do think today's martial art schools should groom their students in such a manner that it would train the students very well for real world scenarios with special emphasis on breaking techniques and vital striking points of the body.They should also teach most practical effective techniques for defense against guns, knives, clubs etc. Instead of focusing so much upon katas and stances schools should teach the students to fight in any situation in any stance utilizing natural weapons which are most effective. Even seconds will count in a life and death situation and the students must be mentally prepared for encouters and escapes.  I wish to add that in a real street fight when up against a gang always try to run for safety. If that is not possible then try to muster all the courage and confidence you can and try to hit your opponents with multiple powerful strikes at one go. For eg. kick in the front and slash at the back at the same time. Learn counters to all kinds of grabs and how to quickly overpower your opponents. Apply throws if neccessary, and run away fast as soon as any opportunity comes your way. In case of gang attacks it is very important to move around in lightning speed around your opponents so that you are never sorrounded. Also in such situations you may only have opportunity to strike only once or twice. So strike with maximum speed and power at vital points.
----
This article shouldn't make any mention of any martial arts. Why? All martial arts began as effective self defence systems, from boxing, wrestling through savate, karate, jujitsu, to kung fu. The problems with a particular systems is that they have lost their focus on self defence and begun concentrating on competition techniques which are completely inappropriate for self defence on the street or to inner personal development which again doesn't train you to handle an aggressive attacker. All of the systems began effectively and all contain useful and effective techniques. The problem is the training, not the martial arts system.

Kata for instance are the very core of what karate is about, the kata contain some extremely vicious and effective techniques, including chokes, joint locks, throws. Stances are also very important, they teach balance, movement, body positioning but all of this information, *all of it*, is useless unless it is applied in training to self defense situations against resisting opponents. This is down to the individual instructors, not the martial art itself.

Therefore rather than badmouthing particular styles for whatever is flavour of the month, this article or book should concentrate on overall strategy. How do street fights start, what are the common stages, what to expect.

Just practicing a martial art (any of them) doesn't mean you know how to fight effectively on the street, preferably the experience of people who regularly deal with conflict would be useful. Door people, police, personal security etc.

It appears to me that this article needs to be split. At the moment, it covers a rather broad area, from fists to firearms. A seperate firearms guide might not be amiss, and most mention of specific martial arts should be removed. Leave the schools of those arts to teach them; people who 'learn' karate from a wiki are only going to get themselves hurt. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:64.223.19.21|64.223.19.21]] ([[User talk:64.223.19.21|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/64.223.19.21|contribs]]) 03:52, 31 Dec 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;
: I agree. There are currently, however, no active editors. (See the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title%3dFighting&amp;action%3dhistory module history]) If you would be willing to give a hack at it, I would be willing to help out. I think the article needs to be split up into submodule pages. If individual submodules get large enough, they could be forked off as distinct modules. When you can, consider working on an outline at [[Fighting/Revamp]]. I'll help out when I can. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at my [[User talk:Iamunknown|talk page]].

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can accept generalizing slightly for the sake of the article but simply stating that all &quot;Large Bladed Weapons&quot; should be just swung and not used to block or parry is ridiculous. This article seems to claim that all large blades function exactly like machetes. Also, since when can you find a bladed weapon that is near 1' in length and weighs 3lbs.!? That's just stupid, there are plenty of 3' weapons that weigh well under that.

This article is just crap in general. By generalizing everything and trying to fit it all in one guide called &quot;Fighting&quot; nothing good is produced. There should be separate guides for separate modes of combat.

== Army Manuals ==

Several army and marine corps manuals are freely available online.  This article should link to them, or at least incorporate parts of it, particularly the combatives, and a

------------------------------------

I agree, this article/book is crap. I don't see it as needing a description of how to fight, perhaps just a description of what fighting is would do. How to fight, should be in a series of separate pages, possibly split into disciplines. This topic is a particully hairy one, as everyone likes to think they know how the right way to fight, and that their methods are most effective.

I quickly skimmed over and noticed the following factual errors:

''The strongest choke hold from this position consists of your arm wrapped around your opponent's throat with the opponent's Adam's apple in the inside of your elbow,'' -
That would be a strangle, not a choke. Chokes limit breathing, strangles limit blood flow. Having the adams apple inside of your elbow would remove your ability to apply pressure.

''A small bladed weapon, such as a knife, should be used primarily to stab. Most knives should be held with your thumb in line with the blade and your dominant hand forward. You should never swipe or slash with a small weapon because it is slower and cannot penetrate the layers of skin and muscle as easily'' - A small knife, (lets say 3&quot; which is possibly one of the most common sizes), is quite an effective slashing tool - See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PWmRWjDhYw. Remember one can't use a limb without intact tendons and nerves.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Notation==
We need notation, or at least we need to figure out how to correctly structure the book. There should be an extended introduction in basics that at least introduces notation. When I learn a new language, I always observe the written part first. We need a functional tutorial, that works step-by-step, not something to just explain what's happening. I'd go through old method books and figure out how they started off, and then embellish it with learned knowledge. I'll work on this later, but it's 3 am now.

--What's wrong with them?

I think they are confusing for the beginners. They need to see from the beginning that the most important things in music are patterns. Chords, scales, extremely confusingly super-kablooey counterpoint :) Only chords in their rootpositions first, we can put the inversions in later. Otherwise the pictures are good.

|The silver elephant has no legal move, so the gold elephant is the strongest free piece.
}}
Not long after discovering the [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Camel_Hostage | camel hostage]] strategy, human players accidentally discovered that some computer programs could be lured into an elephant blockade by the offer of a free piece for capture.  Much later it was further discovered that the program may squirm to try to free its elephant, and in the process get jammed all the way against an edge of the board.

In [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=25532&amp;s=w this game], diagrammed at right, Gold has lost a cat while Silver has a full army, but Silver is nonetheless completely lost.  Not only is there no empty square for the silver elephant to step into, there is no empty square into which it can push its tormentors.  The gold elephant and camel will keep an eye on the silver camel and horses respectively.  Gold can ward off any attempts to break the silver elephant out of its prison, while herding silver pieces at will into the f3 trap.  This is a much more decisive advantage than a camel hostage.  Silver has no plausible lines of play in this case.

===Rotation===

Most elephant blockades, however, are not as hugely advantageous as that one.  It is a rare opponent who will voluntarily move his elephant to the edge of the board when a blockade is looming.  The diagram below left, from
[http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=8213&amp;s=w this game], shows a slightly less advantageous situation with the blockaded elephant one square away from the edge of the board.

|The gold elephant is blockaded, but the game is not over.
}}Here the gold elephant can't move, true, but nine silver pieces are required to maintain the blockade, including both the silver elephant and camel.  Indeed, if all the pieces involved in the blockade stayed put, the strongest free piece would actually be the gold camel.

As it happens, however, Silver can undertake a ''rotation'' (or ''replacement'') of the pieces participating in the blockade.  When it comes to being in the way, a weak piece serves just as well as a strong one.  Silver to move can free his camel for duty in only four steps, while maintaining the blockade: camel h6 south, rabbit h7 south, rabbit h8 south, and rabbit g8 east.  The gold elephant can't make use of g8 to dig its way to freedom without getting smothered against the edge, so Silver can fill in that hole next move.  Thus Silver needs only one turn to equal Gold for having the strongest free piece.

Furthermore, if Gold plays passively, Silver can continue to rotate pieces, freeing his elephant as well in two or three more turns.  Because of this threat, it is very important that Gold not remain passive.  Gold must immediately begin preparing a rescue mission to erode the blockade from the side, or even from the front if the silver elephant tries to leave.  This will necessarily expose gold pieces to danger, but at least it puts some play into the position.  For Gold to hang back is to await execution.

Note that even if Silver manages to rotate the elephant out of the blockade, it will require a few more pieces to maintain than a blockade on the edge.  Furthermore those pieces will protrude one square further, making them slightly easier targets for would-be blockade busters.  Still, the blockade is quite advantageous to Silver.

}}

===When Rotation Is Impossible===

The diagram at right, from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=21755&amp;s=w this game] in the 2006 Arimaa World Championship, features an elephant blockaded one step further from the edge of the board, which is correspondingly less advantageous.  Indeed, it is no longer realistic for Silver to expect to be able to free his elephant by rotating blockaders appropriately.  True, the f6 trap is participating in the blockade at the moment, but Gold might bring a piece to f5 or e6, allowing the gold elephant to step to freedom, so Silver must soon occupy at least the latter squares.

An elephantless blockade would require silver pieces on g8, f7, g7, h7, e6, h6, f5, g5, h5, and g4.  Not only are ten pieces necessary, but the bubble of blockaders also presents a large surface area for Gold to assail, extending within two steps of Gold's home trap at f3.  Silver would be too busy warding off threats to the blockade to ever start capturing pieces with his freed elephant.

Since Silver can't rotate his elephant out of this blockade in practice, it does not give him the strongest free piece like an ideal blockade does.  Yet the blockade is not worthless.  Its value is that, although both Gold and Silver have a free camel, the silver camel is ''more'' free.

Suppose that Silver, while maintaining the blockade, were to use his camel to attack the c3 trap.  Gold could defend c3 with his own camel, but couldn't endanger the attacking silver camel.  In contrast, if Gold were to attack c6 with his camel, Silver would have the option of giving up the blockade to cross wings and take the gold camel hostage.  (This principle recurs again and again in the study of [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Mobility | elephant mobility]].)

This difference of freedom pegs the value of the blockade to Silver at somewhat less than a camel hostage.  Silver certainly can't expect to get more out of the position, because if Gold is willing to give up his camel as a hostage, he can frustrate anything else Silver might undertake.  Indeed, the gold camel can probably break the blockade at any time if it is willing to expose itself.  On the other hand, Silver can't necessarily force Gold to expose his camel.  Gold can play in the west as well as hovering in the east making threats to break the blockade.  If Silver has trouble generating a threat in the west while maintaining the blockade in the east, he may be forced to give up the blockade for an advantage smaller than a camel hostage.

===Worthless Elephant Blockades===

All the top Arimaa computer programs are now aware of elephant blockades, but most are still confused by the huge disparity in value from one blockade to the next.  In the diagram at left, from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=23476&amp;s=w this game], Gold's blockade of the silver elephant actually has negative value, for several reasons.
* Gold will never be able to rotate the gold elephant out of d4.
* The gold camel is so buried on c2 that it has less freedom of movement than the silver camel, despite the theoretical difference in elephant mobility.
* The gold pieces on e4 and f3 (at the edge of the blockade bubble) are in jeopardy.
* The blockade is unmaintainable.  Silver doesn't actually need to break the blockade in order to make progress, but could break it if necessary.

Step 3 :

Calculate the electrostatic force using Coulomb's Law:


Failed to parse (unknown function\rmC): \begin{matrix}F_E&amp;=&amp;k\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}=k\frac{e\cdot e}{1\AA^2}\\&amp;=&amp;(8.99\times10^{9}\rm N\cdot m^2/C^2)\frac{(-1.60\times10^{-19}{\rm C})(-1.60\times10^{-19}\rmC)}{(10^{-10}\rm m)^2}\\&amp;=&amp;2.30\times10^{-8}\rm N\end{matrix}

Hence the magnitude of the electrostatic force between the electrons is 2.30\times10^{-8}\rm N. (Note that the electrons carry like charge and from this we know the force must be repulsive. Another way to see this is that the force is positive and thus repulsive.)

Step 4 :

Calculate the gravitational force:
Failed to parse (unknown function\cdotm): \begin{matrix}F_E&amp;=&amp;G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}=G\frac{m_e\cdot m_e}{(1\AA)^2}\\&amp;=&amp;(6.67\times10^{-11}{\rm N\cdotm^2/kg^2})\frac{(9.11\times10^{-31}{\rm C})(9.11\times10^{-31}{\rm kg})}{(10^{-10}{\rm m})^2}\\&amp;=&amp;5.54\times10^{-51}{\rm N}\end{matrix}

The magnitude of the gravitational force between the electrons is 5.54\times10^{-51}\rm N</text>

==Grammar==
===Basic Sentences===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The sentence structure of Chinese is very similar to that of English in that they both follow the pattern of [[w:Subject_Verb_Object|Subject-Verb-Object]] (SVO). Unlike many languages, verbs in Chinese aren't conjugated and noun and adjective endings don't change. They are never affected by things such as time or person.

:''I'm called Amy.''
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot;
|-
| [[image:Warning icon.png]] 
|Note that in Chinese you do not need the auxiliary verb ''to be'' to use other verbs as in English.  While the sentence is translated as &quot;I ''am'' called Amy&quot;, saying &quot;我是叫艾美&quot; would be considered awkward.

===Sentences using &lt;u&gt;shì&lt;/u&gt; [是]===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | Shì, the equational verb ''to be'', can be used as the English ''is'' or ''equals''. Shì can only be used to equate combinations of nouns, noun phrases, and pronouns. In Chinese, shì, the &quot;to be&quot; verb, is not used with adjectives, as it is in English, as in, &quot;He is cold.&quot;
|}&lt;br&gt;

1.  我是中國人。
:Wǒ shì Zhōngguórén. 
:''I '''am''' a Chinese person.''
2.  她是金妮。
:Tā shì Jīnní.
:''She '''is''' Ginny.''&lt;br&gt;

| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | Shì is negated when preceded by &lt;u&gt;bù&lt;/u&gt; [不]. &lt;u&gt;Bù&lt;/u&gt; is normally 4th tone, but changes to a 2nd tone when it precedes another 4th tone.

2.  我不是美國人。

===The question particle &lt;u&gt;ma&lt;/u&gt; [嗎]===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | Adding the modal particle &lt;u&gt;ma&lt;/u&gt; [嗎] to the end of a sentence makes a statement into a question. There is no change in word order as in English.
|-

The declarative example sentence in #1 is transformed into an interrogative in #2.

1. 她是金妮。
:Tā shì Jīnní.
:''She is Ginny.''

2. 她是金妮嗎？
:Tā shì Jīnní ma?
:''Is she Ginny?''

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | Using the ending modal particle &lt;u&gt;ne&lt;/u&gt; [呢] makes a question when the context is already known, similar to saying &quot;How about...?&quot; in English. A common circumstance is when you wish to repeat a question that was just asked for another subject. Simply add &lt;u&gt;ne&lt;/u&gt; to the end of the noun or pronoun to ask &quot;How about ''this''&quot;.
|-
|}


1.  我叫東尼，你呢？
:Wǒ jiào Dōngní, nǐ ne? 
:''I'm called Tony. How about you?''
2.  艾美是中國人，他呢？
:Àiměi shì Zhōngguórén, tā ne? 
:''Amy is Chinese. How about him?''
----

===Question words===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | Like particles, question words make statements into questions without changing the order of the sentence. To make one, simply substitute the QW in for the place the subject would be in the answer.
|-
|}


1. 他們是哪國人？
:Tāmen shì nǎ guó rén?
:''What country are they from?''

2. 誰是美國人？
:Shéi shì Měiguórén? 
:''Who is American?''

3. 她是誰？
: Tā shì shéi? 
:''Who is she?''

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; |  *literal translation.  In Chinese, sentences are commonly structured like so, as opposed to in English.  In the case of example sentence 3, &quot;Tā shì shéi?&quot; (&quot;She is who?&quot;) is used while &quot;Shéi shì tā?&quot; (&quot;Who is she?&quot;) is uncommon.  As described above, an easy way to find the correct order is by using the response to the question as a template.  In this case, the correct form of the response is &quot;Tā shì Jīnní&quot; or &quot;She is Ginny&quot;, since the other form &quot;Jīnní shì tā&quot; or &quot;Ginny is she&quot; does not really make sense.  Therefore, the question should be worded in the form &quot;Tā shì shéi?&quot;, not &quot;Shéi shì tā?&quot;.

      <comment>/* The Nature of Charismatic Authority Introduction */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Max Weber (1864-1902) was born in Erfurt, the son of a prosperous and influential lawyer who was active in politics. Like his friend Simmel, Weber was brought up in Berlin. He studied law, history, economics, and philosophy and achieved early recognition, becoming a professor at the age of 30. Then he suffered a nervous breakdown which forced him to give up teaching. After he recovered, he spent most of his life in private study. His writings were extensive; although many volumes have been translated into English, a considerable amount remains untranslated. 

==The fundamentals of Sociology==

Weber's sociology main purpose is to understand the social action, given that it's causes must be found in the meaning attributed to it by the actor. While other authors, like Émille Durkheim, were trying to establish the existence of the social phenomena as an objective reality independent of the individuals and their consciousness, Weber stated that the causal link sociology seeks to establish between two events is the meaning attributed by the actors. Thus, society does not have its own existence, independent of the individuals. It is constituted by individuals and meanings.

== The Nature of Charismatic Authority Introduction ==

Weber believed that the same forms of social organization develop independently in different cultures, and his enormous historical knowledge enabled him to demonstrate the one point again and again. He was discussing religious congregations and the balance between preaching and pastoral care in such congregations. &quot;Among those religious functionaries whose pastoral care has influenced the everyday life of the laity and the behaviour of political officials in an enduring and often decisive manner have been the counselling rabbis of Judaism, the father confessors of Catholicism, the pietistic pastors of souls in Protestantism, the directors of souls in Counter Reformation Catholicism, the Brahminic purohitas at the court, the gurus and gosains in Hinduism, and the muftis and dervish sheikhs in Islam.&quot;
One of Weber's lifelong concerns was to show how the major segments of a society influenced each other in their historical development. His first important work, The Protestant Ethic aud. The Spirit of Capitalism, demonstrated how the religious values held by the Puritan sects of the Reformation, especially their asceticism and their belief that God arbitrarily elects certain souls for salvation, contributed to the development of industrial capitalism in England and northern Europe by providing motives for hard work, austere living, and the accumulation of wealth. Although it was not his sole purpose, Weber refuted Marx's contention that all beliefs and values were mere superstructure, explainable by reference to the organization of production, by showing that beliefs and values could be equally well used to explain the development of a system of production.
Because he provided an alternative explanation of the rise of capitalism and a different set of predictions about its future, Weber has been called &quot;the Marx of the bourgeoisie.&quot; But his historical analyses go far beyond this one point; he was able to show the mutual dependence of economic systems, forms of government, social stratification, and religious beliefs in Greece and Rome, in the Middle Ages, in the ancient Near East, in India, China, Japan, and medieval Russia, indeed wherever civilization had left written records.

== The Perception of Charisma ==
In Weber’s word the word &quot;charisma&quot; is denoted to a quality of an individual personality, which makes him distinguish from other persons in a society. This quality may be a supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional power. We may say in simple that it is God gifted. These traits, as such, are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned is treated as a leader. In primitive circumstances this peculiar kind of deference is paid to prophets, to people with a reputation for therapeutic or legal wisdom, to leaders in the hunt, and heroes in war. It is very often thought of as resting on magical powers. Max Weber treated every type of this quality in his theory for explanation whether it is unenthusiastic or Enthusiastic. He also included intellectual, and Heroes (such as Alexander the Great etc.).
Charismatic authority is different from bureaucratic and traditional authority in performing the everyday routine and the profane sphere. Bureaucrat authority is specifically rational in the sense of being bound to intellectual analyzable rules, while charismatic authority is specifically irrational in this sense of being foreign to all rules. Traditional authority is bound to the precedents handed down from the past and to this extent is also oriented to rule while the charismatic authority repudiates to past and is in this sense a specifically revolutionary force. It recognizes the appropriation of positions of power by virtue of the possession of property either on the part of a chief or of socially privileged groups. The on basis of legitimacy for it is personal charisma, so long as it is proved, this, is, as long as it receives recognition and is able to satisfy the followers disciples. But this lasts only so long as the belief in its charismatic inspiration remains.
The charismatic revolutionary force alters the situations of action by changing men's attitudes and intellectualizes the individual. Charisma, on the other hand, may involve a subjective or internal re orientation born out of suffering, conflicts or enthusiasm. It may then resin in a radical alteration of the central system of attitudes and directions d action, with a completely new orientation of all attitudes toward the different problems and structures of the &quot;world.&quot;

== Motives for Transformation of Charismatic Authority ==
Under charismatic realm the social relationships directly involved are strictly personal, based on the validity and practice of charismatic personal qualities. If this is not to remain a purely transitory phenomenon, but to take on the character of a permanent relationship forming a stable community of disciples, or a band of followers, or a party organization, or any sort of political or hierocratic organization, it is necessary for the character of charismatic authority to become radically changed. Charismatic authority exists only in the process of originating. It cannot remain stable, but becomes either traditionalized or rationalized, or a combination of both.
What are the motives necessary for this transformation?
(1) The material interests of the followers in the continuation and the continual reactivation of the community or in simple words we can say the economic and social life is necessary for follower and they can not remain uncommitted from their social life. 
(2) Both traditional and administrative authority have an interest in continuing it in such a way that both from an ideal and a material point of view, their own status is put on a stable everyday basis. This means, above all, making it possible to participate in normal family relationships and at least to enjoy a secure social position, in place of the kind of discipleship which is cut off from ordinary worldly connections, notably in the family and in economic relationships.

== Solution for the Problem of Succession ==
These interests generally become conspicuously evident with the disappearance of the personal charismatic leader, and with the problem of succession which inevitably arises. The way in which this problem is met if it is met at all and the charismatic group continues to exist is of crucial importance for the character of the subsequent social relationships. 
The principal possible types of solution to problem appeared during the process of succession: 

== Selection of New Charismatic Leader ==
The search for a new charismatic leader on the basis of criteria of the qualities which will fit him for the position of authority. A example of this is the choice of new Dalai Lama or new Bull of Apis.
=== Revelation Process ===
By revelation manifested in oracles, lots, divine judgments, or other techniques of selection. In this case, the legitimacy of the new leader is dependent on the legitimacy of the technique of his selection. This involves a form of legalization. It is said that at times the Schofetim of Israel had this character. Saul is said to have been chosen by the old war oracle.
=== Designation by Charismatic Leader ===
By the designation on the part of the original charismatic leader of his own successor and his recognition on the part of the followers. This is' a very common form. Originally, the Roman magistracies were filled entirely in this way. The system survived most clearly into later times in the appointment of &quot;dictators&quot; and in the institution of the &quot;interrex.&quot; In this case, legitimacy is acquired through the act of designation.
=== Pre-Designation of Successor By Selection === 
Designation of a successor by the charismatically qualified administrative staff and his recognition by the community. In its typical form, this process should quite definitely not be interpreted as &quot;election,&quot; or &quot;nomina¬tion,&quot; or anything of the sort. It is not a matter of free selection, but of one which is strictly bound to objective duty. It is not to be determined merely by majority vote, but is a question of arriving at the correct designation, the designation of the right person who is truly endowed with charisma. It is quite possible that the minority and not the majority should be right in such a case. It is obligatory to acknowledge a mistake, and persistence in error is a serious offense. Making a wrong choice is a genuine wrong requiring expiation. Originally it was a magical offense.
Nevertheless, in such a case it is easy for legitimacy to take on the character of an acquired right which is justified by standards of the cor¬rectness of the process by which the position was acquired, for the most part, by its having been acquired in accordance with certain formalities, such as coronation. This was the original meaning of the coronation of bish¬ops and kings in the Western world by the clergy or the nobility with the &quot;consent&quot; of the community. There are numerous analogous phenomena all over the world. The fact that this is the origin of the modem conception of &quot;election&quot; raises problems which will have to be gone into later.
=== Inherit Quality or Kinship ===
By the conception that charisma is a quality transmitted by heredity; thus that it is participated in by the kinsmen of its bearer, particularly by his closest relatives. This is the case of hereditary charisma. The order of hereditary succession in such a case need not be the same as that which is in force for appropriated rights, but may differ from it. It is also sometimes necessary to select the proper heir within the kinship group by some of the methods just spoken of; thus in certain Negro states brothers have had to fight for the succession. In China, succession bad to take place in such a way that the relation of the living group to the ances  spirits was not disturbed. The rule either of seniority or of designation by the follower has been very common in the Orient. Hence, in the house of Osman, it has been obligatory to eliminate all other possible candidates.
Only in medieval Europe and in Japan universally, elsewhere only spo¬radically, has the principle of primogeniture, as governing the inheritance of authority, become clearly established. This has greatly facilitated the consolidation of political groups in that it has eliminated struggle between a plurality of candidates from the same charismatic family.
In Asia there have been very numerous heredi¬tary priesthoods; also, frequently, the hereditary charisma of kinship groups has been treated as a criterion of social rank and of eligibility for fiefs and benefices.
=== Transmitted Dogma ===
The concept that charisma may be transmitted by formal procedure means from one bearer to another or may be created in a new person. The concept was originally supernatural. It involves a dissociation of charisma from a particular character, making it an objective, transferable entity. In particular, it may become the charisma of office. In this case the belief in legitimacy is no longer directed to the individual, but to the acquired qualities and to the effectiveness of the ritual acts. The most important example is the trans¬mission of priestly charisma by anointing, consecration, or the laying on of hands and of royal authority, by anointing and by coronation. The caratter indelibly thus acquired means that the charismatic qualities and powers of the office are emancipated from the personal qualities of the priest.

==Henry II (1154-1189)==
[[Image:Henry II of England - Illustration from Cassell's History of England - Century Edition - published circa 1902.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King Henry II]]
'''Henry II''' was born on 5 March 1133 in Le Mans. He ruled as Count of Anjou, Duke of Normandy and as King of England from 1154 until his death in 1189. Following the disputed reign of King Stephen, Henry's reign saw efficient consolidation. Henry II has a reputation as one of England's greatest medieval kings. At various times he controlled parts of Wales, Scotland, eastern Ireland, and western France. He was the first of the Plantagenet or Angevin Kings. Before becoming king Henry already controlled Normandy and Anjou. Whilst king, he had an empire, known as the Angevin Empire, that stretched from the Solway Firth almost to the Mediterranean and from the Somme to the Pyrenees. His mother was Empress Matilda, and his father was her second husband, Geoffrey of Anjou. He was brought up in Anjou, which is where the name ''Angevin'' comes from, though he visited England in 1149 to help his mother with her claim to the English throne.

===Appearance===

Peter of Blois left a description of Henry II in 1177: &quot;''...the lord king has been red-haired so far, except that the coming of old age and gray hair has altered that colour somewhat. His height is medium, so that neither does he appear great among the small, nor yet does he seem small among the great... curved legs, a horseman's shins, broad chest, and a boxer's arms all announce him as a man strong, agile and bold... he never sits, unless riding a horse or eating... In a single day, if necessary, he can run through four or five day-marches and, thus foiling the plots of his enemies, frequently mocks their plots with surprise sudden arrivals...Always are in his hands bow, sword, spear and arrow, unless he be in council or in books''.&quot;

===Early reign and Thomas Becket===

Henry II's first task as king was to wrest more control from the barons, who had gained more power during King Stephen's reign. Castles that were built by barons during Stephen's reign without permission were torn down.

Henry II also made many legal reforms. Henry established courts in various parts of England. His reign saw the production of the first written legal textbook, providing the basis of today's Common Law. By 1166 trial by jury became the norm. The legal reforms also reduced the power of church courts.  The church opposed this, and their most prominent spokesman was Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who used to be a close friend of Henry's who was made archbishop as Henry wanted to avoid conflict. Becket went into exile in 1164, but after a reconciliation with Henry in 1170, came back. However, Becket again argued with Henry, this time over the coronation of Prince Henry, and Henry II is famously reported to have said, &quot;Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?&quot;  Four knights took the king literally and travelled immediately to Canterbury, where they killed Becket in the Cathedral on 29 December 1170. In penance, Henry made a pilgrimage in sackcloth to Becket's tomb.

===Marriage and children===

In 1152 he married Eleanor of Aquitaine and added on her lands to his, therefore increasing the size of his empire. They had five sons and three daughters. Their first son died in infancy. Their second, Henry, was crowned king at age fifteen in 1170, when Henry II was still king, and was known as the Young King, but he never actually ruled and does not figure in the list of the monarchs of England. They also had Richard and John who both later became Kings of England. Henry also had a number of illegitimate children by various women.

===Revolting sons and death===
Henry II's attempt to divide his titles amongst his sons but keep the power that came with them provoked them into trying to take control of the lands assigned to them in the Revolt of 1173-1174. In Henry's eyes, this was treason. 

When Henry's legitimate sons rebelled against him, they often had the help of King Louis VII of France. Henry the Young King died in 1183, after which there was a power struggle between the three sons that were left. Finally, Henry's third son, Richard the Lionheart, with the assistance of Philip II Augustus of France, attacked and defeated Henry on 4 July 1189. Henry died at the Chateau Chinon two days later and was laid to rest at Fontevraud Abbey near Chinon in the Anjou Region of present-day France. Richard then became King of England.

==Richard I (1189-1199)==
[[Image:Richard coeurdelion g.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Richard the Lionheart]]
'''Richard I''' was born in 1157 in Oxford. He was King of England from 1189 to his death in 1199, and is often known as '''Richard the Lionheart''' or its French equivalent, '''Coeur de Lion'''. 

He was brought up, mostly by his mother in France. Richard was able to compose poetry in French and in the Provençal language. He was also very attractive. He was blond, blue-eyed, and his height estimated at six feet four inches (1.93 m) tall. He gloried in military activity. 

His father, Henry, made him Duke of Aquitaine in 1168, and of Poitiers in 1172. He therefore learned to defend these territories from an early age. In 1173, Richard joined his brothers, Henry and Geoffrey, in a revolt against their father.  They were planning to dethrone their father and leave Richard's brother Henry as the ruling king of England.  Henry II invaded Aquitaine twice.  At the age of seventeen, Richard was the last of the brothers to hold out against Henry, though, in the end, he refused to fight his father face to face and humbly begged his pardon.  In 1174, after the end of the failed revolt, Richard gave a new oath of subservience to his father.

After this, Richard concentrated on putting down internal revolts by the nobles of Aquitaine. His increasing cruelty led to a major revolt of Gascony in 1183. The rebels hoped to dethrone Richard and asked Richard's brothers Henry and Geoffrey to help them succeed.  Their father feared that the war between his three sons could lead to the destruction of his kingdom.  He led the part of his army that served in his French lands in support of Richard.  The death of Richard's brother Henry in 1183, ended the revolt.

When in 1188 Henry II planned to concede Aquitaine to his youngest son John Lackland, later King John of England, Richard allied himself with Philip II of France. In return for Philip's help against his father, Richard promised to concede his rights to both Normandy and Anjou to Philip.  Richard gave an oath of subservience to Philip in November of the same year.  In 1189 Richard attempted to take the throne of England for himself by joining Philip's expedition against his father.  They were victorious, and when Henry II died on 6 July 1189, Richard I succeeded him as King of England.

===Reign===

Soon after his accession to the throne, inspired by the loss of Jerusalem to the Muslims under the command of Saladin, Richard decided to join the Third Crusade, Afraid that during his absence the French might usurp his territories, Richard persuaded Philip to join the Crusade as well. Richard finally started his expedition to the Holy Land in 1190, and for England he appointed as regents Hugh, Bishop of Durham, and William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex, who soon died and was replaced by Richard's chancellor William Longchamp.

In September 1190 both Richard and Philip arrived in Sicily, where they became embroiled in a war for the succession after the death of King William II of Sicily the year before. As part of the peace treaty that ended the conflict, Richard officially proclaimed his nephew, Arthur of Brittany, who was only four at the time, as his heir. After signing the treaty Richard and Philip left Sicily.  The treaty undermined England's relationships with the Holy Roman Empire and caused the revolt of Richard's brother John, who hoped to be proclaimed heir instead of their nephew.  Although his revolt failed, John continued to scheme against his brother after this point.

In April 1191, Richard overthrew the ruler of Cyprus, gaining a major supply base for the Crusade that was not under immediate threat from the Turks as was Tyre. Richard looted the island and massacred those trying to resist him. Meanwhile, Richard married Berengaria, first-born daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre. There were no children from the marriage, although Richard did have at least one illegitimate child.

Richard and most of his army left Cyprus for the Holy Land early in June. King Richard arrived at Acre in June 1191, where he and his forces captured the city. Saladin dragged negotiations on certain points of the surrender of Acre. As Richard's army could not move until 2,600 prisoners of war that he had taken hostage were disposed of, Richard took this to be a deliberate attempt to bottle the Crusaders up in Acre. In what history records as a fit of impatience, Richard ordered all 2,600 prisoners killed.

Richard was also involved in other disputes with his allies, Duke Leopold V of Austria and King Philip II of France. Leopold and Philip no longer supported Richard's Crusade. Still, Richard continued to march south, and Saladin's men were unable to harass the Crusader army into an impulsive action which might not have gone their way.  However, the desertion of the French king had been a major blow, from which they could not hope to recover. Realising that he had no hope of holding Jerusalem even if he took it, Richard ordered a retreat. Despite being only a few miles from the city, he refused, thereafter, to set eyes on it, as he had vowed to look upon it only once he had conquered the city. 

After the retreat from Jerusalem, there was a period of minor skirmishes with Saladin's forces while Richard and Saladin negotiated a settlement to the conflict: both had realised that their positions were growing untenable. In particular, both Philip and John were taking advantage of Richard's absence to make themselves more powerful at home. He and Saladin finally came to a settlement of the conflict on 2 September 1192.

===Captivity and return===
Bad luck dogged Richard on his return home.  Bad weather forced his ship to put in at Corfu, the territory of the Byzantine Emperor, who was still angry at Richard for his annexation of Cyprus.  Disguised as a Knight Templar, Richard sailed from Corfu with four attendants in a pirate ship, which wrecked near Aquileia, forcing Richard and his party into a dangerous land route through central Europe.

On his way to the territory of Henry of Saxony, his brother-in-law, Richard was captured shortly before Christmas 1192 only a few miles from the Moravian border, near Vienna, by Leopold V of Austria. Richard and his retainers had been travelling disguised as pilgrims, complete with flowing beards and tattered clothes. Richard himself was dressed like a kitchen hand, but was identified because he was wearing a magnificent and costly ring no menial worker could afford. The Duke handed him over as a prisoner to Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. 

His mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, worked tirelessly to raise the exorbitant ransom of 150,000 marks demanded by the German emperor, of which 100,000 had to be paid before release, with the remainder after. 150,000 marks represented twice the annual income for the English Crown.  Both clergy and laymen were taxed for a quarter of the value of their property, the gold and silver treasures of the churches were confiscated, and money was raised from other taxes too. John, Richard's brother, and King Philip offered 80,000 marks for the Emperor to hold Richard prisoner until Michaelmas 1194.  The emperor turned down the offer. Finally, on 4 February 1194 Richard was released.

One fictional aspect to Richard's life is the legend of his minstrel, Blondel, who, after Richard's capture, travelled Europe, going from castle to castle and loudly singing a song known only to the two of them. Eventually, the story goes, he came to the place where Richard was being held, and heard the song answered with the appropriate refrain, thus revealing where the king was.

===Death and legacy===

After his many famous battles, it was a minor skirmish with the rebellious castle of Châlus-Charbrol in Limousin, France on 26 March 1199 that would take Richard's life. Richard, who had removed some of his chainmail, was wounded in the shoulder by a crossbow bolt launched from a tower.  Gangrene set in and Richard asked to see his killer, who he ordered to be set free and awarded a sum of money.  However as soon as Richard died, with his 77-year-old mother Eleanor at his side, on 6 April 1199, the killer was flayed alive and then hanged. Richard's bowels were buried at the foot of the tower from which the shot came, his heart was buried at Rouen, while the rest of his remains were buried next to his father at Fontevraud Abbey near Chinon, France. 

During Richard's absence abroad, John had come close to seizing the throne. However, Richard had forgiven him, and named him as his heir in place of Arthur. So it was John who became the next king. However, Richard's French territories initially rejected John as a successor, preferring his Arthur instead. However, the lack of any direct heirs from Richard was the first step in the dissolution of the Angevin Empire. While England continued to press claims to properties on the continent, it would never again command the territories Richard I inherited.

In the long run Richard's legacy includes the capture of Cyprus, which proved valuable in keeping the Frankish kingdoms in the Holy Land viable for another century.  Secondly, his absence from England meant that the highly efficient government created by his father was allowed to entrench itself. Another part of Richard's legacy was romantic and literary.  No matter the facts of his reign, he left an indelible imprint on the imagination extending to the present, in large part because of his military exploits. Indeed, due to his bravery, savagery, and fame in the Arabic world, Richard became a bit of a bogeyman in the Middle East for centuries after his death.  Mothers would occasionally threaten unruly children with the admonition &quot;King Richard will get you&quot; well into the late 19th century.

On the downside, Richard has been criticised for doing little for England, and instead using the kingdom's resources to support his journeys away on Crusade in the Holy Land. He spent only six months of his ten year reign in England, claiming it was &quot;cold and always raining&quot;. During the period when he was raising funds for his Crusade, Richard was heard to declare, &quot;If I could have found a buyer I would have sold London itself&quot;.

==John (1199-1216)==
[[Image:King John.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King John]]
'''John''' was born, probably in the year 1166, in Oxford. He was the fifth son of King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He reigned as King of England from 1199 until his death in 1216. He succeeded to the throne as the younger brother of King Richard I. John acquired the nicknames of &quot;Lackland&quot; and &quot;Soft-sword&quot;. 

King John's reign has been traditionally characterised as one of the most disastrous in English history: he lost Normandy to Philip II of France in his first five years on the throne, and his reign ended with England torn by civil war, with him on the verge of being forced out of power. In 1213, he made England a papal fief to resolve a conflict with the Roman Catholic Church, and his rebellious barons forced him to sign the Magna Carta in 1215, the act for which he is best remembered.

In 1185, John became the ruler of Ireland, whose people grew to despise him, causing John to leave after only eight months. During Richard's absence on the Third Crusade from 1190 to 1194, John tried to overthrow Richard's regent, despite having been forbidden by his brother to leave France. However, on his return to England in 1194, Richard forgave John and named him as his heir.

===John's reign as King===

After Richard's death, John did not gain immediate universal recognition as king. As we have seen above, some regarded his young nephew, Arthur of Brittany, as the rightful heir. Arthur enjoyed the support of King Philip II of France, and the two sides fought. The war upset the barons of Poitou, who sought help from the King of France, who was King John's feudal overlord in respect of some of his territories on the Continent. In 1202, King John was summoned to the French court to answer the charges.  King John refused and, under feudal law, because of his failure of service to his lord, the French King claimed the lands and territories ruled by King John as Count of Poitou. The French promptly invaded Normandy, King Philip II invested Arthur with all those fiefs King John once held (except for Normandy), and betrothed him to his daughter Mary. As part of the war, Arthur attempted to kidnap his own grandmother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, at Mirebeau, but was defeated and captured by John's forces. Arthur was imprisoned first at Falaise and then at Rouen. No one is certain what happened to Arthur after that, but the rumour that he was murdered caused Brittany and later Normandy to rebel against King John.

John functioned as an efficient ruler, but he won the disapproval of the English barons by taxing them in ways that were outside those traditionally allowed by feudal overlords. John was a very fair-minded and well informed king, however, often acting as a Judge in the Royal Courts, and his justice was much sought after. John is also said to have founded the modern Royal Navy. In 1203 he ordered all shipyards in England to be responsible for at least one ship, with places such as the newly-built Portsmouth being responsible for several. By the end of 1204, he had 45 large galleys available to him, and from then on an average of 4 new ones every year. It was during John's reign that great improvements were made in ship design. He also created the first large transport ships.

When the Archbishop of Canterbury died on 13 July 1205, John became involved in a dispute with Pope Innocent III over who the next Archbishop should be. Eventually Innocent appointed a man who John coud not acceept and in July 1207 the Pope ordered an interdict against England. This meant no Church services could happen. John responded by seizing Church property for failure to provide feudal service. After a while, the pope realised that too long a period without church services could lead to loss of faith, and gave permission for some churches to hold Mass behind closed doors in 1209, and in 1212, the pope allowed last rites to be given to the dying. While the interdict was a burden to many, it did not result in rebellion against John. In November of 1209 John was excommunicated, and, in February 1213 Innocent threatened stronger measures unless John submitted, which he now did. 

After putting down the Welsh Uprising of 1211 and settling his dispute with the pope, John turned his attention back to his overseas interests. His European wars ended in defeat at the Battle of Bouvines, after which John had accept an unfavourable peace with France. This finally turned the barons against him, and he met their leaders at Runnymede, near London, on 15 June 1215, Great Charter, which in Latin is known as the  called, ''Magna Carta''. Because he had signed under duress, however, John received approval from his overlord the Pope to break his word as soon as hostilities had ceased, provoking the First Barons' War. For a long time, schoolchildren have learned that King John had to approve ''Magna Carta'' by attaching his seal to it because he could not sign it. In fact, King John did sign the draft of the Charter that the negotiating parties hammered out in the tent on Charter Island at Runnymede on 15-18 June 1215, but it took the clerks and scribes working in the royal offices some time after everyone went home to prepare the final copies, which they then sealed and delivered to the appropriate officials. In those days, legal documents were sealed to make them official, not signed.

===Marriage and children===

In 1189, John was married to Avisa, daughter and heiress of William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester. (She is sometimes referred to as Isabella, Hawise, Joan or Eleanor.) They had no children, and John had their marriage annulled around 1199, and she was never acknowledged as queen. In 1200, John married again, this time to Isabelle, the daughter of the Count of Angoulême, who was twenty years his junior. John and Isabelle had five children, including Henry, who went on to become the King when John died. John also had many illegitimate children.

===Death===

In 1216, Prince Louis of France invaded after being invited by the majority of English barons to replace John on the throne. John retreated, and whilst crossing the area known as The Wash in East Anglia lost his most valuable treasures, including the Crown Jewels, when he was caught by the incoming tide. This dealt him a blow, which affected his health and state of mind. He caught dysentery and died on 18 or 19 October at Newark in Lincolnshire. He was buried in Worcester Cathedral, and his nine-year-old son succeeded him and became King Henry III of England. Although Louis continued to claim the English throne, the barons switched their support to the new king, forcing Louis to give up his claim in the Treaty of Lambeth in 1217.

==Henry III (1216-1272)==
[[Image:BNMsFr2829Fol18Henry3LandsAquit.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Henry III lands in Aquitaine, as shown in a 15th century from a later illumination.]]
'''Henry III''' was born on 1 October 1207 in Winchester Castle. He became King of England in 1216 aged only 9, when he succeeded his father, John. The barons who were in dispute with John quickly withdrew their support of Prince Louis as they considered Henry a safer option, especially as the regents who ruled for Henry declared their intention to rule by ''Magna Carta''. Henry later grew into a thickset man of medium height, with a narrow forehead and a drooping left eyelid. When Henry reached maturity in 1227, the regency ended, and Henry was keen to restore royal authority. 

Henry was extremely religious, and his journeys were often delayed by his insistence on hearing Mass several times a day. He was also much taken with the cult of the Anglo-Saxon King Edward the Confessor who had been made a saint in 1161. Told that St Edward dressed austerely, Henry did the same and wore only the simplest of robes. He had a mural of the saint painted in his bedchamber for inspiration before and after sleep, and named his eldest son after him.  Henry designated Westminster, where St Edward had founded the abbey, as the fixed seat of power in England. Westminster Hall duly became the greatest ceremonial space of the kingdom, where the council of nobles also met. Henry appointed French architects to renovate Westminster Abbey in Gothic style, and work began at great expense in 1245. The centrepiece at the renovated Abbey was a shrine to Edward.

Henry's reign was marked by civil strife as the English barons, led by Simon de Montfort, the 6th Earl of Leicester, demanded more say in the running of the kingdom. After de Montfort married Henry's sister Eleanor without asking Henry, a feud developed between the two. Their relationship reached a crisis in the 1250s when de Montfort was brought to court on charges relating to actions he took as lieutenant of Gascony, the last remaining Plantagenet land across the English Channel. However, he was acquitted by the Peers of the realm, much to the King's displeasure.

Henry also funded a war in Sicily on behalf of the Pope in return for a title for his second son Edmund, which made many barons fear that Henry was following too much in the footsteps of his father and needed to be kept in check. De Montfort became leader of those who wanted to reassert Magna Carta and force the king to give more power to the baronial council. In 1258 seven leading barons forced Henry to agree to the Provisions of Oxford which effectively abolished the complete supremacy of the monarchy, and gave power to a council of fifteen barons to deal with the business of government and providing for a three yearly meeting of parliament to monitor their performance.

Henry was forced to take part in the swearing of a collective oath to the Provisions of Oxford. However, Henry's supporters and de Montfort's supporters grew further apart. When in 1262 Henry got the pope to say that he didn't need to take the oath anymore, both side raised armies and a civil war, known as the Second Barons' War started.  By 1263 de Montfort had captured most of southeastern England by and at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264, Henry was defeated and taken prisoner by de Montfort's army. 

Henry remained king, but was kept under house arrest and the real power was held by de Montfort, who carried out a number of reforms, in particular increasing representation in parliament to include each county of England and many important towns rather than keeping it to the nobility. However many of the barons who supported de Montfort began to suspect that he had gone too far with his reforms.

Only fifteen months later, Henry's son Edward, who was held as prisoner with Henry, escaped and led the royalists into battle again. De Montfort was beaten at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, and revenge was taken on de Montfort and his supporters. 

===Marriage and children===

Henry married Eleanor of Provence in 1236 and he promoted many of his French relatives to power and wealth, which was unpopular among his subjects and barons. He was also extravagant: when his first child, Prince Edward was born, Henry demanded the Londoners bring him rich gifts to celebrate, and even sent back gifts that did not please him.  He had at least four other children by Eleanor.

===Death===

Henry died in 1272 and his body was first put in the tomb of Edward the Confessor, whilst his final resting place was constructed in Westminster Abbey. Henry was succeeded as King of England by his son, Edward.

==Edward I (1272-1307)==
'''Edward I''' was born in Westminster in 1239. He was King of England from 1272 until his death in 1307. Edward initially intended to call himself Edward IV, recognising the three Saxon kings of England of that name. However, for reasons unknown he was called Edward I instead - establishing the custom of numbering English monarchs only from the Norman Conquest. His nicknames include &quot;'''Longshanks'''&quot; because he was 6 foot 2 inch tall and the &quot;'''Hammer of the Scots'''&quot; as he kept Scotland under English domination. Unlike his father, King Henry III, Edward I took great interest in the workings of his government and made a number of reforms to preserve royal rights and improve the administration of the law. 

===Marriage and children===
Edward married twice. His first marriage, in October 1254, was to Eleanor of Castile which produced sixteen children, and her death in 1290 affected Edward deeply. His second marriage, in September 1299, was to Marguerite of France (known as the &quot;Pearl of France&quot; by her English subjects), the daughter of King Philippe III of France. It produced three children.

===Military campaigns===

In 1269 a representative of the pope arrived in England and appealed to Prince Edward, as he then was, to participate in the Eighth Crusade alongside King Louis IX of France. To fund the crusade, Edward borrowed heavily from Louis IX and English Jews, even though the size of Edward's crusading group was quite small. The aim was to relieve the Christian stronghold of Acre, but Louis was diverted to Tunis. By the time that Edward arrived at Tunis, Louis had died of disease. Most of the French forces at Tunis returned home, but a small number of them joined Edward who continued onwards to Acre in the Ninth Crusade. After a short stop in Cyprus, Edward arrived in Acre with thirteen ships. While in Acre, Edward engaged in diplomacy with the Mongols hoping to form an alliance against Sultan Baibars of Egypt, but the alliance did not happen. In 1271 Hugh III of Cyprus arrived with a contingent of knights. These new forces encouraged Edward to raid the town of Ququn. Soon afterwards Edward signed a ten year peace treaty with Baibars. Around the same time, Edward was nearly killed, but fought off his attacker with a metal tripod. Edward left the Holy Land and returned to England in 1272.

One of Edward's early achievements as king was to conquer Wales. Under the 1267 Treaty of Montgomery, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd extended Welsh territories southwards into what had been the lands of the English Marcher lords, and gained the title of Prince of Wales although he still owed homage to the English monarch as overlord. Edward refused to recognise the Treaty, which had been concluded by his father. After Llywelyn repeatedly refused to pay homage to Edward in 1274-75, Edward raised an army and launched his first campaign against the Welsh prince in 1276-77. After this campaign Llywelyn was forced to pay homage to Edward and lost all his lands apart from a small amount of Gwynedd, although Edward allowed Llywelyn to keep the title of Prince of Wales. 

However, Llywelyn's younger brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd, started another rebellion in 1282. Llywelyn died shortly afterwards in a skirmish, after which Edward destroyed the remaining resistance. He captured, brutally tortured and executed Dafydd in the next year. To consolidate his conquest, Edward then built a string of massive stone castles around the coast of Wales.  Wales was incorporated into England under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. In 1301 Edward named his eldest son Edward as the new Prince of Wales. Ever since this, the eldest son of each English monarch has taken the same title.

Edward then turned to Scotland and, on 10 May 1291, Scottish nobles recognised the authority of Edward I. He had planned to marry off his son to the child queen, Margaret of Scotland, but when Margaret died the Scottish nobles agreed to have Edward select her successor from the various claimants to the throne, and he chose John Balliol. Edward summoned John Balliol to do homage to him in Westminster in 1293 and made it clear he expected John's military and financial support against France. Balliol did not accept this and entered into a pact with France and prepared an army to invade England.

Edward gathered his largest army yet and razed Berwick and massacred its inhabitants. He next went to Dunbar and Edinburgh. The Stone of Destiny, on which Scottish kings were crowned, was removed from Scone Palace and taken to Westminster Abbey, where it stayed until 1996. Balliol gave up the Scottish crown and was imprisoned in the Tower of London for three years before going to his estates in France. All freeholders in Scotland had to swear an oath of homage to Edward, and he ruled Scotland like a province through English Viceroys. Opposition sprang up, and Edward executed the focus of discontent, William Wallace, in 1305. Edward was never able to conquer of all Scotland though.

===Death===

Edward died in 1307 at Burgh-by-Sands in Cumberland by the Scottish border, while on his way to wage another campaign against the Scots, who were led by Robert the Bruce. Against his wishes, Edward was buried in Westminster Abbey. His son, Edward, succeeded him as king.

==Edward II (1307-1327)==
'''Edward II''' was born in Caernarfon Castle on 25 April 1284, the fourth son of King Edward I by his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, but he became heir to the throne when he was just a few months old, when his elder brother Alfonso died. Edward II was the first English prince to hold the title of the Prince of Wales. There is a story that his father promised the Welsh a native prince who spoke no English and presented Edward II as a baby. However, this is not true, the story coming from a 16th century Welsh work.  Edward was king of England from 1307. The new king was physically as impressive as his father. He was, however, lacking in drive and ambition. His main interest was in entertainment, though he also took pleasure in athletics and in the practice of mechanical crafts. He was deposed in January 1327, after he had alienated the English nobility. He died the following September, in what has been said to be a very brutal manner.

===Edward's first favourite===

As a prince, Edward took part in several campaigns against the Scots, but &quot;all his father's efforts could not prevent his acquiring the habits of extravagance and frivolity which he retained all through his life&quot;. Edward I put his son's problems down to Piers Gaveston, a knight from Gascony that some believe to have been the prince's lover. Gaveston was exiled by King Edward I after the then Prince Edward gave him a title reserved for royalty. When Edward I died, and Edward became King Edward II, his first acts were to recall Gaveston and to abandon the Scots campaign on which his father had set his heart. In the early years of Edward's reign Gaveston was made regent when Edward went to France.

In January 1308, Edward married Isabella of France, the daughter of King Philip IV of France. Although Edward and his wife had children, Isabella was neglected by her husband. They had two sons, Edward and John, and two daughters. Edward also had at least one illegitimate son. However, Edward spent much of his time with the few friends he shared power with, and looking to limit the power of the nobles. This made him appear to prefer the company of his male favourites, and in particular, Piers Gaveston, and this led to rumours that Edward was homosexual.

Gaveston married the king's niece, Margaret of Gloucester, and was given the earldom of Cornwall. The barons grew to hate Gaveston and twice insisted on his banishment, and Edward twice recalled his friend. As a result, the barons, led by the king's cousin, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, went to war against the king and Gaveston. Gaveston was assassinated in 1312. Edward was not strong enough to resist further, and he stood aside to allow the country to come under the rule of a baronial committee of twenty-one lords ordainers.

===Bannockburn and the dominance of the barons===

During the quarrels between Edward and the &quot;ordainers&quot;, Robert the Bruce was re-conquering Scotland. His progress was so great that he had occupied all the fortresses apart from Stirling, which he besieged. The danger of losing Stirling shamed Edward and the barons into an attempt to make up their lost ground. In June 1314 Edward led a huge army into Scotland to relieve Stirling. On 24 June, his army was heavily defeated by Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn. Bruce was now sure of his position as King of Scots, and took revenge for Edward I's actions by devastating the northern counties of England.

Edward II's defeat made him more dependent on his barons than ever, but they started to argue amongst themselves. Eventually a group of barons so hated the other barons they supported more power for Edward, and he gained more authority after 1318. Edward now found an able adviser in Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, a baron of great experience. His son, Hugh the younger Despenser, became a personal friend and favourite of Edward, and effectively replaced Gaveston. The barons hated the Despensers as much as Gaveston and resented the privileges Edward lavished them.

===The rule of the Despensers===

In 1321, the barons met in parliament, and had Hugh le Despenser and his son banished. This inspired Edward to act. In 1322 he recalled the Despensers from exile, and waged war against the barons on their behalf, which he won. For the next five years the Despensers ruled England. They instituted the rule that no law was valid unless the House of Commons had agreed to it, and this marks the most important step forward in Edward II's reign. But the rule of the Despensers soon became corrupt.

The Despensers had a dispute with Edward's queen, Isabella, over the building of a fortified town by the English possession of Aquitaine by Isabella's brother, King Charles IV of France. The Despensers took away the queen's estates. Queen Isabella kept silent until 1325, when she went to France to negotiate a solution to the dispute. Isabella's polite attitude to Despenser and Edward, despite her hostility to them, meant that she was considered loyal.

===Abdication===

However, Isabella refused to return to her husband as long as the Despensers remained his favourites. On 24 September 1326 Isabella, with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, and her son, Edward, landed a large army in Essex. She intended to expel the Despensers. Edward's followers deserted him, and on 2 October he fled London and took refuge in the younger Despenser's estates in Glamorgan. When Isabella entered London, there was a violent revolution in her favour and weeks of anarchy followed. Isabella's army followed Edward and the Despensers, and Edward was captured on 16 November and taken to Monmouth, and then Kenilworth, Castle. 

On 20 January, Edward was forced to abdicate. The Articles of Deposition accused Edward of many offences including: being incompetent to govern, unwilling to heed good counsel, allowing himself to be controlled by evil councillors, giving himself up to unseemly works and occupations, and plundering the kingdom. A parliament met that same month at Westminster and Edward's son was proclaimed King Edward III, although in practice Isabella and Mortimer held power. Both Despensers were tried and executed.
And the next day they had a battle with the Franks, half his army was killed!

===Captivity and death===

On 3 April, Edward was moved from Kenilworth and handed over to two dependants of Mortimer, who imprisoned him at Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire. It is said the Edward died in October 1327 when a red-hot iron (earlier reports say a piece of copper) was pushed up his bottom, a supposedly deserved end for a homosexual. There is no proof that this happened, and he may just have been suffocated instead.

==Edward III (1327-1377)==
[[Image:EdwardIII-Cassell.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Edward III]]
'''Edward III''' was born at Windsor Castle on 13 November 1312. He was king from 1327 until his death in 1377. He was one of the most successful English kings of mediaeval times. Edward's reign was marked by an expansion of English territory through wars in Scotland and France. His reign was marked by the start of the Hundred Years' War.

===Early reign===

Edward III was crowned on 25 January 1327, at the age of 14. As he was still a child, the country was ruled by his mother, Queen Isabella, along with Mortimer. Mortimer and Isabella made peace with the Scots, but this was highly unpopular.  In 1330, the Earl of Kent, brother of Edward II, was executed for plotting to restore Edward II, who the Earl of Kent believed to still be alive. The Earl's execution lost Mortimer his last support, and as soon as Edward III came of age in 1330, he executed Roger Mortimer on charges of treason, which included the murder of Edward II.  Edward III spared his mother, Queen Isabella, but made her retire from public life. The reign of Edward III saw continued war with Scotland, and Edward's first major military success was early in his reign at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, which he won in support of his puppet, the new Scottish king, Edward Balliol.

===The Hundred Years' War===

In 1328, Edward's uncle, King Charles IV of France, died without male heirs, although he did have a pregnant wife. This left Edward as the senior surviving male descendant of King Philip IV of France, who was Charles's and Queen Isabella's father. Edward's claim to the French throne was contested by French nobles who invoked Salic law, under which held that the royal succession could not pass through a female line. The French nobles therefore said that the legitimate king of France was Edward's cousin, Philip, who became King Philip VI of France.

Edward allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor, Louis IV, in July 1337, and declared war on Philip VI. On 26 January 1340, Edward declared himself king of France. The conflict that had now started eventually became known as the Hundred Years' War. In fact it lasted longer than 100 years up to the 1450s, although this period did not see continuous fighting.

In 1346, Edward defeated the French at the Battle of Crecy, which was also fought by his sixteen year old son, Edward, the Black Prince. The Black Prince commanded England's victorious army at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. The first phase of the Hundred Years' War was concluded in 1360 with the Treaty of Brétigny, marking the height of English influence in France and providing a three million crown ransom for the release of the captured French king, who by that time was John II.

===Edward's reign in England===

While the king and the prince campaigned abroad, the government was left largely in the hands of the prince's younger brother, John of Gaunt. Economic prosperity from the developing wool trade created new wealth in the kingdom, but the bubonic plague, or Black Death, had a significant impact on the lives of his subjects. Commercial taxes became a major source of royal revenue, which had previously been largely from taxes on land. The Parliament of England became divided into two houses. At the beginning of Edward's reign, French, which came over with the Norman Conquest, was still the language of the English aristocracy, in 1362 English was made the official language of the law courts.

The king also founded an order of knighthood, the Order of the Garter, allegedly as a result of an incident when a lady, with whom he was dancing at a court ball, dropped an item of intimate apparel. Gallantly picking it up, Edward tied it around his own leg, and remarked ''Honi soit qui mal y pense'' ('Shame on him who thinks evil of it'), which became the motto of the Order of the Garter. The woman in the incident is known only as the &quot;Countess of Salisbury&quot;. Some say it was Edward's daughter-in-law, Joan of Kent, but a more likely candidate is Joan's mother-in-law from her first marriage.

Facing a resurgent French monarchy and losses in France, Edward asked Parliament to grant him more funds by taxing the wine and wool trades, but this was badly received in 1374–1375 as a new outbreak of bubonic plague struck. The &quot;Good Parliament&quot; of 1376 criticised Edward's councillors, and advised him to limit his ambitions to suit his revenues.

===Marriage and children===

Edward III married Philippa of Hainault on 13 January 1328, when he was aged 15. The couple eventually produced thirteen children, including five sons who reached maturity. Their eldest son and Edward's heir was Edward the Black Prince, who was born in 1330. Edward was a notorious womaniser. After Philippa's death in 1369, Edward's mistress, Alice Perrers, became a byword for corruption.

===Death===

Edward died of a stroke in 1377 at Sheen Palace and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His son Edward, the Black Prince, had died the year before, and so Edward III was succeeded by his young grandson, King Richard II of England, who was the son of the Black Prince.

==Richard II (1377-1399)==
'''Richard II''' was born on 6 January 1367 in Bordeaux. He was the son of Edward the Black Prince and grandson of Edward III, whom he succeeded as King of England in 1377, when aged only ten.

=== The Peasants' Revolt ===
[[Image:Death of Wat Tyler Froissart.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Richard II watches Wat Tyler's death and addresses the peasants in the background]]
John of Gaunt, his uncle, ruled on Richard's behalf for the first years of his reign and it was the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 that brought Richard into the limelight. It fell to him personally to negotiate with Wat Tyler and the other rebel leaders and their massed armed ranks of several thousand. As Richard was only 14 at the time, this must have taken some personal courage. He offered a pardon to the leaders of the rebellion, but he went back on his word and the ringleaders were eventually arrested and executed. It remains a matter of doubt as to whether Richard always intended this to happen, or whether he was forced to go against his word by some of the English nobility. Either way, his tactics had the desired effect of dispersing the rebel forces from the streets of London back to the shires and bringing the disorder to an end. The young king seemed to be showing great promise. As he matured into adulthood, however, he was unwilling or unable to deal and compromise, which was an essential aspect of 14th century politics. This led to his downfall.

===Marriages===

On 22 January 1383 he married Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, but they had no children, and she died in June 1394. On 31 October 1396 he married Princess Isabella of Valois, daughter of King Charles VI of France, but again the marriage was childless.

=== First crisis of 1387-88 ===
As Richard began to take over the business of government himself, he sidelined many of the established nobles, and instead he turned to his inner circle of favourites for his council. The nobles he had snubbed formed the head of a group that called themselves the Lords Appellant. Their main aim was to seek to continue war with France, which went against Richard's policy of peace. This was an aim that many of them pursued in the interests of personal gain rather than the interests of the nation.

In 1387 the English Parliament, under pressure from the Lords Appellant, demanded that Richard remove his unpopular councillors. When he refused, he was told that since he was still a minor, a Council of Government would rule in his place. Richard had the Earl of Arundel, leader of the Lords Appellant, arrested, but Richard's small army was overpowered by the forces of the Lords Appellant outside Oxford, and Richard was held in the Tower of London. Richard's unpopular councillors were either executed or exiled, and Richard was forced to accept new councillors. Richard was effectively stripped of almost all his authority.

=== A fragile peace ===

In the years which followed, Richard became more cautious in his dealings with the barons. In 1390 a tournament was held to celebrate Richard's coming of age. The situation at court had improved since Richard's uncle John of Gaunt's return from Spain to lead the Lords Appellant. Richard’s team of knights, The Harts, all wore the identical symbol – a white hart – which Richard had chosen for himself. Richard himself favoured genteel interests like fine food, insisting spoons be used at his court and inventing the handkerchief. He beautified Westminster Hall with a new ceiling and was a keen and cultured patron of the arts, architecture and literature. However, his tastes were before his time and many began to see him as another Edward II figure, unworthy of his military Plantagenet heritage. Richard lacked the thirst for battle. His Scottish campaign in 1385 was not decisive, and he signed a 28-year truce with France in 1396 which was hugely unpopular at home in spite of the dividends that peace brought to the kingdom.

Richard's commitment to peace rather than war can also been seen in his first expedition to Ireland in 1394. He put forward a sensible policy based on the belief that the Irish rebels were motivated largely by the grievances they had against absentee English landowners. Those who he labelled the &quot;wild Irish&quot; - native Irish who had not joined the rebel cause - he treated with kindness and respect.

=== Second crisis of 1397-99===

In spite of his forward-thinking attitude toward culture and the arts, Richard seems to have developed a passionate devotion to the old ideal of the Divine Right of Kings, that he could pretty much do whatever he wanted. In 1397 Richard decided to rid himself of the Lords Appellant, who were confining his power, on the pretext of an aristocratic plot. Richard had the Earl of Arundel executed and Warwick exiled, while Gloucester died in captivity. Finally able to exert his autocratic authority over the kingdom, he got rid of all those he saw as not totally committed to him, fulfilling his own idea of becoming God's chosen prince. 

As Richard was still childless, the heir to the throne was Roger Mortimer, the Earl of March, and after his death in 1398, his seven-year-old son Edmund. However, Richard was more concerned with Gaunt's son and heir Henry Bolingbroke, whom he banished for ten years in 1399. After Gaunt's death, Richard seized Bolingbroke's lands and gave them to his own followers. At this point Richard left for a campaign in Ireland, which allowed Bolingbroke to land in Yorkshire with an army provided by the King of France. Richard's autocratic ways worried many nobles and were deeply unpopular, which helped Bolingbroke to soon gain control of most of southern and eastern England. Bolingbroke originally just wanted his inheritance and a return of the Lords Appellant, but with Richard remaining King and Edmund as his successor. But by the time Richard finally arrived back on the mainland in Wales, a tide of discontent had swept England. In the King's absence, Bolingbroke, who was generally well-liked, was being urged to take the crown himself.

Richard was captured at Conway Castle in Wales and taken to London, where crowds pelted him with rubbish. He was held in the Tower of London and forced to abdicate. He was brought, on his request, before parliament, where he officially gave up his crown. Thirty-three official charges were made against him, but he was not allowed to answer them. Parliament then accepted Henry Bolingbroke as the new king. 

===Death===

Richard was moved in Pontefract Castle, and was probably murdered there in 1400. Richard's body was put on display in the old St Paul's Cathedral for all to see that he was really dead, and he was then buried in Kings Langley Church. His coffin was badly designed, however, and it was easy for disrespectful visitors to place their hands through several openings in the coffin and interfere with what was inside. It is said that a schoolboy walked off with Richard's jawbone. Despite all this, rumours that Richard was still alive continued well into the reign of King Henry, who decided to move Richard's body to its final resting place in Westminster Abbey with much ceremony in 1413.

==Synopsis==
This book attempts to teach you the skills that can help you to have lucid dreams &amp;mdash; dreams in which you know that you are dreaming. Lucid dreams have been scientifically proven to exist. Being aware that you are dreaming, and still remaining asleep, can give you the ability to control your dreams. Lucid dreaming truly can be a fantastic experience. See the introduction for more details on what lucid dreaming is. 

First, you will find out a little on what dreaming is from the biological aspect. Then, the book will explain how to improve your dream recall so that you remember more of your dreams. Next, it will explain how to become lucid during dreams, and how to stay lucid. It’ll also explain how to keep yourself in the dream and prevent it from “fading”. Finally, there will be some suggestions for what you could do within your lucid dreams.

Remember, you can edit any page to add information &amp;mdash; simply click on the “edit” tab at the top of the page. Your changes will be visible immediately, but don’t worry if you make a mistake, since other users of the wikibook can fix things for you if you do something wrong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">
== Glossary of Terms ==

Here is a list of terms used throughout the book, and their definitions.

; Ante : Required bet by all players to join the hand, and ensures a pot for the hand. There are usually no antes in games played with blinds.
; Bet : To commit an amount of money or chips to the pot in turn during a betting phase. If ''called'' or ''raised'', a bet is placed in the pot.
; Big Bet : The value of one turn and river bet in a limit game
; Big Blind : The larger of two bets that are placed before receiving cards. When blinds are used this bet is placed by the player in second position (the player to the left of the ''small blind''). In limit poker, it is usually half of the ''small bet''
; Button : A large button that is usually passed, to the left, from player to player each hand to indicate what player the dealer is dealing for.  
; Call : To match an opponents ''bet'' and commit the same amount of money or chips to the pot in turn during a betting phase.
; Card : A standard playing card has one side that is indistinguishable from the rest and one side that has a suit and rank that makes it unique.
; Check : This indicates that the player wishes to stay in the hand but not commit any more chips to the hand. This can only be done when the bet to the player does not require any more money or chips be committed to the pot. This can be indicated by knocking the table.
; Cut : The act of splitting the deck into two piles after a shuffle to prevent anyone from knowing the bottom card. This is done by lifting some of the cards off the top and placing them toward the dealer. The dealer then lifts the other cards (the lower cards) and places them on top of the top cards.
; Deal : To give each player the number of cards defined by the game in the fashion defined by the game.
; Dealer : The person that is dealing the cards out to the players. If the dealer is not one of the players then the ''button'' is used to indicate the player that the dealer is dealing for and the hand is dealt as if the player with the button was dealing.
; Deck : A standard deck of 52 playing cards with four suits, each with 13 ranked cards.
; Flop : In Texas Hold'em, the first three community cards.
; Fold : To drop out of the hand and surrender your cards in turn during a betting phase. Any money or chips previously committed to the pot are forfeited by this move. Folding is usually indicated by turning any up cards over, and then giving the cards to the dealer. Cards that are folded are not shown unless the act of folding ends the game.
; Hi-Hand : In a hi-lo game, a hand with a standard combination, such as a pair or a straight
; Limit : In a '''Limit''' game there is a value assigned to the limit and usually (depending on the game choice) has a small and big value. A $10-$20 Limit game has a small bet of $10 and big bet of $20.
; Limp in : A term used to describe when a player sitting in the ''small blind'' position, who has already committed some chips to the pot, ''calls'' the ''big blind'' bet.
; Lo-Hand : In a hi-lo game, a hand with all cards being 8 (sometimes 9) or lower. The lower the card ranks, the better the hand
; Muck : To ''fold'' or to throw away a loosing hand in a showdown without showing the hand.
; No-Limit : In a '''No-Limit''' game there is no limit to the amount a player may bet (other than the amount of chips that player has).
; Nuts : aka Nut hand. The best hand possible considering the community cards in community card poker.
; Out : In community card poker, any card that helps one improve his hand. Nut out gives the player nuts
; Pot-Limit : Bets in a '''Pot-Limit''' game are limited to the amount of chips already committed to the pot. This means that any bet can at most double the pot.
; Raise : To ''call'' an opponents ''bet'' and to ''bet'' more at the same time in turn during a betting phase.
; Shuffle : To mix up the ''deck'' of ''cards'' so that they are randomly ordered. A '''shuffle''' is usually followed by a ''cut'' to minimize the usability of the information a player may obtain by spotting the bottom ''card'' during the '''shuffle'''.
; Small Bet : The value of one preflop and flop bet in a limit game
; Small Blind : The smaller of two bets that are placed before receiving cards. When blinds are used this bet is placed by the player to the left of the ''button''. It is usually half of the '' big blind''

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Bleed=

Bleed is used to describe air extracted from the compressor stages of an engine for some purpose other than combustion with fuel.  There are different types of bleed

==Aircraft Bleed==
Bleed air drawn off the engine compressor section to deliver to the aircraft, most commonly for supply to the aircraft environment control system for delivery to the passengers / cargo compartment.  Also known as customer bleed by engine manufacturers.

==Handling bleed==
Bleed air drawn off the engines compressor stage(s) to avoid surge or stall of the airflow through the engine.

==Engine cooling and sealing bleed==
Generically part of the engine internal air system, taking air from the compressor (possibly at more than one point along it) and using the air for various purposes in the operation of the engine, most commonly component cooling in the hot parts of the combustion system and turbines, and for sealing airflows, e.g. into bearing chambers to prevent ingress of destructively hot air from the main gas path.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Joining the Team ==
Hey I am an avid Halo fan and would like to contribute and help out with writing and re-organizing this/these wikibooks. It looks like there hasn't been much activity here, so if I don't hear from anybody in a day or two I hope it's okay that I might start working on the project.

== ==Comments== ==

Well, this is a really great idea, and I'd love to contribute. But, my one concern at the moment is... Shouldn't we have different Wikibooks for different games? They're completely separate titles, and I just think that it'd be a good idea to have each game separate from each other one. [[User:Soviet Dolphin|Soviet Dolphin]] 22:39, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

== Good point ==

Well, this book originally started covering Halo and Halo 2, and I never really thought to change it, but I'll seperate them into two different books in a few days, because that does make more sense.

== Transwikified to StrategyWiki ==

As was requested, I've merged this content with StrategyWiki's old Halo and Halo 2 guides, but I'm at a loss for what to do with the pages here. Should they be deleted? I've changed this page to point to the StrategyWiki ones. --[[User:MrDrBob|MrDrBob]] 12:00, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; be complex numbers. Since we have:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|z+w|^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = (z+w) \overline {(z+w)} = (z + w)(\bar z + \bar w)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=|z|^2 + z \bar w + \overline { z \bar w } + |w|^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=|z|^2 + 2\mbox{Re }(z \bar w) + |w|^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\le |z|^2 + 2|z||w| + |w|^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= (|z| + |w|)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}
the triangular inequality follows after taking the square root of both sides. Note here we used the properties:
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{ Re}(z) \le |z|&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|z| = |\bar z|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z + \bar z = 2\mbox{Re }(z)&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, the induction shows:
:&lt;math&gt;\left | \sum_1^n z_k \right | \le \sum_1^n |z_k|&lt;/math&gt;

==Structure by interest group==

I believe it would be useful to have a structure for the main page by interest group, by which I mean:

*Wikids (for example), for children under 8 (I don't think we have any books in the category yet though)
*[[Wikijunior]], for 8 to 12 year olds
*Wikistudy I, for those progressing towards exams usually first sat at age 15 or 16
*Wikistudy II, for those progressing towards exams usually first sat at age 17 or 18
*[[Wikiversity]], for undergraduates and graduates
*Wikiprofessional, for books useful to those engaged in a profession (eg accountancy)
*Wikilearn, for adult-learning books (eg computer programming books)
*Wikileisure, for books on leisure pursuits (eg the cookbook, Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter)

I'd be interested in others' views, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 14:33, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

== {{French/Section|Dialogue|A formal conversation|Une conversation formelle}} ==

Two people—Monsieur Bernard and Monsieur Lambert—are meeting for the first time:

{{French/Dialogue list
 | a = Monsieur Bernard
 | b = Monsieur Lambert
 | Bonjour. Comment vous appelez-vous ? | Hello. What's your name?
 | Je m'appelle Jean-Paul Lambert. Et vous ? | I am Jean-Paul Lambert. And you?
 | Moi, je suis Marc Bernard. Enchanté. | Me, I am Marc Bernard. Nice to meet you.
 | Enchanté. | Nice to meet you.
 | audio = French Dialogue - A Formal Conversation.ogg
}}

== {{French/Section|Grammar|''Vous'' vs. ''tu''}} ==
This is an important difference between French and English today. English no longer distinguishes between the singular, and the plural, formal version of ''you''. The use of ''thou'' for the informal singular version faded almost completely by the mid-nineteenth century.

In French, it is important to know when to use {{French/Word|vous|IPA=/vu/|approx=voo|audio=Fr-vous.ogg}} and when to use {{French/Word|tu|IPA=/ty/|approx=tew|audio=Fr-tu.ogg}}.

''Vous'' is the plural form of ''you''. This is somewhat equivalent to ''you all'', ''you guys'', ''all of you'', except that it does not carry any familiarity when used with the plural. You would use it to address your friends as well as when talking to the whole government at a press conference.

''Vous'' is also used to refer to single individuals to show respect, to be polite or to be neutral. It is used when talking to someone who is important, someone who is older than you are, or someone with whom you are unfamiliar. This is known as Vouvoiement. Note the conversation between M. Bernard and M. Lambert above as an example of this use.

Conversely, ''tu'' is the singular and informal form of ''vous'' (''you'') in French.  It is commonly used when referring to a friend or a family member, and is also used between children or when addressing a child. If it is used when speaking to a stranger, it signals disrespect. This is known as Tutoiement. As a rule of thumb, use ''tu'' only when you would call that person by his first name, otherwise use ''vous''. French people will make it known when they would like you to refer to them by ''tu''. The use of ''vous'' is less common in Quebequois than in French from France.

In sociolinguistics, a T–V distinction describes the situation wherein a language has second-person pronouns that distinguish varying levels of politeness, social distance, courtesy, familiarity, or insult toward the addressee. The expressions T-form (informal) and V-form (formal), with reference to the initial letters of these pronouns in Latin, tu and vos. In Latin, tu was originally the singular, and vos the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. It was only between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries that the norms for the use of T- and V-forms crystallized.

|}
Note that with ''vous'', the verb ''appelez'' is spelled with '''one''' 'l', whereas with ''tu'' it has two l's (''appelles''). This is an irregular conjugation which will be covered more in-depth in a later lesson.

When talking to one's peers or to children, ''Salut'' is used as a greeting. Its English equivalents would be ''hi'' and ''hey''. ''Bonjour'', literally meaning ''good day'', should be used for anyone else. One way of remembering these greetings, is that they come in masculine/feminine pairs. One is upon arrival, the other upon departure.
&lt;p&gt;
jour : bonjour / bonne journée&lt;br /&gt;
matin :  bonjour / bonne matinée (early in the morning), bonne journée (early or late in the morning)&lt;br /&gt;
après-midi : bonjour / bon(ne) après-midi (early in the afternoon), bonne journée (early or late in the afternoon), bonne soirée (late in the afternoon)&lt;br /&gt;
soir : bonjour, bonsoir / bonne soirée (early or late in the evening), bonne nuit (very late in the evening)&lt;br /&gt;
nuit : bonjour, bonsoir / bonne nuit&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The French never say Bon matin, They do use matinée, journée, soirée but never use nuitée.

In addition to being used as an informal greeting, ''Salut'' also means ''bye''. Again, it should only be used among friends. Another informal greeting is ''ciao'', an Italian word commonly used in France. ''Au revoir'' is the only formal way to say ''Good-bye.'' If you will be meeting someone again soon, use ''À bientôt'' or ''À tout à l'heure''. ''À demain'' is used if you will be seeing the person the following day.

''Ça va?'' is used to ask someone how they are doing. The phrase literally means ''It goes?'', referring to the body and life. A more formal way to say this is ''Comment allez-vous?''. You can respond by using ''ça va'' as a statement; ''Ça va.'' in this case is used for ''I'm fine.'' The adverb {{French/Word|bien|IPA=/bjɛ̃/|approx=by&lt;sup&gt;uh&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;|audio=Fr-bien.ogg}} is used to say ''well'', and is often said both alone and as ''Ça va bien.'' ''Bien'' is preceded by certain adverbs to specify the degree to which you are well. Common phrases are ''assez bien'', meaning ''rather well'', ''très bien'', meaning ''very well'', and ''vraiment bien'', meaning ''really well''. The adverb {{French/Word|mal|IPA=/mal/|audio=Fr-mal.ogg}} is used to say ''badly''. {{French/Word|Pas|en=not|IPA=/pɑ/|audio=Fr-pas.ogg}} is commonly added to ''mal'' to form ''Pas mal.'', meaning ''Not bad.'' ''Comme ci, comme ça.'', literally translating to ''Like this, like that.'', is used to say ''So, so''.

To be polite, you can add {{French/Word|merci|IPA=/mɛʁ.si/|audio=Fr-merci-fr-Paris.ogg}}, meaning ''thank you'', in your responses to the questions e.g., ''très bien, merci''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Simple harmonic motion==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
A body executes simple harmonic motion if its acceleration is proportional to its displacement from a fixed point, and is always in the direction of that point.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

To explore simple harmonic motion (SHM) let's take the example of a spring with a mass in the absence of gravity (interestingly, you get SHM even with gravity present).  If this is our ideal spring, the force is &lt;math&gt;~kx&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;~k&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the stiffness of the spring and &lt;math&gt;~x&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement.  The force is toward the origin if that is the equilibrium position of the spring, so we write &lt;math&gt;~-kx&lt;/math&gt; to remind ourselves of that.  Now, Newton's second law becomes

&lt;math&gt;m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -kx&lt;/math&gt;.

This differential equation is easy enough to solve, and the answer is &lt;math&gt;~A cos( \omega_0 t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;~A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~\phi&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants and &lt;math&gt;~\omega_0 = \sqrt{k/m}&lt;/math&gt;.  It does not really matter how we got the solution, because we are physicists, not mathematicians.  This is the answer we are expecting, so we try it, and lo and behold, it works.  If you do not believe me, substitute it in.  Moreover, this is the complete solution, and you will just have to believe me on that because it is slightly more difficult to prove.

Without loss of generality, we will take &lt;math&gt;~\phi&lt;/math&gt;, also called the phase shift, to be zero (if you are concerned about this, we are just defining where &lt;math&gt;~t=0&lt;/math&gt; is).

Now, a remarkable thing we recognize about the solution is that the frequency (radians per second), &lt;math&gt;~\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;~A&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, no matter how big the oscillations are, the frequency is the same.  A pendulum approximately undergoes SHM, so this is why they are used in clocks, the amplitude doesn't affect the period!  By the way, we have added the subscript zero to omega because we are going to have some other omegas soon.

Some terms to remember are frequency, f (cycles per second) = &lt;math&gt;~ \omega_0 / (2 \pi) &lt;/math&gt; and the period, T = &lt;math&gt;~ 1/f &lt;/math&gt;.  These are not so important, but often people will specify the frequency or the period instead of the angular frequency, so they can be helpful.

Now, to get the velocity, differentiate the position, and to get the acceleration, differentiate the velocity.  We have,

&lt;math&gt;~v = A \omega_0 sin ( \omega_0 t)&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;~a = -A \omega_0^2 cos( \omega_0 t) = - \omega_0^2 x&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, we have avoided saying what &lt;math&gt;~A&lt;/math&gt; is.  It turns out, it depends on the problem, or the initial conditions.  We can say the velocity or position of the oscillator at some t is something and then use the expression for &lt;math&gt;~v&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;~a&lt;/math&gt; to find &lt;math&gt;~A&lt;/math&gt;.  You can do the same thing with the phase if you want, but it is a little tedious and doesn't tell us much.

Notice the greatest velocity is at the equilibrium position &lt;math&gt;~(x = 0)&lt;/math&gt; of the oscillation.  We can go on making such statements, but they are all extremely obvious if you simply plot out the position, velocity, and acceleration on the same graph.

==Damping==

An object that oscillates freely oscillates at its natural frequency. If it loses no energy, it will continue to oscillate forever. Damping is when an oscillating mass loses energy. There are 3 types of damping:

1) Light - The amplitude gradually decreases over time

2) Heavy - The mass would overshoot 0 displacement

3) Critical - The displacement decreases to 0 without any oscillation. 

The cause of damping is frictional forces, e.g. Car suspension

Let's try to quantify this a bit.  Say there is a friction force which is proportional to the velocity (this is a pretty good approximation in many cases) with constant of proportionality c.  Then, by Newton's second law,

&lt;math&gt;~m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + c \frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

This equation is a little trickier to solve than without the friction.  We going to use a very nice trick which you will find throughout physics, and whenever you have similar equations.  Notice that if &lt;math&gt;~x&lt;/math&gt; is a solution and &lt;math&gt;~y&lt;/math&gt; is a solution, then &lt;math&gt;~ax + by&lt;/math&gt; is also a solution, where &lt;math&gt;~a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~b&lt;/math&gt; are constants (real or complex).  This property means the equation is called &quot;linear.&quot;  We know that &lt;math&gt;~e^{ix} = cos(x) + i sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Assume &lt;math&gt;~x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;~Ae^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we just take the real part of &lt;math&gt;~x&lt;/math&gt; and we get our answer because the equation is linear, but exponentials are so much easier to work with than sines and cosines.  The equation of motion becomes

&lt;math&gt;~(-m \omega^2 + i \omega c + k) e^{i \omega t} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

So,

&lt;math&gt;~(m \omega^2 - i \omega c - k) = 0&lt;/math&gt; or
&lt;math&gt;~\omega_0 = ic/2m \plusmn \sqrt{(c/m)^2 /4 - k/m}&lt;/math&gt;.

Defining &lt;math&gt; ~\gamma = c/m&lt;/math&gt;, and remembering &lt;math&gt;\omega_0^2 = k/m&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;~\omega = i \gamma /2 \plusmn \sqrt{-\gamma ^2 /4 + \omega_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Defining &lt;math&gt; ~\omega_\gamma = \sqrt{-\gamma ^2 /4 + \omega_0^2} &lt;/math&gt;, we have the general solution

&lt;math&gt; ~Ae^{-\gamma/2 + i\omega_\gamma} + Be^{-\gamma/2 - i\omega_\gamma} = e^{-\gamma/2} (A e^{i\omega_\gamma} + B e^{-i\omega_\gamma} ) &lt;/math&gt;.

All we do is take the real part of this with Euler's identity, and we have,

&lt;math&gt; ~C e^{-\gamma/2} cos( \omega_\gamma t + \phi) &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;~C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~\phi&lt;/math&gt; are just &lt;math&gt;~A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~B&lt;/math&gt; written a different way.  You can find them if you want, but they won't be very helpful.  Notice that the oscillator oscillates with ever decreasing amplitude, but not at it's &quot;natural&quot; frequency, but at a different frequency.

It is conceivable that &lt;math&gt;~\omega_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is imaginary, in which case, the entire solution is just a negative exponential!  This is called critical damping, when it just turns into being an exponential instead of oscillatory motion.

== Waves ==

We all have seen water waves, such as the ripples in a pond or puddle.  Although the wave moves from one point to another, the water itself does not go with it.  So, what are waves?  They are somewhat difficult to define, yet they are present throughout physics -- water waves, seismic waves, sound waves, light waves, and many others.  Waves are generally characterized by propagating themselves; if you leave a wave alone, it keeps going.  But already we have exceptions because some materials absorb waves, so it won't necessarily keep going.  Furthermore, waves usually travel through a medium, which is a fancy word for substance.  Water waves travel in water, sound waves travel in air (or just about anything else).  However, light does not seem to travel in a medium, but rather through empty space.  So, a wave does not even need something to travel in, it seems.  In any case, instead of asking around trying to figure out precisely what waves ''are,'' let's try to say some useful things about waves.

First, we will introduce a common wave equation (the equation which describes how waves move), which holds true for electromagnetic waves in vacuum, for small waves in a tight string, and for small sound waves.  Then we will take a look at it's solutions and try to understand some of the principles of waves.

&lt;math&gt; ~\nabla^2 E = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial^2 t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; ~\nabla^2 E \equiv \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial^2 x} + \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial^2 y} + \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial^2 z}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;~E&lt;/math&gt; can be pressure, displacement, or a component of the electric field, or something else, but in any case, this is the equation you get for many things.

First, let's look at the one dimensional equation.

&lt;math&gt;~ \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial^2 z} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial^2 t}&lt;/math&gt;.

I will tell you the solutions to this equations, because that is what we care about.  It is a little more difficult to prove that they are the only solutions than it is to verify they are solutions, but you will have to take my word for it.  We don't really care how we get the solutions because we are physicists not mathematicians.

&lt;math&gt; ~E = A f(x + ct) + B g(x - ct) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;~A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~B&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants, and &lt;math&gt;~f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~g&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary functions.  Interestingly enough, it does not matter what &lt;math&gt;~f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~g&lt;/math&gt; are!  Physically speaking, the two terms correspond waves moving to the left and to the right at the speed c.  Notice that if I have two solutions, say, &lt;math&gt;~E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~E'&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;~ aE + bE' &lt;/math&gt; is also a solution where &lt;math&gt;~a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;~b&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants.  This is one of the most useful properties of the solutions to this wave equation.  This property is known as linearity.

So, we know everything about waves since we have the solution to the wave equation, right?  Wrong.  Let's take some particularly special solutions to this equation and study them a bit.

&lt;math&gt;~A cos(-\omega t + k x + \phi) &lt;/math&gt;

is a solution provided that

&lt;math&gt;~\frac{\omega}{k} = c &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;~k&lt;/math&gt; is called the wave number or wave vector (it will be a vector when we look at the three dimensional solutions), &lt;math&gt;~\omega&lt;/math&gt; is called the frequency (measured in radians per second, not cycles per second), &lt;math&gt;~\phi&lt;/math&gt; is called the phase shift, and &lt;math&gt;~A&lt;/math&gt; is called the amplitude.  Physically this corresponds to a sine wave of frequency &lt;math&gt;~k&lt;/math&gt; moving to the right, with each point going up and down with frequency &lt;math&gt;~\omega&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, &lt;math&gt;~k&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency in space and &lt;math&gt;~\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency in time.  &lt;math&gt;~c&lt;/math&gt; is called the phase velocity in this case (we will see that there is another kind of velocity, but it happens to be the same as this velocity for this particular equation).

Some people like to talk about frequency in cycles per second and give it a special name, &lt;math&gt;~f&lt;/math&gt;.  Some people like to talk about wavelength, &lt;math&gt;~\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, which is just &lt;math&gt;~\frac{2 \pi}{k}&lt;/math&gt; and is the distance from crest to crest.  Fairly obviously, &lt;math&gt;~\lambda f = c &lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;~\frac{\omega}{k} = c &lt;/math&gt;.  Some people call this one of the most important or beautiful relationships of physics, but I would disagree.  It really is not that profound, it is just telling us that if &lt;math&gt;~f&lt;/math&gt; crests pass us per second, and the distance from crest to crest is &lt;math&gt; ~\lambda &lt;/math&gt;, the speed of the wave is just &lt;math&gt; ~f \lambda &lt;/math&gt; which is just using conversion factors.  It is actually pretty mundane.

So, what can we do with these solutions we have found?  Why, make new solutions!  We already know that if we have two solutions we can add them together to get another solution.  We use Fourier analysis and you will find it just about anywhere you find linear systems.  It turns out that we can write any periodic function, discontinuous or not, as the sum of many sine waves and cosine waves of different frequencies.  So, we usually construct a solution based on a boundary condition by finding the coefficients for the different components.  This is the big deal about sine waves -- they add up to make any function you want.

&lt;!-- If someone wants to actually do the Fourier analysis, that would be great --&gt;

===Three Dimensional Solutions===

&lt;!-- Spherical waves, plane waves, the (w,k) wave vector --&gt;

To generalize from one to three dimensions, we convert k and x into vectors: &lt;math&gt;k\rightarrow\vec k&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\vec r&lt;/math&gt;.  To create a scalar phase, we need to take the dot product between these vectors:

&lt;math&gt;cos(-\omega t + k x + \phi) \rightarrow cos(-\omega t + \vec k\cdot\vec r + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

===Phase and Group Velocity===

== {{French/Section|Vocabulary|Time|Le temps}} ==

In French, ''il est'' is used to express the time; though it would literally translate as ''he is'', it is actually, in this case, equivalent to ''it is'' (impersonal ''il''). Unlike in English, it is always important to use ''heures'' (''hours'') when referring to the time. In English, it is okay to say ''It’s nine'', but this wouldn’t make sense in French.

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French Vocabulary - Time.ogg}}
| Quelle heure est-il ? || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || What time is it?
|-
| Il est une heure. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is one o’clock.
|-
| Il est trois heures. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is three o’clock.
|-
| Il est dix heures. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is ten o’clock.
|-
| Il est midi. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is noon.
|-
| Il est minuit. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is midnight.
|-
| Il est quatre heures cinq. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is five past four.
|-
| Il est quatre heures et quart. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is a quarter past four.
|-
| Il est quatre heures moins le quart || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is a quarter till 4.
|-
| Il est quatre heures quinze. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is four fifteen.
|-
| Il est quatre heures et demie. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is half past four.
|-
| Il est quatre heures trente. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is four thirty.
|-
| Il est cinq heures moins vingt. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is twenty to five.
|-
| Il est quatre heures quarante. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || It is four forty.
|}
Time is often abbreviated using ''h'' for ''heure(s)''. For example, 9 o'clock AM would be ''9h'' or ''9h00''. They also use 24-hour time in this format, so 10 o'clock PM would be ''22h''.

The concept is difficult to ''grasp''. This expression is telling of the significance beyond function alone that our hands hold for us. Indeed the use of the word ''hold'' in this way alludes to the same point. With our hands we verify the reality of our physical existence and with our hands we make our way in the world and manipulate it's resources to improve our existence. 

An encyclopedia of the periodic table attests to the fact that man has indeed sought to make some use of every element which composes the matter around us*.  We are born to explore and exploit our world and our hands are not just the implements but symbolize that nature in us as well. 

Even the most ardent atheist is given to wonder at the reiteration of forms found in our hands in our DNA and in the shapes of galaxies and consider that some universal design principle is at work.

Yet as we consider the intricacies it is apparent that this beautiful tool did indeed come about through a process of evolution from a limb for support to one of suspension then to a tool to modify the world.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=1572915 thumb ]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Each orthopedic surgeon seeks the optimal job and in some cases finds it without effort, and in other cases can never seem to find the right fit. Indeed the decision as to where to work may be governed more by priorities other than the work itself. We may be satisfied with a lower income or the need to travel to several hospitals or a demanding call schedule if the pay off in a nice home by the water's edge.

Nothing it seems will do more for your happiness in your work than finding good partners to work with. While a partnership is not a marriage there is indeed a relationship based on trust, mutual respect, and a tendency to help one another out as a matter of course and without a rigid quid quo pro approach as one might have in  ones general interactions in society.  It is more than just the sharing of overhead.  This is the setting in which most orthopedics tend to work.  A staff model or faculty position functions in much the same way although the larger the group the more difficult it is to maintain a cohesive working structure.

A group practice in orthopedic surgery is a form of kinship group.


http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/102/33/11951?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=&amp;hits=&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=work+group+size&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT

The most common basis for group structure is a shared call schedule. This is generally looked upon as a shared burden. Typically the work week is split each member of the group alternating each 24hours, as in from 7:30 to 7:30. Weekends are usually covered by one member who is available to the Emergency room, to field questions from patients and to be available for referrals to the practice occurring during this time. Inpatient rounds are likewise accomplished by the physician on call for the group.  

The structure of the work week creates a natural tendency for an optimal group size of 5 which allows for one member absent on vacation and the remaining 4 each taking one day during the week, and one weekend a month. In groups smaller than 5 the burden of call can be one of the most onerous aspects of the job and one which even becomes the deciding factor in a decision to retire.

I put some ideas about how to use the paper at your request for a good location at Wikibooks staff lounge.  Maybe we can get an initial standard tree in the namespace proposed/specified/requested by our hosting Wikibookean community while we wait for our own URL root so we can devise our own better specialized local tailoring.  If they (WikiXXXeans, Board, etc.) give you any useful information regarding this please put a pointer on my talk page.  Some other Wikiversity people do not really care how we get started as long as we have freedom to evolve improvements sooner or later.  [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 11:51, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

== Policy ==

Thanks for the head's up. I was actually in the middle of reading and commenting on your suggestions in staff lounge when you left me the message. I'll finish my comments! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:07, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

:Since you seem to be interested in policy as well, I would like to mention that we are doing some major discussions for [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal|the new &quot;General Voting Rules&quot; policy proposal]], and you are certainly welcome to read through the proposed policy, and to give some feedback. Once we get an official voting policy in place (can you believe we've gone all this time without one?), we will have a solid foundation for preparing other policies. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:41, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

== Writing lessons ==

Hello,

thanks for the nice feedback on my &quot;Bite-sized language lessons&quot; proposal. I'm presently working on writing lessons that follow the same principle of step-by-step learning rather than trying to cramp everything into the student's head at once. You can see sample lessons for the [[Modern Greek]] script. I believe this approach would also work out well for Thai and take away a major stumbling block for people interested in learning Thai but afraid of learning a new alphabet. If you'd like to try it, make a page similar to [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]] listing as many suitable words and names as you can think of and their transliteration and inform me. I'll gladly help you by finding a good order to introduce letters and starting to write the lessons. Deal?

Hawberries are berries known to grow on Manitoulin Island thanks to its distinctive alkaline soil. During the pioneer days, white settlers ate these berries during the winter as the only remaining food supply. People who saw these settlers collecting the berries started to call them &quot;haweaters&quot;. People born on the island are now called &quot;haweaters&quot;.

A hawberry is small and oblong, similar in size and shape to a small olive or grape. It is red in colour when ripe and grows on bushes. Varying from a shrub to a small tree, hawberries develop in groups of 2-3 along smaller branches. Berries delicate in taste and are pulpy with multiple seeds.

The hawberry is edible, but is commonly made into jellies, jams, and syrups rather than eaten whole. Some people say pick them when they are bright red in color, and others say to wait until they are black and are about to fall apart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Proper tire inflation is very important. All tires should be inflated to the pressure recommended in the vehicles owner manual.  Cars sold recently that meet U.S standards will have a notice, often on the driver's door frame but sometimes elsewhere, like in the glove compartment, showing what the front and rear pressures should be, and they should be listed in the owner's manual.
This should be between the minimum and maximum pressure ratings listed on the sidewall of the tire. Improper inflation may result in poor/unsafe handling, blowouts, poor gas mileage or excessive tire wear. Contrary to some expectations, blowouts are much more frequently a result of underinflation than overinflation; as tire pressure lowers, the sidewalls of the tire flex more during rotation causing more heat, which builds up and damages the tire. In contrast, tires are manufactured with a substantial margin of safety for overinflation.

The manufacturer's suggestions are a good place to start, if it is intended to adjust pressures optimally. Historically American cars would usually have the specified tire pressure somewhat low, for a more &quot;cushiony&quot; ride, but this practice is reduced of late. If suggested pressures are not available, or if the vehicle is modified, Usenet quotes an algorithm from Oscar Pereda, an engineer for BFGoodrich, as a good starting point for pressure in pounds per square inch:
:(Vehicle Weight in lb/100) psi + 2 psi at heavier end + 2 psi all around if suspension and alignment are stock. 
If equipment is available to measure the temperature of the tire tread, they should be inflated so as to achieve even temperature distribution across the treads of all four tires; higher temperature in the center of the tread compared to the edges indicates overinflation, while the opposite indicates underinflation; higher temperatures at one end of the car similarly indicates that that end is overinflated with respect to the other end.

Tire pressures can then be altered to tune handling. If, after the pressure is set up, the car seems to lack adhesion at one end, then air can be added to the tires on that end (one or two pounds at a time) until balance seems to be achieved to suit the driver. As an example, in the rear-engined Chevrolet Corvair, the normal oversteering tendency of a rear-engined vehicle was combated by keeping front tire pressures down to twelve psi, which was safe because of the low weight the front tires carried on that car; if the front tire pressure was raised to what would be normal for a front-engined vehicle, the car would become dangerously unstable.

In the case of tires with very thick tread, such as aggressive mud or snow tires, the tendency described above to build up heat and deteriorate is that much greater, and therefore they should be inflated closer to the maximum pressure given on the sidewall, altered as necessary for safe handling, as described above.

The almost universal adoption of radial tires has made adhesion on wet pavement less of a problem; however, where bias-ply tires are still used, the speed at which &quot;hydroplaning&quot; occurs, ''i.e.'' the tire loses contact with the pavement and begins to slide on the film of water, can be easily calculated as the square root of the tire pressure, times ten psi. If high speed driving on wet pavement with bias-ply tires is contemplated, this is something that must be taken into account.


You will need a tire gauge. You can get a cheap pen style gauge for between $1 and $5 (USD) at a gas station or automotive shop.

To check the tire pressure, locate the valve stem, take the cap off it, and firmly push the gauge onto it, and then remove the gauge and check the reading. The gauge should only hiss briefly while pushing it onto the valve stem. If it hisses more, then you aren't pushing on it hard enough, and are not getting an accurate reading.

==Spare tire==
Proper inflation of the spare tire is also very important. All tires will lose some pressure over time, but since the spare tire is usually hidden from view, many people overlook it. If you don't check it regularly, your spare tire could go flat, and cause further problems when you have a tire failure.

The spare tire is often different than the regular tires. If the vehicle has a full-size spare, it's usually the same as the tires that were originally installed on the vehicle, which may differ from the tires currently installed. If it's a mini spare, the difference is obvious. So, make sure to check the pressure ratings on the sidewall of the tire to find the proper tire pressure.

If you don't already know how to access your spare tire, you should check your car's manual. There are too many different configurations to explain it in this book.

Fifty years ago phalangeal fractures were treated according to &quot;hearsay&quot; or what ''recommendations'' were available in text books.  There were few clinical studies to be found and conclusions from the first of these studies being retrospective with a heterogeneous collection of injuries had little power to illuminate an optimal course of treatment. The early studies by Moberg and Stener and by Watson-Jones concerned avulsion fractures to the interphalangeal joints and Mallet fractures respectively. Then as now we can sort these injuries pretty readily between good actors and bad actors. Experience in exam and interpretation of x-rays is required to distinguish the good actor from the bad. This distinction made early allows for appropriately minimalistic treatment (early motion) for the good actors and for the bad actors, surgical treatment that then allows for early motion or selective immobilization targeted to a specific structure e.g. central slip in an acute boutonierre. There is little sense in considering fractures and sprains separately as either can be a good or bad actor. (Lee 43-B (1), 1963). 

Torn between assuming the best and fearing the worst, early treatment in inexperienced hands tends to lead to the muddled middle course of immobilization, then referral at or about 4 weeks when things seem to be going badly.  Unfortunately at this point the problems related to immobilization and edema now maturing into fibrosis considerably compound the problem of management.

History helps in that the mechanism and events in the immediate aftermath of the injury are often telling. Patients tend to recall quite vividly the appauling sight of one of their fingers pointing hideously askew. The severe nature of the injury may not be quite so immediately apparent if the hand is first seen only after the intial reflexive effort to straighten the finger actually accomplishes substantial improvement. Eliciting the history as to the initial distorted appearance is helpful.

Inspection alone cannot reliably distiguish the good actor from the bad and an early quality xray with the beam properly centered on the injured area is critical to proper decision making. Noting the extent and location of swelling and of course any associated lacerations is essential. 

Regarding the issue of closed vs open fractures there remains some common misconception. Subungual hematoma  without displacement of the nail plate appears ot have no increased risk of infection. Sterile decompression for subungual hematoma for pain relief or for hematoma greater than 50% of the length of the nail bed is recommended. If the nail plate is dislodged from the eponychial fold even partially there is likely a nail bed laceration warranting repair, and the presence of a fracture of the underlying distal phalanx adds the risk of infection which warrants direct irrigation of the bone. In the absence of gross contamination, treatment within 24 hours for such an injury with provisional irrigation by the urgent care physician appears to be both satisfactory and practically managable in most practice settings. 

A laceration overlying a joint where the mechanism does not suggest a penetrating trauma is usually an indication that the underlying fracture or the bone in the case of a dislocation, has penetrated the skin e.g.  the open dorsal dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint. In this case the proper irrigation of the joint within 6 hours is the recommended treatment.  Suitable exposure of the joint by the urgent care physician usually cannot be reliably accomplished as surgical extension of the wound may be required or retraction fo the flexor tendons and volar plate may be necessary to irrigate the joint.

      <comment>/* Underfloor insulation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Foundations==

The first rule of building with straw is to keep it dry (&quot;good hat and goot boots&quot;). This includes the foundations. Moisture will eventually find its way into even the best wall so foundations must allow any moisture to drain away. An impermeable foundation will trap moisture near the straw and cause it to degrade quickly. Care should also be taken positioning membranes for the same reason.

One possible solution is building a stone, lime mortar and rubble infill foundation. Build it up above ground level to protect against rising damp and rain splash. Other alternatives include rubble piers, rammed earth depending on the site and the desired aesthetic.

Concrete [[w:footing|footing]]/[[w:Foundation (architecture)|foundations]] or thickened-edge-slab-on-grade foundations are another option. A building with concrete foundations is generally much easier to attain building approval for. While the most common solution, the cement used in concrete does require large amounts of energy for cement production.  Concrete foundations contribute up to 70% of the ecological footprint of a straw bale house.

== Toe up ==
To further prevent water damage, on top of the foundations one will generally find a toe up, a basis for the straw bale wall. It is made out of two parallel 5x10 (2x2&quot;) or 10x10cm (4x4&quot;) beams. These are spaced evenly about the width of one bale apart, the space between them filled with somewhat water resistant insulation like perlite, sheep wool, crushed shells or alternatives less friendly to the environment.

Pier foundations with joists raised well above ground level are a relatively common option in Australia and Germany. Even if the piers are poured or pre-fab concrete a vast savings on concrete is made. This technique also has the added bonus of allowing the use of straw bales as underfloor insulation as they are raised well above grade.

Bales can also be stacked over stem walls with joisted floors.

With load-bearing straw-bale homes [[w:Rubble trench foundation|rubble trench foundations]] or [[w:Earthbag construction|Earthbag construction]] foundations are increasingly used, as an alternative to conventional footings. Some pioneer designers are even using rock-filled gabions or earth-filled &quot;bastions&quot; in lieu of concrete.


== Underfloor insulation ==

The use of straw as underfloor insulation is usually discouraged because straw will rot and grow mold if it gets damp (&gt;18% moisture content). Avoiding moisture is especially important in kitchens and bathrooms where flooding is possible due to plumbing leaks/broken washing machines/over flowing bath tubs etc. One experimental building in Belgium tried to remedy this with a clever foundation floor structure. From bottom to top: big stones, sand, strong plastic tarp, sand, recycled building bricks (spaced so air can flow between them), straw blocks, and rammed earth for the floor.

A bed of shells has been used with much success in Denmark as a combined rubble bed and insulation. At a thickness of between 119.4 and 124.9mm conductivity is between 0.120 and 0.112 W/mK. Compared to industrial products (such as expanded ceramic or spun glass or rock) shells therefore provide good insulation as a nearly carbon neutral industrial waste product.

== Heating ==

While thinking about the design of your foundations, or more specifically the foundation pad, this is the time to think about heating options. One of the options gaining popularity is in-floor radiant heating. You can read more about this in the section on building services under heating and cooling.

== US specific ==
Foundations can still be a major cost as most building codes still require a footing of at least 12 inches or to the frost line, whichever is deeper.  They then require that a pad be poured that is at least the width of the bales being used(possibly three inches less if you are going to use rigid insulation on the outside of the foundation) for at least 8 inches above final grade.  This is the least restrictive code that has been written to date.  If you are not being bound by code (rural area) you might be able to get away with using something much less energy intensive than concrete.  

*Note: Definitely check with the local code compliance or county property appraiser to get their input.  Give them a bit of the information here and other places to warm them to the idea.  If you are going to be bound by code you need to know that and follow it.  Or alternatively, sell that piece of land and move elsewhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Walls==

===Straw Bale Infill===
The original &quot;Nebraska&quot; straw-bale building technique was one in which walls of straw-bales actually provided the support for the roof-structure above, so these are now referred to as load-bearing, and straw-bale homes of this style continue to be built and permitted.

An alternative method of construction uses a [[w:post and beam|post and beam]] framing system to carry roof, wind and seismic loads. Once that structure is in place, the walls are then infilled with straw bales for insulation. This type of structure is popular because it allows bale placement to be accomplished with the roof already in place, &quot;in the dry&quot;, and can easily be demonstrated to conform to [[w:building code|building code]]s, using conventional engineering techniques or a pre-engineered pole-structure design. 

Some projects best lend themselves to a combination of both techniques, with load-bearing perimeter walls and pole or stick-frame support at the interior or ridge; this is termed a &quot;hybrid&quot; structural system.

The building code in the State of New Mexico (1994 ed.) required that all straw-bale homes there be built with rigid structural frames, while other state or regional building codes lack this restriction (see codes for California, Pima County Arizona, etc.)  In other jurisdictions without specific &quot;straw-bale codes&quot;, strawbale construction is often approved under the building code provisions for alternate methods and materials.  Plans are commonly required to be stamped by a licenced structural engineer. 

Field bales are often laid in stretcher [[w:bond (masonry)|bond]] like bricks. They are easily retied to make half or custom sized bales. They may also be easily &quot;pinned&quot; internally or on both surfaces (with bamboo, reed, rebar or wood).

Bale stacking is often done in community &quot;bale raisings&quot;, where family and friends pitch in together to raise the walls in a weekend or two. Novice owner/builders and their friends can continue the work through lathing and plastering of the bales, giving the house their own special imprint, and achieving savings in construction costs, as well.

===Load Bearing Walls===

As in the original Nebraska straw bale homes, bales are so compact that they can succesfully be used as the structure of the building itself. Strictly speaking it is the outer surface of the bales which provides most of the structure. This matrix of straw fibres on the surface of bales is locked together by the stucco of whatever plaster is being used. Much like the reinforcing bars set into concrete, but over the whole surface and pointing in all directions.

Wooden stakes are pounded vertically into the straw bales. They connect the layers of bales, adding stability to the wall. Popular choices are hazel and bamboo. Sometimes, metal rebar stakes are also used. Metal rebar should be avoided because temperature differences between the metal and the bales cause condensation inside the bales.

Vertical compression of the bales into one surface is just as important for stability. The most popular way to do this is to run plastic straps vertically around the bales, compressing them between the top plate and the bottom plate. This compression not only strengthens the structure. It also helps the load bearing wall settle much more quickly, enabling a quicker installation of windows for example.

The last and least effective option to reinforce (citation needed) is to &quot;cage&quot; the bales on one or both faces with pre-welded or woven mesh, to increase pre-stuccoed wall stability. Do avoid using metal mesh, as it can crack the surface render. This is both because of rust and temperature differences between the organic materials and the metal. These temperature differences also causes condensation inside the bales.

The finish you use also has a great effect on the structural integrity of the finished wall. See the section on [[Straw Bale Construction/Techniques/Finishes|finishes]].

===Curved Walls===
[[Image:Sb-wall-tight-curve.jpg|frame|An example of a tightly curved wall with flat bales (project: John Swearingen)]]
&quot;Curved walls are fun, pleasing to the eye, and create glorious light patterns. But they are deceptively time consuming!  I can build three flat walls for the price of one curved wall. And it has all to do with the foundation, curbs, window bucks, window flashing, roof details.&quot;
(Straw Bale contractor Frank Tettemer of Living Sol)

As the above quote points to, time, and details, are an important consideration when deciding if your building will have any curved walls. How will you put the gutter on, what about the roof structure, the foundation? Some people also find any aesthetic advantages outweighed by the problems of using the rounded shapes on the inside. So, what needs to be considered?

For gentle curves the bales can be laid against a wall and kicked, as you would if you were breaking a small branch. This can be done with bales laid flat or on edge. Of course it's best if the bales on all walls are lying the same way, but it's not a strict necessity. For larger walls flat bales would be more prudent, especially if the wall is bearing some weight.

Bales placed on edge (largest face outwards) can be shaped well before placing into the wall, and hold their shape well. (The insulation value is almost the same as for bales laid flat.) If the curve is very tight the exposed strings could be a problem. Any such problems are solved if you use some form of surface mesh on both sides of the wall (plastic or metal) which you tie to each other through the wall. 

The round bale layout results in pie-shaped gaps between the bales. These are best filled with a mixture of clay and straw, the clay serving to hold the straw together. Mesh on the outside of the wall will add additional restraint to the tendency of the bales to &quot;explode&quot; outwards. (for discussion see John Swearingen).

An additional way to increase the strength of a curved wall is to add large horizontal straps to each row of bales on the outer face, fixing these to something stable. Curved walls are, by their geometry, inherently less prone to overturning than straight walls.

The composite of mesh (tension) and plaster (compression), along with the geometry of the wall, can result in a very stable and strong building, if the continuity of the bale wall isn't broken by large openings.

===Structural Capabilities of Bale Walls===

The bale assembly can do a number of things, depending upon the structural design of the building:

* Hold itself up,  be self-supporting and resist tipping.
* Keep out the wind;  inhibiting air/moisture infiltration.
* Resist heat transfer (insulation)  
* Reduce water intrusion and migration, store and transfer moisture within the wall.
* Keep the assembly from buckling, under a compressive load.
* Keep the assembly from deflecting in a strong wind, when pushed from the sides or end.
* Keep the assembly from bursting apart in an earthquake, when pushed and pulled from all directions.
* Hold the plaster at least while it’s curing.
* Keep the plaster from cracking after it’s cured, from shrinkage or movement.
* Support the plaster skins from buckling.
* Transfer and absorb loads to and from the plaster.
* Support the roof load (compression). 
* Reduce damage or failure from high winds (ductility). 
* Reduce damage or failure from earthquakes (ductility). 
* Stop bullets and/or flying debris.

      <comment>/* Cement/ sand stucco */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Finishes==

Straw-bale walls are most typically plastered on the outside with lime, clay, or a cement and lime mix. Inside surfaces are typically lime, clay, plaster board (gypsum) or Structolite, a US Gypsum product that is formulated for thick applications ([[Straw_Bale_Construction/Bibliography|Wanek, Catherine]]). [[w:Structural analysis|Structural analysis]] has shown that the straw-bale/stucco assembly behaves much like a [[w:sandwich panel|sandwich panel]], with the rigid stucco skins initially bearing most of the load and adding considerable strength to the wall. 

An important consideration when choosing a finish is that the outside surface of the walls ''must be more'' permeable to moisture than the inside surface. Failing to follow this rule will result in moisture accumulating in the wall, which will eventually rot the bales, just as it would rot anything untreated. As two extreme examples, if you chose to finish the inside surface with cement plaster and seal it with acrylic or latex paint, then any moisture in the wall can effectively only move outwards (assuming that's not also painted). If you did the opposite and used natural finishes on the inside but painted the outside with plastic paint then you are trapping moisture into the walls and rotting is likely.

===Cement/ sand stucco===
Stucco for straw-bale walls can be cement/sand-based, although mixes containing earth or clay and/or with a high percentage of lime, replacing part or all of the cement  are increasingly popular trends.  (Advocates of sustainable construction are becoming increasingly concerned with the fact that for every ton of cement manufactured and used, another ton of climate-changing fossil CO2 is released into the atmosphere.) Avoid cement stucco on bale structures. Cement is not breathable. Humidity - the arch enemy of any straw bale construction- will accumulate inside bales covered in cement stucco.

===Clay plaster===

Clay plaster allow higher water vapour permeability through the walls than lime plaster, which in turn is much more than cement plasters. This means the right type of wall will dry quickly when wetted by rain and will effectively transfer any moisture which accumulates in the wall, whether from a leak or from normal day-to-day living (a significant amount).

Clay plasters are great regulators of the indoor climate, they 'breath', which means moisture is absorbed and released - it does not mean that air trickles through the wall. On the inside of a house this property makes it well suited to damp areas like kitchens and bathrooms, it will absorb periodic moisture and to some extent odour, and slowly release it again. Because clay plaster typically is quite thick it also serves to regulate temperature by warming and cooling quite slowly. On the outside of the house this effect can even mean that the clay will wick (pull) moisture out of the straw and release it to the exterior air ([[Straw_Bale_Construction/Bibliography|Wanek, Catherine]])

*[http://www.artesano-home.com/ Information about earth plaster systems for straw bale]
===Lime plaster===
(This section needs improvement)
Performs in a similar way to clay plaster.

Lime plasters consist of Lime, aggregate and other additives.  Lime plasters are more resistant to weather, mold and impact than clay plasters, but are more time consuming and challenging to finish. A good compromise between breathability and water resistance, they are an ideal outside finish for a house, while clay plasters are more appropriate for the inside.

===Tadelakt===
This bright, waterproof lime plaster can be used on the inside of buildings and on the outside. It is the traditional coating of the palaces, hammams and bathrooms of the riads in Morocco. It is characteristically polished with a river stone and treated with a soft soap to acquire its final appearance. Tadelakt has a soft appearance with undulations due to the work of the stone; it is water-tight, which also makes it suitable for making bathtubs and washbasins and confers great decorative capacities. Tadelakt is generally produced with lime of the area of Marrakesh, but other types of lime can also be appropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Roofing==

Building with straw bales does not dictate that you use a certain type of roofing system. Depending on your view, straw bale designs might ''suggest'' that certain roof types are more appropriate. If your reason for choosing to build with straw bales includes an element of environmental concern then some options quickly become more attractive than others. In this context the main concern (after you're sure that the roof will keep you dry) is the embodied energy of the roofing system and the potential for reuse of the materials at a later stage. For example the production of new roofing tiles uses very large amounts of energy, which contributes to our burden on the environment. Clay/ terracotta tiles require large amounts of energy to bake and concrete tiles must take the burden of the energy used in the extraction and heating of lime to make cement. On the other hand some types of roofing tiles can easily be removed and used again and again for several hundred years.

In many cases and depending on where you live, collecting rain water or minimising roof runoff can be important. If you are not collecting your roof water then a '''green''' or '''living''' roof can be an option. Who wouldn't like a  roof garden?

Another direction for roofs in straw bale buildings is to make arches and vaults of straw bales so that they all press on each other giving a stable compressive structure just like the stone arches of ancient roman times. There is more about arches in the section on [[../Pushing_the_Limit]].

The most typical solution is a conventional roof structure attached to a load-distributing plate or beam running all the way along the top of the bale walls.

===The ''Green'' Roof===
[[Image:Green Roof at Vendée Historial, les Lucs.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A green roof with native planting]]
(Please help write this section)

One advantage of green roofs is the stability they add to the temperature of the roof. Because of their size and mass they are slow to warm up and cool down. In places where there is a large temperature change from day to night this can be a great advantage.

The actual insulation value of a green roof (and here we're talking about not more than 30cm thick) is unclear. The presence or absence of water and roots makes such a large difference that it is hard to generalise. Naturally if the layer of soil is thick enough it will provide more insulation and a considerable amount of stability to the temperature.

===Roof and Ceiling Insulation===

One of the easiest and most effective places to add extra insulation is in the space between your ceiling and the roof. So don't overlook this important part of the overall design.

Conventional roof structures may be insulated with straw bales, taking advantage of their high insulation values and good acoustic properties. Other alternative insulation includes rice-hulls, cotton or wool batts, soy-based foam and recycled cellulose. According to comments on an unrecorded test by Tim Owen-Kennedy of Vital Systems [http://vitalsystems.net] rice hulls perform just as flame retardant as borate treated cellulose or better, without being treated. According to ''The Rice Hull House'' ([[../../Bibliography|Paul A. Olivier]]) from around 2004;

:...rice hulls are unique within nature. They contain approximately 20% opaline silica in combination with a large amount of the phenyl propanoid structural polymer called lignin. This abundant agricultural waste has all of the properties one could ever expect of some of the best insulating materials. Recent ASTM testing conducted R&amp;D Services of Cookville, Tennessee, reveals that rice hulls do not flame or smolder very easily, they are highly resistant to moisture penetration and fungal decomposition, they do not transfer heat very well, they do not smell or emit gases, and they are not corrosive with respect to aluminum, copper or steel.

(The following quote from a reference in the same article needs to be followed up)
:&quot;Rice hull has a thermal conductivity of about 0.0359 W/(m.°C); the values compare well with the thermal conductivity of excellent insulating materials (Houston, 1972).” Juliano (1985), p, 696. The thermal conductivity of rice hull ash is reported to be 0.062 W.m-1.K-1. See UNIDO, p. 21. A more recent test done by R&amp;D services of Cookville, Tennessee, indicates a 3.024 R-per-inch.&quot;

Many of these natural products have a very low impact on the environment and perform excellently, sometimes better than synthetic insulation like rock wool or fibre glass insulation.

If straw bales are used in the roof, their weight needs to be considered. Moisture is another consideration, and there is a fire risk if any loose straw is left exposed. Weight considerations are overcome by the fact that web-beams built to the height of the bales can easily bear their weight. To avoid moisture problems, it is important that the bales be treated just as walls are. They need to have good ventilation on the outer surface (a ventilation space) and should be coated with some plaster (typically clay or lime plaster) that can absorb, redistribute and release to the air any moisture. It cannot be overemphasised that no straw should be left exposed, plastering should  be done in such a way that it acts as a suitable fire retardant.

===Arches and vaults===

==== Designing the catenary arch ====
A [[w:catenary|catenary]] shape helps you build the sturdiest vault construction. 

===== The gravity approach =====
You will need:
* a heavy rope at least as long as the circumference of your arch (thin metal wire rope would be ideal)
* an even, rectangular wall at least as high and wide as the arch you want to build. Hint: you can make one out of plywood, pallets or anything you want.
* screws and a screwdriver (or nails and a hammer)
* a wide roll of paper
* a spirit level
* spray paint
* tape
* scaffolding

Instructions:
# If you haven't got the required wall, build one from lightweight materials. Just make sure it's perfectly vertical and level.
# Tape the paper to the wall. Hints: Vertical is easier. Have them overlap a few centimeters. Number the segments.
# Mark a level line on the paper a bit higher than the arch you want to build. Double check the line is level.
# Mark a second line on the paper exactly as far down as the height of the arch you want to build.   
# Mark two points on the top line as far apart as the width of the arch you want to build.
# Fix the rope to one nail, as close to the paper as possible. Lower it from the other nail until it reaches the base line.
# Spray paint the rope. Hint: You may also want to quickly spray paint the overlap between paper rolls.

===== The mathematical approach =====
You will need: a computer, a pencil, some exact measuring skills, a roll of paper, a long measuring device, adhesive tape, a flat surface the size of your arc.

Instructions:
# Calculate the coordinates of your catenary. You can either use a catenary designer like https://github.com/ddjokic/pyCatenary-NoElast/blob/master/pycatenary.py or http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~smann/catenary/ , or use the cosh(x) function yourself.
# Tape the paper together to form a big paper surface that could cover the entire catenary's surface.
# Start out by setting out the triangle defined by the top and the two base points of the catenary.
# Precisely mark the coordinates of one point every 50 cm approximately. Keep in mind that the precision of this drawing is key to the stability of your vault, so take your time.

{{BookCat}}

==== Building the formwork ====

You will need:
* planks. They don't need to be thick, but they do need to be high. Recycled pallet planks are a perfect fit.
* a saw. A circular saw will work best, but a hand saw will do.
* nails and a hammer or (preferably) screws and an electric screwdriver
* your catenary arch design
* battens
* straw bales (if available)

Let's start building the arches:
# Put the paper arch design on a flat and dry surface (the floor?).
# Put the planks on the inside of the arch design. You will have to saw the planks a bit for this, especially at the top.
# Put a second layer of planks on top of the first one. Screw them to the first layer. The idea is to have them overlap with the first layer to get some basic rigidity.
# Mark every 25cm on the outside of the arch. This is where the horizontal battens will link the three arches.
# Reinforce the arch by screwing two planks in an X shape to the inside of the arch. These should also make carrying the final formwork easier.
# Build three arches by repeating the above steps three times. The arches should be almost identical in shape.
# Measure the length of your bales.
# Space your three arches with a distance of one bale's length between each arch.
# Hint: In some cases it might be easy to: lay the first arch on a flat and dry surface, put bales on top as spacers (keep the length side vertical), lay the second arch on top of that, lay another row of bales, lay the third arch.
# Triple check the arches are all 100% level and perfectly aligned.
# Screw the battens to the three arches, removing any spacer bales as you proceed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
In Canada there are two parallel legal regimes that apply to many areas of law. The most prevailent is the common law which is used in most provinces and territories to the exception of Quebec which is under the civil law system.

=== Meaning of property ===

Philosophically, &quot;property&quot; in law does not refer to a thing but to a relationship.  The subject of property enjoys a &quot;bundle of rights&quot; over an object of property.  The bundle of rights includes the right to use the object, the right to exclude others from using or enjoying the object, and the right to dispose of the object.  An object in this sense need not be a physical thing.  In the days of slavery, a slave was an object of property.  In modern times, many abstract concepts (such as patents or copyrights) can be objects of property.

That having been said, the terms &quot;property&quot; and &quot;object of property&quot; are often used interchangeably in practice.

== Common law ==
The common law practice of property is divided into two general types of property: Personal Property and Real Property

=== Real vs. Personal Property ===
There are two categories of property in common law: '''Real''' property and '''Personal''' property.  Real property is, essentially, the rights to land and the things that are attached to it.  Personal property is, essentially, rights to any other possession.

Real property was, in English history, much more important than personal property.  In the Middle Ages, when the economy relied almost exclusively on agriculture, land was the key to wealth.  Therefore, the legal rules around real property developed into a much more complex state than personal property.  Even though today, land is much less central to the economy, much Canadian real property law still obeys the complex English property rules of the Middle Ages.

Personal property, on the other hand, had relatively simple legal rules up until the 20th century, when personal property began to have a much greater value (things such as company shares, drug patents, and computer technology are all types of personal property).  Therefore, the rules of personal property have become much more complex in recent decades, although they will seem much more modern than real property rules.

== Civil law ==
Civil law property law derives mainly from the Civil Code of Quebec, and applies only to property in that province.  Its inspiration comes from French civil law, but it varies in several important ways, and has gradually incorporated several important common law concepts.

Similar to the &quot;real&quot; and &quot;personal&quot; division between types of property, civil law divides property into two types: Movable Property and Immovable Property.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Hard Drive ''(Talkin' 'Bout a Revolution)''==
The Hard Drive is the storage for your computer.  In robot stories, the robot stores things in its &quot;Memory Bank&quot; which would probably be a hard drive.  You can think of it as a filing cabinet, with files, programs, and other information.  Hard drives are measured by the amount of bytes they can hold. A byte is equivalent to one character.  If you need to store more data, there are external hard drives that plug into your computer, or are remotely accessible. For example, flash drives (sometimes referred to as thumb drives) plug into a computer’s USB port and can store data like pictures or music. This type of storage is small and portable, making it ideal for people who need to access the same information on different computers. Remote storage is another option for those who need to store data somewhere other than a hard drive. Cloud storage is a form of remote storage where users store information online using a website. Most cloud storage sources are password protected, which offers a level of security that doesn’t come with a flash drive.

Originally it was always written as FORTH, although in every modern reference I've always seen it written Forth (and, seeing as it isn't an acronym, that seems proper). Whichever is chosen, this book should use it consistently. On the first page alone both are used with no explaination. [[User:Cat Parade|Cat Parade]] 20:51, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

: Originally, all programming languages were spelled in all uppercase.
: Capitalizing only the first letter is more popular these days, so I recommend we use &quot;Forth&quot;.
: There is a discussion of FORTH vs. Forth at [[Wikipedia:Talk:Forth (programming language)]], which parallels another long controversy over FORTRAN vs. Fortran at [[Wikipedia:Talk:Fortran]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 04:54, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{French/Lessons/Introductory/Header|The alphabet|L'alphabet}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
French is based on the Latin alphabet (also called the Roman alphabet), and there are twenty-six (26) letters. Originally there were twenty-five (25) letters, with 'W' being added by the mid-nineteenth century. Unlike the English, who call it a &quot;double-u,&quot; the French use &quot;double-v&quot; and pronounce it (doo-bluh-vay) after the 'V' which is pronounced (vay). During the period from Old French to Modern French, the letter 'K' was added. These two letters are used mostly with adopted foreign words. The French alphabet used today is less than 200 years old.

The twenty-six letters are parted into :
* 20 Consonants (''Consonnes''): B C D F G H J K L M N P Q R S T V W X Z
* 6 Vowels (''Voyelles''): A E I O U Y

In addition, French uses several accents: grave accents (''à'', ''è'', and ''ù'') and acute accents (''é''). A circumflex applies to all vowels, except Y (considered as a vowel): ''â'', ''ê'', ''î'', ''ô'', ''û''. A tréma (French for ''dieresis'') is also applied: ''ë'', ''ï'', ''ü'', ''ÿ''. Two combined letters (called orthographic ligatures) are used: ''æ'' and ''œ''. Finally, a cedilla is used on the ''c'' to make it sound like an English ''s'': ''ç''.

== {{French/Section|Orthography|Notes|supplementary-id=french-notes}} ==
&lt;div id='french-notes'&gt;
=== Final consonants ===
In French, certain consonants are silent when they are the final letter of a word. The letters ''p'' (as in ''coup'' {{French/IPA|/ku/|approx=koo|audio=Fr-coup.ogg}}), ''s'' (as in ''héros'' {{French/IPA|/e.ʁɔ/|approx=ay-roh|audio=Fr-héros.ogg}}), ''t'' (as in ''chat'' {{French/IPA|/ʃa/|approx=shah|audio=Fr-chat.ogg}}), ''d'' (as in ''marchand'' {{French/IPA|/maʁ.ʃɑ̃/|approx=mahr-shah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;|audio=Fr-marchand.ogg}}), and ''x'' (as in ''paresseux'' {{French/IPA|/pa.ʁɛ.sø/|approx=pah-reh-sew|audio=Fr-paresseux.ogg}}), are generally not pronounced at the end of a word. They are pronounced if there is an ''e'' letter after it (''coupe'' {{French/IPA|/kup/|approx=koop|audio=Fr-coupe.ogg}}, ''chatte'' {{French/IPA|/ʃat/|approx=shaht|audio=Fr-chatte.ogg}}, ''marchande'' {{French/IPA|/maʁ.ʃɑ̃d/|approx=mahr-shah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;d}}).

=== Dental consonants ===
The letters ''d'', ''l'', ''n'',''s'', ''t'', and  ''z'' are pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the lower teeth and the middle of the tongue against the roof of the mouth. In English, one would pronounce these letters with the tip of the tongue at the roof of one's mouth. It is very difficult to pronounce a word like ''voudrais'' {{French/IPA|/vud.ʁɛ/}} properly with the ''d'' formed in the English manner.

=== ''b'' and ''p'' ===
Unlike English, when you pronounce the letters ''b'' and ''p'' in French, little to no air should come out of your mouth. In terms of phonetics, the difference in the French ''b'' and ''p'' and their English counterparts is one of aspiration. Fortunately, in English both aspirated and unaspirated variants (allophones) exist, but only in specific environments. If you're a native speaker, say the word ''pit'' and then the word ''spit'' out loud. Did you notice the extra puff of air in the first word that doesn't come with the second? The ''p'' in 'pit' is aspirated ({{French/IPA|[pʰ]}}); the ''p'' in 'spit' is not (like the ''p'' in ''any'' position in French). 

=== ''q'' ===
The letter 'q' is always followed by a 'u'. There are only two cases where there is an exception, and that is 'cinq' (five) and 'coq' (rooster).

=== ''r'' ===
A final 'r' after 'e' is generally mute, but it is pronounced on words of one syllable 'fer', 'mer' and 'hier'.

=== Aspirated and non-aspirated ''h'' ===
In French, the letter ''h'' can be aspirated (''h aspiré''), or not aspirated (''h non aspiré''), depending on which language the word was borrowed from. The ''h'' is never pronounced, whether it is aspirated or not aspirated.

For example, the word ''héros'' {{French/IPA|/e.ʁɔ/|audio=Fr-héros.ogg}} has an aspirated ''h''. When a ''definite article'' (''le, la, l', les'') is placed before it, the result is ''le héros'', and both words must be pronounced separately. However, the feminine form of ''héros'', ''héroïne'' {{French/IPA|/eʁɔin/|audio=Fr-héroïne.ogg}} is a non-aspirated ''h''. Therefore, when you put a ''definite article'' in front of it, it becomes ''l'héroïne'', and is pronounced as one word.

The only way to tell if the ''h'' at the beginning of a word is aspirated is to look it up in the dictionary. Some dictionaries will place an asterisk (''*'') in front of the entry word in the French-English ''H'' section if the ''h'' is aspirated. Other dictionaries will include it in the pronunciation guide after the key word by placing an apostrophe (&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;) before the pronunciation. In short, the words must be memorized. 

Here is a table of some basic ''h'' words that are aspirated and not aspirated:

{| {{French/Table|audio=French/Orthography/Examples with aspirated and non-aspirated h.ogg|columns=2}}
! aspirated || non-aspirated
|-
| '''héros''', hero {{fr/sec|(le héros)}}
| '''héroïne''', heroine {{fr/sec|(l'héroïne)}}
|-
| '''haïr''', to hate {{fr/sec|(je hais)}}
| '''habiter''', to live {{fr/sec|(j'habite)}}
|-
| '''huit''', eight {{fr/sec|(le huit novembre)}}
| '''harmonie''', harmony {{fr/sec|(l'harmonie)}}
|}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-notes --&gt;

The punctuation symbols in French operates very similarly to English with the same meaning.  The only punctuation symbol not present in French would be the quotation marks; these are replaced by the ''guillemets'' shown in the table above.  For speech in fiction, no quotation marks are used.  The two stroke punctuation marks (such as '';'', '':'', ''?'', ''!'')  may require a non-breaking space before or after the mark in question.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-punctuation --&gt;

== {{French/Section|Orthography|Diacritics|supplementary-id=french-diacritics}} ==
&lt;div id='french-diacritics'&gt;
Five different kinds of accent marks are used in written French. In many cases, an accent changes the sound of the letter to which it is added. In others, the accent has no effect on pronunciation. Accents in French never indicate stress (which always falls on the last syllable). Accentuated letters are usually never followed by a double consonant (except ''ch'''âss'''is'' for instance); moreover on ''e'' accent becomes useless because a following double consonant changes its pronunciation (e.g.: ''j'''e'''ter'' ([ə],throw) but ''je j'''e'''tte'' (pronounced ''è'', I throw). The following table lists every French accent mark and the letters with which it can be combined: 

{| {{French/Table|audio=French/Orthography/Diacritics.ogg|columns=3}}
! Accent || Letters used || Examples
|-
! acute accent {{fr/sec|(accent aigu)}}
| ''é''
| '''é'''l'''é'''phant {{French/IPA|/e.le.fɑ̃/|audio=Fr-éléphant.ogg}}
|-
! grave accent {{fr/sec|(accent grave)}}
| ''è'', ''à'', ''ù''
| fi'''è'''vre {{French/IPA|/fjɛvʁ/|audio=Fr-fièvre.ogg}}, l'''à''' {{French/IPA|/la/|audio=Fr-là.ogg}}, o'''ù''' {{French/IPA|/u/|audio=Fr-où.ogg}}
|-
! circumflex {{fr/sec|(accent circonflexe)}}
| ''â'', ''ê'', ''î'', ''ô'', ''û''
| g'''â'''teau {{French/IPA|/ɡa.tɔ/|audio=Fr-gâteau.ogg}}, '''ê'''tre {{French/IPA|/ɛtʁ/|audio=Fr-être-fr-ouest.ogg}}, '''î'''le {{French/IPA|/il/|audio=Fr-île.ogg}}, ch'''ô'''mage {{French/IPA|/ʃɔ.maʒ/}}, d'''û''' {{French/IPA|/dy/}}
|-
! diaeresis {{fr/sec|(tréma)}}
| ''ë'', ''ï'', ''ü'', ''ÿ''
| No'''ë'''l {{French/IPA|/nɔ.ɛl/}}, ma'''ï'''s {{French/IPA|/ma.is/|audio=Fr-maïs.ogg}}, aig'''ü'''e {{French/IPA|/e.ɡy/}}
|-
! cedilla {{fr/sec|(cédille)}}
| ''ç''
| fran'''ç'''ais {{French/IPA|/fʁɑ̃.sɛ/|audio=Fr-le français-fr-ouest.ogg}}
|}

Note that the letter ''ÿ'' is only used in very rare words, mostly old town names like ''L'Haÿ-Les-Roses'', a Paris surburb or ''Aÿ'' in Champagne region. This letter is pronounced like ''ï''.

Note also that as of the spelling reform of 1990, the diaresis indicating ''gu'' is not a digraph on words finishing in ''guë'' and is now placed on the ''u'' in standard (''académie française'') French: ''aigüe'' and not ''aiguë''; ''cigüe'' and not ''ciguë''; ''ambigüe'' and not ''ambiguë''. Since this reform is relatively recent and mostly unknown to laypeople, the two spellings can be used interchangeably.

=== {{French/Section||Acute accent|Accent aigu}} ===

The acute accent is the most common accent used in written French. It is only used with the letter ''e'' and is always pronounced {{French/IPA|/e/|approx=ay}}. 

One use of the ''accent aigu'' is to form the past participle of regular ''-er'' verbs. 

{| {{French/Table|audio=French/Grammar/Accute accent.ogg|columns=2}}
! Infinitive || Past participle
|-
| aimer {{fr/sec|(''to love'')}}
| aim'''é''' {{fr/sec|(''loved'')}}
|-
| regarder {{fr/sec|(''to watch'')}}
| regard'''é''' {{fr/sec|(''watched'')}}
|}

=== {{French/Section||Grave accent|Accent grave}} ===

==== ''à'' and ''ù'' ====

In the case of the letters ''à'' and ''ù'', the grave accent is used to graphically distinguish one word from another. 

{| {{French/Table|audio=French/Orthography/à and ù.ogg|columns=2}}
! Without ''accent grave'' || With ''accent grave'' 
|-
| '''a''' {{fr/sec|(3rd pers. sing of '''avoir''', ''to have'')}}
| '''à''' {{fr/sec|(preposition, ''to, at,'' etc.)}}
|-
| '''la''' {{fr/sec|(definite article for feminine nouns)}}
| '''là''' {{fr/sec|(''there'')}}
|-
| '''ou''' {{fr/sec|(conjunction, ''or'')}}
| '''où''' {{fr/sec|(''where'')}}
|}

==== ''è'' ====

Unlike ''à'' and ''ù'', ''è'' is not used to distinguish words from one another. The ''è'' is used for pronunciation. In careful speech, an unaccented ''e'' is pronounced like an a on the end of a word in English /ə/, as in &quot;Angel&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;&quot;, and in rapid speech is sometimes not pronounced at all. The ''è'' is pronounced like the letter ''e'' in ''pet''.

=== {{French/Section||Circumflex accent|Accent circonflexe}} ===

This accent is often called a 'hat' in language and mathematics, and usually indicates the disappearance of the old-French ''s'' after the vowel wearing it (the hat) but this ''s'' can still be found in a noun or a verb of the same lexical family. Examples are: ''hospital --&gt; hôpital'' but ''hospitalité'', ''maistre --&gt; maître'', ''gâteau'' from old french ''gastel'', ''ê'' is pronounced like ''è'': ''Fenestre --&gt; fenêtre'' but ''défenestrer'', ''forest --&gt; forêt'' but ''forestier''.

Circumflex accent may be used to have ''closed-o'' (la Drôme (French department), un dôme... ''ô'' is pronounced [o] like in chât'''eau''', without this accent it would be said like the english word ''hot'' ; whereas this pronunciation is not really applied in the south of France.)

In past participle of ''devoir'' (must), ''dû'' a circumflex accent is written to distinguish it with the article ''du''.

According to the spelling reform of 1990 some of circumflex accent are not compulsory any more (''maître --&gt; maitre'', ''boîte --&gt; boite''...)

=== {{French/Section||Cedilla|Cédille}}=== 

The cedilla is used only with the letter ''c'', and is said to make the ''c'' ''soft'', making it equivalent to the English and French ''s''.

: ''gar'''ç'''on'' {{French/IPA|IPA=/ɡaʁsɔ̃/|audio=Fr-garçon.ogg}}

I am a developer using the Microsoft .NET Framework preparing for the Microsoft certification.  The way I figure it, there can be no better way to learn new material than to write about it.  I have to research it, study it and ''know'' it before I can sit down and churn out something that someone else can understand -- or at least that is my hope.

I am also an Aircraft Maintenance Technician for Delta Air Lines.  But that's just my day job.

*I believe that open source books have the potential to be fantastic learning tools - imagine if everyone who really ''knew'' about a topic wrote the encyclopedia article for it.
*I love to snowboard.  I'm not very good at it, but I love it anyway.

No!  Some vehicles require different front and rear pressures.  The correct advice is: Check on the panel inside the drivers door where the pressure of the tires will be indicated.  Sometimes the pressure on front and back tires will be different!</text>

      <comment>/* Step 1: Setting up your environment */ update</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is intended to be a short, simple tutorial on writing a Java application that uses the Spring framework. Please note, this tutorial is intended for those with a moderate amount of background with [[Java]], and a basic working knowledge of [[XML]].

For this tutorial, we will be making an application that reads short stories from a Spring bean configuration file. (For the sake of this example, these short stories are ''real short'' stories.) There will be three Java classes, and one Spring config file. So let's begin...

==Step 1: Setting up your environment==
Before we can directly make the files, we first need to setup Spring. I'm assuming you already have the latest version of Java installed. If not, you can download Java Development Kit [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp here]. To download Spring, go to http://www.springsource.com/download/community and click on &quot;spring-framework-3.2.2.RELEASE-dist.zip (sha1)&quot;. Download it and unzip it.

Next we want to add '''spring.jar''' and '''commons-logging.jar''' to our classpath. Their locations are '''spring-framework-1.2.7\dist\spring.jar''' and '''spring-framework-1.2.7\lib\jakarta-commons\commons-logging.jar'''.  Since this varies from platform to platform, I'm not going to cover how to add libraries to your build path. However, if you use an [[IDE]] such as [[Eclipse]], then it shouldn't be too difficult. We will need spring.jar for the classes it uses to read the configuration file, and the classes in spring.jar depend on the logging utilities in commons-logging.jar for recording any errors.

From here on out, you can just copy and paste the text into the files for Steps 2, 3, and 4; skip the explanations; and run the program yourself. The explanations are only there to provide you with a background of the way Spring puts it all together. Ok, now on to the meat and potatoes, story_configuration.xml.

=='''Step 2''': Creating a Spring beans configuration file==
Create a new XML file in the directory where you are planning to put your java files. Call it story_configuration.xml. Then copy and paste the text below into the file and save it:

===story_configuration.xml===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC &quot;-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN&quot; 
      &quot;http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;beans&gt;
   &lt;bean id=&quot;StoryList&quot; class=&quot;StoryList&quot;&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;stories&quot;&gt;
         &lt;list&gt;
           &lt;ref bean=&quot;HelloWorld&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;ref bean=&quot;OnceUpon&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/list&gt;
       &lt;/property&gt;
   &lt;/bean&gt;

   &lt;bean id=&quot;HelloWorld&quot; class=&quot;Story&quot;&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;Hello World!&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/property&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;author&quot;&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;User:Hyad&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/property&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;This is a simple story.
This is a story about a man who said, &quot;Hello, World.&quot;
See, now wasn't that simple.&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/property&gt;
   &lt;/bean&gt;
	
   &lt;bean id=&quot;OnceUpon&quot; class=&quot;Story&quot;&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;Once Upon a Time&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/property&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;author&quot;&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;Rob Yates&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/property&gt;
      &lt;property name=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;Once upon a time there were some interesting things going on.
The end.&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/property&gt;
   &lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;/beans&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Explanation===
The first two lines are just standard XML declarations. Technically we don't really need them, but we'll put them in anyway. Next, you'll see the &lt;beans&gt; tag, this is where all the Java beans go.

Below that you'll see &lt;bean class=&quot;StoryList&quot;&gt;. This will be a bean for our Java class, StoryList.java. This class is simply a placeholder for the List where we will be holding our stories. Note the attributes of the bean element: there must always be a class attribute to represent the Java Class the bean is using. The id attribute is optional; it is used by the XMLBeanFactory class, to tell it what bean to get with the getBean method: ex. getBean(&quot;My id attribute name here&quot;). If no id attribute is provided, like with &lt;bean class=&quot;StoryList&quot;&gt;, then the class name is used as if it were the id attribute. Think: &lt;bean id=&quot;StoryList&quot; class=&quot;StoryList&quot;&gt;. Also note a bean's id value must not have any spaces, ex. don't write id=&quot;Story List&quot;.

Next we have &lt;property name=&quot;stories&quot;&gt;. The property tag just specifies what property variable in the Java bean file we want to specify with a bean property. The &lt;list&gt; tag is used next to tell Spring that we're dealing with a List of things, not just one. Next we have &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref bean=&quot;HelloWorld&quot;/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, this tells Spring to return the &lt;bean id=&quot;HelloWorld&quot; class=&quot;Story&quot;&gt; bean inside this List. In a different example, you might simply need a list of values like Strings. For a grocery list you might have something like,
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;list&gt;
	&lt;value&gt;milk&lt;/value&gt;
	&lt;value&gt;eggs&lt;/value&gt;
	&lt;value&gt;bread&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Either way your property is mapped to a LIST

For our HelloWorld story, we have &lt;bean id=&quot;HelloWorld&quot; class=&quot;Story&quot;&gt;. Hopefully, nothing too surprising here. There are three properties of this bean, &lt;property name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;, &lt;property name=&quot;author&quot;&gt;, &lt;property name=&quot;content&quot;&gt;.  These are again mapping to property variables: title, author, content in the Story class. Within each value we have:
&lt;value&gt;Hello World!&lt;/value&gt;, &lt;value&gt;User:Hyad&lt;/value&gt;, &lt;value&gt;This is a simple story.

This is a story about a man who said, &quot;Hello, World.&quot;

See, now wasn't that simple.&lt;/value&gt; Since we are dealing with Strings, everything between the start and end value tags is converted into a String. Hence to add a newline, we must actually put text on separate lines without any indentation. Be aware that values don't have to be mapped to Strings, they can be primitives like int or char, or objects like Integer or Float. Spring automatically knows how to convert them.

We won't be covering the OnceUpon bean, it's essentially the same thing as HelloWorld, only with different values. In fact, that is the main purpose for using Spring, storing different sets of values for a Java class as a bean instead of making a new class. Up next are the Java Bean classes themselves.

==Step 3: Making JavaBean classes==
There are two JavaBean classes: Story.java and StoryList.java. Copy and paste the following text into their respective classes.

===Story.java===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Story {
	
	private String title;
	private String author;
	private String content;
	
	public Story () {
	}	
	public void setTitle(String title) {
		this.title = title;
	}
	public String getTitle() {
		return title;
	}
	public void setAuthor(String author) {
		this.author = author;
	}
	public String getAuthor() {
		return author;
	}
	public void setContent(String content) {
		this.content = content;
	}
	public String getContent() {
		return content;
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===StoryList.java===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.util.List;

public class StoryList {

	private List stories;
	
	public StoryList (){
	}
	public void setStories(List stories) {
		this.stories = stories;
	}
	public List getStories() {
		return stories;
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Explanation===
Not too complicated, right? These are JavaBeans; simple classes with getters and setters for property variables, and a constructor without any parameters. For a more in-depth discussion of JavaBeans visit [[Wikipedia:JavaBeans]]. The setters, like setTitle(String title), are what Spring uses to create the beans in the XmlBeanFactory. The setters must follow specific bean naming conventions. For example, settitle(String title) with a lowercase &quot;t&quot; won't work. However, as an example setURL(String url) with property name &quot;URL&quot; will work because the second letter &quot;R&quot; is also capitalized in addition to the first &quot;U&quot;. Getters aren't actually used by Spring in this example, however StoryReader needs them as we'll see later on. In addition, we don't actually have to specify a no-argument constructor, we could just leave it out and the Java compiler will automatically put one in the class when it's compiled. However, writing a constructor with one or more arguments without a no-argument constructor would invalidate the class as a bean.

==Step 4: A main method to put it all together==
As we have before, copy and paste the text. And save your class as StoryReader.java.

===StoryReader.java===
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.core.io.ClassPathResource;

public class StoryReader {
	
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		XmlBeanFactory beanFactory = new XmlBeanFactory(
				new ClassPathResource(&quot;story_configuration.xml&quot;));

		StoryList storyList = (StoryList) beanFactory.getBean(&quot;StoryList&quot;);

		List myStories = storyList.getStories();

		for (int i = 0; i &lt; myStories.size(); i++) {
			Story currentStory = (Story) myStories.get(i);
			System.out.println(&quot;\&quot;&quot; + currentStory.getTitle() + &quot;\&quot; by &quot;
					+ currentStory.getAuthor() + &quot;:&quot;);
			System.out.println(currentStory.getContent());
			System.out.println();
		}
	}//end main
	
}//end StoryReader 
&lt;/source&gt;

===Explanation===
Here is our main class, StoryReader.java. First we have to import two Spring classes, XmlBeanFactory and ClassPathResource. XmlBeanFactory is essentially a Java class representation of the Spring XML configuation file, story_configuration.xml. However, before we can get the XML file, we have to tell Spring to look in our class path for that file. That's where ClassPathResource comes in. It searchs the class path, which is where our .class files are stored, for the file specified in its constructor, story_configuration.xml. Any other class that implements the Resource interface may be used, such as org.springframework.core.io.FileSystemResource. Therefore, we see XmlBeanFactory beanFactory = new XmlBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource(&quot;story_configuration.xml&quot;)); creates a new bean factory from story_configuration.xml.

The next line, StoryList storyList = (StoryList) beanFactory.getBean(&quot;StoryList&quot;);, tells us which bean we want to get next. The getBean(&quot;StoryList&quot;) tells the bean factory to return an object corresponding to the bean with the id &quot;StoryList&quot;, since it is the class name. Since it is an Object, we have to cast it into a StoryList class.

Next, we get the list of stories from the StoryList class, and loop through them. Since this is a bean, the Stories are already there in the list, within the values already in the stories. All we have to do is print them out; which we do. Note: \&quot; is used to escape quotes within the String.

==Step 5: Running your program==
So now that we're done creating our classes and files, lets run the program! Fix any errors you get by making sure you copied everything correctly. When you run the main method of StoryReader, your output should be as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
Mar 12, 2006 5:42:30 PM org.springframework.core.CollectionFactory &lt;clinit&gt;
INFO: JDK 1.4+ collections available
Mar 12, 2006 5:42:30 PM org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanDefinitionReader loadBeanDefinitions
INFO: Loading XML bean definitions from class path resource [story_configuration.xml]
&quot;Hello World!&quot; by User:Hyad:
This is a simple story.
This is a story about a man who said, &quot;Hello, World.&quot;
See, now wasn't that simple.

&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; by Rob Yates:
Once upon a time there were some interesting things going on.
The end.

&lt;/pre&gt;

The dates will obviously be different when you run it yourself. Also, the four lines that begin with either a date or the word &quot;INFO&quot; are printed to System.err and may be above, or below, or even in between the rest of the output. This is because some operating systems may print to System.out and System.err at different times. Check that your output matches the one shown, disregarding the dates and order of the four lines that Spring prints. Now, you have a fully functioning Spring application, but what next?

==Afterthoughts==
===Things to remember===
As I mentioned earlier, Spring performs automatic conversion of values to both primitives and Objects; int, float, char, Double, boolean, Byte, you name it. Also note that &lt;list&gt;, which is simply a list of values, can be mapped to a List object, an Array object, or a primitive array (the two square brackets kind). There are even &lt;set&gt; and &lt;map&gt; tags which can be mapped to Sets and Maps, respectively. And at any point you can replace a value with a reference to a bean, like replace &lt;value&gt;myValue&lt;/value&gt; with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref bean=&quot;myBeanId&quot;/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This reference will return the corresponding JavaBean and Spring will store it as that variable.

In addition, Spring can also serve as a replacement for properties files. An advantage is that Spring is XML based, so any XML parser can read it. And multiple beans can be stored for the same class within the same file. However, you may also place beans across multiple files, and use &lt;import resource=&quot;myOtherBeanConfigFile.xml&quot;/&gt; to &quot;import&quot; other beans, just like importing Java classes.

The last thing you may want to know is that Spring is most helpful when you use one bean to reference to other beans, classes, files, etc. You may have one bean contain a list of beans, which contain a list of beans, each of which contain another list of beans, ... This way only the file name and location of most top level bean is &quot;hard-coded&quot; in the Java class, and everything else is specified by the XML configuration files.

===Try it yourself===
Here are a few tasks you might do to make your Spring application more robust. Do as many, or as little, as you like:
*Separate the StoryList bean into another XML file, using &lt;import resource=&quot;story_configuration.xml&quot;/&gt; in your new file.
*Add publication date to each of your stories. How will you store the date?
*Make a separate class for the author. What attributes might an author have?
*Put additional functionality into StoryList. How about a printStories() method that can be called by StoryReader's main method?
*Create a writer so all output will be written to a file. And store that file name as a bean.
*Add more stories. (Mine suck, I know.)
*Instead of stories, how about TV shows, or video games?
*Change random code around until it breaks. Have fun! :)

===About the author===
I go by [[User:Hyad]] on Wikipedia and Wikibooks. Having been frustrated by other Spring tutorials that were too long, I decided after actually learning (and using) Spring at work that I would actually create my own. [http://www.drrockit.com/space/Java/Simple+Spring+Demo This tutorial] came the closest to what I was looking for in a good tutorial, but it was a little too short. So I figured, why not give an example that could be used in the real world. And I figured Wikibooks would be the best place for it, considering if I put it on my website, 1. It would be too cumbersome to edit, and 2. Other people wouldn't be able to edit and update it easily. So drop me a line at [[wikipedia:User talk:Hyad|my Wikipedia talk page]] and tell me what you think.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Cuisine of India]]

'''Vindaloo''' is a hot and spicy dish from the Goa region of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. Its heavy use of vinegar and the traditional meat of pork are due to the Portuguese influence on the area. Vindaloo is a popular Indian restaurant meal, where it is often made with [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], [[Cookbook:Prawn|prawns]], or vegetables such as [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]].

There are many variations of the vindaloo recipe. Some derivatives use potato, or vary the amounts and types of spices used. Goans scoff at the usage of any other main ingredient besides high fat content pork in vindaloo, because the flavor is very different when prepared with a main ingredient other than pork. Authentic Goan vindaloo is not a curry but more of a dry sauce-based dish, which tastes better as it ages. The authentic taste of vindaloo comes from a unique blend of the fat in the pork, the garlic, vinegar, [[Cookbook:jaggery|jaggery]] and kashmiri chili (this specific spice is very flavorful but not too pungent). 

Vindaloo is often served with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], [[Cookbook:Chapati|chappatis]], [[Cookbook:Naan|naan bread]], or a combination of these. It can also be served with assorted pickles, such as aubergine or lime pickle. Given the spicy nature of the dish, it goes particularly well with [[Cookbook:Raita|raita]].

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breast fillets 
*2-3 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s
*2 fresh [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]] (I use 2 red and 1 green)
*6 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (or 6 tsp minced) 
*2cm cube of [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (if you don't have fresh ginger use 2 cloves garlic + 1 tsp dried ginger powder)
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Vinegar|white wine vinegar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] dried [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]  powder
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
*0.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] powder
*1.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] black [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] seeds
*0.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|rock salt]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbl]] chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]] 
*half a cup of water

==Procedure==
# '''Make the onion sauce'''
## Take a thick-based [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]], and pour into it enough vegetable oil to cover the base, with a little excess. Heat on a stovetop.
## Slice the onions into fairly thin slivers. When the oil is very hot, add the onions.
## Turn the stove down to a low heat, so the onions just gently [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]]. After around 3 minutes they should be starting to caramelize.
## Gradually turn up the heat and keep stirring the onions. You want them to brown quite heavily without burning.
## Add the white wine vinegar, it will sizzle, and after a while will evaporate. Keep stirring. Fry for several more minutes, until they are very brown, but not burnt.
## Remove the onions from the pan into a bowl, taking care to let as much oil as possible drip back into the pan. You should now have a bowl of nicely crisped fried onions.
## Add the onions to a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] or [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]]. Add around 1 tablespoon of oil, and process for around a minute until you have a fairly thick, dark brown sauce. This is the basic onion sauce from which vindaloo is made. It's also the onion sauce that gives the vindaloo the majority of its 'hot' taste, as it builds up as you eat the dish.
## Remove sauce from blender and set aside.
# '''Make the garlic/chili paste'''
## Coarsely chop the garlic cloves (and ginger if you're using it). De-seed the chili peppers and chop in the same way. Add the chopped garlic and chillies to the food processor. 
## Blend the garlic and chillies until you have a fairly grainy (but liquid) sauce. For this I used an attachment on my blender which is intended to grind coffee beans. It has a much smaller container and so there's less waste.
## Add the turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala and cinnamon to the sauce. Stir it until it's well mixed, and set aside.
## Gently crush the black peppercorns in a mortar and pestle. Once coarse, add the mustard seed and rock salt. Continue blending until all the spices form a nice coarse powder.
# '''Cook the paste and meat'''
## Pour a little oil into a saucepan. Add the spiced garlic and chili paste to the pan. It needs to be slightly floating on oil, not touching the bottom of the pan.
## When the sauce is quite hot and bubbling, add the chopped meat. Keep stirring so the meat absorbs the spice mix, until it is browned and mostly cooked.
# '''Add onion sauce and simmer'''
## Now add the onion sauce to the pan. After stirring for 1 minute, add a little water and stir for another 2 minutes, then turn the heat to quite low. The sauce at this stage should be quite runny, and orange/tan in color. Remember a lot is going to evaporate off as it cooks.
## At this stage you can add some vegetables. Half a cup of frozen peas works well.
## Place a lid over the pan, and cook for around 30-40 minutes. Keep checking and stirring the pan every 5 or 10 minutes to make sure it doesn't stick or burn.The sauce will darken in color as it cooks.
## Towards the last 15 minutes of cooking time, boil 2 cups of pilau, or basmati rice in a pan.
## To serve- spoon the curry over the top of the rice. Sprinkle the chopped coriander leaves over the curry, and serve immediately.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Powdered or dried ingredients can be substituted for fresh, but at the expense of taste.

===Spicier Variation===
To cook a more intensely spiced but still field tested variation of this recipe consider the following modifications:
*Double the amount of each of these ingredients:
**chosen chilies (if you like very spicy curry)
**garlic
**ginger
**turmeric
**coriander
**garam masala (if you like very spicy curry)
**cinnamon
**black pepper
**black mustard seeds
**coriander leaves
*Cook the onion sauce mixture and the meat-and-paste mixture until they are very nearly burned (consider a non stick pan for this).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Japanese Law and Government}}
Japanese civil law is generally governed by the Civil Code (民法 ''Minpō''). The Civil Code is divided into five volumes:

#General Provisions
#[[Japanese Law and Government/Property Law|Property]]
#[[Japanese Law and Government/Obligation Law|Obligations]]
#[[Japanese Law and Government/Family Law|Family]]
#Succession

==Personhood==

The Civil Code recognizes two types of &quot;persons&quot; (人 ''hito''); natural persons (自然人 ''shizen-jin'') and juristic persons (法人 ''hōjin'').

===Natural persons===

====Minors and majority====
Individuals acquire civil rights at birth (Article 3) and are considered to be competent as adults upon reaching the age of twenty (Article 4).

Minors must have the consent of their legal representative in order to engage in legal acts; any acts engaged in by minors without such consent are voidable but not automatically void. The legal representative may give prior consent for a minor to dispose of their property, in which case any such disposal is not voidable (Article 5).

Minors may also engage in business as adults with the consent of their legal representative (Article 6).

====Competency====

Adults with inhibited psychological competency may be protected under three different systems. These are instituted by a family court at the petition of the individual, their spouse, their immediate relative, their legal guardian/curator/assistant, the supervisor of their guardian/curator/assistant, or by a prosecutor. The family court may also rescind any of the systems upon petition of any such person. The three systems are mutually incompatible with each other; if a person moves from one status to another, their previous status must be canceled (Article 19). 

* '''Guardianship''' (後見 ''kōken'') is employed when the adult in question has lost their ability to reason due to psychological disability. Once guardianship is instituted, the individual's legal acts are voidable, except for necessary acts in the course of their daily life (Article 9).
* '''Curatorship''' (保佐 ''hosa'') is a less severe form of guardianship for adults who have significantly reduced capacity to reason (Article 11). A person under curatorship needs consent of their curator to engage in certain acts listed below (Article 13). The family court may also give this consent where the curator denies consent and there is no risk of harm to the individual (Article 13.3). Any such acts without the curator's consent are voidable (Article 13.4).
*#Collection or use of principal
*#Lending or guaranteeing an obligation
*#Acquiring or disposing of real estate or other major assets
*#Litigation
*#Gifts, settlements or arbitration agreements
*#Accepting or waiving succession rights, or dividing estate property
*#Refusing or waiving gifts, or accepting gifts with appurtenant liabilities
*#Building, renovating, expanding or conducting major repairs on buildings
*#Leases beyond the maximum default term stipulated by law
*'''Assistance''' (補助　''hojo'') is an even less severe system for adults who have reduced capacity to reason. The individual must consent to being placed under assistance (Article 15). The family court then designates acts for which the individual requires the assistant's consent (Article 17).

====Counterparty rights====

When a minor or otherwise competency-restricted individual becomes legally competent, any counterparty to a voidable act has the right to demand their acceptance of previously-voidable acts. If the individual remains incompetent, the counterparty may demand a similar acceptance by their guardian, curator or assistant. The demand must allow for a response period of no less than one month (Article 20). 

A competency-restricted individual is also barred from voiding prior acts if they used fraudulent means to make their counterparty believe they were competent (Article 21).

===Juristic persons===
For-profit corporations are the most common juristic persons; these are described in [[../Commercial Law|Japanese Commercial Law]].

The Civil Code also establishes two types of juristic person that are formed for public purposes, such as education, arts, religion or charity. Such corporations must be granted a permit from a relevant government agency before they are legally established (Article 34). Their establishment must then be recorded within two weeks at the Legal Affairs Bureau having jurisdiction over the corporation's head office (Article 45).

Foreign juristic persons are not generally recognized in Japan, except for the following (Article 35):

* Foreign countries
* Foreign regional divisions
* Foreign companies
* Other foreign juristic persons recognized by a Japanese law or treaty

====Associations====
'''Associations''' (社団法人 ''shadan hōjin'') are formed by members who execute articles of incorporation (定款 ''teikan'').

Associations have a structure similar to business corporations. Their highest decision-making organ is a general meeting of members (社員総会 ''shain sōkai''), which elects directors (理事 ''riji'') to oversee the operations of the association. Associations may also have auditors (監事 ''kanji''), although these are not required.

====Foundations====

'''Foundations''' (財団法人 ''zaidan hōjin'') are formed by a donation of capital recorded in an act of donation (寄附行為 ''gifu kōi''). Foundations always have directors and may have auditors, but they do not have a general meeting of members, as there are no members to form a general meeting.

====Legal capacity====

The director(s) of an association or foundation may act on behalf of the corporation with regard to any matters within its enumerated purposes. Directors may be personally liable for approving or executing acts outside the purpose of the corporation (Article 44).

== Me ==

I live in Nottinghamshire, England, and am currently in Year 9 at a High School in the area. I am a self professed expert in the fields of defence, and policing. I have been working on several projects for major press and broadcasting companies, as an investigative journalist, covering areas such as the counter terrorist operation of the British Police, and the Nuclear Decommissioning of Russia's Northern Naval Fleet.

I am currently studying for my GCSE's, and as a result of that, have far too much homework, and spend too much time online. I enjoy programming, and do a bit of web design in my spare time. I also play alot of sports, such as tennis, cross country, orienteering, and badminton. If you really want to know, I am doing the following for GCSE:
*French
*German
*Spanish
*English Literature
*English Language
*Maths
*History
*Design Technology or Geography or Religious Studies (dont know)
*Chemistry or Biology or Physics (dont know)
*Chemistry or Biology or Physics (dont know)

I'd also like to take Physical Education and ICT, but my school doesnt offer those choices, so i'll just have to make do, or do them by distance learning, or some other way.

PS. I am heavily obsessed with userboxes, so watch out!



==Things that Wikipedia could improve on==
* '''Instruction creep'''. The overly long instruction pages actually put me off from following accepted conventions. It just takes so long sometimes to find out how to do things correctly. Even though you sometimes see references to [[m:Instruction creep]] in those pages, they still keep growing. The results are that either (a) I go against the rules, or (b) I just don't bother fixing things that I know are wrong.
* '''Vandalism'''. To be honest, I used to find it fun to hunt for and squash vandalism. It's great that the intelligent design of this project means it's usually as easy to undo vandalism as it is to do it in the first place. (If only physical vandalism in real life were as easy to rectify.) However, vandalism is  now really annoying me; it's absurd that a large part of people's editing time is taken up with countering it. As maybe 99% of vandalism is from anonymous IP addresses, I now believe all posting should be from registered users. I think some of the proposals in [[m:anonymous users should not be allowed to edit articles|anonymous users should not be allowed to edit]] are extreme: such proposals undermine the whole point of the project. Allowing people to remain anonymous behind a nickname is fine - in fact, absolutely necessary as many people may not wish to be publicly identified (I ceratinly don't). Generally I do like the approach of [[User:Anastrophe-wikipedia]], though I don't see the necessity for even requiring an e-mail address. The basic principles should be:
** New users must have a relatively pain-free experience&amp;mdash;both in signing up, and in making initial postings.
** A campaign of vandalism must be a painful experience for the vandal.

In the early stages of this project it is better to not take on too many subjects, lest none of them get anywhere.  They suggested three beginning topics would be a good start across several topics.

As I said on the Meta discussion, we should look at the possibility that each booklet have several editions covering an age range of not more than three years each: 2-4, 5-7, 8-10, 11-14 and 15-16.  Beyond that the existing Wikipedia article will do.  Each age group has different abilities and requirements.

A sampler book should first be prepared containing the range of six articles on for example the lion, Mercury and Peru.  This should also include ample space for comments.  It could then be distributed to a broad range of educators and librarians who would be requested to comment and criticize.  Only then, in response to that feedback, should we proceed with full production.  I think that this is as much an exercize in building credibility as in building a series of texts. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 13:59, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Although that's a good idea in the long run. This project is aimed at 7-12 year olds so we don't need to worry about very young or nearly adult readers. As I suggested on the draft page layout, we can write for an average 10 or 11 year old with simpler texts in the speach bubbles and advanced texts in text boxes (like they with derivations in physics books) for the older and brighter child. And Angela's idea of alternate texts can be useful for extending the age range.  A quiz, an interview, a story. These can all be designed to appeal to the younger or older child. That way we only need one booklet per topic to cover 7 - 12. Not every child will read every single line of text in a particluar booklet. but there will be something to interest all of them. See http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikijunior_draft_page_layout for a sample of how this might look. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:23, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

P.S. It has been a while since I contributed at Wikipedia .... Does this project work like wikipedia where nothing is thrown away, merely archived until more approprite or is deletion or ignoring forever around here?

== Need Guidance on Length ==

My research on cats is underway, and I would like some length guidance for this book.  48 pages of what size?  How many words total?  How many words for each species? For other introductory sections? Lets please target an age range no more than 3 years apart.  --  [[User:Lotsofissues|Lotsofissues]] 03:18, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
: My advice, just write what you think is right. We'll edit things before they go to print, but keep the full length versions online. Our grant says we are to write for 8-11-year-olds.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

You'll make it easy on yourselves (editing) if we have some idea how long each article should be. I'm working on South America, and I'm not sure if I'm writing too much. I'm not interested in writing stuff that will just end up being cut for space reasons, so what's a decent rule of thumb? There will be 20 articles, so presumably every article will be 48 pages / 20 articles = 2.4 pages per article. But are theses 100 word pages or 500 word pages? [[User:Quadell|Quadell]] 6 July 2005 17:38 (UTC)

: I would recommend that you worry more about trying to keep the level of complexity down so it is understandable for kids.  Remember, this is not Wikipedia, so use simple english.  If the article goes over 32K (when the warning goes off when editing any page on Wikibooks or anything with MediaWiki), it is probably way too long and should be edited back.  That would make it roughly 2500 words+ image tags and templates.  If possible, try to bring articles up that are weak in content first, as they really need help.

: As far as how this will look when it goes to print, that is going to be an interesting question.  There is quite a bit of work that will have to be done even after the basic content is put together.  [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 9 July 2005 10:27 (UTC)

== Article of the Week/Month ==

This is a feature that has languished for some time, and I'm rushing off to change it for now.  As it is the end of the month, it doesn't really matter, but I think it does need to be updated regularly.  Should there be some sort of vote on this?  I just selected some new articles, and things that IMHO needed a little bit of work as well.  This is totally arbitrary, and certianly could be improved.  any suggestions?  A voting page for suggestions? [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:48, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Read-only mode ==

Once the projects are finished, is there a way to put them on Read-only mode?
That way, we would avoid spam and troll attacks while kids navigate these pages. The lock could always be removed when there is need to update anything. [[User:Carlos Hoyos|DrJones]] 20:49, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

Yes it's planned that the books will be developed here, but will be printed and put on a read only website once they are finished. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:07, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

:I hope it is just a &quot;finished&quot; fork that is put on a read-only mode.  Times change, new discoveries happen (particularly in science, but also in politics like South America), wars occur, and more happens.  Every topic here can and should be allowed to &quot;breathe&quot;.  This development &quot;fork&quot; could then be imported by an admin if it seems as though it is has significantly improved the article or has improved the editing....hopefully by general community concensus as well.  In the meantime, I hope that several new &quot;projects&quot; get started well before the read-only issues occur.  This is similar in nature to the Wikipedia 1.0 issues, although this is going to be a little bit smaller in scope.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:07, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
::Of course. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 17:44, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

== Print version of Wikijunior book ==

I'm tired of people merely talking about what a print version of one of these books would look like.  Barring substantial changes in MediaWiki software, this is going to have to be done by hand for now.

Anyway, if you want a copy of [[Image:Solar System.pdf|The Print Version of Wikijunior Solar System]], download this to you heart's content.  I'll try to upload a new version about once a month or so incorporating changes in the articles for each Wikijunior Wikibook as they happen.  The version from the Wikijunior pages will be as of the date of upload, avoiding blatant vandalism and obvious stubs in progress.  If there is any interest, I'll go ahead and do the other two Wikijunior books as well.  Of course, anybody can update the file as well doing it the same way I've done it.

This has been prepared by saving each page in the Wikijunior book to my hard drive, and then importing them into Open Office (v. 1.1.4) and in turn exporting as a PDF file.  I had problems trying to copy &amp; paste directly from Mozilla into Open Office.  If there is interest I'll also include the *.sxw file on some Wikijunior:Print page.  Right now this would be trivial to duplicate, so I'm not really going to fight it right now with the extra upload.

I'm doing this because

# I have a 9-year-old son who has been begging me to get him a book about the Solar System.  This is as good as any, so I'm going to let him be the first one to read this particular book in hard copy dead-tree format.
# I wanted to see just how many printed pages one of the books on-line really is (64 pages of print BTW, and there is missing content from the site as well, but the 64 pages does include the GFDL).
# I thought it would be cool to try the Open Office PDF publishing button. (I havn't had that much experience with it before... I just upgraded to a new version of Open Office.)
# I am tired of the FAQ happening where everybody is talking about a print version, but there isn't any to show.  Now there is a print version, so those new to Wikijunior can have something to wrap their hands around if they so choose.
# If Wikinews can have a Print version, why not Wikijunior?  To be honest, that was the #2 inspiration for me (after reason #1 listed above).

Comment away on what you like/dislike/think needs to be added to these print version of books.  I do intend to put in a formal table of contents to each major article, footers with page numbers, a semi-exaustive list of contributors as based on the histories of each project, and other items more fitting a print version than a web version.  Any reasonable suggested would be appreciated --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:36, 24 July 2005 (UTC)


My first impressions are that it looks pretty good. We need a list of contributors somewhere in the book (or on the back page perhaps) to comply with the GFDL. This was discussed somewhere on meta, I can't recall where exactly. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:09, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

:I'm going to plow through the history of each article to see if we can get that information.  Almost everybody uses a psuedonym for attribution, so perhaps we need to set up a formal identification area for those that want to be &quot;officially&quot; an author of the Wikibook.  This will be especially important if we want to do formal registration.  This is something I'm willing to fill out the paperwork for... but I'm going to need some assistance in trying to find the real names of the authors of these books in order to fill out the copyright registration forms. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:49, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

:This may sound really silly, but can the final version have a better font than Times New Roman (which is generally acknowledged to be harder to read)?  A font like Ariel would be pretty and highly readable.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 03:47, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

::No problem.  At least is isn't Old German gothic.  The reason for Times New Roman was simply because it was the &quot;default&quot; font for Open Office on a fresh install. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:51, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

While it is still developing, you may look at the Wikijuior Big Cats Print Version [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/c/cc/Big_Cats.pdf located here].

&lt;p&gt;
'''FYI''' I just added an update for the [[:Image:Big Cats.pdf]] that you can download.  For some reason it is about half the size of Munchkinguy's version but with more content.  Go figure.  Anyway, have fun and I hope this shows the fruit of what Wikijunior can become.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:44, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

== Pronunciations? ==

It might be a good idea to provide pronunciations of some of the italicized words and other terms.. Though, is there an easy way to do this? (I.e., not using the IPA) It seems phonetic pronunciations can be ambigious at times.

*For further discussion on exactly this topic, see:  [[Talk:Wikijunior_Solar_System#Pronunciations]]
*In short, how would you suggest this could be done and also be understandable to young readers of English languages books (the goal of Wikijunior).  Most pronouciation guides tend to use special symbols that IMHO require a more adult level of knowledge to understand in the first place.  Phoenetic pronounciations that use just latin letters may not be as easily transfered across all English dialects, where pronounciation does have a huge impact through cultural customs and traditions.  That is also another issue in regards to what pronounciation standard should be used, although &quot;General American&quot; and &quot;British&quot; are two standards to apply in a situation like this.  Common pronounciations do occur in most English dialects (although I do have a little bit of a problem trying to understand Jamacian).  Texan and Cockney are two other dialectial flavors that each have their own unique traits, but unlikly to be used as a grammar standard.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]]
*I think the idea the second poster presented here: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Wikijunior_Solar_System#Pronunciations is a good idea. That is, using words kids should already be familiar with to use in pronunciations (or in the pronunciation key).

== Ancient Egypt and New Wikijunior Books==

Some anonymous user just added the following Wikijunior Wikibook to the front page:

* [[Wikijunior Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egypt]]

I have removed it to here mainly as a reference, and because it doesn't meet with what I would call basic minimum standards that need to be followed here.  It perhaps needs to be deleted, and certainly needs to be called a stub and nothing more.  It also goes against the &quot;no new Wikijunior books&quot; policy.

It does bring up the point that I feel this policy of no new Wikibooks is totally anti-wiki and against just about everything that we stand for here on any Wikimedia project:  The ability for users to create new and original content.  This whole business of &quot;waiting&quot; until some printed content has been created for Wikijunior is totally silly, and there are no deadlines to getting that accomplished either.  And besides, '''''I''''' created a PDF file (for [[Wikijunior Solar System]]) that is more or less ready for print, except for the fact that improved editing really does need to take place before I would send a copy of this Wikibook to an eager school teacher.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:20, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

After seeing little activity in other Wikijunior discussion forums, I am hereby proposing the following new Wikijunior Book:  Ancient civilizations.  If there seems to be some desire for somebody to contribute to a totally different area of knowledge, this would be an interesting one to go after.  Topics would be in part based on the rough outline in the above article suggestion on Ancient Egypt.  Suggested articles would be the following:

*Egypt
*Persia
*Babylon/Sumeria
*Assryia
*Inca
*Maya
*Mound Builders (North America)
*India
*China
*Japan
*Korea
*Rome
*Carthage
*Greece
*Ethiopia
*South &amp; Central African civilizations?

Focus in this situation will be on B.C.E./B.C. civilizations, although this distinction doesn't always have to hold.  There are some issues where some national governments in a way to gain legitimacy often do biased &quot;research&quot; on their ancient progenitors.  These POV issues will be present, but I believe they can be avoided.  Imperial governments that governed more than one city (loosely &gt; 50,000 people) will also be a focus rather than individual city-states (aka Athens).  Anyway, I'd like some feedback on this proposal before going off and starting it up. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:50, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

:If you havn't noticed, in part because this section of Wikijunior is so dead, I've gone ahead and added this new Wikijunior Wikibook.  I've also created [[Wikijunior:New Title Policy]] to establish some basic guidelines on how to formalize the process of creating a new Wikijunior book.  I'm not trying to flood Wikijunior with a bunch of half-done book titles, but I think we do need to broaden the realm of potential contributors to this series, and staying stagnated with just three different Wikibooks isn't enought.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:43, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

==Board to discuss giving Wikijunior seperate wiki==
During the upcoming September 18 Wikimedia Foundation board meeting, the Board will discuss registering a seperate domain for Wikijunior, presumably wikijunior.org. Presumably Wikijunior will still be developed on Wikibooks, but it will go live on a seperate site. Alternatively, we could have en.wikijunior.org for viewing, and en2.wikijunior.org for editing, which would allow for a greater ease in developing pages, as they could be part of a freeform encyclopedia (on limited topics), rather than the isolated books they are now. If we were to develop off Wikibooks, I'd like us to retain most, if not all of the structure of Wikibooks, it's worked well so far.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

:I'm curious about what is going to go on the Wikijunior.org site?  Is this going to be an editable Wiki by the general public, or something that a few &quot;admins&quot; and invited guests are going to work on to mirror the content of Wikibooks?  I guess I'm confused as to what the full extent of the proposal is going to be right now.  If a fully editable wiki is going to be started as essentially a whole new Wikimedia sister project, I would perfer that it go through the whole new project proposal process, including vote, as supposedly required by the foundation (although it seems as though this isn't being respected).  I got that whole thing organized for Wikiversity, and it is not a trivial thing to accomplish.  On the other hand, once you get some widespread support through such a vetting process and vote in multiple languages (the really hard part of the process), it is hard to deny that the new project should be started.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:19, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

== A World of Discovery and Innovation ==

I just had to do it.  I hope nobody minds.  Science &amp;asymp; discovery.  Technology &amp;asymp; innovation. They are often intertwined because development of new technology is often required to enable new scientific discoveries. But innovation, of itself, is not usually science.   --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 14:45, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
: Yes, that's fine. I've clearly defined what each of the &quot;series&quot; are, primarily based on the categories on the front of Wikipedia English (&quot;Culture | Geography | History | Life | Mathematics | Science | Society | Technology&quot;). However, natural history is split from science.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

:: This isn't that big of a deal, but I wanted to emphasis that the new Ancient Civilizations book would be different from the South America book, and technically a different &quot;series&quot;.  I see the South America book being a part of a larger collection of books about each continent, like doing Africa, Austrialia/Oceania, and Asia as subsequent volumes in that series.  The Ancient Civilizations don't really fit in that mold as easily, although breaking up Ancient Civilizations by continent might not be a bad idea either.  Just a thought, and this whole classification system might go out the window anyway.  I'm not too worried until we have several books out anyway, and a group of books that can be collected and published as a &quot;series&quot;.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:09, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

== Distribution to hurricane evacuees ==

[[Wikijunior Solar System]] is currently being proofread.  [[meta:User:Danny|Danny]] has asked us to have [[Wikijunior Solar System]] ready for distribution to hurricane evacuees by [[October 3]][[2005]]. 

Here are some questions we need to answer:
* Do the hurricane evacuees want this book?
* Do their host schools want this book?
* Does anybody know who to contact to get in touch with organizations that can distribute these books to the evacuees?

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 19:34, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:Just an FYI.  [http://rrdonelly.com R.R. Donelly company] is currently in the process of trying to get donations and organize a campaign to replace the books for the libraries of all of the public schools that were destroyed in the Hurricanes of 2005 (mainly Katrina and Rita).  I'm trying to get some contact information, but they may even be willing to help with the printing and distribution of some orginal content like the Wikijunior Solar System.  I'm trying to get some further contact information to propose the concept to the powers that be.  They are a major printing service, but book publishing isn't a major feature or component of their business (they do have a publishing arm, however).  I'll try to post more information about this as details progress.  BTW, my wife is an employee of this company, and has some &quot;inside&quot; contact that can be useful to help with this process.  There are other organizations I know of (foundations with strong ties to education) that I can also contact for help with the financial aspects, especially if we have a real &quot;product&quot; that we can show to them, like a proofread book, and other books in the pipeline.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:59, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

Great idea!  And if anyone else knows how to get these booklets published and distributed, please let us all know. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 20:42, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

== Quarterly voting for new Wikijunior Book Projects ==

I added some pages to help vote for new Wikijunior Book Projects.  Due to suggestions on [[Talk:Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions]], I made this a quarterly vote.  If Wikijunior is popular enough, this can be changed to Monthly or whatever, but this is just a chance to still allow us to grow a little bit but not too fast.  Voting is rampant all over Wikimedia projects anyway, but this is new territory for seeking input on what new articles are going to be written in the first place.  I hope this will allow some growth to Wikijunior to keep it from getting stagnant but at the same time allow us to focus our energies on existing projects to try and get them caught up and completed.  Also, the methodology of developing projects first before expansion I think is a good experiment to try out on Wikijunior, something I havn't seen anywhere else on any other Wikimedia project.  Any more suggestions?  

I also want to eventually put this on the main page of Wikibooks as another item for the Wikibooks community to vote on as well.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:22, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

== Alaska? ==

Was there some discussion on choosing Alaska, or was that just a '''bold''' move? Thanks. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] [[User talk:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;(Dark Mark)&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:22, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

:That was just a bold move and something done arbitrarily.  I think it is a neat idea, and Alaska certainly is big enough in terms of geography to justify a book like this, but I would strongly suggest it goes into the New Title Suggestions area first.  I'm still trying to get some community concensus if we need to have a free-for-all on title expansions in Wikijunior or if we need to maintain the slow growth approach.  In the past, titles like Alaska would have been simply removed.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:05, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

::Okay, because while I think Alaska would be an interesting topic, I don't think we should put it out there unless we have discussed it. Isn't that what the New Title Suggestion page is for?

== A few things... ==

*So was there ever any agreement on the Kiki/Nikki thing? The books as they have proceeded do not seem to accomodate Kiki. 
*And can we try for some sort of standardisation throughout the Wikijunior world? There was an intro on the Solar System book that I stole and added to Big Cats. Should we include this on the other two as well? 
*There was also a template that I stole for Big Cats too. This might be helpful for the other two books as well. 
*Was there ever any final decision about a new domain for Wikijunior? 
*When are we trying to have the first book published by? Who is going to publish it? How will it be distributed? Can someone point me in the direction of these discussions?
*Is there regular contact with the Beck Foundation since they approved the grant so long ago?
*Any idea on how many regular Wikijunior editors are there? I do not see a ton of activity and that's sad if we really are trying to do this.
*Is there a way we can make this project more visible? Perhaps a Signpost article on WP? Was there one ever written? Can someone point me where to go?
I am sorry for all the questions, but I think I have raised some important concerns. I am trying to move this project forward but am wary that it is not focused enough to accomplish our goals. Thank you for the time. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] [[User talk:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;(Dark Mark)&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:23, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

::A reply to some of the things listed above:
::*The whole Kiki/Nikki thing has not been resolved, but at the same time it hasn't been used either in any of the Wikijunior books.  As currently presented, none of the content seems to be from the 1st person POV that would suggest a need for the character either.  I have my own ideas about how useful a cartoon character is going to be for these books, but it was something thought up in the early stages of Wikijunior to help draw a certain audience for these books.
::*The &quot;standardization&quot; in terms of the intro and stuff was actually something I added when I wanted to publish the Wikijunior Solar System as a dead-tree book.  I've done it, and it looks nice, but I felt that it needed an introduction in order to work out.  Some of these features perhaps should be adopted in some of the other books like Big Cats as well.
::*As far as the new domain of http://wikijunior.org/ is concerned, it does exist right now and is registered with the Wikimedia Foundation as the technical and billing contact.  It is also active right now, but all it does is redirect to the Wikibooks page of Wikijunior at the moment.  In terms of trying to create a whole new MediaWiki domain, that will have to be a new project proposal on the Wikimedia Meta Wiki.  The Foundation board is still talking about the issue, but it is also something that has to come from the community for support.  As it was, this was really just one motivated contributor who wanted to see it happen.  Nice by itself, but there are still unanswered questions and some community decisions (not the decisions of one person) that have to be made before it can happen.  I don't think we have enough participants yet with Wikijunior to justify a whole new project yet.
::*I'm willing to bankroll a few initial print copies of some fully prepared Wikibook volumes to get the ball rolling for a Wikimedia Press organization.  There is also some talk about doing this on Meta and a few other places as well, but as yet rather diffuse in terms of organization.  The big sticking point is that this is a capital intensive activity (requires $$$ to get started) and then trying to find a place to be able to sell the content.  Preferably, I'd like to do something loosly affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation, but be a for-profit venture with some of the profits going back to the Wikimedia Foundation.  Lulu Press and a couple other printing companies are also a possibility.
::*As for the Beck Foundation, I have made some inquiries and frankly I'm starting to smell a scam here.  I don't know exactly what was promised and I have yet to find somebody or have somebody respond to tell me where the formal contract with the Foundation is at, what the contact names and addresses of the Beck Foundation are, certainty as to which Beck Foundation it is associated with, and what deadlines if any are expected with the content.  All this an absolutely no leadership to get the printing done, and zero contact between the people supposedly working on the grant contract and the people actually writing the content.  As far as I'm concerned at the moment, the Beck Foundation doesn't even need to exist in order for the rest of Wikijunior to continue and for this project to turn out to be something useful.  Basically, ignore the Beck Foundation and if what we have for Wikijunior is useful perhaps somebody will donate some money to the Wikimedia Foundation at some time in the future.  I'm not holding my breath.  We'll find another way to get the content printed if you want a copy for yourself or to donate to your local public library.
::*As far as regulars are concerned, there about about 10-12 semi-regular contributors.  A huge push is going into the Wikijunior Solar System right now, with some fresh blood going into the Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations area as well.  Both of those Wikibooks seem to be doing fairly well.  The South America book is simply languishing, and the Big Cats book seems to suffer from perhaps too narrow of a focus.  Big Cats, however, is still getting some work done on it from time to time, and there is a small but dedicated group that seems to be working on that independent of the rest of the Wikijunior books.  This is an issue with Wikibooks in general, but Wikijunior is more of a microcosum of this.  I have a good portion of Wikijunior on my watch list, and there seem to be about 10 edits/day ''somewhere'' on a Wikijunior book.  This is significant growth from about 5 months ago when it was quite a bit less.
::*For visibility, Perhaps we need to get something going more on Meta as well, and putting out a cattle call on Wikipedia would be a good idea.  Particularly for the new book of the quarter vote, where perhaps we could get some input as to the next major project we will be doing.  Barring any huge changes, it looks like the next Wikijunior book will be about Dinosaurs, but that is still premature.  I think it is critical that we start expanding Wikijunior if we want more contributors.

::I hope this answers your questions.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:53, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

Thanks Robert. Most of my questions are answered. I am a little confused on the entire Beck Foundation issue. Angela said that there was a physical check for 10,000 USD. So my real question is, why would any of us need to chip in for publishing at this point? What is the 10,000 dollars for? Is it still available, or was it used ofr other projects? And If the Beck Foundation is a scam, where did the check come from, and was it ever cashed? I know I am coming to this project fairly late, but I think this is an important issue to resolve. When was our (Wikimedia) last contact with representatives from the Beck Foundation? Thanks. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] [[User talk:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;(Dark Mark)&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:07, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:I didn't say it was a scam, just that it seemed like one.  The $10,000 check went into the general fund of the Wikimedia Foundation, although some things were promised would be accomplished.  The problem is that like I said, the people who seemed to be involved with the grant are not participating with Wikijunior.  I have asked for and have not recieved any links to or copies of the grant or really much of anything that goes into details about what is going on.  I can't find any contact people either at the Wikimedia Foundation who are willing to discuss the issue with me, at least people who know what is going on.  The board members are willing to talk to me, but they don't have much more to add to the discussion going on right now and don't know the full details either.
:The thing I didn't like about the whole thing was mainly the way it was put together with promises made that volunteers would accomplish.  Even more importantly, that a fairly significant amount of money is involved, and the people involved in obtaining that money have shown no leadership on the actual Wikijunior project to see that deadlines are met and that one we have a book ready for publication that the rest of the actual publishing details have been worked out as well.  That hasn't happened yet and doesn't appear as though it will ever happen with money from the Beck Foundation.
:Wikijunior is a neat project on its own merit, and that is why I am participating.  I've decided to take a role of leadership and try to enlarge the community through things like the New Book of the Quarter and to keep pages like this one active and fresh.  The Wikijunior Solar System book is very close to completion at least for a 1st edition, so it is important that we try to work out the other details about where we can go from here.  If Beck Foundation seed money can't be used for the printed materials, I don't mind holding out a tin cup and trying to see if we as a community putting this together can go and do this on our own.  There are some other educational foundations I can hit up, but I don't want to have vaporware to hand over before I approach those other educational philothrantic groups.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:35, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

::It is sort of sad that what started out as a noble idea, sort of fizzled out now as we near publication. I think Wikijunior ''does'' have merit on its own, but all I can think of is &quot;so what?&quot; It just seems like it is hidden away, and will people ever use it? Maybe once we finalize all of the copyediting and proofing, and have something final, we could go to the community and show them what we are trying to do. Maybe raise Wikijunior specific funds. People are much more apt to donate if there is some finished project. Oh well. I guess we just keep up the good work.

== Grant Idea ==

I found this grant announcement to be somewhat interesting, and perhaps relevant to Wikijunior:

http://www.fedgrants.gov/Applicants/NEH/OPUB/OPO/MI/Grant.html

This is a U.S. Federal Grant for historical presevation and includes a specific reference to funding for working on educational materials and website development.  This came up in another discussion, and I'm not sure if we want to be tied to the U.S. Government, but this is a thought for some funding, and with the 501(c)(3) status of the Wikimedia Foundation we might be able to qualify as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:36, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:While that is ''very'' intriguing, it states, &quot;''These grants support interpretive museum exhibitions (both long-term and traveling) and the interpretation of historic sites, and include support for accompanying publications, websites, and public humanities programming.''&quot; While we clearly fall under the websites and public humanities programming clause, I'm not sure we qualify for the main clause (the museum or historical sites clause). How can we reconcile this fact? --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:08, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::What is interesting is that there is no grant &quot;floor&quot; on this.  We can submit a grant request for just a few hundred dollars and we may get it!  Indeed, if we want to apply for this, we would have to make a much more serious proposal than what was apparently done with the Beck Foundation, and come up with a realistic budget that would require something beyond what would normally be covered through the general server operations that the Wikimedia Foundation already covers.

::Some points in our favor is that Wikijunior is something that is already established, with some &quot;publications&quot; already under our belt.  That is a requirement for this grant, that we ''&quot;should have already done most of the planning for their projects, including the identification of the key humanities themes, relevant scholarship, and program formats.&quot;''  I think the current Wikibooks and Wikijunior policies already implemented would be useful as demonstration points for this.  Another clause that is in our favor is that they are seeking &quot;projects that use innovative formats and non-traditional ways of engaging audiences&quot;.  If that isn't Wikijunior, I don't know what is.

::I was thinking that the Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations book is particularly relevant to this grant proposal, particularly the sections that cover ancient North American civilizations (that would be of interest to the NEH), but most of Wikijunior would be of interest as well in general.

::Point here that should be noted:  Let's talk about in general what is realistically needed for Wikijunior outreach... i.e. what can we do to get Wikijunior content moved beyond just this website and get it into the hands of children.  What things can be done through organization of volunteers, and what activities would actually cost us some money by being responsible on spending the money as well.  Sure, we can talk about funding an Antarctic expedition for all current contributors to write a book about Penguins, but that is unrealistic.  Requesting funding to send existing Wikijunior materials to grade schools, including on CD-ROMs, flyers, and printed copies of the book might be more relevant.  Setting up a program where volunteers could give presentations to school kids based on Wikijunior materials might be another approach, with the grant money providing for travel stipends and presentation supplies.  We could be creative here, if we gave it a thought.

::Other opportunities like this will present itself over time, but I felt word about this grant needed to get out.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:34, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

==illustrations==
Usually childrens books are full of illustrations. However little original work seems to be surfacing and it would seem foolish to merely steal (even if it is legal) photos, maps, etc. from other organizations and people. Shouldn't we create our own page illustrations? My artistic ability is limited, although I would be willing to draw some less detailed pictures and/or maps. Does anyone have and fair talent in drawing and would be willing to donate a few hours to creating large page illustrations?

== Form of English ==

I trust we're all agreed that it isn't right to confuse kids with the differences between American and British English. However, that in itself can make things difficult - a book should only be written in one form of standard English, and it's tough luck if that form of English is American and you are British, or vice versa. I have seen it mentioned elsewhere that it may be desirable to have two books in that instance - one in British English and one in American English, and I think that's a good idea. Maybe have &quot;Wikijunior&quot; for American English and &quot;Wikikids&quot; (for example) for British English? I'd happily help &quot;translate&quot; any American English into British English, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 22:13, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

:I've given some of this some thought since the failed Brazilian Portuguese Wikipedia was proposed.  I sort of put the nail into the coffin of that proposal by comparing Brazilian Portuguese with European Portuguese as compared to American vs. British English.  If you look at the Chinese Wikipedia pages, there is a special tab at the top of the page (with edit, history, etc.) that points to Simplified vs. Traditional Chinese spelling as varients of the Chinese language.  I'm curious if there might not be something similar that could be done for the two variations of English?  See [[:zh:Wikijunior]] for an example of this and especially note the last two tabs (when not logged in as a registered user).

:The problem with doing something like this is that it goes beyond just Wikijunior but instead requires a change to the whole of Wikibooks and this Wiki.  I don't know all of the details for these variants, but it is something to at least think about and perhaps bring up at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]].  

:As far as what variation to use for now, I would say for now not to sweat the details.  Different authors have different writing styles anyway, and the dielectal variation of the language is just one of the differences you can note in writing style.  I guess it matters if you want to be a grammar Nazi.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:40, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

I don't think it requires as fundamental a change as you suggest. I believe it is important for children's books to be written in the form of standard English the child will/should be used to. At age ranges above Wikijunior we have (mostly in development) for English children, titles such as &quot;GCSE History&quot; (GCSE being the exams sat at age 16), &quot;A Level History&quot; (A-Levels being the exams sat at age 18), and then we go to undergraduate and adult texts. There are/should be equivalents for those studying for exams at age 16 and 18 in other countries. These texts no doubt will follow the form of standard English prevalent in that country anyway. Which leaves us with adult books - and by the time someone is reading adult books they should be more ok with reading texts in a different form of standard English. It's only really at a younger, pre-exam stage that I see this as an issue. Incidentally, you will note that many popular books have different versions - for instance, there is an American English version of the Harry Potter books, which were, of course, written in British English, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:38, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:I know this is a delay in response here.  I am appalled that the Harry Potter books have a seperate American English version distinct from the traditional English of J.K. Rowling.  I wish that was discussed and debated much more, and I guess I havn't noticed before.  The main difference I thought was only on the title of the first Harry Potter book, which in Britian was &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;, America &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;.  I think Philosopher's Stone has much more meaning but that is a seperate argument.  I know Tolkein books have not had this happen (aka the Hobbit... clearly a children's book), nor has C. S. Lewis had his Narnia books translated into American English.  In all but when you are trying to teach basic grammar with a limited set of basic words would I consider this to be important, as most children can understand words like colour and color with no problem understanding what they mean.  Only words that are quite different like bonnet and hood (on an automobile) would cause some real confusion, and even then the fact that there are dilectical differences was actually something brought up by my teachers when I was growing up.  This only affects just a few words out of most of the content that is written anyway.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:33, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

== Doubt ==

Hello! I find Wikijunior very interesting but I wanted to ask a doubt. Suppose if I'm suggesting a new title, can we start working on it before it is chosen as &quot;Wikijunior: New Book Of The Quarter&quot;. Please advice with information. --Mastermind 007 13:04, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:Mastermind, that's effectively what I'm doing with [[Wikijunior Kings and Queens of England]]. I don't think that setting out alone is really the problem - the problem is that books tend to have very limited value until they are 100% (or very close to 100%) complete, and people on wikibooks tend to start books that never even get 10% or 20% complete. The &quot;New Book Of The Quarter&quot; was, I understand, started so that efforts could be concentrated on one book that would be seen through to completion. As long as you are committed to completing your project, there should be no problem with you doing your own Wikijunior book. What subject do you have in mind? Is it focused and is it likely to appeal to a wide readership? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:30, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== ''Non Canonical Books'' for Wikijunior ==

On the front page of the main Wikijunior page, two new Wikijunior books were added that I will confess do have a limited amount of content in them.  You can read a comment about this I made for [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions#Wikijunior Kings and Queens of England]], and I will admit that this is an unofficial policy.  Some other Wikijunior contributors in the past have instantly reverted any changes like this where new books were added to the main Wikijunior page.

This whole process of doing a [[Wikijunior:New Book of the Quarter]] vote was to allow a forum to expand the number of Wikijunior books, but keep the philosophy of slow growth and concentrating on just a few titles at a time.  We are now at a crossroads on this philosophy (it isn't a policy, and I'm admitting it here) where now several new Wikijunior books have been created outside of this process of holding a vote for a new book.

The question I propose is:  Should the '''New Book of the Quarter''' process become official policy?  What sort of penalties should happen to content that is developed outside of this process?  Do we simply open up Wikijunior as a free-for-all and allow anybody to start writing any content they please, simply with Wikijunior as the &quot;Children's corner&quot; of Wikibooks?

I'm not ready to have a formal vote yet on this topic, but I would like to get some feedback from the usual Wikijunior contributors.  I'm sure there are a number of opinions on this matter, and some pure Wikists feel that anybody should be free to add any content anywhere they like, barring blatant vandalism.  Perhaps one approach is to come up with a formal Wikijunior policy on this matter, and get user input on it.  I do think that we can be a bit more creative here, and that doesn't have to be the only option.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:21, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

: I do not understand the situation. If there was some problem with creating new &quot;Wikijunior&quot; books, I would just tell users to create the books without using the (possibly worthless) &quot;Wikijunior&quot; name. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:14, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:: Largely I would have to agree.  I set up the current process of &quot;allowing&quot; new Wikijunior books as a compromise from a few of the original Wikijunior contributors who actively went out and deleted new Wikijunior proposals and reverted additions on this main Wikijunior page.  That is precisely the point that you simply could add new children's books elsewhere, and perhaps it should be simply opened up as a free for all.&lt;p&gt;Before that happens, I am suggesting that perhaps you could change your mindset a little bit here and notice the benefits of having a bunch of people working together at trying to improve a common sub-set of content before creating new content.  Notice especially the [[meta:Wikijunior project first topics|early discussions at the founding of Wikijunior]] that are on Meta.  All of the Wikijunior books (except for the Ancient Civilizations book that I added myself) were created with a formal vote process.  Even the Ancient Civilization books was added due to several people trying to add content like that, and I decided to not fight the wind if there were people interested in that topic.  People like [[User:Jguk]] has gone off and created a new Wikijunior book, and since this is not policy, I don't have any reason to stop him from creating a new book like this under the umbrella of Wikijunior.  The question I bring up here is if that is indeed what should be happening, and simply open the floodgates and allow any and all Wikijunior books to be created and added to the &quot;Wikijunior&quot; bookshelf.  This also largely removes the New Book of the Quarter page as anything except as a collaboration of the Quarter effort for Wikijunior.  This is, however, a significant change over the practice on the Wikijunior pages from what occured in the past.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:50, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:Rob, I think this is a really good idea. I suspect that one of Wikibooks's weak points is a lack of focus on specific projects. You seem to have addressed that with this unofficial policy. I think Wikijunior's strong ability to find focus is one of the big secrets of its success.
:I get the idea that you have in mind to discourage the creation of new Wikijunior projects in the interest of keeping work focused on the existing ones. Avoiding having too many in-progress Junior books seems like good practice. At the same time, it might be unwise to ''completely'' prevent people who are dead set on working on their pet project from contributing. Jon seems to be doing a nice job with ''Kings and Queens'', and I'd hate to see that work discouraged because the community as a whole isn't interested in it.
:The best solution, in my opinion, might be for new books to become candidates for the &quot;canon&quot; once the community decides they want to work on it, or once the book becomes sufficiently developed that it wouldn't be a drain. These books would not appear on the Wikijunior page until they became canon. (And there might be a pastel box on the book's TOC gently encouraging contributors to work on the &quot;official&quot; books.) Given that, it might also be better to just have a &quot;Current Book&quot; rather than a &quot;Book of the Quarter&quot;, so that books that already have substantial progress can receive a little attention when they get added. --[[User:Brian Brondel|Brian Brondel]] 08:06, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

::I think the main [[Wikijunior]] page should be changed so that its emphasis is strongly on readers (and leave a comment about looking on the talk page, or another page, if you wish to contribute). The only books highlighted on the Wikijunior page should be: (i) those books that are complete; (ii) those books that are near-complete (by which I mean they are 98%-100% complete technically, have no redlinks, but need proofreading); (iii) the current Wikijunior collaboration of the quarter (which has as its aim going at least to (ii) if not to (i) in the quarter.

::That would leave all &quot;non-canonical&quot; books off the main Wikijunior page, although reference to other wikijunior books in development could be made on the collaboration pages, eg [[Talk:Wikijunior]]. Indeed, the requirement should be that all books aimed at children in the 8 to 12 year age group are wikijunior books, as that is the part of wikibooks dealing with that audience.

::Overall this approach stresses the importance of creating complete books. And it leaves two routes - (a) go down the wikijunior book of the quarter route; (b) go it alone. If you choose (b) you have the incentive that your book will get recognised as part of the wikijunior canon - but only once it has become near-complete, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:46, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:::I think this idea is good. Keep Wikijunior limited in scope for now (until we get firmly established), and continue the new title voting, but allowing people to write their own books (though perhaps not under the &quot;Wikijunior&quot; name. Then they can propose their book be added to WJ as a whole. Not exactly sure how all of that would work, but I'm just registering my opinion that we do need ''some'' limits of what can be labeled &quot;A Wikijunior Book&quot;. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:31, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:So what's the official stance? Do I have the go-ahead to create a Wikijunior book (that I feel I will be able to complete content-wise in a month or two)? Of course, I'm not talking about adding it to the main page until everything's ready to be proofread.

:Wikijunior books are in a strange position, in that they require the least amount of time to write content for compared to other Wikibooks, but will also require the most amount of correctness and eventually be the most publicized. What I think Wikijunior, as in wikijunior.org, should be is a collection of the 5000 or so top Wikipedia articles reduced to one-page each, and from that separate printed books each based on one category of that content. But I'm sure all that has been discussed before. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 11:32, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

::I say go ahead and start it and add it to the &quot;other books&quot; section at the top. Also feel free to nominate it as the development book of the quarter. Once it's ready for proofreading (but not before), move it to the '''[[Wikijunior]]''' page, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:57, 12 March 2006 (UTC)


While maintaining some quality control, especially in the area of completion, is important so that the books remain understandable and accessible to children, I think the ability to contribute needs to be more open if a significant library of quality materials is ever going to be developed. Some of my suggestions have already been mentioned by others above, but in reading this discussion it does not seem that anything has clearly been established. 

To me it is confusing as both a contributor and a parent/educator that would like my children to be able to actually use wikijunior. First, from the parent/educator perspective, the books on the front page of wikijunior do need to be complete and mostly proofread. Incomplete books are confusing to kids and are too difficult for educators to develop lessons from.  From the perspective of a contributor (or potential contributor) the current process and format of the books feels exclusionary and cursory. 

Obviously, everyone already involved in the project has intentions and efforts that should be applauded, but I think a broader scope and style of book needs to be available before educators can embrace wikijunior. Children are of course the main focus, but since these are educational books, their appeal to the educators is also of prime importance. There are many types of books used in a learning environment. I understand the original intention of the books being print published. My observation is that the books are being limited in appeal and scope by not embracing the full potential that publishing them online allows.  The books should be fully developed as online media, then if a version is to go to a print publisher, it should b distilled from the online version. Children, at least the first ones that will be turned on to wikijunior, are not technology ignorant and will expect more from an online book.

My suggestion is to encourage development of the books in wikibooks, possibly with an agreed upon standard text or tag that can be added so that one could search for all books being developed that are intended to be submitted to wikijunior. Then when a contributor feels a book is ready, it could be submitted to a vote. If a predecided upon number of positive votes is received in a predetermined time (10 votes in one month?), it is added to the main wikijunior. If it needs work, those areas are listed or fixed, and the book goes back to development until it is ready to be voted on again. That would allow anyone that wished to work on development, but still allow some community patrolled quality control of the content available on the main wikijunior page. 

In terms of target age, I realize the initial (and current) target age is 8-12, but honestly that is an difficult range to write to if each work needs to appeal to the entire 8-12 spectrum and it also excludes many children that could benefit from wikijunior. It would be better, and more useful to educators, to open up the age range to pre-K to about 13 (end of middle school). Each book should contain a notice to the age group it is geared to, maybe even have links leading to lists for specific ages. Very few 12 year-olds are going to find a book written at a level that includes 8 year-olds interesting, and many 8 year olds will find a book written for 12 year-olds too difficult.

Lastly, I think there needs to be some open-mindedness towards the style of the books. The basic template that is here is good, but some people may wish to be more creative or have material that needs a different style. For example I have unit studies, written for children to use mainly on their own (or under the direction of a teacher), but written to them, that would not fit the current template. I believe they would make excellent contributions to wikijunior and benefit from community contribution, but I would hate to see them shelved due to a style difference. Any non-fiction, non-pov, work intended for educational purposes geared toward children should, IMHO, be allowed.

I have a 9yo boy. He reads well above average, but he still has the likes, dislikes and attention span of a 9yo boy. He looked over the current wikijunior offerings. His opinion was that they were &quot;OK. A good idea, but nothing new. Most of the information is too basic. The unfinished stuff was confusing. Not books he would bother reading normally.&quot; His favorite was, by far, the solar system book (no surprise since he is an astronomy buff). He did say all the notices made it very confusing. 


These are my suggestions, not many know me here yet, but hopefully you will take the time to consider them. 
[[User:Starchildmom|Starchildmom]] 03:51, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

:Keep in mind that Wikijunior even from the very initial steps restricted development to just a few titles.  The point here was mainly to keep what few users there were participating with content development working together on the same tasks.  Wikibooks has more of the go it alone and build on whatever topic you would like to have.  It has certainly added significant diversity in terms of the variety of topics covered, but Wikibooks suffers right now from many book stubs that don't seem to really go anywhere.  A few books are in active development with some dedicated groups, but most Wikibooks just sit and languish, waiting for somebody else to come along and rework the content into something perhaps more usable.

:I would also like to point out that the Wikijunior Solar System book is like a draft copy that is covered with post-it notes and scribbles between the editors and the author.  They are all eventually going to go, but it looks messy at the moment due to the fact that some significant effort has gone into cleaning up the content.  More importantly, the language that was in that content earlier really was too complicated for the target ages we were seeking, like you 9-year-old son you are talking about.  BTW, did you show your son some of the [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs]] content?

:There is a proposal out there right now to turn the website http://wikijunior.org/ into read-only version of completed Wikijunior content.  I think this is an excellent idea precisely for the reasons you mentioned above, but I'm not entirely sure what content ought to be there at the moment.  The rules for &quot;publication&quot; of Wikijunior content still need to be worked out.  If you are serious about trying to work on this proposal, I would like to perhaps organize the effort.  A critical feature, however, is to clearly identify what content should be added first to this &quot;public&quot; site, including multi-lingual content.  So far I don't think anything currently under development is quite ready for professional critical review, but the two books that are closest are [[Wikijunior Solar System]] and [[Wikijunior Big Cats]].  Both of these BTW are the oldest of the Wikijunior cannon and have had the longest time to develop the content.  

:More important than anything else, we simply need people willing to contribute to this content and help us not only clean it up, but be willing to develop Wikijunior as a whole.  This is an all-volunteer community here, and we move as fast or as slow as the volunteers are willing to put in the effort.  It also takes leadership and the ability to convince other people that perhaps the community should go in the direction you are proposing... just as I'm trying to do here with this discussion.  There certainly are many things that Wikijunior could be, but it is going to take quite a bit of effort from many individuals, not just one person.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:53, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

::I am absolutely willing to put in generous amount of time and effort, and to participate in the proposal development. I have been working on projects on my own. Trying to get them into my local community and the online homeschool communities I participate in. If I had found Wikijunior earlier, my efforts would have been focused here. Now that I have found it, I hope posting my ideas and questions may spawn some new activity from others. I have projects currently in progress with deadlines looming in the next week(because they need to be used by homeschoolers waiting for them), although both will be suited to Wikijunior when finished, in my opinion. I will add the current Wikijunior books next on my list. I have a couple of question on how to progress in the [[Wikijunior Solar System]] book, but I will take those over to that book's talk. 

::I have sent my son a link to the dinosaurs book. He has just glanced at it so far. His opinions, to this point, are not exactly positive. Although, I think he is being too critical. Dinos are a difficult topic to take on. Not becuase of the volume of information possible, but because most kids already know more about dinosaurs than the adults writing the books imagine. I have yet to meet a child under 12 that could not give encyclopedic information on at least their favorite dinosaur. One very valid comment he had, was that the adults working in the project needed to be careful not to talk down to the child-readers in the attempt to make the language child-friendly.

::I have some ideas on ways to help determine content, but I need to flesh them out a bit more in my own mind. Essentially, I was thinking some sort of scope and sequence guidelines that potential contributors could reference. I have something on my hard drive already, but it needs to be made more non-educator friendly.[[User:Starchildmom|Starchildmom]] 23:38, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

:It appears to have been [[User:Munchkinguy]] who added this, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:41, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

I sent a notice to Foundation-l simply because I thought that some input from the WMF board was in order.  I was not expecting this link to be removed immediately, and I fail to see what the problem is here as there simply is no policy of any kind to deal with this sort of link.  Wikibooks does allow links to commercial websites, so I fail to see what policy has been violated here in this regard.

As far as doing this in the name of the Foundation, I think it is a misunderstanding of the role of the WMF and its copyright claim over Wikimedia content.  But I don't know if the WMF has a copyright claim or not.  I hope this book has raised awareness of the issue, and I think it is entirely reasonable to be able to offer for sale Wikijunior content like this.  I don't know if Lulu Press is the best place for something like this, but we can come up with many different options if necessary.  I do want to see printed versions of Wikibooks content be made available, and would like to see them made available to readers of Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:40, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

== New portal page ==
I've created a mockup of a new look front page at [[Portal:Wikijunior]]. I truly don't have any idea what I'm doing and may have put the page in the wrong place or done some other terrible thing. I ask for forgivness in advance. Any feedback would be very much appreciated. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 18:41, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

== Is it ok to do this? ==
I've been adding content to [[Geometry for elementary school|Geometry for Elementary School]].  I added illustrations and diagrams to some sections.  I'm also trying to simplify the language of some of the constructions and proofs.  I'm new to wikibooks, so it's likely that I haven't observed proper etiquette.  Sorry if that's the case.  In particular, I hope my &quot;go it alone&quot; approach hasn't annoyed anyone.

Would it be more appropriate for me to stop editing Geometry until more people become involved? If that's the case, I'll leave it alone and maybe contribute to another more popular book.
Otherwise, should I add the title to the &quot;under development&quot; section at the top of the page? I'd like to hear what people think. (I left some notes detailing my progress on the [[Talk:Geometry for elementary school|discussion page]] if anyone's interested)

== New Section ==

How about we add a section to each Wikijunior book called something like &quot;Fun Page&quot; for riddles, crossword puzzles, etc. to provide an amusing way for kids to review what they read? --[[User:Gray Porpoise|Gray Porpoise]] 21:30, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

:Note that Wikijunior is still loosly governed by [[WB:WIW]] by official policy.  Any attempt to go beyond the mission of Wikibooks can and should be addressed on [[meta:Proposals for new projects]].  Having fun pages like this can be difficult to regulate and is currently an issue that has caused some problems, particularly with the removal of [[Jokebook]] and some resistance to [[Puzzles]] that has suggested that Wikibook may have to be deleted some time in the future as well.  As for putting some games and stuff into existing Wikibooks that would enhance the learning process of trying to study the content of the book, I would generally be supportive of the concept in a cautious manner, but it is going to take a little more work than you think.  Let's see an example first and I'll try to add some comments.  BTW, [[Wikijunior Big Cats]] would be a good place to start, as that book is almost complete and is even &quot;published&quot;, but could use some more interactive content for kids rather than being a reference book.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:41, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

:: Why would [[WB:WIW]] apply to Wikijunior? Wikijunior projects/collections/things are not designed to be books, but collections of articles on a related subject (a macropedia, which violates [[WB:WIW]]). Wikijunior has its own official policy on meta. A &quot;Fun Page&quot; would probably violate the letter of that policy, but abides by the spirit of Wikijunior. I would first ask on the meta project page just to be safe, but this sounds like a great idea that should be part of all Wikijunior projects, in my opinion. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 20:53, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
:::This has been kind of the sticking point about the whole Wikijunior project from the beginning.  It was created out of whole cloth and in many ways was intended to be an independent project, but clearly didn't have the user support basis to be independent and instead was dumped onto Wikibooks.  This really weird dual relationship has plagued the project even from the start, and even the project &quot;founders&quot; aren't particularly clear as to why this belonged on Wikibooks instead of being created as a new project proposal on Meta and go through the whole new project process (where the New Project policy had already been established at the time).  It is claimed to be both a Wikimedia Foundation project with independent funding, and just another ordinary Wikibook at the same time.
:::I actually fought against this use of Wikibooks at the time Wikijunior was created, but I was still fairly new to Wikimedia projects at the time and couldn't prevail.  Instead, I've tried to encourage independent development of this, and have made some major contributions to the content.  If I started a VfD of Wikijunior now, I'm sure it would be met with huge resistance even though as you have pointed out, it already violates Wikibooks policies even in its current format.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:49, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

I was thinking that for the dinosaurs Wikijunior issue, there could be something along the lines of, &quot;Match each dinosaur to what its name means&quot;, with images of dinosaurs and their names in one column and English translations in the other column. --[[User:Gray Porpoise|Gray Porpoise]] 01:06, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

== More Accessible Format for Kids == 
Is there a discussion anywhere related to what can be done to make the web content of wikijunior more accessible and interesting for kids? For instance, changing the skin to include larger fonts, adding more pictures, making better captions for pictures that are there, reducing the clutter of navigation links on the screen, and using hyperlinking to make the content more discoverable? --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 19:18, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
:This is an interesting problem.  Currently, this page ([[Wikijunior]]) is set up to deal with content organizers and contributors as opposed to dealing with kids directly.  And I'll be the first to admit that this website certainly isn't kid friendly.

:A proposal to try and set up some other website was made a little while ago to be more a public place for kids to read the content was suggested.  How this would be done, and if it would be running with MediaWiki software or something else certainly has not been very clear from previous discussions.  One of the &quot;cool&quot; things about Wikipedia and her sister projects (including Wikibooks) is that people who are reading the content have the option of being able to edit it and &quot;fix&quot; problems they may see, including adding new content that was not there before.  Or updating information as new discoveries in science change information about the topic (quite common with the [[Wikijunior Solar System]], for instance).  A &quot;read-only&quot; website might have the advantage of protecting kids from flagrant vandals, but we would have to come up with a system that allows &quot;trusted users&quot; to be able to update the content from time to time.

:Creating the skin is an idea, but as a &quot;default&quot; appearance to Wikijunior, that would require this project to be moved to a different domain and possibly a completely different wiki, such as is currently happening with [[Wikiversity]].  Some attempts to do this have been made, but the Wikimedia Foundation has been very relutant to create a new Wikimedia sister project in the past.  Wikijunior does enjoy widespread support from many people, and there would be some significant measure of support if serious efforts were made to do this.

:As far as adding more pictures and better captions, you are certainly free to help out and make those changes.  Wikijunior pages tend to be very image intense anyway compared to other Wikimedia projects, but there certainly is room for improvement.  This is how all of the content on the Wikijunior pages was created:  Somebody came here reading about it and decided to start adding some additional information.  In fact, the original people who have proposed this project have done very little editing on it.  Most of the work was done by very ordinary people who saw a problem and decided to do something about it.  Please help us out and try to fix those weak areas that you might have some expertise in.

:One of the problems we are facing is finding good public domain or otherwise free resources that we can use to add to these projects, as paying royalties for images is not something we are equiped to deal with.  And we are also trying to do more than simply make a web page, but also make paper-publishable content as well, so I can't emphasis enough that images and other content must be made freely available and used under terms that are compatable with the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]].  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:58, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
::After reading your comments I suggest that the books be published in a static version on a different site. Readers should be invited to contribute on the static pages, but the edit page link would take them here, other &quot;business&quot; links such as the side and top navigation would be unneccessary to include on the &quot;kid ready&quot; site. Updating from the live wiki to the static site would be a second step. It seems like the static site should be skinnable and different skins could be used for different books. 

::Regarding photos, I'm happy to help where I have competence, it's hard for me to wrap my mind around the legal issues. It seems to me that publications goals should include general standards for illustrations (as they do for language and factualness.) In my view, the selection, captioning, and frequency of photos and illustrations should also be reviewed before publication if this is to be a resource that is effectively geared towards kids. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 00:27, 25 August 2006 (UTC)







== Main problems == 

I've been going through some of these pages, and here are some of my thoughts on what the big problems are over many of the pages. As having been a kid myself (granted, the target audience was about half a lifetime ago for me), I have just about two cents to add to this.

First of all, '''new vocabulary''' should be kept at a '''minimum'''. You don't want to hit a kid with too much '''jargon''', and any other word choices should also be '''simple'''. This should be obvious, but are vocabulary gets rather heavy; take the Chinese page for the Languages of the World book. Some of that vocabulary is the same that you'd introduce to college-level students. As a whole on Wikijunior, we must find other, simpler ways to give these ideas. 

'''Tying the pages together as an actual book is problematic.''' Each page reads nicely as an article on its own, but there are two problems that some of these books fall into on reading it page by page. First, '''inconsistency in format'''. Though many are based on the same basic questions on each page and tie it together like that, on some pages I have found some authors prefer to put bullets in the same subsection another author finds that prose is best. And in my opinion, prose is best. A list is good at summing stuff up, but in most situations, the best thing for these kids would be to sum it up in sentences so that it's actually interesting to read. '''Another problem with tying stuff together is repitition. More often than not, many of the pages will repeat the same information.''' For example, many cats are nocturnal, which means active at night. You only need to explain what nocturnal means on the first page you mention the word nocturnal, and it doesn't have to be explained again. This will help the book feel more connected and unitary, rather than a random mess of related articles compiled in the same cover for convenience.

'''Introductory stuff''' doesn't seem as good as it could be. For example, on the Wikibook for the Solar System, there is a short discussion of each type of object in the introduction, the sun, the moon, the planets, etc. '''An intro should be concise and should not mention facts that you are going to present later.''' Rather than listing all of the objects and introducing their characteristics, it would be best to stick with just saying these objects exist; in the next 47 pages you're going to tell what they are anyway, so no need to waste words in the beginning saying this stuff and repeating yourself later. In the Solar System example, it would be good to just leave it at something like &quot;The Solar System contains the sun, the planets, moons, and some other objects&quot; or something like that. A kid's book isn't a thesis paper; in some cases you can even dive right into the information without that introduction and thesis and they'll still learn something new. The extreme example is an ABC book where they give a picture and a word or words. I remember a very nice Dinosaur ABC book from when I was a kid, and, you guessed it, the first page says &quot;A&quot; and a dinosaur name and description, not, &quot;In this book we're going to talk about 26 different dinosaurs that all begin with a different letter of the alphabet.&quot; 

When I was a kid, the introduction section always bored me; I still often skip that section as it rarely holds actual, good information. Sometimes the intro gives a nice, fun story, but not the meaty stuff that's going to teach any factual material. That's because they save it for the rest of the book. We don't need to waste pages or ink; an intro should be reduced to one page at most. The exception to this is if your introduction is giving general information that applies to all of the subpages (ie. Cats are all from the family Felidae, Dinosaurs lived from ____ to ____) and the book doesn't have a page to deal with general information on all the subpages (in my opinion, though, a general page is the best way to go so you can separate this from the introduction). My attack on the introduction's informative material talks about when we're getting repetitive and talking about stuff in the introduction that is also, or should be, in a subpage.

'''Also, there is never a need to tell someone to keep reading.''' That just puts more words where the kid could just continue merrily reading without interruption.

'''Format trouble'''. For some of the books, such as the Big Cats book, there is great difficulty in reducing it's length when given the strict skeleton that authors must build off of, which seems to be the way Wikijunior is organized. On some of the less important topic, the book may merely contain one paragraph about the idea. That's a kid's book for you; they're not meant to be extremely in depth. '''In fact, many books I have read will talk about the distinguishing characteristics of a topic, rather than everything about it.''' For example, me and my friend both live in Delaware, go to the University, both like to play video games, blah blah blah; however, when I say that in the future I plan to be a marine biologist and my friend plans on a career in making video games, then you get something interesting, right? '''What makes the particular subject different is important; entire (children's) books have been written only giving distinguishing charateristics rather than complete profiles.''' In the limited space we have, this is a consideration, especially for less important topics. This is an important topic to consider; you can find a book talking about only Tigers, so making a single book that covers more topics invariably means that some information is that one book is going to say something the other doesn't.

'''Conversely, a lot of the information between pages overlaps or nearly overlaps. This can be solved simply: Consolidate by giving an entirely new page.''' This also allows you to expound on the information if necessary. For example, instead of saying on every page that a cat species can have about x number of kittens or we still need to find out what colors a dinosaur was, you create a new page on how MOST cats have about x to y number of offspring or how we don't know the color of ANY dinosaur and why. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, but this goes back to my distinguishing characteristics point. For example, if one cat can have up to 9 offspring in a litter, that's a distinguishing characteristic if the rest of them have up to about 4; you could then put this information as an exception. But you see how this saves space and still teaches about the same information? But really, do we have to put on every page that we have no idea what a dinosaur looks like? Rather than saying that, you could have a section in the book talking about stuff that fossils do not tell us, such as skin color and certain behaviors, and then use that extra space for something more appealing.

'''In some cases, it turns out that some of the questions asked in each article have answers that can be generalized or overlap.''' By combining the sentences in another section for these questions, this allows the use of fewer words and consolidating information. It adds some flexibility in the way a page can be written, too. Also, by reducing sections we can arrange the page in more interesting ways. Remember those Eyewitness books? Most of their headings were only on each (pair) of pages, to introduce the topic. Then a paragraph. THEN PICTURES EVERYWHERE, and the information given in captions. This is an extreme example, but '''the format we have now is quite restrictive. It forces us to include information that may be less important or interesting (how many kittens does this cat have? oh, it's about the same as the next) when we could put something else instead and consolidate it some other way.''' I understand that the question with headings is the basic format of Wikibooks, but when a question only gets a one sentence answer, we may have to rethink the format. We should find which questions have answers that can be generalized over many subjects be dealt with differently so we don't repeat ourselves.

My last note is on '''reading level'''. There's a lot of worrying about reading level. Part of this is very much tied to vocabulary which I talked about earlier, and another is on length, which I try to deal with by talking about the format. '''Yes, reading level is extremely important, and in a number of pages the mark was missed completely. But the other point is that reading level should also be taken with a grain of salt.''' The average kid I've ever met when I was a kid usually scored higher on the reading level test than their grade level. According to those reading level tests, I've been Reading Level of Grade 10 to 13 (based on various maximum scores) since at most about 6th grade or something like that. And in those years we weren't split up into higher levels or anything, so I think I was getting a pretty good, representative sample; granted, I wasn't doing a statistical survey, but whenever I asked anyone how they did on their reading level tests, the idea was always that the test was relatively simple. '''Point is, reading level is not an extremely accurate scale.'''

For the kids that are smarter, the best thing to do would be to point them to other resources that better suit them; when I was a kid, I often read large, nonfiction books aimed at the layman (the adult layman). '''My point here is we may say we want to aim for a specific age group, but really age is not exactly the best qualifier for the difficulty of reading level they can handle.'''

Sorry about that huge post. It may have been a little convoluted, but hopefully you guys get some of my points.

:Because this is a huge post, I don't think I'm going to do a point by point reply but instead simply do a general reply.  I want to thank you for coming along and at least giving Wikijunior a serious review and pointing out that yes, there are some significant flaws to the current approach that we are doing right now.

:One point in particular I feel like addressing is the concept of target age level.  Unfortunately, there is a perception that this is largely Wikipedia II, which was never really the intention of Wikijunior.  This is meant to be a project that would be written specifically for children and to do topics that would appeal to them.  The problem here is how do you address the issue of determining exactly what is the age level for a given paragraph or sentance, and how do you &quot;drop&quot; the age level if it appears as though that section is a little bit high?  Mind you, this is a problem that appears with all children's literature, and Wikijunior is not alone here.

:One way that this is done is to significantly limit vocabulary.  [[w:Dr. Seuss|Theodor Geisel]] (aka Dr. Seuss} and other similar writers dealt with this by starting out with a very limited set of words and only expanded that list when it helped make the book flow.  Explicit unique word counts are very commonly quoted by publishers to demonstrate their quality as children's literature.  I've even seen explicit references to word frequency charts that attempt take a given body of English language literature (not always defined) and determine the frequency of usage to determine commonly used words, and then explictly restrict children's books to just those words that appear in the top 1000 words, for instance.

:Another approach is to use some mathmatical forumla that essentially considers a word to be simple or child-friendly if it has very few letters, or that words with many letters to be something to avoid when writing for children.  This approach was used with [[Wikijunior Solar System]] to try and simplify the language, but at some places the simplification came at the cost of watering the content down so much that important details were lost or even the basic meaning of some sections were changed completely to be nearly the opposite of what was originally written.

:I don't know what approach or if several can and should be used, but yes, this is a problem.

:This is a collaborative effort, and frankly we are still at what I would consider some of the early stages of trying to put this whole thing together.  It is also very easy to get those individuals who are interested in developing Wikijunior content to become quickly overwhelmed by the tasks that need to be accomplished.  For this, I would simply recommend that you do what you can, and try to help out with as much or as little time as you have available.  This is a Wiki, which gives you the ability to change just about everything if you have the patience to try and make positive contributions.  I don't know of a single area of Wikijunior or even a single &quot;article&quot; that is completely polished and couldn't use at least a little bit of work.

:What you currently see with the Wikijunior pages represents the work of nearly a couple dozen substantially committed individuals and close to 100 different major contributors and a couple thousand additional people who passed by and made some minor change that as a whole add up to some substantial contributions as well.  I hope that you will add your own little bit to this effort and help make Wikijunior into something that can be a positive contribution to the world.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:15, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

::I generally agree, MiltonT. There are definitely opportunities for improvement in every article. Some of the things you mention have also bothered me. I have put together a rough draft of a [[Wikijunior:Style_Guide|style guide]]. All are welcome to add, subtract, amend, annotate or otherwise contribute. I wasn't going to actually put it up until I'd hammered on it a little more but your post inspired me to do so. Like Robert Horning, I hope you decide to contribute content to the books. Also, we'll be launching a new book in a few days so there are lots of opportunities to contribute. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 00:56, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

:The point about trying to adjust reading level more systematically is very intriguing. I looked online, finding what I think to be a good resource to use to determine what are some good words to use.

: This http://www.wordcount.org/main.php is a list of several thousand English words. This is a useful tool to consider if a word is common enough to use in this book. The problem arises in knowing where the cutoff point is. Also, I believe that one system alone for reducing difficulty will not do the job. Common words are not always easier words, and vice versa.

::I have used http://www.online-utility.org/english/simple_basic_helper.jsp . I put the text through the 9300 filter and then anything that is not recognized I consider rephrasing, defining in context, or omitting. I also use http://literacynews.com/readability/readability_analyses.php to get an idea of grade levels.--[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 19:52, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

(Many people use the Fleisch-Kincaid scale because it is built into MS Word and other tools, but the scale is actually designed for technical documentation.)

Is this official policy?  Seems a little beurocratic to me and frightening to newbies.  Can someone explain this please. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 23:52, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

:Wikijunior has had a long standing tradition since the project was started that we wanted to do a slow and gradual growth of the project.  Indeed, when Wikijunior was started, content was restricted to the original three Wikijunior books:  Solar System, Big Cats, and South America.  There was an intention to proceed and add additional books at a later date, but the point here was to strongly encourage people to participate in the current books and bring them up to a very high quality rather than trying to be all things to all people.  Keep in mind that for the most part this has succeeded.  Almost all of the current Wikijunior books that are on the main page (with the exception of the Wikijunior Europe book you just added) all have major sections that are nearly finished, and certainly have content that is worth having kids browse through just for reference material alone.

:I started the &quot;Book of the Quarter&quot; system to help allow a gradual growth of Wikijunior, as there were additional topics that many of the Wikijunior participants wanted to cover.  There is some wisdom to this philosophy, as Wikijunior has enjoyed several of its titles to become &quot;Book of the Month&quot; for the main Wikibooks project.  This should be encouraged and expanded.

:What appears on the main Wikijunior page ought to be either those project that have won the distinction of going through the process of the new book of the quarter, or are substantially complete.  Wikijunior Europe has done neither.

:As far as official policy, no there isn't really an official policy other than this is something that has been a bit of a tradition for Wikijunior participants.  Yes, this does make it a bit bureaucratic, but it is also a very transparent process where the decisions are made by the Wikijunior participants at large.

:I will also try to have you look at [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical classification]] (still not a complete list) and pick random Wikibooks.  Far too many of them are mere stubs.  This whole system is explicitly designed to keep that from happening, which has also been a major criticism of Wikibooks in general.  I would urge caution to try and do a major reformation of this system until after you have spent some time developing Wikijunior content and have seen what benefits it does bring.  I have also seen very few books get out right rejected in this process, but it has also kept books like [[Wikijunior Terrorism]] from being started that might be a tad bit controvercial.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:07, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for your reply (and sorry about my short reply but it's late and I'm tired).  I've removed my title from the main list on Wikijunior as I understand your policy now.  I will continue editing my title and any help from anyone is much appreciated.  I still think your policy might frighten many potential writers away but I do understand your points about half-finished books.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] 00:30, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

I've added [[Wikijunior Europe]] to the list of non-canonical books at the top of this page. I'd like to move them to a more visible place, but I haven't really thought about where that would be. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 01:30, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for your help guys and to others across Wikibooks.  I've started developing a few of the sections.  Any help with adding new information, checking for mistakes etc is much appreciated.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] 22:29, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

==Wikijunior South America== 
There is an interesting coincidence with the creation of Wikijunior Europe. Last night I left a message on the [[Talk:Wikijunior_South_America#Revitalizing_Wikijunior_South_America|Wikijunior South America talk page]] proposing a major reworking of the South America book. I proposed changing the questions to try and orient the book more towards the kinds of information kids are interested in. Comments most welcome. I hope that this idea seems like a good one to other people as well. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 01:30, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

==Seperated Website==

Maybe Wikijunior could be made into a seperate wiki. I am a student and I also am a very new member at wikibooks (at wikipedia, not so much). I don't really know how to navigate, but If there was a seperate wikijunior, I bet it could be like the simple english language. Thanks, [[User:RyGuy|RyGuy]] 18:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:This is an interesting suggestion, and something that is valid.  BTW, you might want to check out the URL http://www.wikijunior.org/

:To note, that URL goes right to the en.wikibooks page on Wikijunior, in anticipation that at some point in the future it would become a completely seperate Wikimedia project.

:There was an effort about a year ago to do exactly what you are suggesting.  The problem with the proposal was that from my perspective that it wasn't really thought through all that well, and there were some very significant questions that needed to ben answered.  Rather than trying to revise the proposal to become more complete, it turned into an all-out on-line debate over the merits of the idea in the first place and showed that there might be some opposition.

:At this point, if we want to create a seperate website, I would recommend that we submit a formal proposal to the special projects committee of the WMF that goes into some depth about what would be accomplished, and why these new activities related to Wikijunior would not be appropriate to Wikibooks (to distinguish the two projects).  There are some, including the Wikibooks project founder Karl Wick, who don't think that there is any pressing need to make this happen.

:Another variant of the proposal is to do something like the Wikipedia 1.0 group, but related to Wikijunior.  Once we have identified some pages that are up to a very high quality level, we would be able to move the content to a &quot;published&quot; website that would be intended more for children's access and be just Wikijunior content.  While I think this would be an excellent idea on many levels, it would require organizing some Wikijunior editors and setting up some hard policies over what would be allowed and not allowed on the site.

:These are just some thoughts, and certainly other ideas can be discussed here as well.  I've been involved with the transition for Wikiversity becoming a seperate website from Wikibooks, so I do have a bit of an idea over what is needed to get this accomplished.  While technically it isn't that challenging, there is quite a bit more work that would have to be done to get this going.  How we would handle the multi-lingual aspects would also be interesting as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:20, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

I believe this book is mature enough to be linked directly from the front page of Wikijunior. I'd like a to initiate a strawpole on the subject to see if there is consensus. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:32, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

==[[Wikijunior Animal Alphabet]]==
I linked this book on the front page because it was substantially filled out with content and thought it was useful to do so. In hindsight this may have been overly bold. There is a [[User_talk:Xixtas#Regarding_Animal_Alphabet|related discussion on my talk page]]. However I still believe that the content is mature enough and that the subject is within the bounds of what a Wikijunior book should be. I'd like to create a straw pole on this book as well to see if there is consensus that this book should be added. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 14:12, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

::*{{Question}} -- I wonder if there's someplace on meta where we should mention that we would like to expand the scope of wikijunior? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 23:09, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
:::*{{Comment}} -- I couldn't find a page to formally discuss this issue, but the impression I received from recent discussions with you was that, Wikijunior is quite unstable and its objective could be changed irrespective of awareness. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 20:41, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
::::*{{comment}} -- After some thought, I think the best way to move forward is to start a page [[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:What is Wikijunior]] and discuss not only age ranges, but other issues of scope there. Once we have that hammered out in rough form, we can send a message out to textbook-l and leave notification on meta. I really don't want to get slapped down without having done our best to work within the system. I still truly believe that almost nobody at Wikimedia cares what happens to Wikijunior. But that could change in the future especially if there's money involved. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 17:37, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

::::* I've started the page and included the age range of &quot;birth to 12&quot; comments would be appreciated. I've also linked to it on Meta, and as soon as there is consensus here on what Wikijunior is, I'll include that on the project page on Meta. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 21:15, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

== Has anyone heard of &quot;Its Just a Plant&quot;? ==

It's a picture book about a girl and her two parents as she learns about marijuana- and why people use it, why it's illegal, and why she shouldn't use it- but all the information is presented in a non-biased, non-fear mongering, and factually sound manner. I was just wondering if there could be a responsible book written on Cannibis that shows both its benifits and dangers, yet clearly outlines why children should not use it. I don't know if there is some POV policy for Wikibooks, and if so, if this would violate it, but it would be a very beneficial project.

== Basic word list ==

Would we be undermining children's intelligence if we were to adhere to the [http://simple.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Basic_English_alphabetical_wordlist basic english word list]?

Yes: Why?

No: Should we adopt this as a policy?
--[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 22:44, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

:The 850 word list was designed to be version of English that non-native English speakers could easily learn. It would be impossible to use it to explain something like how a person's lungs work because the words lung and diaphragm are not on the list. I do think it's a good idea to use a limited vocabulary of between 5000 and 10,000 words and define words that are not on that list in context. 

:For instance using the tool at http://www.online-utility.org/ with the ''9300'' filter on I ran the article from [[Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations/Hebrews]] (just a Wikijunior module selected at random) through and excluding proper nouns, the following is the list of unrecognized words: 
::ancestors, behaved, captivity, cedar, chairs, chew, commandments, consonants, converting, counters, cud, described, divan, dreams, enlarged, evenings, exiled, famine, fins, garments, girdle, goddesses, headdress, homemade, hooves, interpreting, Kosher, lentils, manuscript, mats, monotheism, neighbors, niche, nomadic, olives, paintings, parchment, patriarch, plagues, polytheistic, preserving, scrolls, sheltered, skillful, slaughtered, sleeves, spreading, supervised, temples, tents, wealthier, extermination
:I think many of those words an average eight year old native English speaker would have no problem with. I think this kind of illustrates the problem of using any strict word list. Still, I do think it's useful to run articles through a tool like this to check the vocabulary. 
:Maybe we should add some of this information to the style guide. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:59, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Building Services==

===Plumbing===
You must consider condensation issues when running plumbing through straw bale walls.  Consider normal technique for plumbing adobe.

===Electrical===
It is common to simply use Romex as one would do in a normal wood frame construction.  Due to the compact nature of straw bales, there is less of a risk of fire than in traditional building with the air gaps (assuming there is plaster sealing inside and outside of walls).
per Austin, Texas, U.S.A Code:
3605.7.10 Electrical. All wiring within or on bale walls must meet all provisions of the National
Electrical Code adopted by this jurisdiction. Type NM or UF cable may be used, or wiring may
be run in metallic or non-metallic conduit systems. Electrical boxes must be securely attached to
wooden stakes driven a minimum of 12 inches into the bales, or an acceptable equivalent.

===Heating and Cooling===
(Please help write this section by pressing the edit button and adding your knowledge)

While thinking about the design of your foundations, or more specifically the foundation pad, this is the time to think about heating options. One of the options gaining popularity is in-floor radiant heating. You can read more about that in the section on heating.

== Overview ==

'''''Serpensortia''''' makes a snake appear from the end of the caster's wand. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] uses this spell against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] during a duel in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 11|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This is a major plot point, as it is the first time that Harry has had to use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]] in front of wizards, and while we have seen it before, neither he nor we understand its significance.

The various components of the musculo-skeletal apparatus interact in a coordinated fashion.  We have evolved the highly adaptive ability for upright movement through our environment  freeing the upper extremities to engage in independent activities that advance the agenda of the organism;  first and foremost to promote our own survival or the survival of our immediate family.  The upper limbs through the anatomic features of the shoulder,elbow, forearm, wrist and hand  have evolved for tool use and seemingly toward the efficient use of hand held projectiles, to affect defense and to obtain food.  

The axial skeleton and core muscle groups provide protection to our vital energy processing viscera and the avenues of communication and nutrient distribution that are represented by our,nervous, endocrine and vascular systems.  The central muscle groups anchored to the axial skeleton affect a coordination of  the whole by  overcoming momentum and enabling the fluid transfer of potentional energy to kinetic energy via the levers of our extremities in a fashion enabling force speed and accuracy in our activities.  The resultant process can be beautiful, awe inspiring or comical.

Our skeletal adaptation to bipedal locomotion was accompanied by a bowl shaped pelvis with resultant narrowing of the pelvic outlet.  This in association with enlarging brain size necessitated parturition at a relatively immature state of development to enable the passage of the fetal skull through the birth canal.  A protracted post natal dependency would logically have required mating humans to remain mutually supporting to enable division of labor to support the dependant newborn. Thus it seems our biomechanical characteristics lead to social implications from the beginning of our existence as a species.

==What is Syntax?==

Syntax is the how and why of sentence’s structured: the relationship between elements of a sentence and what those relationships encode. It’s the way a language organizes bits of meaning into representations of the world, of ideas, of situations, etc. Without syntax, there’d be no way of putting any particular meaning into sounds or symbols, and there’d be no way of getting a particular meaning out of sounds or symbols. In short, without syntax, there’s no language, just like without meaningful components there’s no language.

Some examples of word order affecting grammaticality:

:1) The dog bit the man.
:2) The dog is brown.
:3) *Man bit dog the the.
:4) *The is brown dog.

Some examples of word order affecting meaning:

:5) The man bit the dog.
:6) The dog bit the man.
:7) Is the dog brown?

[Note: An asterisk before a sentence indicates ungrammaticality. A superscript question mark before a sentence indicates questionable or unknown grammaticality, or grammaticality to only some speakers.]

Syntax generally describes two things: where certain things can go, and what those positions mean. At this level we’ll be looking at various languages and comparing the different ways languages achieve the same thing. Later, in the advanced syntax tutorial, we’ll go back and attempt to find out if it’s possible to describe all languages using the same fundamental syntactic rules and structures, and why they seem to be so very different.

Unlike the simpler approach to syntax, this tutorial will be an in-depth look at linguistic theories. Where traditional approaches just discuss things like SOV vs. SVO vs. etc. word order, or such, this tutorial will explore the underlying structures and rules that produce those word orders. In the advanced syntax tutorial we’ll see how the rules we develop shed more light on the situation, and prompt us to throw out the simplistic notion of SOV vs. SVO vs. etc. word order as being a fundamental concept in syntax.

This tutorial will with some of the preliminary concepts used in syntax, primarily with the structural components of sentences. As we’ll see by the end of the tutorial, we can account for a large number of features of languages with just this approach, but that we still miss a significant portion of what languages do in fact produce. The advanced syntax tutorial will take us into new territory, exploring a few different theories that aim to account for still more of language. Both this tutorial and the advanced syntax tutorial will be following the general structure of Andrew Carnie’s Syntax: A Generative Introduction (2nd edition), and could be considered a conlanger’s summary of that book. If you’re serious about understanding syntax from a P&amp;P perspective, that book is highly recommended.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Supply and Demand: A Model of a Competitive Market ==

This chapter will focus on &lt;b&gt;competitive markets&lt;/b&gt;, a market in which there are many buyers and sellers of the same good or service. The key feature of a competitive market is that no one individual's actions have a noticeable effect on the price at which the good or service is sold. When a market is competitive, its behavior is well described by the &lt;b&gt;supply and demand model&lt;/b&gt;. Because many markets are comparative, the supply and demand model is very useful one indeed. There are five key elements in this model:
* The &lt;i&gt;demand curve&lt;/i&gt;
* The &lt;i&gt;supply curve&lt;/i&gt;
* The set of factors that cause the demand curve to shift and the set of factors that cause the supply curve to shift.
* The &lt;i&gt;market equilibrium&lt;/i&gt;, which includes the &lt;i&gt;equilibrium price&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;equilibrium quantity&lt;/i&gt;
* The way the market equilibrium changes when the supply curve or demand curve shifts

      <text xml:space="preserve">Proposed Changes:

1.Include short description of what each Open Office components are capable of.

2.Link to each component on the OpenOffice website.

3.Update the future of OpenDocument to include more recent news updates.

4. Include portions of the OpenDocument code within the chapter as source of reference.

'''Editorial Board - Viji''':

I like all your suggestions.  Just remember to make the changes that we are making to all chapters (many will not apply to this chapter, but some like putting the learning objectives in a table will apply).

Is there an example of code or an exercise that would be appropriate for this chapter?

==Professor==
The chapter could do with some links to other sites (eg OASIS, Star Office)
Say a bit more about the zip archive as this is something interesting about OO that most people will not know about. What is it?

In class, show people how to get OO and give them a demonstration of using it with a MS Office product (eg Word), and show the XML files, etc created by OO.

A good exercise would be to get the class to create an OO document and then use XSLT to transform it.

==1. Memorize and apply 1 Corinthians 10:31 to completing this honor.==
{{Bible verse
| book = 1 Corinthians
| chapter = 10
| verse = 31
| version = NKJ
| text =
Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
}}

==2. Describe each of the following categories of Drama:==
=== a. Human Videos === 
Characterizing a song by acting it out with expression and movement. 
=== b. Worship Skits/Drama Sketches ===
Usually only about 10 minutes long or less and have a specific message.

=== c. Pantomime ===
The art of telling a story without speech. Can be one person or a group. Can also be put to music as a Human Video.
=== d. Dramatic Reading/monologue, duet, or group ===
Can be a monologue, duet or group reading using the voice to emphasize and show emotion. 
=== e. Musical/Drama ===
Usually longer than a skit. Could have different acts or scenes. Songs are added to go with the theme.

==3. Describe how each of these areas of Drama can be used to reach people for God.==
They can be used in Youth Rallies, Worships, and Youth Groups. Also, for going out to other churches, schools and youth groups as an outreach.

==4. Know the following rules for acting: ==
=== a. Never turn your back to the audience ===
=== b. Speak slow during a line and fast between the line (no dead space between characters speaking) ===
=== c. Enunciate and pronounce words clearly (unless it states differently in the stage directions) ===
=== d. No dairy products or sweets (chocolate, soda pop) before speaking lines or singing ===
=== e. Keep in character (don't laugh or smile unless stated in stage directions) ===
=== f. Stay in your space (unless stated to move in stage directions) ===
=== g. Do not block other characters from the audience ===
=== h. Use your hands and eyes ===
=== i. There is no such thing as over acting ===
=== j. Nothing blocking your mouth (gum, etc. Unless otherwise directed) ===
==5. Know and understand why the following rules for pantomiming are important. Practice these rules to a simple Bible story.==
===a. Pantomiming used as an outreach ministry should never be a guessing game. It should clearly state the theme.===
=== b. It is important to remember that in dramatic work, the thought comes first. Let your eyes respond first, then the rest of your face and head, and finally, the rest of your body. This is called motivated sequence. ===
=== c. Your actions should always be simple and clear cut. ===
=== d. Every movement and expression should always be visible. ===
=== e. There should be a reason to every gesture or movement. ===
=== f. Only one gesture or movement should be made at a time. ===
=== g. Rehearse until you have created a clear-cut characterization. ===
==6. Know the following acting terminology:==
=== a. Ad-lib ===
To make up stage business or conversation.
=== b. Backstage ===
The area behind the stage. This part of the stage is invisible to an audience.

=== c. Cross ===
The movement by an actor from one location to another onstage.
=== d. Cue ===
An action or event that is a signal for somebody to do something.
=== e. Downstage ===
The part of the stage toward the footlights.
=== f. Exit ===
To leave the stage.
=== g. Getting up in part ===
Memorizing lines.
=== h. Holding it ===
Keeping perfectly still.
=== i. Left and Right ===
Terms used to refer to the stage from the actors point of view when facing the audience.
=== j. Left Center and Right Center===
The portion of the stage just to the left or right (from the actor's point of view) of the center of the stage.
=== k. Set ===
The scenery for an act or scene.
=== l. Tempo ===
The speed with which speech and action move a play along.
=== m. Upstage ===
The area of the stage away from the footlights, toward the rear of the stage.
=== n. Upstaging ===
Improperly taking attention away from an actor who is the focus of interest.

==7. From the categories listed in #2, plan and perform two (2) from the categories of Drama in a worship setting, church, or youth group.==
==8. As a group create one drama presentation and perform it.==

==Grammar==

===&lt;u&gt;Le&lt;/u&gt; [了] as emphasizer===

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;le&lt;/u&gt; [了] as used here serves to add emphasis to the verb or adjective of the sentence. It is often seen paired with &lt;u&gt;tài&lt;/u&gt; [太] to express excessiveness.
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;

===Affirmative-negative questions===

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | A sentence can be made into a question by having both affirmative and negative options together. To answer in the affirmative, the verb or adjective is repeated. (An affirmative adjective in this case is usually preceded by &lt;u&gt;hěn&lt;/u&gt; [很] to avoid a comparative tone.) Responding in the negative is simply saying &quot;not verb&quot; or &quot;not adjective&quot;.
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + V 不 V + O?
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example:&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | Because the &lt;u&gt;bù&lt;/u&gt; in affirmative-negative questions is often said quickly, marking the tone on &lt;u&gt;bù&lt;/u&gt; is not strictly necessary in their case.
|-
|}
Q: 他是不是東尼?
:Tā shì bu shì Dōngní?
:''Is he Tony?''
A: 是。'''or''' 不是。
:Shì. '''or''' Bú shì.
:''Yes (he is).'' '''or''' ''No (he isn't).''

&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + adj. 不 adj.?
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example: &lt;br&gt;
Q:今天艾美忙不忙?
:Jīntiān Àiměi máng bù máng? 
:''Is Amy busy today?''
A: 她很忙。'''or''' 她不忙。
:Tā hěn máng. '''or''' Tā bù máng.
:''Yes, she's busy.'' '''or''' ''No, she's not busy.''

===Sentences using &lt;u&gt;yǒu&lt;/u&gt; [有]===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Yǒu&lt;/u&gt; [有] means ''to have'' and indicates possession.
|}&lt;br&gt;

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + 有 + O
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example: &lt;br&gt;
我有三節課。
:Wǒ yǒu sān jié kè.
:''I have three classes.''

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Yǒu&lt;/u&gt; is negated when preceded by &lt;u&gt;méi&lt;/u&gt; [没].
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + 没有 + O
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example: &lt;br&gt;
今天她們没有一節課。
:Jīntiān tāmen méi yǒu yì jié kè.
:''They don't have any class today.''

: Non. Use &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; to sign with your IP/name and date. I also recommend that you sign up for an account. Thanks for your help, 89.48.250.14 and Merrheim. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 23:46, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

== § /* Possessive Pronouns */ le tienne, le sienne ==

Should not 'le tienne' and 'le sienne' here be 'la tienne', 'la sienne'? Or are they irregular like that? —[[User:Auk|Auk]] 06:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

: Thanks for the lively response! Anyway, I verified the terms in a dictionary, and I've now corrected them to ''la''. —[[User:Auk|Auk]] 23:07, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

== relative order of direct &amp; indirect non-3rd-person pronouns ==

I am trying to say in French, &quot;If &lt;u&gt;he recommends you to me&lt;/u&gt;, then you shall be my friend.&quot;

Should the condition (underlined) be #1 or #2?
# s'il vous me recommande 
# s'il me vous recommande

The article gives no help here. [[French/Grammar/Pronouns#Order_rules|Order rules]] says only
:When a sentence uses the indirect object pronouns ''me'', ''te'', ''nous'', and ''vous'' with the direct object pronouns ''le'', ''la'', and ''les'', ''me'', ''te'', ''nous'', and ''vous'' go first.
:*il me le donne. - He gives it to me.

But I need to use ''me'' and ''vous'' together, ''me'' as I.O. and ''vous'' as D.O., and the article says nothing about such cases. Nor do others I've consulted. '''This needs clarification.'''

--[[User:Thnidu|Thnidu]] ([[User talk:Thnidu|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thnidu|contribs]]) 16:08, 1 December 2011 (UTC)

:According to &quot;A Comprehensive French Grammar&quot; by Glanville Price (ISBN 978-1-4051-5385-0) section 208, it is not possible to combine any two of ''me, te, se, nous or vous'' in the same sentence. He says &quot;In circumstances that might seem to require one of these impossible constructions, the direct object pronoun follows the ordinary rule but the indirect object is expressed by à (to) and a disjunctive pronoun.&quot; This would produce &quot;il vous recommande à moi&quot; based on your example. (Your complete example sentence being a conditional contruction using ''si'' may require different tenses in French, which is a separate issue unrelated to the content of this page which we need not discuss here.) I don't know if this is the kind of depth of knowledge you would expect to find in a book of this level or not. Hope this helps anyway.

Welcome to Part 1 of the Anim8or - Basics to Advanced QuickStart.  This first part of the Quickstart will show you how to model the shape of a Gingerbread man.  Many of you may be familiar with the Gingerbread man modeling from the Blender book.  This article will show you how to do exactly that with similar results, except we are going to use Anim8or, not Blender.  So go ahead and open up Anim8or and let's start.

===Creating the Body===

First off, start up the Anim8or program.  Make sure you are in front view by pressing (NUM – 5).  Also make sure you are in Object Edit mode by pressing (SHIFT – A).

We are going to draw a cube, which we will edit to form our gingerbread man.  Select the Cube draw button by pressing (SHIFT – C).  Move your mouse pointer to the workspace and click and drag the mouse to form a cube.  Next, get the Select tool (A) and double-click the cube you just drew.  Make sure the location of the cube is in the center by setting the x, y, and z parameters to 0.  Then in the Divisions, set them to 2 in each direction.  For the size, set x, y, and z to 20.  Then hit the OK button:

DFL (D Forms Library) is a Win32 windowing library designed by Christopher E. Miller for the D language.

Maybe, there will be a linux and xBSD versions as well.

Licence is unknown so far.


==Simple DFL Example==
 &lt;font color = blue&gt;import&lt;/font&gt; dfl.all;
 &lt;font color = blue&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; main()
 {
    Form myForm;
    Label myLabel;
   
    myForm = &lt;font color = blue&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; Form;
    myForm.text = &lt;font color = green&gt;&quot;DFL Example&quot;&lt;/font&gt;;
   
    myLabel = &lt;font color = blue&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; Label;
    myLabel.font = &lt;font color = blue&gt;new&lt;/font&gt; Font(&lt;font color = gray&gt;&quot;Verdana&quot;&lt;/font&gt;, 14f);
    myLabel.text = &lt;font color = green&gt;&quot;Hello, DFL World!&quot;&lt;/font&gt;;
    myLabel.location = Point(15, 15);
    myLabel.autoSize = &lt;font color = blue&gt;true&lt;/font&gt;;
    myLabel.parent = myForm;
   
    Application.run(myForm);
   
    &lt;font color = blue&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; 0;
 }

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Partial Freedom===
As long as an elephant is not [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Blockade | blockaded]], it retains a theoretical freedom to roam the board.  There are, however, fine distinctions in exactly ''how free'' a free elephant is.  A whole spectrum of positional features may limit an elephant's ability to switch its field of operation.  Extreme contraints include guarding against an imminent goal, or guarding against the capture of a [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Camel_Hostage | camel hostage]].  The range runs all the way down to minor constraints such as guarding against a rabbit being captured, or even guarding against a small positional disadvantage the opponent might create in the elephant's absence.

At the start of each game, both elephants are free, but differences in elephant mobility soon emerge.  Some observers are astonished that tiny advantages in Arimaa seem to snowball; it is easy to underestimate how a more mobile elephant can pose increasingly tricky defensive puzzles for a less mobile elephant to solve.  As the game progresses, one or both elephants tend to become more and more committed to the defense of a particular trap.  When an elephant finally can't leave a trap without its army suffering captures in that trap, that elephant has lost mobility in a clearly identifiable sense.

===Frames===
A piece which is on a trap square, surrounded on three sides by opposing pieces which prevent it from pushing its way off the trap square, has been ''framed''.  The lone friendly piece providing support is ''pinned'', because as soon as it moves, the piece on the trap square will disappear.  In the position at right,
from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=7978&amp;s=w this game], the gold elephant is pinned to the defense of the gold horse which has been framed on c6.

Pins are most effective in the opening when the board is crowded, so that strong pieces participating in the frame can be rotated out and replaced with the plentiful weaker pieces.  At right Silver can rotate the a5-horse to c5, making the silver elephant the strongest free piece.  If not enough weak pieces are available for rotation, though, the side maintaining the frame will have to commit three pieces at least as strong as the piece being framed, which may not be worthwhile on a relatively empty board.

At right the silver camel has a freedom to attack that the gold camel does not.  The silver elephant can switch wings at any time to threaten the gold camel at no cost other than giving up the frame.  In contrast, the gold elephant can't threaten the silver camel without abandoning the framed gold horse to instant capture.

A pin is not as absolute as a blockade, because the pinned piece may choose to leave at any time.  If the silver camel becomes too exposed, the gold elephant may cross over in a single move, and possibly even force the capture of the silver camel.  More subtly, if Silver rotates the a5-horse to c5 and then attacks the east wing with the silver elephant, the gold elephant may be able to abandon the framed horse and in the same move push the silver horse from c5 to c4, threatening to capture it in the following turn.  It would be a huge relief for Gold to abandon the pin in a way that resulted in only an exchange of horses rather than a loss.

A frame may be broken by the arrival of a piece strong enough to dislodge the framing piece or pieces on one side of the trap.  If a piece on a trap gains a second supporter, it is no longer framed.  At right only the gold camel would be strong enough to break the frame.  Gold must judge whether breaking the frame is worth the danger of the gold camel being taken hostage, as well as considering the damage that the silver camel will do on the east wing in the mean time.

===Horse Hostages===
An elephant holding a camel hostage is only one example of a whole class of positions where a frozen piece is held in danger of capture, committing the opponent to defense.  It is, however, the most effective.  Suppose, for example, that an elephant holds a horse hostage instead.  This commits the opposing elephant to defense, true, but who has the strongest free piece?  The defending elephant can't leave without losing a horse, but the hostage-holding elephant often can't leave either, because the newly-freed horse would cooperate with the formerly-defending elephant to wreak havoc at that trap.

In the diagram at left, from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=10598&amp;s=w this game], Silver is holding a hostage, but ''neither'' elephant wishes to leave the northeast trap square.  Indeed, it is the gold elephant which has the greater mobility because it is two steps closer to the center, and is thus a greater threat to the silver camel than the silver elephant is a threat to the gold camel.  Since the gold camel has more freedom of movement, Gold may be able to make progress in this position despite having a horse held hostage.

Silver's hope in this position must be either to frame the hostage horse and rotate out the silver elephant (see above), or to pass the hostage horse off to the silver camel (see below), which would also free the silver elephant.
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

|It is difficult to maintain a horse hostage with a camel on the side of a trap if the opposing elephant is nearby.
}}
After an elephant holding a camel hostage, the second-most effective hostage situation is a camel holding a horse hostage.  Ideally this ties the opposing elephant to defense, while the friendly elephant is free to roam.  However, the situation is often unstable because the &quot;defending&quot; elephant can attack the hostage-holding camel, freeing the hostage horse, and possibly creating offensive threats.  This means that the &quot;free&quot; elephant must work as quickly as possible to score material gain, before the hostage situation collapses.

When a horse is held hostage by a camel, the deeper the hostage is held, the greater the threat.  In the diagram at right, the gold elephant has no easy way to approach the silver camel and switch to offense.  In contrast, if a hostage-holding camel has no friendly pieces in front of it, the opposing elephant can more easily free the horse.  At right, the silver elephant can pull the gold camel to b4 in three steps (returning to c4 after the pull) and the final step can be used to move the silver horse to b3.  This would threaten the gold cat with capture on the following turn.  Also the silver elephant has the option of flipping the gold camel to c5 on the following turn, threatening another capture.
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

|The gold dog would be most valuable as a hostage if held by a horse.

===Cat and Dog Hostages===
A smaller piece may also make a valuable hostage.  In the diagram at left, from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=33519&amp;s=w this game], Silver has an advantage due to the gold dog held hostage by the silver camel.  The silver elephant is a free piece, which will try to pull something to capture in the f6 trap.  The Gold elephant will be overloaded if it must simultaneously defend c6 and f6.

However, the situation is less than ideal for Silver, for two reasons.  First, the silver cat on c6 means that the hostage dog isn't threatened with one-turn capture.  If the gold elephant leaves, it will take five steps for Silver to capture the hostage dog, giving the gold elephant that much more mobility.  Second, the gold rabbit on h5 gives the gold camel more freedom to advance without fear of being taken hostage by the silver elephant.  Silver would like to send his elephant after the gold camel, but in practice will probably have to try to capture the h5-rabbit before this is feasible.

In general, the advantage of a small piece hostage over a horse hostage is twofold.  First, the smaller piece can be held hostage by a horse, sparing both the friendly elephant and the friendly camel for other duty.  Second, it is easier to frame a small piece than to frame a horse.  In the diagrammed position, Silver would have a greater advantage if the c7-camel were swapped with the g6-horse.  Then the silver camel could defend the f6 trap while the silver elephant either hunted for a second piece to drag for capture, or assisted in framing the hostage dog.  As it stands, the silver elephant can't help frame the c8-dog, because of the damage the gold camel would do in the mean time.
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

|The gold elephant is cut off from the center.
}}

===The Center===
A more subtle, positional aspect to elephant mobility is the ability of the elephant to access the areas of most importance at the current stage of the game.  From the centre four squares of the board the elephant has access to all four traps, so as a general rule it is better for the elephant to be centrally located.  Also, a centralized elephant is almost impossible to blockade.  On the other hand, in order to attack or defend a trap, an elephant must decentralize itself at least to one of the eight squares in the ring around the center, and perhaps further if it is hunting down a fleeing piece.  The possibilities available to an elephant in the center usually remain mere possibilities until the elephant leaves the center to pursue one of them.

It is occasionally possible to station a clump of friendly pieces in the center of the board, which can cut off the opposing elephant's ability to switch wings at will.  In the diagram at right, from [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=31556&amp;s=w this game], Gold is losing because the gold elephant can't access the f3 trap.

This strategy must be used with great caution, however, because if the opponent is able to erode the dividing wall, there will probably not be time to retreat all of the participating pieces to safety.  At right, if the gold elephant could break through the wall, some silver piece would likely perish in f3.  In general, pieces other than the elephant should stay out of the center.  It is asking for trouble to give the opposing elephant a target in the center where that elephant wants to be anyway.

==Quoi, qui, que, ce que, ce qui, est-ce que, and qu'est-ce que==

*&lt;b&gt;&quot;Quoi&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is used as the object of a preposition (i.e.: à, avec, après), except for variations of &quot;de&quot;.  Example: Sais-tu à quoi il pense? = Do you know what he's thinking about?

*&lt;b&gt;&quot;Qui&quot;&lt;/b&gt; can be most easily translated as &quot;which&quot;, or &quot;who&quot;.  It's used when referring to a specific item or person doing something (La chienne qui aboye), or when asking a question (as in &quot;Qui aimes-tu&quot;).

*&lt;b&gt;&quot;Que&quot;&lt;/b&gt; can be used to compare something (he eats more than she eats = il mange plus qu'elle mange), or to be used to say &quot;that&quot; (&quot;he thinks that he eats a lot&quot; = &quot;Il pense qu'il mange beaucoup&quot;).

*&lt;b&gt;&quot;Ce que&quot;&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;&quot;ce qui&quot;&lt;/b&gt; are indefinite pronouns.  Ce que is used to describe something the subject of a sentence is modifying, and ce qui describes the subject of a sentence.

This is what he wants = &quot;C'est ce qu'il veut&quot;.
This is something that satisfies me = &quot;C'est ce qui me satisfait.&quot;

*&lt;b&gt;&quot;Est-ce que&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a phrase placed in front of a statement to make it a question.

&quot;Tu l'aimes&quot; = &quot;You like it.&quot; In French, when describing the subject of a sentence in relation to another object or place, the subject goes first, then the pronoun of the object or place being related to, and then the verb.
&quot;Est-ce que tu l'aimes ?&quot; = &quot;(Do) you like it?&quot;

*&lt;b&gt;&quot;Qu'est-ce que&quot;&lt;/b&gt; means &quot;what is it that&quot;, as in &quot;What is it that he likes to eat&quot; (Qu'est-ce qu'il aime manger ?) Similarly, &lt;b&gt;&quot;Qu'est-ce qui&quot;&lt;/b&gt; means &quot;What is it that&quot;, however, just like &quot;ce qui&quot;, it refers to a subject instead of an object.  (&quot;Qu'est-ce qui aboye?&quot; = &quot;What's barking?&quot;)

==tout, tous, toute, toutes==
&quot;Tout&quot;, when used as an adverb, always stays invariant. When used as an adjective, it agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies (like every adjective in French).

Example: 
&lt;br&gt;''Ils sont sales'' means &quot;They are dirty&quot;. Adding ''tout'' gives a complementary information, different whether ''tout'' is employed as an adverb or an adjective:
&lt;br&gt;''Ils sont '''''tout''''' sales''. (Adverb: invariant). Insists on the adjective ''sale''. In this case ''tout'' means &quot;very&quot; or &quot;completely&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;''Ils sont '''''tous''''' sales''.  (Adjective: agree with &quot;sales&quot; in gender and in number). Insists on the fact that they are ALL dirty.

==false cognates / faux amis==
*Actuel vs. actual: &quot;actuel&quot; in French means &quot;current&quot;.  ''e.g. les événements actuels = current events''
*Sale vs. sale: in French, sale is an adjective that means &quot;dirty&quot;.
*Travailler vs. to travel: &quot;travailler&quot; is a verb meaning to work, not &quot;to travel&quot;.
*La librairie vs. library: &quot;librairie&quot; denotes bookstore.
*La figure vs. figure: &quot;figure&quot; in French means face.
*La journée vs. Journey: &quot;journée&quot; in French means day.

==ap/em/porter==

'''apporter''' - to bring an object (only things you can carry) to a place where you are.
''J'ai apporté mon livre à la fête.''

'''emporter''' - to take an object (only things you can carry) to a place different than your current location.
''J'ai emporté ma boisson à la fête.''

Best way to remember is that ''''take'''' has an ''''e'''' so the verb starts with an '''em'''.

==a/em/mener==

'''amener''' - to bring an animal, vehicle or a person with you to a place where you are.
''Si vous venez nous voir, amenez votre frère.''

'''emmener''' - to take an animal or a person with you somewhere different than your current location.
''Il a emmené ses enfants à l'école.''

Same formula to remember: ''''take'''' has an ''''e'''' so the verb starts with an '''em'''.

==passer==
*passer la journée which means to spend the day (doing something. a longer example is needed here)
*se passer which means for something to happen, or to occur.

==em/s'en aller/vouloir/s'enfuir/s'envoler==

==pronominal verbs with meanings different than regular version==
==plus==
==bon vs bien==
Bon is usually an adjective. It modifies a noun and means good, suitable, efficient, correct, useful, etc.  
Bien means good, right, healthy, etc., and can often be used as an adjective with the verb être. It usually is an adverb, however.

==capitalization==
==an/année, jour/journée==
==negation other that ne..pas in detail==
''Pas'' can be substituted for other words to give a negation new meanings. For instance, ''ils ne regardent pas'' - &quot;They are not watching&quot; can become :
*''Ils ne regardent plus'' - They are no longer watching 
*''Ils ne regardent guère'' (formal) - They are barely watching
*''Ils ne regardent jamais'' - They are never watching

==c'est vs il est, ce vs il vs one==

==mal, le mal, faire mal, malade, malaise, etc==

{{Java Programming/Navigation|next=Dynamic Class Loading}}
__NOTOC__{{Java Programming/Reflection/Nav}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Reflection is the mechanism by which Java exposes the features of a class during runtime, allowing Java programs to enumerate and access a class' methods, fields, and constructors as objects. In other words, there are object-based ''mirrors'' that reflect the Java object model, and you can use these objects to access an object's features using runtime API constructs instead of compile-time language constructs. 
Each object instance has a &lt;code lang=Java&gt;getClass()&lt;/code&gt; method, inherited from {{java:jlObject}}, which returns an object with the runtime representation of that object's class; this object is an instance of the {{java:jlClass}}, which in turn has methods that return the fields, methods, constructors, superclass, and other properties of that class.
You can use these reflection objects to access fields, invoke methods, or instantiate instances, all without having compile-time dependencies on those features. The Java runtime provides the corresponding classes for reflection. Most of the Java classes that support reflection are in the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;java.lang.reflect package&lt;/code&gt;.
Reflection is most useful for performing dynamic operations with Java &amp;mdash; operations that are not hard-coded into a source program, but that are determined at run time. One of the most important aspects of reflection is [[Java Programming/Reflection/Dynamic Class Loading|dynamic class loading]].
== Example: Invoking a &lt;code lang=Java&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method ==
One way to understand how reflection works is to use reflection to model how the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) loads and executes a class. When you invoke a Java program

# invoke the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method, passing the string array main &lt;code lang=Java&gt;String[]&lt;/code&gt;.
Steps 2, 3, and 4 can be accomplished with Java reflection.
Below is an example of loading the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; class, locating the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method, (see [[Java Programming/Understanding a Java Program|Understanding a Java Program]]) and invoking it via reflection.
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-1&quot;&gt;'''Code section 10.1: main() method invocation.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;9-12&quot;&gt;
public static void invokeMain()
   throws ClassNotFoundException,
   	ExceptionInInitializerError,
   	IllegalAccessException,
   	IllegalArgumentException,
   	InvocationTargetException,
   	NoSuchMethodException,
   	SecurityException {
   Class&lt;?&gt; distanceClass = Class.forName(&quot;Distance&quot;);
   String[] points = {&quot;0&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;};
   Method mainMethod = distanceClass.getMethod(&quot;main&quot;, String[].class);
   Object result = mainMethod.invoke(null, (Object) points);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
This code is obviously more complicated than simply calling
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-2&quot;&gt;'''Code section 10.2: main() method calling.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Distance.main(new String[]{&quot;0&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;});
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
However, the main Java runtime does not know about the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; class. The name of the class to execute is a runtime value. Reflection allows a Java program to work with classes even though the classes are not known when the program was written.
Let's explore what the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;invokeMain&lt;/code&gt; method is doing.
The first statement at line 9 is an example of [[Java Programming/Reflection/Dynamic Class Loading|dynamic class loading]]. The &lt;code lang=Java&gt;forName()&lt;/code&gt; method will load a Java class and return an instance of {{java:jlClass}} that results from loading the class. In this case, we are loading the class {{java:string|Distance}} from the default package. We store the class object in the local variable &lt;code lang=Java&gt;distanceClass&lt;/code&gt;; its type is {{java:Class}}&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;.
The second statement at line 10 simply creates a {{java:String}} array with the four command line arguments we wish to pass to the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; class.
The third statement at line 11 performs a reflection operation on the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; class. The &lt;code lang=Java&gt;getMethod()&lt;/code&gt; method is defined for the {{java:Class}} class. It takes a variable number of parameters: the method name is the first parameter and the remaining parameters are the types of each of &lt;code lang=Java&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;'s parameters. The method name is trivial: we want to invoke the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method, so we pass in the name {{java:string|main}}. We then add a &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; variable for each of the method parameters. &lt;code lang=Java&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; accepts one parameter ({{java:String}}&lt;code lang=Java&gt;[] args)&lt;/code&gt; so we add a single &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; element representing the String[]. The &lt;code lang=Java&gt;getMethod&lt;/code&gt; method has a return type of &lt;code lang=Java&gt;java.lang.reflect.Method&lt;/code&gt;; we store the result in a local variable named &lt;code lang=Java&gt;mainMethod&lt;/code&gt;.
Finally, we invoke the method by calling the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;invoke()&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Method&lt;/code&gt; instance. This method's first parameter is the instance to invoke on, and the remaining parameters are for the invokee's parameters. Since we are invoking a static method and not an instance method, we pass {{java:null}} as the instance argument. Since we only have a single parameter we pass it as the second argument. However, we must cast the parameter to Object to indicate that the array is the parameter, and not that the parameters are in the array. See varargs for more details on this.
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-3&quot;&gt;'''Code section 10.3: invoke() call.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Object result = mainMethod.invoke(null, arguments);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
The &lt;code lang=Java&gt;invoke()&lt;/code&gt; method returns an &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; that will contain the result that the reflected method returns. In this case, our &lt;code lang=Java&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method is a {{java:void}} method, so we ignore the return type.
Most of the methods in this short &lt;code lang=Java&gt;invokeMain&lt;/code&gt; method may throw various exceptions. The method declares all of them in its signatures. Here is a brief rundown of what might throw an exception:
* &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Class.forName(String)&lt;/code&gt; will throw &lt;code lang=Java&gt;ClassNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt;, if the named class cannot be located.
* &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Class.forName(String)&lt;/code&gt; will throw &lt;code lang=Java&gt;ExceptionInInitializerError&lt;/code&gt;, if the class could not be loaded due the static initializer throwing an exception or a static field's initialization throwing an exception.
* &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Class.getMethod(String name, Class parameterTypes[])&lt;/code&gt; will throw
** &lt;code lang=Java&gt;NoSuchMethodException&lt;/code&gt;, if a matching method is not found, or is not public (use &lt;code lang=Java&gt;getDeclaredMethod&lt;/code&gt; to get a non-public method).
** &lt;code lang=Java&gt;SecurityException&lt;/code&gt;, if a security manager is installed and calling the method would result in an access violation (for example, the method is in the &lt;code lang=Java&gt;sun.*&lt;/code&gt; package designed for internal use only).
* &lt;code lang=Java&gt;Method.invoke(Object instance, Object... arguments)&lt;/code&gt; may throw:
** &lt;code lang=Java&gt;IllegalAccessException&lt;/code&gt;, if this method is invoked in a manner that violates its access modifiers.
** &lt;code lang=Java&gt;IllegalArgumentException&lt;/code&gt; for various reasons, including
*** passing an instance that does not implement this method.
*** the actual arguments do not match the method's arguments
** &lt;code lang=Java&gt;InvocationTargetException&lt;/code&gt;, if the underlying method (&lt;code lang=Java&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; in this case) throws an exception.
In addition to these exceptions, there are also errors and runtime exceptions that these methods may throw.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
All features of a class can be obtained via reflection, including access to {{java:private}} methods &amp; variables. But not always see [http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/11/12/reflection.html].
Let us look at the following example:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-3&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 10.3: Secret.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class Secret {
  private String secretCode = &quot;It's a secret&quot;;
 
  private String getSecretCode() {
    return secretCode;     
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Although the field and method are marked {{java:private}}, the following class shows that it is possible to access the {{java:private}} features of a class:

   private static final Object[] EMPTY = {};
 
   public void reflect() throws IllegalAccessException, IllegalArgumentException, InvocationTargetException {
     Secret instance = new Secret();
     Class&lt;?&gt; secretClass = instance.getClass();
 
     // Print all the method names &amp; execution result
     Method methods[] = secretClass.getDeclaredMethods();
     System.out.println(&quot;Access all the methods&quot;);
     for (Method method : methods) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Method Name: &quot; + method.getName());
        System.out.println(&quot;Return type: &quot; + method.getReturnType());
        method.setAccessible(true);
        System.out.println(method.invoke(instance, EMPTY) + &quot;\n&quot;);
     }
 
     // Print all the field names &amp; values
     Field fields[] = secretClass.getDeclaredFields();
     System.out.println(&quot;Access all the fields&quot;);

     }

    try {
      newHacker.reflect();

===JUnit - Test Private methods===
JUnit's are unit test cases, used to test the Java programs. Now you know how to test a private method using Reflection in JUnit.
There's a long-standing debate on whether testing private members is a good habit&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34571/whats-the-best-way-of-unit-testing-private-methods What's the best way of unit testing private methods?], March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;;There are cases where you want to make sure a class exhibited the right behavior while not making the fields that need checking to assert that public (as it's generally considered bad practice to create accessors to a class just for the sake of a unit test). There are also cases when you can greatly simplify a test case by using reflection to test all smaller private methods (and their various branches), then test the main function. 
With [http://dp4j.com dp4j] it is possible to test private members without directly using the Reflection API but simply accessing them as if they were accessible from the testing method; dp4j injects the needed Reflection code at compile-time&lt;ref&gt;[http://dp4j/faq Reflection API injected at compile-time]&lt;/ref&gt;.

We start with basic transfer object:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 10.1: DummyTo.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
package com.test;
 
public class DummyTo {
    private String name;
    private String address;
 
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
 
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
 
    public String getAddress() {
        return address;
    }
 
    public void setAddress(String address) {
        this.address = address;
    }
 
    public DummyTo(String name, String address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }
 
    public DummyTo() {
        this.name = new String();
        this.address = new String();
    }
 
    public String toString(String appendBefore) {
        return appendBefore + &quot; &quot; + name + &quot;, &quot; + address;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Following is the example for invoking method from the above mentioned to dynamically.
Code is self explanatory.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Dynamic Class Loading allows the loading of java code that is not known about before a program starts. Many classes rely on other classes and resources such as icons which make loading a single class unfeasible. For this reason the &lt;code&gt;ClassLoader&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;java.lang.ClassLoader&lt;/code&gt;) is used to manage all the inner dependencies of a collection of classes. The Java model loads classes as needed and need not know the name of all classes in a collection before any one of its classes can be loaded and run.
==Simple Dynamic Class Loading==
An easy way to dynamically load a &lt;code&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; is via the &lt;code&gt;java.net.URLClassLoader&lt;/code&gt; class. This class can be used to load a &lt;code&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; or a collection of classes that are accessible via a URL. This is very similar to the &lt;code&gt;-classpath&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the &lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt; executable. To create a &lt;code&gt;URLClassLoader&lt;/code&gt;, use the factory method (as using the constructor requires a security privilege):
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-4&quot;&gt;'''Code section 10.4: Class loader.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
URLClassLoader classLoader = URLClassLoader.newInstance(
   new URL[]{&quot;http://example.com/javaClasses.jar&quot;});
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Unlike other dynamic class loading techniques, this can be used even without security permission provided the classes come from the same Web domain as the caller.
Once a &lt;code&gt;ClassLoader&lt;/code&gt; instance is obtained, a class can be loaded via the &lt;code&gt;loadClass&lt;/code&gt; method. For example, to load the class &lt;code&gt;com.example.MyClass&lt;/code&gt;, one would:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-5&quot;&gt;'''Code section 10.5: Class loading.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Class&lt;?&gt; clazz = classLoader.load(&quot;com.example.MyClass&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Executing code from a &lt;code&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; instance is explained in the [[../Dynamic Invocation|Dynamic Invocation]] chapter.

==Proteomics==
!!! To those adding sections and contributions over the last few days by adding sections this is great!!!! Please add more and let us know who you are! If you need any help developing these new areas please let me know! (Tung)

New update! I will be creating a new updated pdf version of what we currently have for offline use. The new sections will not be added yet. However Once done a 2.0 PDF will be released.

This project has currently been taken over by myself Tung Luong as a graduate project and would love to get feedback on any of the information as well as would love contributions. So please feel free to edit appropriately as well as let me know how I am doing.
This is a textbook for teaching the principles and practice of
proteomics for undergraduate students in the life sciences. The focus is
on the analytical methods and data analysis for protein separation,
quantitation and identification.  We will begin with older methods
(chromatography, electrophoresis) and move to more modern approaches
(chips, for example) that are being used for high throughput proteomics.

This book is collaboration with [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] and can be found under [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]]

Is &quot;efficient&quot; used here to mean that meaningful conclusions can be made from a small number of samples?

Also, if someone was looking for the table of &quot;k&quot;s, what terms should they search for?

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''WE THE WRITERS'''&lt;/big&gt; of this book want to address an area where it seems programming books make a big mistake. From what we've seen, programming tutorials and books for C++ (and other languages, for that matter) are organized in the same old way. They start with &quot;basics&quot; like variables and control flow, each chapter dedicated to a different part of the programming language. They teach the language, they just don't teach things that are absolutely fundamental to programming. Then there are other books who say that they don't just teach the language, they teach &quot;real world&quot; examples. These books tend to compact the language half, and add in chapters for user interface programming or network programming. Once again, this is not teaching exactly what is needed. It's good that they are spreading around knowledge, so that the reader knows a bit of useful skills that they can apply towards their program making. It's bad that they are compacting knowledge of the language, which is itself just as useful.

However, we are still missing something fundamental to programming. What does every programmer do, no matter what programming language, and no matter what task? They solve problems! Problem solving is a skill central to programming. The programmer could know every interface, every library in the world, but it would all come to nothing if they didn't know how to make their knowledge useful. You, as a programmer, not only need to know the language, in its entirety: quirks, oddities, and all, you need to know how to use that knowledge and apply it towards the problem.

So this is where we come in. We're going to take a different approach to teaching programming. It's true that we will teach the programming language C++. It's true that we may also spoil some of those joyful weekends we as programmers spent solving the problems we present in this book a year or two after we have learned to program. For that reason, we will leave the book with a list of &quot;problems&quot; for the reader, pointing to various articles about the problems, so that they to can experience joyful weekends making Tic Tac Toe programs or Sudoku Solvers, as it was these &quot;weekends&quot; that inspired some of us to teach C++ using them, because it's those times when you try new things without worrying about messing something up, and it's those times that new skills truly develop.

Another common thing that I've seen in C++ books is that they teach C before C++, even though they don't say it. C++, as you may have guessed, is derived from another programming language, C, but with many, many extensions, even innovations. Where as C could be taught in a single chapter of a book (and often is), C++ is likely to take up a good chunk of the book. The code in many books early on looks and acts like C code, without using good C++ conventions, yet it is these chapters that become permanently graven in the reader's mind (you'd be amazed how much these have an affect, even if you can't remember the paragraphs 5 minutes after you read them), as they are their first steps into programming. So, in the spirit of Accelerated C++ (a highly recommended commercial book), we will start out with C++ code, and finish with C++ code.

'''Compilers'''
*[[Wikipedia:Dev-C plus plus|Dev-C++]] (uses the [[Wikipedia:GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] compiler neatly)
*[http://mingw.org MinGW] (uses the [[Wikipedia:GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] compiler)
*[http://cygwin.org Cygwin] (uses the [[Wikipedia:GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] compiler directly, you'll have to generate compile codes yourself (note: this also goes for MingW), you'll be helped with that ;-) )

These are free and open source, but you might still like to use a commercial compiler instead. As long as it is compatible with ANSI-C and/or ANSI/ISO  C++, you won't have to worry much (although there is one compiler, which rumors say, is the least standards conforming compiler made by man). Otherwise just edit this book and add what worked for you. Suggested non-open source compilers are Microsoft Visual C++ or Borland C++.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction - Solving The Tower of Hanoi ==
[[Image:Hanoi_10Ring_3D_Small.jpg|frame|right|A 10 Ring Hanoi puzzle in the starting position.]]
The Tower of Hanoi is a fairly simple puzzle. It consists primarily of three poles and a set of rings. The rings are in different sizes, stacked from largest to smallest on the first pole. Your objective: to move all the rings to the second or third tower. Sounds simple? Rules: You can only move the top ring on a given tower, and you can't place larger rings on top of smaller rings. If you already know how to get a solution, you can skip the next part.

Let's start off with a simple version of Hanoi, it is from this version that we will base larger versions. Let's start with two ring Hanoi. I'm sure it shouldn't be a challenge for you to move two rings to the target location. We will call these rings #1 and #2. #1 is stacked on #2 on the first pole. We want to get both #1 and #2 to the second pole; so eventually, we will have to move #2 to the second pole. #2 is the bottom ring, so it can't be placed on top of anything else; the second pole has to be clear. So, from this, we formulate a solution. We move the #1 ring onto the alternate pole, then we move #2 on to the target pole, then move #1 back onto the target pole.

Now, let's move onto a larger example. How about 4 ring Hanoi. We will try to use some of the knowledge present in the previous example. First, we have to move the #4 ring onto the second pole at some time in the solution, and for that to happen, the second pole has to be empty. For #4 to be movable there can be nothing on top of it, so we have to stack #1, #2, and #3 on the alternate pole first. Now we can move #4 to the target pole and reassemble the tower on top of it.

The solution has gotten slightly more complex. We can't simply pick up #1, #2, and #3. We have to move them according to the same rules. So we apply the same pattern, #3 has to be moved to the alternate pole, and that pole has to be clear of rings with lower numbers than #3, meaning no #2's, or #1's. So, the alternate pole becomes our target pole, only we're moving less rings. See the pattern? Its called a ''recursive pattern''. So, let's define a basic rule: To move ''n'' rings from pole ''a'' to pole ''b'', using ''c'' as an alternate, first we move ''n-1'' rings to pole ''c'' using the same rule, then we move the ring ''n'' to pole ''b'', then we move ''n-1'' rings back from pole ''c'' to pole ''b''. Note that when n=0 we should do absolutely nothing. Now, let's turn this into a program.

== Proudly, Your First Program ==
Open up your favorite text editor with a new file called &quot;hanoi.cpp&quot;. This file will contain our ''source code''.

First of all, we told ourselves that there is a ''recursive pattern''. This pattern seemed to take four variables, n, a, b, c. We should give these slightly better names, perhaps, ''depth'', ''from'', ''to'', and ''alternate''. So, let's make a function. A function, as in math, is just a list of instructions for the computer to follow. It has a name, unlike in math where everything is named &quot;f&quot; or &quot;x&quot;, which makes little to no sense. We will name our function &quot;hanoi&quot;. Type or copy/paste into your text program the following:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 void hanoi(int depth, int from, int to, int alternate)
 {
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's dissect this for a moment. The first part of the line is &quot;void&quot;. What does this mean? Well, in reality, the first part of the line is the ''return type''. This is what the function will ''return'', which is what it will evaluate to, what its result is. A type just means a type of data, like a number, a letter, a string (which is a bunch of letters that make up sentences and stuff), or even our own data type (we will explore this later). The ''void'' type means nothing, literally, so this function doesn't have a result, it does some other thing, like output its result to us, instead of returning it. The second part of line is &quot;hanoi&quot;, which, as you may have guessed, is the name of the function.

Then a pair of parentheses, &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;, and within them is a set of arguments. You may have also guessed that these arguments are what we named earlier: depth, from, to, and alternate. They are separated by commas, which is logical. However, what is the ''int'' part, you may be wondering? Remember I said earlier that all data has a type. The int is a type that your compiler knows, it stands for ''integer''. So, our four variables are ''integers'', in that they represent negative or positive numbers. The depth is a number that represents the number of rings the system should be moving. The from, to, and alternate are all integers that specify what pole we are working with. Indeed, these could also be done with ''strings'', which would allow the output to be more like &quot;Move ring #3 from tower a to tower b&quot;, instead of &quot;Move ring #3 from tower 1 to tower 2&quot;. We can, and will, do this later.

The next lines consist entirely of an opening bracket &quot;{&quot;, and a closing bracket, &quot;}&quot;. These two brackets show what is in the function, what the function does.

Now, we are going to start making up the function. Remember our rule? Part of it said that we should do nothing if n, or ''depth'', is 0. So, let's do that first. Make a new line in between the brackets, and we will add in an ''if statement''. An if statement consists of a few parts, mainly, it 
follows the following pattern:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 if(something)
 { ..do something.. }
&lt;/source&gt;

You can note that the &quot;..do something..&quot; is only done if the &quot;something&quot; is true. In our case, the something is &quot;depth is 0&quot;, and the do something would be to do nothing, as confusing as that sounds. Our code, then, is:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 if(depth == 0)
 {
     return;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

I can hear the screams already! You shout &quot;Wait, that doesn't match the pattern! It's supposed to be on one line, not three!&quot;. Let me explain. You're allowed to put spaces and new lines anywhere, absolutely anywhere in the code, except in dumb places like between the &quot;i&quot; and the &quot;f&quot; in the &quot;if&quot;, or inside the &quot;depth&quot;. But in most other places, it's perfectly OK. So you might be asking, &quot;Why bother?&quot;. There are notable benefits to spacing things out. It makes code more readable. You will find that as you get more experienced that more than two-thirds of your time is spent reading code you wrote at some other point in time, rather than writing code right there and then. You will spend lots of time finding mistakes, or computer bugs, in your code. So, it becomes essential that your code be easy to read.

All this being said, we should discuss the code. First of all, our &quot;something&quot; in the ''if statement'' is &quot;depth == 0&quot;. You might be wondering why there are two equals signs instead of one. This is because using only one equals sign would change depth, &quot;depth = 0&quot; causes depth to become 0, and we lose whatever used to be the value of depth. Two equals signs denotes comparison, we are ''comparing'' depth to 0, and if it is true, we are going to execute the ''return statement'', otherwise, we skip past everything contained in the curly brackets. The return statement causes the function to return immediately, meaning there is nothing more to be done in this function, so no more code is executed in that function. This is exactly what we want: if the depth is 0, then do no more, just go back up a level. Also note that the return statement has a semicolon (;) at the end, yet the if statement does not. This is extremely important to remember: all statements, except for ones that use curly brackets, must end in a semicolon.

So, on to the next part. First things first, we move all of the rings above the nth ring to the alternate. So, basically, the function is calling itself to do this. Add in the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 hanoi(depth-1, from, alternate, to);
&lt;/source&gt;

You can see that we are calling the hanoi function again. Except, we've now swapped the alternate and the to, to represent the fact that we want to move all the above rings to the alternate pole, rather than onto the pole we are trying to move the bottom ring to. This is simple enough.

On to the next part. We have to move the nth ring from the ''from'' to the ''to''. Let's decide how we're going to do this. We are not literally doing it in code&amp;mdash;there is no Pole data and we are not moving Ring data between poles, we are simply issuing the command so that a human reader who had the three poles in front of him could do it himself. We will get into more advanced forms later. For now, add in the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Move ring &quot; &lt;&lt; depth &lt;&lt; &quot; from pole &quot; &lt;&lt; from &lt;&lt; &quot; to pole &quot; &lt;&lt; to &lt;&lt; &quot;.&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

This is the code that will output our information. Let's dissect it. First, it starts with &quot;std::cout&quot;. The &quot;std::&quot; part specifies that we are using something in the ''standard library''. The standard library includes lots of useful things, and it comes with every implementation of C++. The &quot;cout&quot; part means we are using ''cout'' from the standard library, which stands for &quot;Character-OUTput&quot;. The next part is &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;. This is called the ''format operator''. It sends what's on the right into what's on the left. This ''operator'' is used almost exclusively for &quot;std::cout&quot;, although, if you really wanted to, you could use it for your own purposes. The next part is &quot;Move ring &quot;. This simply means we're sending the text &quot;Move ring &quot; into std::cout, which will, in turn, come out for us to see.

Then you see another &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;, so we are sending more into std::cout, except this time, we're not sending in text that is to be replicated exactly, we are sending in ''depth'', which means whatever the value of depth is, be it 17, 42, or 15843, it will be output that number. The next part is another piece of text. Again, notice that there is a space at the beginning. This is because when the program is outputting the 'depth', it doesn't add in spaces at the beginning and end, as that may not be what you want. So, you have to add in the spaces manually. The rest of the line may be easily deciphered; we are just outputting more information. The last part, however, is std::endl. Another thing from the standard library. &quot;endl&quot; stands for &quot;end-line&quot;, it causes the line to end, and all the previous output to be sent to the screen.

Let's go onto the next part of our pattern. Now we have to move all the rings, which would now be on the alternate pole, back onto the target pole. For that, we use a similar command to what we used the first time:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 hanoi(depth-1, alternate, to, from);
&lt;/source&gt;

We've swapped things around again. We are moving from the alternate pole to the target pole (named &quot;to&quot;), and we use the from pole as a new alternate pole. Lost in confusion? I hope not. Now that that is over with, the rings should all be on the right poles, so that is the end of our function. The completed function looks like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 void hanoi(int depth, int from, int to, int alternate)
 {
     if(depth == 0)
     {
         return;
     }
     hanoi(depth-1, from, alternate, to);
     std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Move ring &quot; &lt;&lt; depth &lt;&lt; &quot; from pole &quot; &lt;&lt; from &lt;&lt; &quot; to pole &quot; &lt;&lt; to &lt;&lt; &quot;.&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
     hanoi(depth-1, alternate, to, from);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

You can take notes on how I space things, as it's probably not how you did it in your text editor. You can see that for every &quot;{&quot; bracket, I indent things by four spaces. Again, this is a style choice, but it's commonly agreed upon that four spaces makes code look neat and tidy, while still allowing lots of code to fit on-screen at once.

The terror is not over yet! All we have is a function. We haven't told the computer what we want done with the function. We also forgot to include some header files, but we'll get more on that later. For now, let's add in the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 int main(int argc, char** argv)
 {
     hanoi(4, 1, 2, 3);
     return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

We made a new function, ''main'', and it returns an integer. The ''main'' function is special, it specifies the entry point to your program. It takes two arguments. The first one we can figure out easily&amp;mdash;it's another integer. The second one is slightly more confusing. &quot;What is with the char** thing?&quot; Well, a &quot;char&quot; stands for ''character''. But the two stars changes this somehow. I can't entirely explain what this does at this point, it's fairly complex. For now, just be certain that it stands for the arguments passed into the function on the command line.

Let's jump into the body of the function. It seems to execute our hanoi function, it provides a depth of 4, and it wants you to move rings from tower 1 to tower 2, using tower 3 as an alternate. Then we see that ''return statement'' again, except this time, we are returning nothing (as we did in our hanoi function, which returned void, which is basically nothing). This time we are returning a 0, which is compatible with the int return type. That is the end of our main function. It seems pretty simple, heh?

We are missing just one last thing to make the program complete. Remember how we used std::cout? Well, the compiler doesn't just assume std::cout exists, you have to ask for it. To do this, you &quot;include the header file&quot;. This is done by adding the following to the very top of the file:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This copies and pastes the iostream header file into your file at compile time, rather than you doing it manually (which is both error prone and time consuming, and, if the iostream header file were to change, you'd have to repeat the whole process over again). You will have to memorize this one fact, std::cout is contained in the iostream header file. If you want to use std::cout, you have to #include the iostream header file.

Here is the entire program. Note that the compiler may care about the order, so 'main' should be placed after the 'hanoi()' function definition. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 void hanoi(int depth, int from, int to, int alternate)
 {
     if(depth == 0)
     {
         return;
     }
     hanoi(depth-1, from, alternate, to);
     std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Move ring &quot; &lt;&lt; depth &lt;&lt; &quot; from pole &quot; &lt;&lt; from &lt;&lt; &quot; to pole &quot; &lt;&lt; to &lt;&lt; &quot;.&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
     hanoi(depth-1, alternate, to, from);
 }
 int main(int argc, char** argv)
 {
     hanoi(4, 1, 2, 3);
     return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

We now have a complete program! Your first! Congratulations! I think it's about time we test it out, don't you think? At this time, pull up a console, go into the directory where hanoi.cpp is located, and type in &quot;g++ hanoi.cpp -o hanoi&quot;. Wait about 2 seconds, and you have your program. You can execute it by doing &quot;./hanoi&quot;. Amazing, isn't it? It's giving you the commands for 4 ring Hanoi. I think you should give yourself a pat on the back, and move onto the next section when you're ready.

== Extending, What More Could A Man/Woman Want? ==

So, we have a Hanoi program. It tells us how to solve Hanoi. Big deal. This won't impress an interviewer at Google who's qualifying you for &quot;Head Of Development.&quot; Our program needs to become a little more involved. Heres a list of things we want the program to do:

# Allow us to choose the number of rings when we start the program
# Show us the actual towers of Hanoi, and where the rings are placed.
# Update the image, on the console, in real time as the computer finds the solution
# Not to go too fast, as we would like to see the solution, rather than have it blaze by us in the blink of an eye.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section contains several examples of mathematics problems that can be solved using lists. These applications come for a variety of levels of math. Some of these problems can be solved in other ways on the calculator.

=== Reducing fractions ===

Let's reduce &lt;math&gt;\frac{29302}{75803}&lt;/math&gt; to lowest terms by seeing which prime numbers divide into both the numerator and denominator.  In a list we can divide tham both at the same time.

Enter the numerator and denominator of the fraction as a list   
:{29302,75803}
::::{29302 75803}

Divide by 2.
:Ans / 2
::::{14651 37901.5}

As we might have guessed the top comes out even, but the bottom does not.  So, multiply by 2 to get the original fraction back.
:Ans * 2
::::{29302 75803}
 
Let's try dividing by 3.
:Ans / 3
::::{9767.333 25267.667}

Neither one works.  Multiply the 3 back in.
:Ans * 3
::::{29302 75803}
 
Looking at the ones digit tells us not to bother with 5.  Seven is the next prime.
:Ans / 7
::::{4186 10829}

Both number came out even so the original fraction reduces by 7.  Now we must see if there is another factor of 7 in both numbers.  We can hit enter again to do the same operation again: dividing the previous answer by 7.
:Enter
::::{598 1547}

Seven is a factor of both numbers again; what about a third time?
:Enter
::::{85.429 221}

The denominator is dividible by 7 a third time, but not the numerator.  We must put the 7 back in.
:Ans * 7
::::{598 1547}

Next try 11.
:Ans / 11
::::{54.364 140.636}

No good.
:Ans * 11
::::{598 1547}

13 is next.
:Ans / 13
::::{46 119}

They both reduce by 13.
 
Now since 13 time 13 is more than 100 and thus more than 46, if 13 divided into 46 evenly the answer would be smaller than 13.  But we tried all the primes smaller than 13.  This fraction is in lowest terms.


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{29302}{75803} = \frac{7\times 7\times 13\times 46} {7\times 7\times 13\times 119} = \frac{46}{119} &lt;/math&gt;
 
=== Checking for prime factors ===
We can check any three digit number to see if is a prime by dividing it by all the primes less that the square root of 1000.  Create a list in L1 for these primes.
:{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31} Sto&gt; L1
It might be easier to create this list in the Editor.

Is 997 a prime number?  Divide 997 by all those primes.
:997 / L1 Sto→ L2
::::{498.5 332.333...

Since this contains lots of numbers with ten decimal digits, look at L2 in the list editor, and scroll down it.  We see that none of the divisions come out as even integers, so 997 is prime.

Try 991
:991 / L1 Sto→ L2

Can you see that 991 is also a prime?

Try 989.
:989 / L1 Sto→ L2

Can you see in the editor that the factors of 989 are 23 &amp;times; 43?

=== Graphing families of curves ===

A list of numbers can be used to display several related graphs.

For example put 0, 1, 2, and 3 into a list.  We will use this list of numbers in several ways.
:{0,1,2,3,} STO&gt; L1
::::{0 1 2 3}

*Start with a set of linear graphs.
Press Y= and enter
:Y1=L1*X+1
:ZOOM 6(ZStandard)

Notice that the lines have different slopes.  Each graph is steeper that the previous one. But the y-intercept is 1 in each case.

*Next look at a family of quadratic curves.

Change to 
:Y1=1+L1*X+0.25X^2
:GRAPH

This time each of these parabolas have the same shape, due to the second degree term, and the same y-intercept, due to the constant (1).  The list draws each graph in a different place on the axes.

*How will changing the cofficient on an exponential function affect the graph?
:Y1= L1*e^(X/4)
:GRAPH

Why do you only see three graphs? The list has affected the y-intercept. What does multiplying by zero do to the rest of the formula?

*And now for some trigonometry.

Hit the MODE key and move down and over to Degree; hit ENTER.
:Y=L1*3*sin(36X)
:GRAPH

Once again there are only three visible graphs. (I guess zero wasn't the best number to put in our list.) The sine waves are similar with different amplitudes.

=== Solving systems of linear equations ===

One good way of solving a system of equations is called the elimination method. 
The plan is to multiply each equation by a different number. The multipliers are chosen so that one of the variables in each equation has the same coefficient, except for opposite sign. This allows us to add the equations together and eliminate that variable with opposite cofficients.

Example
:8x + 7y = 35
:6x + 5y = 27

Put the three numbers in each equation into a list.
:{8,7,35} STO&gt; L1
::::{8 7 35}
:{6,5,27} STO&gt; L2
::::{6 5 27}

35 is the smallest number that the y-coefficients are both multiples of; and 24 is the smallest common multiple of 8 and 6.  Let's start with 24.  We need a positive 24x in one equation and a negative 24x in the other.

We can multiply the first equation by 3:
:3 * L1 STO&gt; L3
::::{24 21 105}
and the second equation by -4:
:-4 * L2 STO&gt; L4
::::{-24 -20 -108}

Add the two new lists.

:L3 + L4
::::{0 1 -3}

This list represents 0x + 1y = -3 or y = -3.


Next let's fix the y coeficients to 35 and -35

:5 * L1 STO&gt; L3
::::{40 35 175}
:-7 * L2 STO&gt; L4
::::{-42 -35 -189}

And add

:L3 + L4
::::{-2 0 -14}

Which represents -2x = -14, so divide the list by -2

:Ans / -2
::::{1 0 7}

Solution: x = 7, y = -3

=== Calculating both solutions to quadratic equations ===

This process is begun by having a list containing a positive one and a negative 1.
:{1,-1} STO&gt; L6
::::{1 -1}

When this list is multiplied by a number, the result is a list with plus and minus the number.

:1.8 * L6
::::{1.8 -1.8}

Next, since the answers to a quadratic equation are often irrational, they need to be rounded off. So set the calculator to 3 decimal digits.

Press the MODE Key and move down and over to the 3 and press ENTER.

Example - Solve   x2 + 5x + 3 = 0

Using the quadratic formula gives us:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Start with the calculation inside the square root:

:5 ^ 2 - 4 * 1 *3
::::13.000

Next do the square root and get both positive and negative answers:

:L6 * &amp;radic; (Ans)
::::{3.606 -3.606}

Add -5

:Ans - 5
::::{-1.394 -8.606}

And divide by 2
:Ans / 2
::::{-.697 -4.303}

That list contains both of the answers.

=== Finding the polynomial formula for a sequence ===

=== Solving two parts of a triangle problem at once ===

=== Plot both halves of conic graphs ===

=== The application problem that got me started on this list idea ===

[http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=15552 Gameboard] |  [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/comments.cgi?gid=15552 Comments]

* '''Introduction:''' This game was one of the last games of the 2005 Arimaa Postal Championship to finish, and it ultimately determined the tournament champion. If Omar had won, he would have tied Fritzlein for first with a 9-1 record. As it turned out, however, Fritzlein prevailed, and finished the tournament undefeated.

* '''1w:''' Omar deviates from the standard setup popularized by 99of9 by putting Dogs behind his traps and Cats back and center. A Dog behind the trap makes it easier to frame an opposing Dog. Also, as the game progresses, Cats are more likely to want to stay home for goal defense while Dogs are more likely to want to go on offense; Omar's setup anticipates this.

* '''1b:''' Fritzlein chooses 99of9's opening as originally conceived. Having only a Cat next to a home trap makes it less costly to abandon that trap. This gives him a slightly greater freedom to counter-attack in the opening rather than defending, i.e. a tactical advantage rather than the strategic advantage Omar chose.

* '''2w:''' Omar aggressively advances his Elephant four squares, which was not only the most common opening of that time, but was also invited by Fritzlein's central Camel.

* '''2b:''' Fritzlein, by vitrue of having Cats behind his traps, could now respond by advancing his own Elephant four squares, because he would be threatening to capture a Dog for a Cat. Omar could then enter an extremely sharp line in which each Elephant captures several pieces, and it is not clear whether the intiative of the first move compensates for losing Dog for Cat. In any event the counter-attack is very playable for Silver, but Fritzlein plays very defensively, protecting his Camel and warding off an EH attack on f6.

* '''3w:''' Due to the danger of an Elephant smother, Omar can't create any weaknesses by poking around with his Elephant on the seventh rank. He opts instead for a safe developing move. The fact that the Gold Elephant might as well step back one against a solid defense has dented the popularity of the Elephant-forward-four opening since the time of this game.  Nowadays the most popular move is Elephant forward three and a Horse forward one on the same flank.

* '''3b:''' Fritzlein defends c6 and moves his Elephant nearer Omar's Camel.

* '''4w:''' Omar drags Fritzlein's Horse towards the f3 trap. Of course, capturing the Horse any time soon will be impossible with Fritzlein's Elephant in the neighborhood. The threat is strategic rather than tactical: Omar's Camel is near f3, waiting to hold the Horse hostage if the opportunity arises.

* '''4b:''' The value of an Elephant taking a Horse hostage was very much in contention in this tournament, and still is. In some circumstances the hostage-giver appears to be in better shape than the hostage-taker. Nevertheless, Fritzlein decides to play defensively and free his Horse. The nearby Cat and Rabbit could also unfreeze the Horse, but not without exposing themselves. Giving up a Cat or Rabbit hostage at this stage of the game would be worse than giving up a Horse hostage.

* '''5w:''' Omar is also unwilling to give up a Horse hostage. Current opening theory suggests that it is bad to give up a Horse hostage on a wing where the opposing Camel waits, because the hostage Horse is then easy to frame or to pass off to the waiting Camel. So far the opening has been defensive, with neither side willing to expose a piece other than the Elephant.

* '''5b:''' Fritzlein finally takes a tiny risk to go on offense. It is not clear whether the tactical disadvantage of decentralizing his Elephant outweighs the strategic advantage of pulling a Rabbit, but since Omar has no large immediate threat, it may be a favorable tradeoff. A plausible alternative attack would have been to push Omar's e3 Horse to d3, unbalancing Omar's forces by putting both Horses on the same wing, but that wouldn't be to Omar's disadvantage unless Fritzlein switched wings with his Camel as well. Exposing a Rabbit is more tangible and immediate.

* '''6w:''' Omar does not have any play against the Silver pieces on the east wing, he can't pull a Rabbit, and he can't stop Fritzlein from pulling the h-Rabbit further. Therefore, he astutely switches wings to make a bigger threat. Fritzlein can hardly continue hunting a Rabbit when his b6-Horse is in jeopardy, but his Elephant is too far away to properly defend the west wing, which creates a tactical dilemma.

* '''6b:''' Fritzlein's b6-Horse can't stay safe without an advanced Rabbit to unfreeze it. Rather than advancing a Rabbit and accepting a game of competing Rabbit pulls, Fritzlein plays more ambitiously with a counter-threat to Omar's e3-Horse.

* '''7w:''' If Omar now flips the b6-Horse to b4, Fritzlein can flip the e3-Horse to e5. Yet if Omar brings his e3-Horse to safety, Fritzlein's Elephant will arrive on the west wing in time to defend his threatened Horse. Omar chooses the conservative plan of centralizing his Elephant while pulling the b6-Horse to c5.

* '''7b:''' Fritzlein's Elephant is now near enough to bring his Horse to safety. The exposed Rabbit on h4 leaves him at a slight strategic advantage, because nothing more important is going on anywhere else. In an opening where neither player attempts to take control of the other player's traps, exposed Rabbits are the main strategic marker.

* '''8w:''' Omar makes an exciting move to take the initiative. Had Omar continued to play with his lone Elephant on offense, he would have been accepting a slightly disadvantegous position, because none of Fritzlein's Rabbits are exposed and none of Fritzlein's pieces can be taken hostage while Fritzlein's Elephant is centralized on defense. Note how Omar uses his Horse on the wing away from Fritzlein's Camel.

* '''8b:''' The exposed Horse on a6 is a tempting target, but Fritzlein's Camel is on the wrong wing. (This is a frequent dilemma on defense in the opening: a centralized Camel is a target for the opposing Elephant, but a Camel on one wing leaves the other wing open for a Horse to attack.) Fritzlein would love to take the a6-Horse hostage with his Camel, but Omar's centralized Elephant could hinder the Camel's crossing long enough for the Horse to get away with a Rabbit pull. Fritzlein must therefore either take the encroaching Horse hostage with his Elephant, or ignore it.

* Had Fritzlein taken the hostage, Omar would have defended c6 with his Elephant, leading into a class of positions that is very poorly understood to this day. Opinion varies wildly both as to whether Gold or Silver would stand better in the resulting position, and as to what strategy each player should pursue.

* Instead, Fritzlein decides to drag the h4-Rabbit further forward, in order to be the first to threaten a capture.

* '''9w:''' Omar could use his Horse to pull out Fritzlein's a1-Rabbit, but Omar doesn't have great prospects in a Rabbit-pulling race in which he is already behind. A more forceful option would be an E-H attack on the c6 trap, which would essentially force Fritzlein to take the attacking Horse hostage with his Elephant. The threat would be slow to develop, however, and would probably be worth less than a Rabbit lost in the mean time.

* Instead Omar declares an intention to defend his h-Rabbit with his Camel. Arimaa theory at the time of this game strongly frowned on exposing one's Camel so early in the game, lest it be taken hostage by the opposing Elephant. Subsequent experience, however, has shown that the presence of an advanced Rabbit on the wing where the Camel is operating makes the danger to the Camel considerably less.

* '''9b:''' Fritzlein drags the Gold Rabbit to h6, an excellent square for holding a hostage, and brings his Elephant nearer to intimidate Omar's Camel from advancing further. Omar's a6-Horse is now roaming free of danger, which can't make Fritzlein happy, but the threat from Omar's Camel is too serious to be ignored entirely. As a general rule of thumb, if your opponent goes on the attack with his Camel, your Elephant has to leave whatever else it might do in order to go after the encroaching Camel.

* '''10w:''' Omar correctly defends the f6 trap to save his Rabbit, and places his Elephant on e6, a better square than f5. From e6 Omar's Elephant exerts influence on the c6 trap, as well as indirectly threating Fritzlein's home rows. The shocking part of the move (at that time) was Omar's further Camel push, in defiance of Fritzlein's nearby Elephant.

* '''10b:''' Fritzlein will not be able to capture anything in the f6 trap as long as Omar uses his Elephant to share control of it. Therefore Fritzlein is very eager to retain total control of the c6 trap. Without total control of at least one trap, Fritzlein will not be able to threaten captures. He immediately crosses with his Camel to scare off Omar's advanced Horse, and inches his Elephant closer to Omar's Camel.

* '''11w:''' Omar's Horse retreats empty-handed, but his Camel advances undaunted, and threatens a capture in f6. Omar's Rabbit on h6 not only prevents his Camel from being frozen, it also prevents his Camel from being pushed to h6 as a hostage of Fritzlein's Elephant. Thus the g6-Camel and the h6-Rabbit, which each individually would be weak, support each other.

* '''11b:''' Fritzlein decides to make room in his back ranks to threaten pushing Omar's Camel g7, where Omar's Rabbit can't unfreeze it any more. Fritzlein's Camel incidentally inches nearer Omar's Horse. Normally it would be bad to expose the Camel on d6 right next to Omar's Elephant on e6, but Fritzlein calculates that Omar's Elephant can't afford abandon the f6 trap any more. Fritzlein would be happy to lose his Camel while capturing both Omar's advanced Camel and Rabbit.

* '''12w:''' Omar would have liked to use his Camel to pull the f8 Rabbit to f7 or the g8 Rabbit to g7, because either move would have deprived Fritzlein of a square to hold the Camel hostage in. Unfortunately, either pull would require all four steps, leaving the a5-Horse to be taken hostage by Fritzlein's Camel. Therefore Omar retreats his exposed Horse and delays Fritzlein's ability to set up his Elephant on g6 holding the Camel on g7.

* '''12b:''' Omar has declined his last chance to retreat with his Camel; now Fritzlein can (and does) permanently secure the Camel as a hostage, albeit in a temporarily very awkward position. For Fritzlein to leave his Elephant on a trap in a live game would take guts, but in a postal game there is plenty of time to make sure it is not a blunder.

* Fritzlein's move is actually quite greedy, in that he retreats his Camel out of range of Omar's Elephant. In effect he is saying, &quot;I am no longer willing to trade my Camel for your Camel plus Rabbit&quot;, in other words, &quot;I think I am presently winning by more than a Rabbit.&quot; The further course of the game shows this judgement to be overly optimistic.

* '''13w:''' Omar flips Fritzlein's Cat into danger, a move which incidentally would not have been possible had Fritzlein's Camel stayed on d6. Omar isn't trying to free his Camel so much as get adequate compensation for it, but it is important to note that he must keep his Elephant on e6 while flipping the Cat. If Fritlzein could station his Elephant on e6 holding Omar's Camel hostage on e7, Omar would be hard pressed to save his Camel from outright capture.

* '''13b:''' If Fritzlein were in the ideal Camel-hostage position, he could send a Horse to defend f3. Because he still needs a couple of moves to get into proper hostage-holding position, he has no time to save his Cat.

* '''14w, 14b, 15w:''' These moves are nearly forced on each side. Each player is getting what he wants, and oddly, each player is happy with the resulting position. Fritzlein believes that the Camel hostage will be worth more than a Cat, and Omar thinks the Cat will be worth more. The last word on this trade-off has not yet been written, but it is quite probable that Fritzlein, if he is winning at all, is winning by less than a Rabbit.

* '''15b:''' Omar is very constrained by the need to keep his Elephant adjacent to f6. His only active plans are (1) Repeat his Cat-capturing maneuver with his Elephant to capture another of Fritzlein's pieces in f3, or (2) Flood the east side of the board with little pieces to hem in Fritzlein's Elephant and free Omar's Elephant to roam the board. Fritzlein therefore immediately disrupts both of Omar's potential plans by stationing a Horse adjacent to f3.

* '''16w:''' Omar just as quickly abandons his hostage Camel for an opportunity to capture a Horse. This calls into question Fritzlein's judgement on move 15b. Should Fritzlein have made a move which would do less delay to a piece flood in the east, but also not give Omar the option of trading? Too few games of this nature have been played to answer this question definitively, but for the second time each player gets what he wants, and an unbalanced position results.

* '''16b:''' The only question for Fritzlein is whether to end the move with his Elephant on e6, f5, or g6. Ending on g6 would threatening Omar's Rabbit immediately, but it would be better to have the Elephant centralized in case Omar attacks Fritzlein's heavy pieces around c6. Leaving the Elephant on e6 is more attractive, since that would deprive Omar of the best square for defending f6. The tradeoff would be leaving the g-file more open for Omar's Elephant to dive in to pull Fritzlein's Rabbits as well as generate a minor goal threat.

* '''17w:''' Omar grabs the prime defensive spot on e6, where his Elephant can defend f6 as well as influencing c6 and disrupting Fritzlein's ability to rebalance his forces. The Horse step is very important, as Omar has his eye on g6 again.

* '''17b:''' Fritzlein fails to understand Omar's designs on g6, and does nothing to correct the bad balance of his forces. He has a Camel and a Horse on one side, and two Dogs on the other. He would be much better off with a Dog on each side and the Camel and Horse split. Fritzlein's threat to the h6 Rabbit is premature and impotent.

* '''18w:''' Omar advances his Horse, while bringing up other pieces to unfreeze it at need and to keep f3 safe.

* '''18b:''' Fritzlein belatedly realizes his Dog on g6 is overmatched, and starts switching wings with his Camel.

* '''19w:''' Omar takes advantage of the temporary misplacement of Fritzlein's pieces lauch an Elephant-Horse attack on f6. This attack removes the danger to Omar's h6 Rabbit, ties up Fritzlein's Elephant, and forces Fritzlein's Camel to come across to relieve the pressure. On the other hand, the attack poses no immediate danger to Fritzlein, and it effectively forces him to do a reblancing of forces he needed to do anyway. If Omar has to retreat his Horse soon, it will be a net loss of time.

* A final argument against this Horse advance is that Fritzlein can't afford to frame the h6-Rabbit anyway until after his Camel has finished crossing, because if he completes the frame with a Dog on g6, Omar can break the frame anyway. Therefore Omar might have done better to hold off advancing his Horse, instead putting his Elephant on f7, with a threat to pull the f8 Rabbit and/or attack Fritzlein's Camel if it comes closer.

* '''19b:''' Fritzlein once again plays ambitiously, threatening to take Omar's exposed Horse hostage with a Camel. Omar's Dog and Rabbit on that wing have therefore also become indirectly threatened. However, in haste to complete this plan Fritzlein doesn't have a spare step to shore up the defense of the c6 trap.

* '''20w:''' Omar divides his Horse from Fritzlein's Camel. Omar's Elephant may be subject to blockade threats behind enemy lines, but it also makes incidental threats to pull Rabbits. Using the fourth step to advance the western Horse may look irrelevant, but neither side has capture threats at the moment, so there is time to spare for a move with a strategic purpose. As long as Fritzlein's Elephant and Camel are both tied up around f6, Omar's other Horse will be safe to pull a Rabbit down the a-file.

* '''20b:''' Fritzlein could occupy g6 with his Camel, pushing Omar's Horse to g5, but he doesn't want Omar to flip the f8 Rabbit to f6 in response. Fritzlein's actual move is rather sharp, as it leaves his Horse alone next to a trap, and exposes his Cat to being pushed. On the other hand, the threat to Omar's Horse is now severe.

* '''21w:''' Omar wisely chooses to retreat his Horse before it loses the option to retreat. However it is an open question whether the fourth step might not have been better spent advancing his other Horse again rather than retreating all the way to h3.

* '''21b:''' Fritzlein's Camel sits a bit awkwardly on h5, but he wants to make a threat large enough that Omar must choose to stop it rather than flipping the f8 Rabbit to f6.

* '''22w:''' Omar resists having his Dog taken hostage, and incidentally gains the small strategic advantage of getting one of Fritzlein's Rabbits off the back rank. On the other hand, he has increased the danger of an Elephant blockade.

* '''22b:''' Fritzlein now simultaneously threatens to blockade Omar's Elephant and threatens to frame the Dog in f6. This tactic leaves Omar with only one playable move, but maybe Fritzlein should have done something else, because the one move Omar can play is strong enough to free him without losses, and in a postal game Omar is unlikely to miss it. The tactics in this sequence were sufficiently complex that it isn't clear even in retrospect whether better moves by one player or the other could have tipped the balance.

* '''23w:''' Omar escapes from the threatened blockade, and makes an incidental threat to Fritzlein's b6-Horse. Thus Fritzlein's earlier sharp play succeeded in generating threats, but also left him open to counter-threats.

* '''23b:''' Fritzlein elects not to take the Dog and Rabbit in exchange for a Horse. Ordinarily this exchange would be nearly even, but experience has shown that even trades hurt the side with stronger pieces while helping the side with more numerous pieces. The [http://www.janzert.com/fame.html FAME score] agrees that Fritzlein would lose out to get DR for H, and would also lose out to get H for DR. Fritzlein needs to use the strength of his Camel to win pieces outright if the opening trade of M for HC is going to work out in his favor.

* '''24w:''' Omar has only one option for a second move in a row. His actual move is the only one to prevent the capture or frame of his f5 Dog.

* '''24b:''' Fritzlein is playing against Omar's exposed Rabbit while keeping Omar's Elephant away from his Camel. Since Omar can obviously defend his Rabbit no matter what, Fritzlein wants the Camel forward to assist in the creation of a second threat after the Rabbit is framed.

* '''25w:''' Omar defends f6 with his Elephant, and enters a race of sorts. Fritzlein will be trying to create a second threat, so that Omar's Elephant can't defend both his advanced Rabbit and the other threat. Meanwhile Omar will try to drag a Rabbit down the a-file to threaten it in c3. But Omar sagely doesn't put all his eggs in one basket by using three steps in the west, because if Fritzlein crosses wings with his Camel Omar will have to give up on Rabbit dragging to attack g6 with a Horse again. Thus Omar's move is split between defending f6, threatening the a-Rabbits, defending c3 from attack, and preventing Fritzlein's Camel from easily switching wings.

* '''25b:''' Fritzlein activates his Camel and pins Omar's Elephant to defense.

* '''26w''': Omar still does not want his Horse to be taken hostage. If Fritzlein were able to get his Camel back to g6 holding Omar's Horse on g7, it would indeed look grim for Omar.  On the other hand, perhaps it isn't so critical for Omar to avoid a Dog hostage, and a couple of steps would be better spent charging up the a-file.

* '''26b''': Fritzlein voluntarily advances a Rabbit with some thought of generating a goal threat. This is misguided, however, because Omar's defense is sufficiently thick at the moment.

* '''27w''': Omar develops his threat apace.

* '''27b''': Fritzlein rotates a Dog forward with the idea of freeing his Elephant for attack. The Dog will cover f5 so that Omar can't put a small piece on f5, freeing Omar's Elephant.

* '''28w''': Omar uses only two steps to pull the a-Rabbit and spends two to bring his Dog out of danger. He feared that Fritzlein would attack it with either his Elephant or his Camel and eventually threaten it in c6. However, it is not clear that Fritzlein can safely leave the east with his Elephant or safely cross over with his Camel. Moreover, retreating the Dog makes it rather easier for Fritzlein to take control of f3. In hindsight it would perhaps have been better for Omar to pull Fritzlein's a-Rabbit with all four steps.

* '''28b''': Fritzlein rotates his Elephant into the attack. It appears that he can now forcibly gain control of f3 against any non-Elephant defense, so in theory his second threat has been established. Fritzlein's Rabbit push to h4 doesn't pose much additional threat, though. His own west wing is now too depleted to flip Omar's Horse to g4 and launch a goal attack; indeed he rather has to seal off Omar's pieces from advancing.

* '''29w''': Omar belatedly counters the threat to f3. However, given that he can no longer protect f3 in the long run, he would be better off to abandon his framed Rabbit immediately rather than letting the situation deteriorate further.

* '''29b''': Fritzlein not only threatens Omar's Dog on f3, but also attempts to seal off the Gold pieces from coming to the rescue of f6. If Omar could support f6, he would be able to score a goal more quickly than Fritzlein, regardless of any losses suffered in f3. However, it appears that if Omar doesn't defend f3, Fritzlein has time to capture a Dog and fall back in defense quickly enough to prevent goal.

* '''30w''': Suddenly Omar can't bring his Elephant back on defense without losing either his d3-Cat or his f3-Dog, so he must delay his Elephant retreat for another move.

* '''30b''': Fritzlein has won the race. Omar faces unacceptable losses in f3, and therefore must give up on f6. In spite of this, Fritzlein's &quot;victory move&quot; of flipping Omar's Dog to g4 was actually a serious strategic blunder. To instead flip Omar's Horse to g4 would have forced Omar's retreat just as effectively, while also creating the strategic plus of getting Omar's Horse out of position where it could later be threatened. In general Camels much prefer to attack Horses than Dogs.

* '''31w''': Omar must retreat his Elephant, but it is worth considering pushing Fritzlein's Dog to e4 rather than f5. Pushing to e4 would create a stronger threat to take Fritzlein's Camel hostage. On the other hand, it would give Fritzlein slightly greater potential to launch a double-trap attack, contesting control of both c3 and f3, while rolling forward Rabbits on both sides of the board. If Fritzlein were able to share control of both of Omar's home traps, it could in certain circumstances be enough of a strategic advantage to compensate for a Camel hostage. Timing would be critical in such a wild attack.

* Just as Omar was not particularly distraught to give up his own Camel hostage, he is not overly eager to take Fritzlein's Camel hostage.  Omar's push to f5 allows Fritzlein's Camel to escape much more easily, but this does not necessarily lead to disadvantage. If the Camel runs away Fritzlein's advanced Rabbits are simply weak.

* '''31b''': Fritzlein seizes the opportunity to run with his Camel, carrying a Dog hostage, no less. A double-trap attack is not Fritzlein's style, so he wants to avoid a Camel hostage at all costs. A free-roaming Camel represents his only advantage over Omar. If Omar gets the Camel hostage, Fritzlein might not get as much compensation (a full Cat) as Omar did in the opening.

* '''32w''': Omar temporarily ignores the threat to his Dog in order to prevent Fritzlein from creating any threats elsewhere, in particular an Elephant-Horse attack on c3. With the given material imbalance, it would be devastating if Fritzlein got an Elephant-Horse attack rolling, because Omar has no Camel to defend with, and defending with his Elephant would leave Fritzlein's Camel to rampage unimpeded.

* '''32b''': Fritzlein gets his Camel a step further from Omar's Elephant and puts another Rabbit in between for safety. Incidentally he threatens Omar's Dog with capture.

* '''33w''': Omar defends f6 and shores up the defense of the east corner against any possible goal attack.

* '''33b''': Fritzlein threatens to frame Omar's Dog, which Omar could ill afford. Omar would have no way to break the frame, and Fritzlein's Elephant would then roam free.

* '''34w''': Omar prevents the frame and retreats into a compact position. His position now has no weaknesses other than the hostage Dog, which will make it very difficult for Fritzlein to create a second threat.

* '''34b''': Fritzlein plays an amusing move. His plan is to threaten Omar's Dog from behind the trap in such a way that the Camel will not be exposed to any danger of being taken hostage. This plan is far too slow, however, given that Omar can quickly set up threats to Fritzlein's Rabbits on a5 and h4.

* '''35w''': Omar threatens a Rabbit frame.

* '''35b''': Fritzlein occupies e3, a good defense point for his Elephant, and laboriously continues his action against Omar's Dog. Now that Fritzlein's Elephant is tied up defending a small threat rather than generating a big threat, it should be clear that Fritzlein has misunderstood the position.

* '''36w''': Omar pins Fritzlein's Elephant. Now it is his turn to attempt to overload Fritzlein's defense. If Omar creates a second threat, Fritzlein's Elephant will not be able to defend them both.

* '''36b''': Fritzlein gets his Cat out of the way and moves Omar's Dog a square closer to being threatened. The Cat comes forward to threaten to occupy f4, which would free Fritzlein's Elephant.

* '''37w''': Omar blocks the Cat and rotates forward his Horse. His Horse and Elephant combined represent a serious threat to take control of f6.

* '''37b''': Fritzlein finally threatens the Dog. Also he aligns his Cats and Rabbits so that neither Omar's Elephant nor his Horse can get to g6 in one move.

* '''38w''': Omar clears the path to g6.

* '''38b''': Fritzlein re-establishes the block to g6, but he has become very worried. It is finally clear that he doesn't have the resources to frame Omar's Dog, and there is no second threat in sight which would overload Omar's Elephant. He would like to pass the hostage Dog off to his Horse so that his Camel could operate against Omar's Horse, but that is another slow plan, and it could be disrupted by Omar's Elephant moving up the middle.

* '''39w''': Omar seals off the east wing to prevent any goal threats, and moves against Fritzlein's exposed Rabbit on a5. He is careful to support his advanced Horse so that Fritzlein has no opportunity to abandon his framed Rabbit, switch wings with his Elephant, and quickly generate a second threat.

* '''39b''': Unless he does something drastic, Fritzlein will lose this race. Omar will soon have a second threat, and Fritzlein will not. Fritzlein must abandon his framed Rabbit to activate his Elephant. Yet it is not clear how much play this will buy him, since Omar has minimized vulnerabilities in his own position, and can quickly threaten another of Fritzlein's h-Rabbits. In desperation to generate counterplay, Fritzlein leaves his west wing underdefended, and advances his Horse into Omar's territory.

* Fritzlein's advanced Horse serves a dual function. It threatens to burrow behind f3 to release the framed Rabbit (possibly even scoring a goal), and it threatens the c3 trap somewhat in conjunction with Fritzlein's Elephant crossing over. However, both of these plans will take longer to come to fruition than the damage Omar could do around the c6 trap.

* '''40w''': Omar makes his biggest mistake of the game. Had he played against c6 immediately, he would have launched a race to goal with time on his side. His threat to Fritzlein's Horse instead squandered a couple of steps in the goal race.

* '''40b''': Fritzlein removes his Horse so that Omar can't set up a one-turn capture threat against it. If Omar could threaten the Horse again in one turn, then that would trump the threat to Omar's Dog, and 40w would have been good strategy after all. Tactics and strategy are closely interwoven: the presence of a certain tactic (like Fritzlein hiding his Horse) can make an otherwise good strategy turn sour.

* '''41w''': Omar can't now afford to return to defending his Dog from capture in f6, because Fritzlein's Horse is two moves closer to digging out the f3-Rabbit from behind. Omar therefore launches the attack on c6 that he could have started on move 40b. The difference of delay is that now he must give up his Dog to get the attack rolling.

* '''41b''': Fritzlein can't defend c6, and can't generate a fast enough threat to get the f3-Rabbit to goal, so he snatches the Dog before his west wing implodes.

* '''42w''': Omar captures a Rabbit and pushes his Rabbit forward one step, only five steps from goal on a clear line. Fritzlein's west side is in tatters.

* '''42b''': Fritzlein has no choice but to defend with his Elephant, abandoning his framed Rabbit. The exchange of two Rabbits for a Dog is actually slightly in Omar's favor, but Fritzlein's Elephant is no longer pinned, and he no longer faces material threats. Indeed, it is Fritzlein who is in a better position to make the next material threats. Omar's only remaining trump card is having an extra Rabbit with which to make goal threats.

* According to [http://www.janzert.com/fame.html FAME], Fritzlein was materially +25 to have captured M for HC in the opening, and now having captured MDR for HCRR he has extended the advantage to +66. On the other hand, his forces are temporarily very poorly placed, with all his officers on the east wing so the west wing still vulnerable to goal attack despite the Elephant defending. Omar may be able to capitalize on this weakness before Fritzlein can favorably re-align his slightly stronger army.

* '''43w''': Omar shores up the defense of c3 and prevents his Horse from being taken hostage. Superficially this is reasonable, because the consequences of a Horse hostage look dire. Omar's Elephant would be tied to the defense of c6 while Fritzlein's Camel and Horse could quickly generate a second material threat.

* What this calculation leaves out, however, is that goal threats are inherently more forceful than material threats. Omar has nothing to lose by advancing at least one Rabbit in the east without delay, as Fritzlein will be too busy defending to make progress elsewhere. His only parallel concern should be dividing his four steps between goal defense (against the a5 Rabbit) and goal attack.

* '''43b''': Fritzlein supports the defense of c6 with a Dog, and inches his Camel closer to Omar's Horse.

* '''44w''': Again Omar incorrectly plays the material game rather than the goal game. His Horse now can't be taken hostage, true, but the threat to Fritzlein's Rabbit is illusory given the proximity of Fritzlein's d1-Horse. Indeed, given that Fritzlein has the stronger army, it will in general be extremely difficult for Omar to create two simultaneous material threats. For him to gain ground materially, he needs at least one of his two threats to be a goal threat.

* '''44b''': Fritzlein defends his threatened Rabbit and prevents Omar's Elephant from centralizing.

* '''45w''': Omar correctly launches a goal attack (finally), although now Fritzlein has a Dog helping on defense which wasn't there two moves ago.

* '''45b''': Fritzlein is in a delicate situation. He can't easily create a goal threat, and his only hope of generating two material threats it to activate his Camel. On the other hand, activating his Camel will expose it to danger should Omar choose to switch wings with his Elephant. Fritzlein decides he has time to play the material game for one more move, time that his c7 Dog buys him. However, this requires accurate forecasting of the strength of Omar's attack. In a live game Fritzlein's move would be intolerably risky, as there would be no way to be sure his west wing defenses would be adequate.

* '''46w''': Omar correctly ignores Fritzlein's threats in the west and presses his goal attack in the east.

* '''46b''': Fritzlein does the minimum to defend while pressing his western attack. Again, this requires very precise calculation to be playable, but prevents him from being forced into a totally passive posture on defense.

* '''47w''': Omar continues to play strongly. Fritzlein's defense now hangs by a thread.

* '''47b''': Fritzlein plays the only move to save his position. Omar's threats are so sharp that Fritzlein's position would crumble if, for example, he took Omar's Horse hostage on a6 instead of b7. Furthermore, it was necessary for Fritzlein to have calculated this correct defense already on move 45b. Thinking five or six ply ahead is possible only postally, and even then only in extremity of need.

* '''48w''': Omar must now realize that his attack can't break through, but his continued advance regains mobility for his Elephant, saving his threatened Horse and creating alternative attacking possibilities.

* '''48b''': Fritzlein is forced to release the Horse he is holding hostage, which in itself proves the correctness of Omar offering it as a hostage on move 47w, and again calls into question Omar's refusing to offer it as a hostage on 45w.

* '''49w''': Omar's Rabbit is now far enough from goal that Fritzlein is threatening to enter a goal race by capturing Omar's b3 Cat. Omar has several reasonable options for dividing between attack and defense; the chosen move leans towards eventual disengagement.

* '''49b''': Fritzlein's move appears to be a threat to Omar's b6-Horse, but in fact, since the Horse can retreat, the move is aimed equally at the d5-Rabbit. Omar can't save one without losing the other.

* '''50w''': Rather than defend or delay, Omar opts to trade Horses. The advantage of making an even trade is that every trade weakens the importance of Fritzlein's Camel and raises the importance of Omar's extra Rabbit. The disadvantage of the trade is that Omar's Elephant loses time leaving the west wing when it will have to return to save his f4 Horse and/or threaten Fritzlein's Camel.

* '''50b''': Fritzlein has no choice but to accept the offered trade, since he can't defend his own Horse.

* '''51w''': Omar now offers the additional trade of Horse and Rabbit for Dog and Rabbit. This puts him even further behind in terms of strong pieces, but also thins out the board a bit more, which works to the advantage of the side with more numerous pieces.

* '''51b, 52w''': Fritzlein again has little alternative to Omar's offer, and Omar must stick to the course he has charted.

* '''52b''': Fritzlein captures the Rabbit before the Horse, since Omar's Horse is doomed anyway, and once the Rabbit is gone Omar's goal threats disappear. Putting the Elephant on c5 rather than d6 lends extra defense to the depleted west wing.

* '''53w''': Omar's Cat is scared by Fritzlein's Elephant, and captures to c2 so that Omar's Elephant can leave next move without hanging the Cat. However, given that Fritzlein's west wing has been denuded once again, Omar will probably want to launch another Rabbit up that side before long. Leaving the Cat on b3 after the capture might therefore have been more strategically sound.

* '''53b''': For the second time in the mid-game, Omar's failure to be aggressive in the west encourages Fritzlein to make a material-oriented play while leaving a minimal goal defense. He couldn't have afforded to centralize his Elephant if Omar's Cat had stayed on b3, but with the Cat on c2 it is just barely possible.

* The point of Fritzlein's Elephant steps is to eventually attain a favorable alignment of pieces. If Fritzlein's Dog ends up opposite Omar's Dog, then Fritzlein's Camel will be opposite Omar's Cat(s), and Omar's Elephant will do nothing but chase Fritzlein's Camel.  In the worst case, Omar would take Fritzlein's Camel hostage and totally neutralize his material advantage. If, on the other hand, Fritzlein's Dog ends up opposite Omar's Cat(s) and Fritzlein's Camel ends up opposite Omar's Dog, Omar will be threatened on both wings at once, and his Elephant will eventually become overloaded.

* '''54w''': As before, Omar has no hope of creating two material threats, so he wisely starts setting up a goal threat.

* '''54b''': Fritzlein defends with his Dog rather than with his Elephant, for the piece-alignment reasons mentioned above.

* '''55w''': Omar intensifies the goal threat, threatening to keep Fritzlein's Dog on the wrong wing.

* '''55b''': Fritzlein stubbornly refuses to defend with his Elephant, which would release Omar's Dog to switch wings. Instead he brings his Cat to e6 to prevent his Dog from being pushed there. Fritzlein is starting to feel a pinch because his eastern Rabbits are too advanced to participate in defense of f6, yet not far enough advanced to be a direct goal threat.

* '''56w''': Omar re-creates the goal threat, and astutely advances a Rabbit to c3. This late in the game one doesn't have the luxury of keeping Rabbits on the back row for goal defense, because they are more necessary for trap defense and for the creation of goal threats.

* '''56b''': Fritzlein defends the goal threat, and attempts to complete the re-alignment of his forces.

* '''57w''': Omar makes a strategic mistake. It is necessary for him to push Fritzlein's Dog back into the c6 trap, keeping alive the possibility of goal threats in the east. His threats against Fritzlein's Camel are much less pressing. Early in the game nothing is more important than a Camel, but late in the game goal threats loom large. Given that Fritzlein's Dog is now favorably aligned, Fritzlein might gain the option of attacking in the east with Elephant and Dog to create a goal threat, sacrificing his Camel in the west to buy time.

* '''57b''': Fritzlein keeps Omar's Dog on the wrong side, and moves his Camel further west to force Omar's Elephant to choose between extremes.

* '''58w''': Omar plays consistent with his mistake on 57w. After this move he is strategically lost.

* '''58b''': Fritzlein finishes aligning his Dog to the west. He is happy to have his Cat linger on defense in the east while his Rabbits are forward to support his Camel and eventually create goal threats. Cats are the one type of piece which are strategically happiest to spend the entire game in the home half of the board.

* '''59w''': Omar continues to play against Fritzlein's Camel, now directly threatening it with capture. Also his Rabbit advance is tactically tricky to meet. However, given his poor strategic situation, tactical tricks are all that remain to Omar.  At postal speeds, Fritzlein has plenty of time to be careful.

* '''59b''': Fritzlein now offers his Camel to be taken hostage for the price of only Omar's c4 Rabbit. It may seem odd that he was happy to get a Camel hostage in the opening for a whole Cat, while now he is happy to give up a Camel hostage for a mere Rabbit, but the relative piece values have changed immensely since then. The Camel has sharply declined in value relative to the little pieces.

* When one is defending a Camel hostage in the opening, one's Elephant has the option of leaving at any time in pursuit of some other prize. Usually that other prize is a Horse at best, i.e. something worth less than the hostage Camel. In an endgame, in contrast, an elepant can abandon a hostage Camel in pursuit of a goal, i.e. something worth more than a Camel. Thus not only does the value of the Camel itself decline, the value of the Camel hostage declines.

* '''60w''': Omar decides he can't afford to accept the offered hostage. His crossing underscores the importance of Fritzlein stepping his Rabbit to e4 on move 59b. It costs Omar one step in the goal race.

* '''60b to end''': Fritzlein's win is now a matter of patience and technique. He has time to calculate variations exactly to be sure that his goal threats will always land home one move sooner than Omar's, so Omar must always defend rather than racing. The fact that Fritzlein's threats are always stronger has nothing whatsoever to do with the relative tactical ability of the two players. On the contrary, it all traces back to the piece re-alignment of moves 53b to 58b. With a different position it would be Omar's extra Rabbit causing his goal threats to be eventually unstoppable.

* On move 63w Fritzlein's Dog is only optically threatened, as Omar would allow a goal in two moves by capturing it. When Omar finally concedes on move 64w that his Elephant must retreat to prevent goal, Fritzlein completely shuts down any counterplay and indicates an intention to win materially rather than force an immediate goal.  Facing a painful mop-up operation, Omar decides with move 67w to go down shooting rather than be paralyzed.

* '''Conclusion''' In the end the stronger pieces prevailed over the more numerous pieces, but this was far from an inevitability. On the contrary, each side outplayed the other strategically in various phases of the game, causing the probable outcome to swing back and forth. Until move 58, the game remained rich and balanced, with deep opportunities for both sides to uncover within the position.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: comunicate → communicate, dowload → download, the the → the using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the tutorial for Equip4j. In a few words equip4j implements (and not only) the concept of dataspace. A dataspace may be interpreted as a middleware solution for distributed computing. 

Equip4j is a Java library developed for the Equator project (http://www.equator.ac.uk/). The source code can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/equip.

== How does it work? ==
[[Image:Equip02.gif]]

Basically, equip4j provides a Java library that exploits the concept of dataspaces. One way to view the way equip4j works is by the three roles of software components: the server, the consumers and the producers. The consumers can make subscriptions to any kind of tuples(1), the producers post tuples (or updates to these) to the server (2), and the server processes and notifies the consumers about new tuples (3,4).  Any software component may assume the consumer or producer role.

For ease of implementation, Equip4j provides libraries for handling, managing and distributing tuples through the JavaBean framework.  Most of the documentation here provided deals with the libraries surrounding this particular JavaBean support in equip4j.

== The Class Tuple ==

A tuple &quot;''is a finite sequence of objects''&quot; or elements (simillar to a row in  a database). In equip4j, a tuple is a generic class used to interchange information between producers and consumers. In equip there are two subclasses of tuples: Tuple and TupleEvents.

Elements in equip tuples are stored in an array. The way to create a tuple is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
Tuple message =new TupleImpl(new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Chat&quot;),
                             new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Peter&quot;),
                             new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Hello!&quot;),
                             new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Jane&quot;));
&lt;/source&gt;

This tuple can represent a chat message (Hello) form Peter to Jane. As the elements of the tuple are in an array, the order of the elements remains the same and can have meaning, i.e. the second element is the &quot;sender of the message&quot;. Notice each element in the tuple is a subclass of the ValueBase class, in the example StringBoxImpl is used to send strings. Furthermore, the class Tuple has two other fields: &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, the elements are stored in the field &lt;code&gt;fields&lt;/code&gt;.

The current contructors allow a certain maximum number fields.  In case you require more than the current maximum number of fields (in &lt;code&gt;fields&lt;/code&gt;), it is possible to manipulate the field  &lt;code&gt;fields&lt;/code&gt; directly as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
   Tuple message =new TupleEventImpl();
   message.fields = new ValueBase[12];
   message.fields[0] = new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Chat&quot;);
   message.fields[1] = new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Peter&quot;);
   ...
   message.fields[10]= new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Hello!&quot;),
   message.fields[11]= new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Jane&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

About nulls in the fields the following are the possibilities:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;  
   message.fields[0] = new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Chat&quot;);       /* Correct*/
  
   message.fields[1] = new StringBoxImpl(null);         /* Correct but DANGEROUS */
     	
   message.fields[9] = null;                            /* Correct and recommended*/
&lt;/source&gt;

== The Class DataspaceBean ==

The class DataspaceBean represents the server and allows the programs (consumers and producers) to communicate with the server (as a proxy). The form to create an instance of this class is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
DataspaceBean mydataspace = DataSpaceBean();
... 
mydataspace.setDataspaceUrl(&quot;equp://127.0.0.1:9123&quot;);
...
&lt;/source&gt;
 
In the example is supposed there is a equip server running at the IP address 127.0.0.1 (local machine) and at the port 9123.

The form to post a new Tuple in the server is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
/* first create the tuple*/
Tuple message =new TupleImpl(new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Chat&quot;),
                             new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Peter&quot;),
                             new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Hello!&quot;),
                             new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Jane&quot;));
/* then, put name and id */
message.id=mydataspace.allocateId();
message.name=&quot;chat_message&quot;;
 
/* finally add the tuple to the dataspace */
... 
mydataspace.add(message);
...
&lt;/source&gt;

If the tuple to add is an &quot;event&quot;, must be added to the dataspace as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
mydataspace.addEvent(myeventTuple);
...
&lt;/source&gt;

It is good idea to initialize the metadata filed of the event in case you don´t want to generate a warnig when the event is added. Two forms to initialize the metadata (merely as examples):

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
this.localGUID=mydataspace.allocateId();
...
myeventTuple.initMetadata(localGUID,false,true);
  
//or
  
myeventTuple.initMetadata(null,true,false);
...
&lt;/source&gt;

== The Interface DataspaceEventListener ==

This interface must be implemented by the consumers, in case the consumer wants to be notified about events, for instace, new tuples posted in the server. The method &lt;code&gt;dataspaceEvent(DataspaceEvent event)&lt;/code&gt; must be implemented to process the events. When invoked, the dataspaceEvent receives as parameter a DataspaceEvent class. The DataspaceEvent class allows to retreive the posted tuple by the producer. 

The form to implement listener is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
...
class MyListener implements DataspaceEventListener (...)
...
 
public void dataspaceEvent( DataspaceEvent myevent)
...
/* process my event in case of AddEvent */
  if (myevent.getEvent() instance of AddEvent) {
     Tuple mytuple = (Tuple) event.getAddItem();
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that there exists several types of events.

Finally, the form to subscribe to events type &quot;AddEvent&quot; is as follows.
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
MyListener mylistener(...); 
...
/* the mytupletemplate represents the kind of tuples mylistener wants to consume*/
/* nulls can be used as wildcards                                     */
Tuple mytupletemplate = new Tupleimpl (new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Chat&quot;),new StringBoxImpl(&quot;Jane&quot;), null, null); 
mytupletemplate.name=&quot;chat_message&quot;;
...
mydataspace.addDataspaceEventListener(mytupletemplate,false, mylistener)
&lt;/source&gt;

The code above allows '''mylistener''' to receive notifications (events) when a producer post (adds) tuples with the words &quot;Chat&quot; and  &quot;Jane&quot; in the first two elemens of the array, the '''name''' equals to &quot;chat_message&quot; and any other information in the other fields (again, null is a wildcard).

==Using equip ==
=== Running equip as server ===

The simply way to run equip as server is as follows:

 java -cp &lt;equip-jar-path&gt; equip.data.server equip://&lt;ip-address&gt;:&lt;portnumber&gt; 

As concrete example to run equip in the current machine (equip4j.jar must be placed in the directory where the command is executed):

Gluten is a protein found as a major component of [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]], [[Cookbook:Rye|rye]] and [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]].
Gluten can be separated from the [[Cookbook:Starch|starch]] and is useful to make dough more elastic and bread
made with additional gluten is more firm, remains fresh and in its form. 

[[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]] is graded by its gluten content, with bread flour having the most, and pastry flour, the least. The more widely-available all-purpose flour is a compromise between the two, having an intermediate amount of gluten.

Gluten develops its firmness as dough or batter is &quot;worked&quot;.  In a relatively dry dough, as is used in most breads, this development of structure causes the dough to be noticeably firmer as kneading progresses.  In looser doughs, such as those used for [[Cookbook:Focaccia|focaccia]] or certain thin-crust, high-temperature [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] doughs, working of the dough is necessary but its effects aren't apparent until the dough is baked.

For most pastries, the development of gluten is undesirable.  [[Cookbook:Pie Crust|Pie crust]] and [[Cookbook:Sugar Cookies|sugar cookies]] are common examples.  Recipes of this type often warn against the toughness that results from over-working the dough.

Gluten is the main component of [[Cookbook:Seitan|Seitan]], a versatile meat substitute.

Threading in python is used to run multiple threads (tasks, function calls) at the same time. Note that this does not mean that they are executed on different CPUs. Python threads will NOT make your program faster if it already uses 100 % CPU time. In that case, you probably want to look into parallel programming. If you are interested in parallel progamming with python, please see [http://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing here].
 
Python threads are used in cases where the execution of a task involves some waiting. One example would be interaction with a service hosted on another computer, such as a webserver. Threading allows python to execute other code while waiting; this is easily simulated with the sleep function. 

== Examples ==
=== A Minimal Example with Function Call ===
Make a thread that prints numbers from 1-10, waits for 1 sec between:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import threading
import time

def loop1_10():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        time.sleep(1)
        print(i)

threading.Thread(target=loop1_10).start()
&lt;/source&gt;

=== A Minimal Example with Object ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
import threading
import time
from __future__ import print_function

class MyThread(threading.Thread):
    def run(self):
        print(&quot;{} started!&quot;.format(self.getName()))              # &quot;Thread-x started!&quot;
        time.sleep(1)                                      # Pretend to work for a second
        print(&quot;{} finished!&quot;.format(self.getName()))             # &quot;Thread-x finished!&quot;

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for x in range(4):                                     # Four times...
        mythread = MyThread(name = &quot;Thread-{}&quot;.format(x + 1))  # ...Instantiate a thread and pass a unique ID to it
        mythread.start()                                   # ...Start the thread
        time.sleep(.9)                                     # ...Wait 0.9 seconds before starting another
&lt;/source&gt;

This should output:
 Thread-1 started!
 Thread-2 started!
 Thread-1 finished!
 Thread-3 started!
 Thread-2 finished!
 Thread-4 started!
 Thread-3 finished!
 Thread-4 finished! 

'''Note:''' this example appears to crash IDLE in Windows XP (seems to work in IDLE 1.2.4 in Windows XP though)

There seems to be a problem with this, if you replace Sleep(1) with (2) ,and change range (4) to range(10). Thread -2 finished is the first line before its even started. in WING IDE, Netbeans, eclipse is fine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Toyota Prius TOC}}
The Prius has been called a true hybrid vehicle, designed from the bottom up. Toyota's goal for the Prius was to reduce the amount of pollutants it produced and to be as energy-efficient as possible. They used several methods to try to achieve this goal, including:
#More efficient use of the internal combustion engine (ICE), reducing gasoline consumption. The Toyota 1NZ-FXE engine uses the more efficient [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_cycle Atkinson cycle] instead of the more common Otto cycle;
#Two electric motor/generators, providing 50&amp;nbsp;kW (67&amp;nbsp;hp) @ 1,200 to 1,540&amp;nbsp;rpm and 400&amp;nbsp;N&amp;middot;m (295 ft&amp;middot;lbf) torque from 0 to 1,200 rpm, which significantly contribute to performance &amp; economy;
#50&amp;nbsp;kW IGBT inverter controlled by a 32 bit microprocessor, which efficiently converts power between the batteries and the motor/generators.
#Lower Drag coefficient of drag at 0.26 (0.29 for 2000 model), reducing air resistance especially at higher speeds;
#Lower rolling-resistance tires on the 2000 model, reducing road friction;
#Regenerative braking, a process for recovering kinetic energy when braking or traveling down a slope and storing it as electrical energy in the traction battery for later use while reducing wear and tear on the brake pads;
#Sealed 168 cell nickel metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable battery providing 201.6 volts;
#Continuously variable transmission — the Prius does not use a typical CVT; Toyota calls it the [http://web.archive.org/20031010025736/home.earthlink.net/~graham1/MyToyotaPrius/Understanding/PowerSplitDevice.htm Power Split Device]. The electric motors and gas engine are connected to a planetary gear set which is always engaged, and there is no shifting.
#Flexible resin gas tank, reducing the amount of hydrocarbon emissions in the form of escaped gasoline vapor;
#Vacuum flask coolant storage system that stores hot engine coolant, then reuses it to reduce warm-up time.
#Weight reduction — for example the hatch and hood are made of aluminium instead of steel.

Touted advantages of the Prius over previous energy-efficient designs include never needing to be plugged in, as all power is ultimately delivered from the gasoline engine. This means it drives like a traditional ICE automobile, with the onboard computer taking care of shifting power to and from the engine and motors, and automatically determining when to charge the battery, as well as the most efficient use of the engine or the electric motors (or both) based on driving conditions. This also means that one can not choose to use electricity from other sources to power this vehicle; some consider this to be serious disadvantage. The Prius uses energy that would be otherwise wasted: i.e. when braking, the kinetic energy is partly recovered to recharge the battery instead of being wasted as heat and brake wear. 

The engine is permitted to shut down once it has warmed up and the catalytic converter in the exhaust system has reached operating temperature. Once this occurs, the Prius can be driven on electric power only; this is sometimes referred to as &quot;stealth mode&quot; due to the lack of engine noise. This further reduces gasoline consumption and wear and tear on the engine. When driving conditions demand additional power from the engine, it is designed to start up automatically.

As well as the immediate benefit of reducing fuel consumption and emissions, stopping the engine also improves the performance of the catalytic converter, as in a normal vehicle the exhaust gases from an idling engine tend to cool the catalysts below their optimal temperature.

Frequent starting up and shutting down of the engine does not cause additional wear and tear nor emission problems, as in conventional automobiles, because the drive motors have enough power to quickly and smoothly spin the engine to optimal rpm (around 1,000) before the engine actually begins to &quot;fire up&quot;. This avoids wear when the engine is &quot;running&quot; (with fuel and spark) at very low rpm, as happens in most vehicles. 

The Prius gets better fuel efficiency in the city because the batteries get used more, whereas on the highway, the engine is used in order to recharge the batteries, and the wind resistance is higher.

==Awards==
* 2005 European Car of the Year (Toyota Prius 2nd generation with 406 points, ahead of Citroën C4 with 267 points and Ford Focus II with 228) [http://www.di-ve.com/dive/portal/portal.jhtml?id=161929&amp;pid=null]
* ''Motor Trend'' Motor Trend Car of the Year 2004 (January 2004 issue)
* ''Car and Driver'' magazine's Car and Driver Ten Best list for 2004.
* The Prius also won the ''North American Car of the Year'' award for 2004 and was nominated in 2001.
* 2003 ''Scientific American'' names Toyota Motor Corporation as &quot;Business Leader of the Year&quot; (&quot;Scientific American 50&quot;; December, 2003) for its singular accomplishment in the commercialization of affordable hybrid cars.

==Notable facts==
*Due to the success of both the engineering and sales of the Prius, in 2005, Toyota has released a hybrid V-6 engine for the Lexus RX400h and a hybrid engine version of the Highlander. 
*Toyota is also actively developing a hydrogen-fuel-cell engine. They have already successfully developed a RAV4 that can achieve 900 miles (1450 km) on one tank of hydrogen.
*The Prius fuel tank holds 45 litres (11.9 US gal), although the internal bladder in American models limits the fill, giving a range of up to 600 miles (1,000 km).
*In August 2004, Toyota began a Special Service Campaign (SSC 40G), affecting most previous generation Prius cars manufactured between 2001 and mid-2003. This repair involves re-sealing terminals on the high-voltage battery to avoid minor electrolyte leakage. Repairs will be performed free of charge on affected automobiles.
*Starting with the 2004 model, Toyota is now producing the Prius on a standard mass production assembly line, resulting in one being produced every minute instead of one every 8 to 10 minutes. The use of a standard assembly line has dropped the manufacturing cost significantly, allowing Toyota to deliver a substantially upgraded model, which in turn has generated publicity and popularity. The limiting factor in Prius (and Lexus RX400h) production now appears to be third party component availability, particularly batteries.
*The battery pack of the 2004 Prius is guaranteed for 100,000 miles (160,000 km) or 8 years, although Toyota has stated that they expect it to last 15 years. The warranty is extended to 150,000 miles (240,000 km) or 10 years for Prius in California and several other states that adopted the Californian emission control standards.
*In May 2005, Finnish anti-virus firm F-Secure Corp. has tested a Prius for Bluetooth vulnerabilities in the on-board mobile telephony and computer systems and [http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-052005.html#00000553 found the car has performed &quot;admirably&quot;.]
*On June 1, 2005, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the US started an investigation on the 33 reported cases of engine stalling when the Prius travels at highway speed. The cars were still operatable under battery power with substantial loss of power when the internal combustion engine failed to run. Toyota believes it was due to a computer programming error that was fixed in a recall (SSC-40D) issued back in September, 2004. The investigation needs to verify if all the reported cases occurred to the cars that didn't receive the software fix. Some supporters argued that 33 cases (of which some were duplicate reports and/or valid out-of-gas conditions) among 75000+ cars sold was not an alarming percentage figure compared to the millions other auto makers have recalled. Besides, the Prius is safer than any other car with a failed engine, as the Prius can still run with its electric motor until it can stop at a safe location.

====Celebrities====
*Larry David, co-creator of Seinfeld and star of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' drives a Prius.
*Bill Maher, host of the HBO series ''Real Time with Bill Maher'', drove a Prius for 3 years before trading it in for the Lexus RX 400h hybrid.
*Not only did actor Leonardo Dicaprio buy himself a Prius, he bought several for others in his family.
*In Gilmore Girls, Rory drives a first generation Prius which she received as a high school graduation gift from her grandparents.
*Brian Griffin of the show Family Guy drives a Prius (which inexplicably appeared in the fourth season of the show).
*Claire Fisher of the show Six Feet Under drove a Prius to NYC after crashing her Cadillac Hearse.
*Holly Madison, Hugh Hefner's ex-girlfriend, drives a Prius instead of her Porsche.
*Jeff Dunham drives a Prius according to his show.
*Karen Moody, Hank Moody's ex-wife from Californication drives a Prius.

The Prius 2004 model year was a complete redesign of the previous generations of Prius. The new model is based on the new (third generation) Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD), replacing the earlier Toyota Hybrid System (THS) technology. The first generation (1997 to 2003) could not run its air conditioning unless the motor was running. In contrast, the 2004 model introduced an all-electric compressor for cooling. This allowed more extensive use of the &quot;stealth mode&quot; (operation on electric motor only).

The drag coefficient of 0.26 was now the second-lowest in the industry, after the smaller Honda Insight at 0.25.

Regenerative braking was greatly improved, relying so little upon the friction-type brakes (except for panic stops) that some Toyota technicians quipped that the original brake pads might well last for the life of the car.

The 2004 Prius emerged as a midsize car with more room than the previous compact, redesigned as a &quot;five-door&quot; model (four doors plus a rear hatch). In general the car remained conveniently narrow on the outside, rather flat sided, and relatively tall (several inches taller than a Toyota Camry). The profile was much more continuous, with a short sloping nose transitioning to a highly sloped windshield and an arcing roofline ending in a cut-off Kammback. The additional height allowed a more erect seating position and a higher eye point, giving a better view of the road to the driver. There was also a surprising amount of additional rear-seat leg room, resembling that available in a much larger vehicle. Fold down rear seats with a 60/40 split made for easy carriage of most parcels.

With a smaller and lower voltage NiMH battery and an inverter to step the voltage up to 500 V, the 2004 model was more powerful (2 seconds faster in 0 to 96 km/h acceleration) and is 15% more fuel efficiency|fuel efficient than the previous generation Prius, with 60 miles per US gallon (4.3 L/100 km) city and 50 miles per US gallon (4.7 L/100 km) highway (according to the EPA). When driven appropriately, commuting and mixed suburban drivers are reporting fuel consumption of 45 to 50 miles per US gallon (5.2 to 4.7 L/100 km). See also 
[http://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/2004-02-03-hybridmileage_x.htm]

The multi-function-display (MFD) shows fuel consumption bars for each five minute segment of driving and this can encourage economical driving. The display also indicates instantaneous fuel consumption, which is useful for detecting when the vehicle has switched from electric-only to electric + ICE. At this time it can usually be advantageous to accelerate quickly rather than lug the vehicle, in an attempt to get to a more favorable location or speed range for electric-only mode.

A Smart Key System (SKS) option eliminates the traditional ignition key. The &quot;smart key&quot;, which resembles a conventional keyless entry remote, has buttons to remotely lock and unlock the door, as well as trigger the alarm system. It is not necessary to use any of the buttons to utilize the SE/SS system. Approaching to within one metre of the car while in-possession of the key (even inside a pocket or purse) causes the interior dome lights to fade in (if the switches are at the DOOR position). When the person with the key in their possession touches either of the front doors, or the rear hatchback door, that door is immediately unlocked and can be opened. There are three settings in which the Smart Key System (SKS) can operate with the default being - driver's door touched, driver's door unlock only; front passenger or rear hatchback touched, all doors unlock. Once inside, the car may be started by pushing the &quot;POWER&quot; button with the fob still safely tucked away inside your pocket or purse). To stop the car, push the &quot;POWER&quot; button again. Once parked, the car can be locked by a pushing a black button on the exterior door handle. The SKS system will detect keys left inside the vehicle when powered-off, and will not allow the vehicle to be locked in this situation.

There is no conventional ignition switch which needs to be turned to start the Prius, that function having been replaced by a simple round &quot;POWER&quot; button on the dashboard. With the SKS models, the driver only needs to sit down inside the vehicle (with the fob in their possession), press the brake with their foot and push the &quot;POWER&quot; button to start the vehicle. On cars which are not equipped with SKS, the driver uses the lock/unlock buttons on the fob, and puts the remote fob into a slot in the dash to allow the car to start.

The vehicle is classified as a SULEV (Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle), 90% cleaner than conventional gasoline-only automobiles. It comes with an Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emission Vehicle (AT-PZEV) certification by CARB (California Air Resources Board). 

As an interesting side note, an option package offered in Japan and Europe gives the Prius the ability to perform parallel and reverse parking assisted by the on-board computer — the first time such a capability has been offered on a production vehicle. Eighty percent of the Prius buyers in Japan have chosen this option. The system is not [[Artificial Intelligence|intelligent]] though, particularly lacking machine vision which would allow avoidance of obstructions or pedestrians, so it is very limited. [http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/01/15/car.selfpark.ap/index.html]

When the vehicle is turned-on with the &quot;start&quot; button, it is ready to drive immediately in &quot;EV&quot; (electric vehicle) mode, before the internal combustion engine is started to heat-up the emissions control system (including the catalytic converter). The delay between starting the car and starting the internal combustion engine is approximately seven seconds. The Asian and European versions of this vehicle provide a button labelled &quot;EV&quot; that maintains electric vehicle mode after startup, under most low-load driving conditions. The North American model does not have the &quot;EV&quot; button, although the &quot;EV&quot; mode is still supported internally by the Prius high-voltage management computer. While some have speculated that EV mode was not included on North American models in the interest of retaining the warranted battery life of 100,000 miles (160,000 km) in the US - 150,000 miles (240,000 km) in California and several other states, engineers note that EV mode is automatically overridden when the battery requires recharging from the internal combustion engine. The Prius is designed to protect the battery from extreme discharge as well as over-charge and will utilize the engine as-necessary to maintain the optimum conditions for a long battery life. In addition to information at online discussion groups, the [http://www.priusplus.org PRIUS+ Project] offers instructions for do-it-yourselfers who wish to enable the button, and aftermarket components provider [http://www.coastaletech.com/ Coastal Electronic Technologies] offers a kit. 

Evolving from the button project, [http://www.calcars.org The California Cars Initiative] (CalCars) converted a Prius in 2004, adding larger batteries, and private companies [http://www.edrivesystems.com/ EDrive Systems] in the United States and [http://www.plugin-hybrid.com Amberjac Projects] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] announced plans to sell conversion kits in 2006. CalCars initiated efforts to promote fleet purchases of plug-in hybrids to be built by automakers, and documented the emissions benefits of plug-in hybrids not only on California's clean power grid but also on the national (50% coal-fueled) power grid.

Passengers of the Prius can use their Bluetooth-enabled cellphone via the car's audio system without taking the phone out of their pocket. It is the first car released with this feature.

==Incentives==
Many governments, from the national to local levels, are offering tax and other incentives to encourage people to purchase hybrid and alternative/clean fuels vehicles.

===Carpool lane===
Drivers of the Toyota Prius, or other Hybrid-Engine automobiles are allowed to drive by themselves in Carpool (High Occupancy Vehicle) lanes in some US states such as Virginia, California (requires $8 one-time fee for a decal), Florida (requires $5 per year decal), and Utah (requires [http://dmv.utah.gov/licensespecialplates.html#cleanfuel Clean Fuel-Clean Air] license plate).

===Parking===
Los Angeles and San Jose, California and Salt Lake City, Utah allow free parking at meters for the Prius (and possibly other hybrids and clean vehicles) for the posted time limit.

===London congestion charge===
Prius drivers in London, UK, are exempt from the £8 ($14) daily London congestion charge (requires £10 per year registration).

==Sales==
*In January 2005, the Prius became available in South Africa.
*Toyota will increase production by an additional 50% for 2005, now producing 15,000 cars per month, and will import 100,000 into the United States for that model year.
*In June 2004, the Wall Street Journal reported that the backlog for 2004 Prius has reached 22,000 in the US.
*As of April 2004, the expected delivery time for Prius in the Netherlands is one year.
*As of March 2004, the waiting list at a Sonoma County, California dealership was over 100 people long.
*As of February 16, 2004, Toyota USA is not taking new internet orders for the 2004 Prius.
*As of December 14, 2003, the waiting time in Dallas, Texas, USA, was 6 months.

==Car rental==
Many Toyota dealerships offer car rentals, allowing prospective buyers to try the Prius. Futhermore, most of the major rental car agencies in the United States are offering hybrid cars for rent. Enterprise Rent A Car has the largest fleet of hybrid cars available, with more than 4000 scattered throughout the country.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  EV Rental Cars, in partnership with Fox Rent-a-Car, offers the Prius for rent at the airports in Phoenix, San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, Orange County, Los Angeles, and San Diego.

In Australia, all the major [http://www.elephantcarhire.com car rental] companies have the Prius in their rental fleets. This includes Avis, Budget, Europcar, [http://www.elephantcarhire.com/car-hire-united-kingdom/hertz-car-hire-heathrow-airport.htm Hertz heathrow] and Thrifty. Availability at a given location varies and largely depends on demand, which is high, and the size of the rental location. It is advisable to book well in advance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Again, an outline. Perhaps it'd be best to answer the question &quot;why you should learn statistics&quot; in three easy parts:

*Statistics are everywhere. (Sports, budgeting, business, polls, traffic jams - things ordinary people can relate to.)
*You can use statistics to make good decisions. (Politicians take polls, businessmen use graphs, doctors use experiments, etc.)
*Statistics breed curiosity. (It helps you question assumptions, draw conclusions, etc.)

I like the &quot;but seriously, folks&quot; take on the fictional example.</text>

'''Miscellaneous lymphoid disorders''', including '''lymphoproliferative disorders.'''

==Castleman disease==
''Synonyms:'' angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, giant lymph node hyperplasia, lymphoid hamartoma, follicular lymphoreticuloma.

Clinically presents as lymphadenopathy with or without constitutional symptoms.

Pathology: is neither purely reactive nor purely neoplastic. Etiology is unclear. HHV-8 has been implicated.

Multicentric disease can be rapidly progressive with the potential for malignant transformation.

Surgery is standard of care for unicentric Castleman disease. RT can be used with doses around 40 Gy. Combination chemotherapy and steroids are used for multicentric Castleman disease.

==Ingredients==

* 2 large [[Cookbook:Durian|durian]] fruit, remove flesh and discard the seeds
* 4 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

The salt is used as a preserving agent and thus one needs to be generous with it.

==Procedure==
#Place the durian flesh in a clean jar. Add salt, then beat the mixture until it becomes soft and creamy.
#Close the jar tightly and leave it to [[Cookbook:Fermentation|ferment]] for 1 week. 
#The fermented durian can be kept in the refrigerator for up to a year.

==Introduction to the Drug Discovery Process==

The process of drug discovery within the modern scientific context is quite complex, integrating many disciplines, including [[w:en:Structural_biology|structural biology]], [[w:en:Metabolomics|metabolomics]], [[Proteomics/Introduction_to_Proteomics|proteomics]], and computer science, just to name a few. The process is generally quite tedious and expensive, given the sheer amount of possibilities of drug-to-target interactions in-vivo, and the necessity of successfully passing rigorous pharmacokinetic studies and toxicology assays prior to even being considered for clinical trials (Burbaum). Though a more detailed explanation is offered further into this text, several key components of the drug discovery process include target selection, lead identification, and preclinical and clinical candidate selection. The schematic on the right outlines the steps involved in the drug discovery process.  

[[File:Structure-Based Drug Discovery Processs.jpg|Drug Discovery Timeline|right]]

The recent boom of the proteomics field, or the analysis of the ever dynamic organismal [[w:en:proteome|proteome]], has brought many advances with respect to the very nature of how the current drug discovery process is undertaken. The potential the field of proteomics brings in for identifying proteins involved in disease pathogenesis and physiological pathway reconstruction facilitates the ever increasing discovery of new, novel drug targets, their respective modes of action mechanistically, and their biological toxicology (Page).

The challenge in the drug discovery process is to find the exact causes of an underlying disease and find a way to negate them or bring them to normal levels. A mechanistic understanding of the nature of the disease in question is essential if we are to elucidate any target-specific remedy for it. While the causes of many documented clinical problems vary greatly in their nature and origin, in some cases, the cause is found at the protein level, involving protein function, protein regulation, or [[Proteomics/Protein_-_Protein_Interactions|protein-protein interactions]]. One example of such a disorder would be [[w:en:Alkaptonuria|alkaptonuria]], characterized by a defect in the gene coding for the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase[http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/nicezyme.pl?1.13.11.5], inhibiting the metabolism of homogentisic acid to maleylacetoacetic acid, within the phenylalanine degradation pathway (Brooker). While the underlying cause of this inborn disease is due to a single gene genetic defect, the clinical manifestations, which include excretion of black urine, are a function of the built up of homogentisic acid resulting from a defective [protein] [[Biochemistry/Enzymes|enzyme]]. 

Recent advances in applied genomics helped in the target identification process, since it allowed for high throughput screening of expressed genes. However, studies have shown that there is a poor correlation between the regulation of transcripts and actual protein quantities. The reasons for this are that genome analysis does not account for post-translational processes such as [[w:en:Post-translational_modification|protein modifications]] and [[w:en:Protein_degradation|protein degradation]]. Therefore, the methods employed in the drug-discovery process started to shift from genomics to proteomics (Burbaum). Analysis of the dynamic organismal proteome, as opposed to the static genome, will certainly bring a much more accurate approach to identifying not only applicable biomarkers that will aid in diagnosis, but also effective remedies for diseases of varying origins.  

The field of proteomics faces some daunting challenges, in comparison to genomics, for several reasons. First, protein science lacks an analogue of the [[w:en:pcr|polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), which can generate many copies of a single, native molecule in vivo (nucleic acids in the case of PCR). However, several recent approaches have been applied in an effort to ameliorate this quandary. Methods of chemical synthesis exist, being limited by yield, particularly when it comes to synthesizing lengthy peptides. In-vivo expression synthesis methods exist as well, however, this approach cannot be applied to producing proteins which may alter normal cellular function. Also, cell-free synthesis ribosome kits can also be employed for accurate and rapid protein synthesis, though the intrinsic presence of ribosome inactivating enzymes contributes to the instability of these systems (Madin). Second, in contrast to DNA, protein levels vary significantly depending on cell type and environment. Third, protein abundance is not directly correlated to protein activity. Protein activity is often determined by post-transcriptional modifications such as [[w:en:Phosphorylation|phosphorylation]]. Protein activity, not protein abundance, is of interest in the drug discovery process. Finally, proteins form many interactions with other proteins or small molecules. Elucidation of these interactions would greatly speed up the drug discovery process.  One way this is currently being done is through ligand bound x-ray crystallographic studies.

The ideal proteomics technique suited for drug discovery would have the following features: it should be able to separate membrane proteins and detect low abundance proteins, two abilities not quite yet realized, yet required in current separations and analytical techniques. Furthermore, it should be able to identify protein activity independent of protein abundance. It also should reveal protein-protein and protein-small-molecule interactions. This method should also be implemented easily, be automatable, and perform at high-throughput speed. Proteomics researchers are addressing these issues, and new methods are being developed (Burbaum). 

[[Proteomics/Proteomics_and_Drug_Discovery/Software_Tools#Virtual_Drug_and_Target_Libraries|Virtual drug libraries]] are being developed, both in the public and private sectors. These databases contain potential drug compounds; these compounds may or may not exist outside of a computer database, and new compounds developed through various methods of synthesis are continually added. Methods of modifying existing database entries to create new isomers and derivatives are also used, to more adequately cover a range of potential drug compounds.
Docking and scoring are implemented using known and hypothetical drug targets on a protein, coupled with the databases of virtual chemical compounds. In [[Proteomics/Proteomics_and_Drug_Discovery/Docking_and_Scoring|docking]], various computational methods are used to position a chemical properly within a protein binding site. [[w:en:Genetic_algorithms|Genetic algorithms]] and [[w:en:Monte_carlo_algorithm|Monte Carlo methods]] are two popular algorithms for evolving an optimum binding position. This process screens for chemicals that are potential drugs, which initially are termed as hits. After docking, scoring is carried out using mathematical models. These models determine the chemical binding strength and energy state of the drug-protein complex. Those hits with high ranking scores are suqsequently subjected to in-vivo tests; hits with positive scores in both areas are then known to be leads (Bleicher).

Evaluation of docked and scored complexes are then made, selecting an arbitrary number of top hits to be further screened manually. The first two steps are done entirely in silico; however, the best complexes now need to be examined using software visualization, often in three-dimensional setups. This allows scientists to ensure that the determined docking orientation looks acceptable, and that the scoring is correct based on known interaction energies such as hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions.

The compounds that make it through docking, scoring, and evaluation become drug leads, and are then passed on to undergo drug testing techniques by scientists in a wet lab, to ensure that only compounds with effects relatively unique to the target system and safe to the rest of organism are considered.  However, the drug company has already saved much time and money up to this point by having computers do chemical screening, rather than human scientists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{French Grammar Header}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In the introduction of the book the description of a sentence, versus a phrase was outlined. A phrase does not contain a ''subject + verb'', while a sentence includes a subject (what or whom) and a predicate (tells us about the subject). A sentence, and not a phrase, is a grammatical unit, which may have nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. Like English, a sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark.

In the introduction we highlighted the types of sentences, and these are:

* Declarative (statements)
* Interrogative (questions)
* Exclamatory (exclamations)
* Commanding (commands)


== Declarative ==

A simple declarative sentence is ''subject + verb + object noun''. This word order is pretty much the same as English. ''&quot;Henry got a car.&quot;'' You may have heard that there are some English sentences that cannot be translated to French. While this is true in the literal sense, it doesn't mean you can't get the point across in another way. The French declarative sentence with direct and indirect object nouns must be in this order: ''subject + verb + direct object + indirect object.''

For example, I can say ''&quot;Peter bought a car for his son Henry&quot;'' in French, but I can't say ''&quot;Peter bought his son Henry a car.&quot;'' In the first example ''Peter'' is the subject, ''bought'' is the verb, ''a car'' is the direct object, and ''for his son Henry'' is the indirect object. In the second example you will see that the ''direct object'' and ''indirect object'' have been swapped. In order to translate an English statement like this, you would have to slide the indirect object to its proper place.

:Henri obtenu une voiture. (Simple declarative)&lt;br /&gt;
:Pierre a acheté une voiture pour son fils Henri. (With direct + indirect object)&lt;br /&gt;
:Pierre a acheté &lt;s&gt;pour son fils Henri une voiture&lt;/s&gt;. (With indirect + direct object - wrong)

== Interrogative ==

===Formation===

====Intonation====

As in English, raising the tone at the end of a sentence can turn it into a question.

Example: 

Il aime les bonbons. ''He likes sweets.''
&lt;br&gt;Il aime les bonbons? ''Does he like sweets?''

====Est-ce que...====
&quot;Est-ce que&quot; (''ehs kuh'') by itself does not mean anything.  Like the upside-down question mark in Spanish '¿', it merely indicates the sentence is an informal question. To form a question, attach &quot;Est-ce que...&quot; at the beginning of the sentence.  Sometimes &quot;que&quot; has to be modified to &quot;qu'&quot; for elision. Est-ce is actually the inversion of c'est (&quot;it is&quot;). Like all inversions a '-' dash is required.

These questions in this form are typically mean't to elicit a &quot;Oui&quot; or &quot;Non&quot; answer. If you want more than that, you must precede it with an interrogative: Quand est-ce que, Qui est-ce que, or Quel est-ce que, for example.

Some of these later examples can more easily be said by just leaving the inversion off. For example &quot;Quel est le problème ?&quot; is preferred to &quot;Quel est-ce que le problèm ?&quot;

If the question is negative, then the form is: n'est-ce pas, as in: N'est-ce pas qu'il fait beau temps ? ou Il fait beau temps; n'est-ce pas ? (It is good weather, is it not?)

Example: Il aime ce film. =&gt; Est-ce qu'il aime ce film ?
&lt;br&gt;(He likes this film. =&gt; Does he like this film?)

====Inversion====
This is considered to be the most formal way to ask a question out of the three.
&lt;br&gt;(The indicative form of the following sentences will be placed in parentheses for comparison.)

To ask a question by inversion, simply invert the verb and the subject (the pronoun) and insert a hyphen (un trait d'union) in between.
&lt;br&gt;Example: Do you like apples?  (You like apples.)
&lt;br&gt;'''''Aimes-tu''' les pommes ?'' (Tu aimes les pommes.)

In the case where the verb ends in a vowel while the subject starts with one, a &quot;t&quot; needs to be inserted to avoid elision.
&lt;br&gt;Example: Did she make the decision already?  (She made the decision already.)
&lt;br&gt;''A-'''t'''-elle déjà pris la décision ?  (Elle a déjà pris la décision.)

(Notice that for compound tense [les temps composés], only the ''avoir'' or ''être'' part is interchanged with the subject.)

For third person plural (verbs ending in &quot;ent&quot;), there is no need to insert the &quot;t&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;Example: Are they buying a house? (They are buying a house.)
&lt;br&gt;'''''Achètent-ils''' une maison ?'' (Ils achètent une maison.)

If the subject is a noun instead of a pronoun, invert the verb and the pronoun that represents the subject.
&lt;br&gt;Example: Did Marie choose this shirt?  (Marie chose this shirt.)
&lt;br&gt;'Marie ''a-t-elle choisi'' cette chemise ?'' (Marie a choisi cette chemise.)

For negative such as &quot;ne...pas&quot;, the verb should be inserted in between:
&lt;br&gt;Example: Didn't you eat the whole pizza?  (You didn't eat the whole pizza.)
&lt;br&gt;'''''N'as-tu pas mangé''' la pizza entière ?'' (Tu n'as pas mangé la pizza entière.)

If there is a direct or indirect object (complément d'objet [in]direct), it goes before the verb.
&lt;br&gt;Example: Have you been there?  (You have been there.)
&lt;br&gt;''Y '''es-tu allé(e)''' ?'' (Tu y es allé(e).)

===Question/Interrogative words===
*Où ? - Where?
*Quand ? - When?
*Pourquoi ? - Why?
*Comment ? - How?
*Quel/Quels/Quelle/Quelles ? - Which?
*Qui ? - Who?
*Combien ? - How much?
*Quoi ? - What?

== Exclamatory ==

== Commanding ==

==If...==
Si...

With present tense (le présent):

(1) Si + (le présent), (le futur simple)
&lt;br&gt;Example: If you finish your homework, I'll give you some candies.
&lt;br&gt;''Si tu '''finis''' tes devoirs, je te '''donnerai''' des bonbons.''

(2) Si + (le présent), (l'impératif)
&lt;br&gt;Example: If you are cold, close the window.
&lt;br&gt;''Si tu '''as''' froid, '''ferme''' la fenêtre.''

With imperfect (l'imparfait) past tense (to express hypothetical situations):

(3) Si + (l'imparfait), (le conditionnel)
&lt;br&gt;Example: If I had a million dollars, I would buy a house.
&lt;br&gt;''Si j''''avais''' un million de dollars, j''''achèterais''' une maison.''

With &quot;plus-que-parfait&quot; (also to express hypothetical situations):

(4) Si + (le plus-que-parfait), (le conditionnel passé)
&lt;br&gt;Example: If I had known (or &quot;had I known&quot;) computers were so useful, I would have taken a computer course.
&lt;br&gt;''Si j''''avais su''' que les ordinateurs étaient si utiles, j''''aurais suivi''' un cours de l'informatique.''

Sorry for the late reply.

The problem with the renaming is that I was not able to get to the sub pages that were not moved. If you want to rename the book, first move the subpages, then move the main page last. Thanks, [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 01:30, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can't translate risotto as ''big rice'', the current tranlation is  made by rice. big rice is ''risone'' a kind of riso. 
But for italian risotto is that plate. so risotto cant't be translated.

Matteo Pedani
01:43, 15 March 2006 (UTC)


Having passed more than 60 years of my life based in Milano where the Risotto was created and where the Milanese Risotto is still a basic dish, I suggest to eliminate garlic and pepper from the basic recipe. In priciple, garlic never goes with onion in the same dish. Italian cousine is very simple and contains few elements: it allows people to take initiatives about adding any sort of &quot;other&quot; things to &quot;improve&quot; the dishes: see what happened to pizza;  forget about pepper, vodka and other liquors but wine.  
For those interested a good Risotto can be made in 5 minutes with a pressure cooker

Sandro Marchesi

: That's an interesting point of view. I admit I've learnt about Italian cuisine through the muddled channels of western European cooking culture, so there are definitely things I don't know, but I've always thought of the soffrito (which I took to be onions and garlic, and maybe more) as the basis of most Italian dishes. Can you back these statements up with any references? (this is a wiki after all, we must be rigorous). On the whole I think that recipes are disconnecting from their origins everywhere in the world. The hip new chefs reinvent everything they can get their hands on. And if that means that pizza's will have pineapple and ham, or scollops and raisins on them then so be it. The Italians can still have their basil and mozarella pizza's, but ideas will evolve, it can't (and shouldn't) be helped. [[User:Risk|risk]] 01:54, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

I think paella (the many different kinds) has sufficient entity by itself as to be considered a variation of risotto

César Sánchez

: I agree that paella can stand on it's own, but in the grand view of things, it's interesting to see how two neighboring countries produce such similar yet very distinct rice dishes. Perhaps it's wrong to refer to paella as a kind of risotto, but they are definitely related. [[User:Risk|risk]] 01:54, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER &quot;Sprinkle a vinaigrette over the risotto just before serving&quot;

Giorgio Benci, Gorizia, Italy

: Thanks for the input. A quick google shows that it's not uncommon to combine risotto with vinaigrette. It cuts through the fat, and particularly with mushrooms the acidity can be a very pleasant addition. That's an addition that must come in liquid form, near serving, so a few drops of a strong vinaigrette seems as good a way as any. I think Gordon Ramsey even served a risotto with vinaigrette in Hell's Kitchen. Can you elaborate on your statement? [[User:Risk|risk]] 01:54, 21 September 2007 (UTC)



==  Authentic Italian risotto and International adaptations of Risotto ==

There is Italian risotto and then there are the International Risottos where cooks and chefs who are foreigners to authentic Italian cuisine add their personal twists and touches.

Italians do not use garlic much at all, especially in Northern Italy which is where risotto originates and is most eaten. Italians often omit vinaigrette on salad ( just excellent olive oil and salt) let alone on risotto, the very thought would make a Milanese faint.  
These, by the way, are hard facts of Italian cuisine and not points of view.

A point of view is yours on the positive-ness of dishes changing and evolving away from their origins. In Italy we have respect for dishes which have roots and history, which make seasonal and territorial sense, which took decades to perfect. We look forward to eating the same dishes every year at the right season and compare them with those we ate in previous years thus buidling up our culinary and gastronomic culture and developing an attentive palate. We do excercise personal variation but within sensible -in a culinary sense- limits. We find the need for constant variation and innovation a little puerile to be honest. This is our point of view, on the whole.

Your &quot;quick google&quot;, doubtless in Englisjh, will have brought up non authentic risotto recipes by non Italians.

There is the real world and there is Wiki. 

Italian cookbooks written by Italians in Italian (and not by British or Australian or US chefs) will back up what these Italians are saying about their dish. But would you accept them as references? Or are you going to insist on telling Italians that unless they back up their comments on the dishes they grew up with references in English, then your version (point of view)is the the correct one?

Maybe this page ought to be divided into two:  Authentic Italian risotto and International adaptations of Risotto. We'll eat the first kind you can enjoy the second. 

[[Special:Contributions/213.156.49.142|213.156.49.142]] ([[User talk:213.156.49.142|talk]]) 16:41, 4 September 2008 (UTC)

: Good grief. I did not mean to step on any toes, but if I have to learn Italian just to work out what a proper risotto is, I don't stand much of a chance, do I? From your arguments, it seems like the fact that I'm not an Italian, means I would never be able to speak with any authority on what risotto is. 
: I think we can agree that the basic recipe should be as simple as possible. This could well be the &quot;authentic Italian risotto&quot; (however you want to define that). If you're not allowed to use onions and garlic together, fine, we'll pick just one. All the rest can be added to the variations. But if we have to hold a referendum among &quot;real Italians&quot; to determine whether or not adding rosemary to a risotto is &quot;allowed&quot;, I doubt we'd end up with anything sane. Most likely, we couldn't get any agreement on whether to use olive oil or butter.
: This kind of authenticity vs innovation debate is going on all over the world. Any kind of regional style of cooking (Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese) has these issues, and there's no getting away from them. Perhaps we need a page discussing the issue in a general sense, so that we can link to it from all these particularly sacred recipes. 
: Plenty of Italian cookbooks have been translated to English, and plenty of Italian chefs have migrated abroad and written about Italian cooking, so I'm sure we can find references that everybody can read. My point of view is not the correct one, but neither is anyone else's. The whole point of a wikipedia and it's sister projects is that when there's disagreement, we can reach a consensus without referring to authority. That means that when someone says &quot;it should be like this, and I know because I know Italy&quot;, that in itself is not enough, because the next person might refer to '''their''' authority and claim the opposite, we'd never get anything done. We need to find an objective way to establish a minimal risotto, and we need to establish what weight we will give to regional authenticity.
: As for it being &quot;not done&quot; to use onions and garlic together, I wasn't trying to stall any edit by asking for references, I was genuinely interested. I've simply never heard this before and I have been cooking cooking our bastardized western-Italian cuisine for some time. [[User:Risk|risk]] ([[User talk:Risk|talk]]) 17:14, 27 March 2010 (UTC)

== Couple of quick comments ==

* Risotto should be served immediately the butter is added. I would say a little Parmesan is generally beaten in together with the butter. The resting for a few minutes would come before the butter.
* The butter MUST be beaten in vigorously rather than &quot;stirred&quot; in. 
* The risotto in the picture is extremely liquid and as such not very typical. Surely a better picture can be found?
* Vodka instead of wine is not a good idea unless you are using other acidic ingredients such as lemon juice later on.

== &quot;Alternative&quot; Rices Varieties ==

I understand that it's not recommended, but can a satisfying result be reached by substituting an alternative short of medium grain rice (such as one commonly available in the US)?

:::No. They appear in the books; Florean Fortescue in particular is a haven for Harry in book 3, and his departure from Diagon Alley is a matter of some concern in book 6. Leaving them as they are, mentioned as part of another place (Diagon Alley) is reasonable; giving them a separate page, I think, is not, or at least is not yet. The Leaky Cauldron plays a large enough part that it might merit having its own page, eventually; likewise Quality Quidditch Supplies, Madam Malkin's, Florean Fortescue's, Flourish &amp; Blotts, and Ollivander's might one day have individual pages.

'''Flat Frog''' is a templating system created by Paul Lockaby &lt;paul @ paullockaby.com&gt;. The package is actually maintained by Serge Gilette.
It can be found on [http://sourceforge.net SourceForge] on its [https://sourceforge.net/projects/flatfrog project page]

'''Flat Frog''' commenced life as ''Smarty-Lite'', as it relies on plugins to add in various support whilst the core remains smaller than Smarty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pictograms==
[[File:Therm.JPG|right]]

A pictogram is simply a picture that conveys some statistical information. A very common example is the thermometer graph so common in fund drives. The entire thermometer is the goal (number of dollars that the fund raisers wish to collect. The red stripe (the &quot;mercury&quot;) represents the proportion of the goal that has already been collected. 

Another example is a picture that represents the gender constitution of a group. Each small picture of a male figure might represent 1,000 men and each small picture of a female figure would, then, represent 1,000 women. A picture consisting of 3 male figures and 4 female figures would indicate that the group is made up of 3,000 men and 4,000 women.

An interesting pictograph is the Chernoff Faces. It is useful for displaying information on cases for which several variables have been recorded. In this kind of plot, each case is represented by a separate picture of a face. The sizes of the various features of each face are used to present the value of each variable. For instance, if blood pressure, high density cholesterol, low density cholesterol, body temperature, height, and weight are recorded for 25 individuals, 25 faces would be displayed. The size of the nose on each face would represent the level of that person's blood pressure. The size of the left eye may represent the level of low density cholesterol while the size of the right eye might represent the level of high density cholesterol. The length of the mouth could represent the person's temperature. The length of the left ear might indicate the person's height and that of the right ear might represent their weight. Of course, a legend would be provided to help the viewer determine what feature relates to which variable. Where it would be difficult to represent the relationship of all 6 variables on a single (6-dimensional) graph, the Chernoff Faces would give a relatively easy to interpret 6-dimensional representation.

Comment by [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]]: About your new book, [[Ori: Book of Origin]]...

At first it was unclear to me what this was for. Then I noticed the association with ''Stargate SG-1'', which I remembered reading about at Wikipedia. So I looked at [[Wikipedia:Ori (Stargate)]], [[Wikicities:c:Stargate:Ori]], and some related pages.

The way I understand it, in the TV show ''Stargate SG-1'', there are beings called ''Ori'' that invade the Milky Way galaxy and establish their religion ''Origin''. The Stargate show often quotes the ''Book of Origin'', and what you are trying to do is write a [[Ori: Book of Origin]] that includes all of the quotes?

In that case, you are writing ''fan fiction''. Then I should tell you that '''this wiki, Wikibooks, is NOT the place for writing fiction'''. If you look at [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]], you will mostly find instructional and reference books. This is because Wikibooks is for instructional resources, not essays or fiction. The relevant text in '''[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]''' reads, &quot;Wikibooks hosts ''non-fiction'' texts only. As such we do not allow original works of fiction or literature.&quot;

Wikibooks is not for fiction, in the way that [[Wiktionary:Main Page|Wiktionary]] is not for encyclopedia articles. Thus you will need to
# move [[Ori: Book of Origin]] to a different web site, '''or'''
# redo [[Ori: Book of Origin]] as a non-fiction resource about fiction (like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]], for example).

This is a strange misty globe, it looks cool when animated. 

This could be used as a mystical crystal ball etc. etc.

      <comment>/* Static Size Arrays */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Lists, or Arrays are types in Pascal that can be used to store multiple data using one variable.

==Static Size Arrays==
These lists are defined in syntax of:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
type MyArray1 = array[0..100] of integer;

type MyArray2 = array[0..5] of array[0..10] of char;
 {or}
type MyArray2 = array[0..5,0..10] of char;
&lt;/source&gt;
Examples of this would be having a list of different types or records.
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
type my_list_of_names = array[0..7] of string;

var the_list: my_list_of_names;

begin
  the_list[5] := 'John';
  the_list[0] := 'Newbie';
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
This would create an array of &lt;nowiki&gt;['Newbie','','','','','John','','']&lt;/nowiki&gt;. We can access these variables the same way as we have set them:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
begin
  writeln('Name 0: ', the_list[0]);
  writeln('Name 5: ', the_list[5]);
end;
&lt;/source&gt;


The following example shows an array with indices of chars.
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
var
  a: array['A'..'Z'] of integer;
  s: string;
  i: byte;

begin
  readln(s); {reads the string}
  for i := 1 to length(s) do {executes the code for each letter in the string}
    if upcase(s[i]) in['A'..'Z'] then
      inc( a[upcase(s[i])] );
    {counts the number the times a letter is counted. the case doesn't count}
  writeln('The number of times the letter A appears in the string is ',a['A']);
  {returns 5 if the string is 'Abracadabra'} 
end.
&lt;/source&gt;

== Dynamic Arrays ==

Lists also can contain unlimited number of items, depending on the amount of computer memory.
This is acheived by dynamic arrays, which appeared with '''Delphi''' (not available with '''Turbo Pascal''').
To declare a dynamic array, simply declare an array without bounds :
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
var a: array of &lt;element_type&gt;;
&lt;/source&gt;
Then, define the size at any moment with the function ''SetLength''
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
SetLength( a, &lt;New_Length&gt; );
&lt;/source&gt;
The indices of the array will from 0 to length(a)-1.

You can get the current length with the ''Length'' function, as for String type.
To go through the array, you can write for example :
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
var
  i: integer;
  a: array of integer;
 
begin
  randomize;
  setlength(a, 10); { a will contain 10 random numbers }
  for i := 0 to length(a)-1 do
    a[i] := random(10)+1;
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
The memory is '''freed automatically''' when the array is not used anymore, but you can free it before by assigning '''nil''' value to the variable which is the same as defining a length of 0.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Back to [[Programming:Pascal|Pascal Programming]]

Object Oriented Pascal allows the user to create applications with Classes and Types. This saves the developer time on developing programs that would be very flexible.

This is a sample program (tested with the FreePascal compiler) that will store a number 1 in private variable One, increase it by one and then print it.
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
 program types;  // this is a simple program
 type MyType=class
       private
        One:Integer;
       public
        function Myget():integer;
        procedure Myset(val:integer);
        procedure Increase();
      end;

 function MyType.Myget():integer;
 begin
   Myget:=One;
 end;
 procedure MyType.Myset(val:integer);
 begin
   One:=val;
 end;
 procedure MyType.Increase();
 begin
   One:=One+1;
 end;

 var
   NumberClass:MyType;
 begin
   NumberClass:=MyType.Create;  // creating instance
   NumberClass.Myset(1);
   NumberClass.Increase();
   writeln('Result: ',NumberClass.Myget());
   NumberClass.Free;  // destroy instance
 end. 
&lt;/source&gt;

This example is very basic and would be pretty useless when used as OOP. Much more complicated examples can be found in [http://www.codegear.com/ Delphi] and [http://lazarus.freepascal.org/ Lazarus] which include a lot of Object Oriented programming.

Pointers are pointers or addresses to specific variables in the memory.
Pointers allow the developer to make an alias or referencing of a specific variable.
Professionally, Pointers are being used for lists since they require less memory although they are more intricate.

A sample pointer app:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
program Pointers;
 
var
  number : integer;
  { ^ before the type shows that it's a pointer }
  numbers_pointer : ^integer;
 
begin
  { Set to 5 }
  number := 5;
  { Output }
  writeln('Number is ', number);
 
  { Assign the number's address, which is @number to numbers_pointer }
  numbers_pointer := @number;
  { To access the pointer's address, you've got to add a ^ after the pointer variable's name: }
  numbers_pointer^ := 8;
  writeln('Pointed Content is: ', numbers_pointer^); { 8 }
 
  writeln('Number is: ', number); { Should be 8 }
end.
&lt;/source&gt;
Pointers are introduced as lists, explained above. Simply, you've got to point to the next or the previous record.

Note that there are three ways pointers are notated:

- the &quot;@&quot; indicates the memory address of another type; it is a common way of initializing a pointer. 
- when &quot;^&quot; is placed before a name, you are asking for a pointer for a particular &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;, like a pointer to an integer or a char. Alternately you can use the generic &quot;Pointer&quot; type if you wish to use a pointer to reference many kinds of objects.
- when &quot;^&quot; is placed after a name, you are asking for a &lt;i&gt;dereference&lt;/i&gt; - for an existing pointer to return the variable it's referencing. So if you have a variable you wish to change, but have only a pointer to access it from, you use &quot;variable^&quot; to obtain the value.

Pascal pointers are often notated as &quot;Pvar&quot; where &quot;var&quot; or &quot;Tvar&quot; is the original.

One significant difference between C and Pascal programming is that C requires the use of pointers in more cases. When you call a function in C, there is no &quot;var&quot; keyword to indicate pass-by-reference; instead, C expects you to call the function with a pointer to the variable you want changed, and then dereference the pointer inside the function. Although the functionality is nearly the same, Pascal was originally designed to use pass-by-reference for subroutines, and pointers for complex data structures; later implementations added more generalized functionality for pointers.

Modern Pascal adds plain pointer type, named Pointer, which is compatible to C's &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;code&gt;. This pointer type is semantically compatible with any other pointers. Therefore, the following code snippet is valid:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
var
  P: Pointer;
  PL: PLongWord;
  PB: PByte;
  PC: PChar;

begin
  New(PL);
  // Assuming little endian, the byte order would be: $41424300
  PL^ := $00434241;
  P := PL;
  // Now PB can read PI's value byte per byte
  PB := PByte(P);
  // Byte order cross check 
  WriteLn(PB^,' ',(PB + 1)^,' ',(PB + 2)^,' ',(PB + 3)^);
  PC := PChar(P);
  // Guess what?
  WriteLn(PC);
  Dispose(PL);
end.
&lt;/source&gt;
Another Modern Pascal enhancement regarding pointers is that you can treat it as array of infinite length. The byte order cross check above could be rewritten as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
WriteLn(PB[0],' ',PB[1],' ',PB[2],' ',PB[3]);
&lt;/source&gt;
Be careful, this enhancement also brings bad things. For instance, what if you access index that's out of your program's memory region? That's why you better be sure to have range checking on whenever you use this feature (except for a guaranteed free of errors code).

== Overview ==

'''''Merope Gaunt''''' is the mother of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]], the sister of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin Gaunt]], and the daughter of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]]. She is not a pretty woman at all: 'Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes stared in opposite directions.' She wears ragged clothing and is always abused by her father, because of the relative weakness of her magical powers.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

We see Merope only through the recorded memories of various wizards, and the ensuing discussions with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. When we first see her, she is eighteen years old, and keeping house (more or less adequately) for her father and brother. She was in love with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]]. Shortly afterwards, her father and brother are sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] for attacking the wizards who were to bring Morfin to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] for a hearing concerning his attacking a Muggle with magic. Merope, left to her own devices, used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Amortentia|a love potion]] to trap Riddle into marriage. When she became pregnant, she apparently stopped using the love potion, possibly under the misconception that as she was bearing his child, Riddle would really love her without the use of potion, or possibly because the pregnancy weakened her magical abilities. Once freed of the effect of the potion, however, he realized what had happened, abandoned her and returned to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]]. There, he told the town that he had been ''hoodwinked'' and ''taken in''. Merope never tried to improve her life after being abandoned by him, living on in London, on her own and in poverty. Shortly before giving birth, she sold her only possession, a priceless locket which was one of the family heirlooms, and which could be traced back to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]]. She gave birth to her son in a Muggle orphanage and died after she named the child Tom Marvolo Riddle.

== Strengths ==

Largely lacking in physical strength or magical ability, she still has sufficient strength of character to stand up to her father and brother in the matter of the muggle Tom Riddle.

== Weaknesses ==

Merope's character was severely weakened by the abuse of her father and brother. She often had trouble with magic growing up, being terrorized by her father, and living in harsh impoverished conditions making her vulnerable to negative feelings about her magic abilities. It is likely that her apparent magical weakness was in part because she was untrained. It is unlikely that Marvolo, with his distrust of the Wizarding hierarchy, would have allowed either of his children to attend school.

As a result of this, Merope's self esteem was quite low; she apparently believed that the only way she could be loved was through a love potion. As noted, she was quite unattractive; it is possible that this assessment of her romantic chances was accurate.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Most villages in England will have a manor house, and the resident will be the local important person; often referred to as &quot;the lord of the manor&quot; though not necessarily nobility. Tom is the son and heir of the local lord, and Merope is hopelessly in love with him. Her brother and father abuse her quite harshly for daring to fall in love with a Muggle. This abuse from her family has left her feeling very unsure of herself.

== Analysis ==

It is clear to the reader that Merope was faced with a wretched home situation. In even the very short time we see the entire family together, we note that Marvolo and Morfin both treat Merope very brutally. We also see that Tom Riddle treats the girl he's riding out with much more gently than anything Merope has ever known, It is not surprising, then, that Merope should fall in love with Tom, if only because he was possibly the only Muggle who had ever dared to go near the ugly, scary Gaunt shack while she was living there. The abuse she receives at home predisposes her to escape, and any passing man could be her ticket out; it is unfortunate that the Gaunts had isolated themselves from the Wizarding community, because that resulted in the only available man being a Muggle, an impossible match in the eyes of her father and brother. 

Though Merope did fall in love with, and eventually marry, Tom Riddle, the child she had with him seems to have developed into someone who hated Muggles as much as Merope's father and brother. We can't, of course, know if her selection of Tom was love, or a combination of infatuation, woolly romantic thinking, and rebellion. We do know that, as Merope died shortly after giving birth, Tom Marvolo Riddle's eventual character would not be influenced by Merope's feelings about Muggles.

__TOC__
==What is proteomics?==
[[Image:Central_dogma.JPG|thumb|Information transfer in the central dogma of biology]]
The focus of proteomics is a biological group called the proteome. The [[w:proteome|proteome]] is dynamic, defined as the set of proteins expressed in a specific cell, given a particular set of conditions. Within a given human proteome, the number of proteins can be as large as 2 million. {{ref|AMA}}

Proteins themselves are macromolecules: long chains of [[w:amino acids|amino acids]]. This amino acid chain is constructed when the cellular machinery of the [[w:ribosome|ribosome]] translates RNA transcripts from DNA in the cell's nucleus. {{ref|Hartl}} The transfer of information within cells commonly follows this path, from [[w:DNA|DNA]] to [[w:RNA|RNA]] to [[w:protein|protein]].

Proteins can be organized in four structural levels:
:*[[w:Primary_structure|Primary]] (1°): The amino acid sequence, containing members of a (usually) twenty-unit alphabet
:*[[w:Secondary_structure|Secondary]] (2°): Local folding of the amino acid sequence into α helices and β sheets
:*[[w:Tertiary_structure|Tertiary]] (3°): 3D conformation of the entire amino acid sequence
:*[[w:Quaternary_structure|Quaternary]] (4°): Interaction between multiple small peptides or protein subunits to create a large unit
Each level of protein structure is essential to the finished molecule's function. The primary sequence of the amino acid chain determines where secondary structures will form, as well as the overall shape of the final 3D conformation. The 3D conformation of each small [[w:peptide|peptide]] or subunit determines the final structure and function of a protein conglomerate. {{ref|Weaver}}

There are many different subdivisions of proteomics, including:
:*[[w:Structural_proteomics|Structural proteomics]] -- in-depth analysis of protein structure
:*[[w:Expression proteomics|Expression proteomics]] -- analysis of expression and differential expression of proteins
:*[[w:Interaction proteomics|Interaction proteomics]] -- analysis of interactions between proteins to characterize complexes and determine function. {{ref|Twyman}}

Proteomics has both a physical laboratory component and a computational component. These two parts are often linked together; at times data derived from laboratory work can be fed directly into sequence and [[w:Protein_structure_prediction|structure prediction]] algorithms. [[w:Mass spectroscopy|Mass spectrometry]] of multiple types is used most frequently for this purpose. {{ref|Colinge}}

==The importance of proteomics==
Proteomics is a relatively recent field; the term was coined in 1994, and the science itself had its origins in [[w:Electrophoresis_(disambiguation)#Molecular_Biology_and_Biochemistry|electrophoretic separation techniques]] of the 1970's and 1980's. {{ref|APAF}} The study of proteins, however, has been a scientific focus for a much longer time. Studying proteins generates insight on how they affect cell processes. Conversely, this study also investigates how proteins themselves are affected by cell processes or the external environment.

Proteins provide intricate control of cellular machinery, and are in many cases components of that same machinery. {{ref|MolecPro}} They serve a variety of functions within the cell, and there are thousands of distinct proteins and peptides in almost every organism. This great variety comes from a phenomenon known as [[w:alternative splicing|alternative splicing]], in which a particular gene in a cell's DNA can create multiple protein types, based on the demands of the cell at a given time.

The goal of proteomics is to analyze the varying proteomes of an organism at different times, in order to highlight differences between them. Put more simply, proteomics analyzes the structure and function of biological systems. {{ref|Prot}} For example, the protein content of a cancerous cell is often different from that of a healthy cell. Certain proteins in the cancerous cell may not be present in the healthy cell, making these unique proteins [[w:biomarker|good targets]] for anti-cancer drugs. The realization of this goal is difficult; both purification and identification of proteins in any organism can be hindered by a multitude of biological and environmental factors. {{ref|Wijk}}

[[Image:Protein-structure.png|center|Protein structural levels of interest in proteomics]]

==Proteomics Workflows==

The first step of proteomics is sample preparation. In this step, we are trying to extract protein from cells. In the second step, we use methods such as [[w:Two-dimensional_gel_electrophoresis|2D electrophoresis]] to separate different proteins. Then we try to cut proteins into peptides since peptides are easier to detect. In the forth step, we use mass spectrometry to detect peptides and peptides fragments. Finally, we can then determine the sequence of the protein by interpreting all the data obtained.

==Broad-Based Proteomics==
[[Image:Broad-Based Proteomics Overview.jpg|right|thumb|600px|Broad-based Proteomics Approach vs traditional focused approach]]
Because Proteomics is growing at a very rapid pace, there is a shift in the field away from a specialized/focused way of conducting studies and towards a more global perspective. Broad-based proteomics presents a unique perspective on the field of proteomics because it allows for one to take on this general perspective by setting out to understand the proteome as a whole. A critical aspect to this strategy is planning ahead; and in doing so, the most appropriate plans and technologies can be implemented in the most efficient manner. By developing a strategy tailored to understanding a particular proteome, problems and setbacks can be avoided during the study. 

The first step when utilizing broad-based proteomics is to develop a hypothesis specific to the proteome being studied. It is best to choose organisms that already have a great deal of [[w:genome|genomic]] [[W:genetic code|information]] available, since the genome is always a useful supplement to proteomic information. Once the a hypothesis and organism are established, the proper technologies should be chosen; and these technologies should be compatible with whatever biological factors are present (i.e. sample type). Some important and relevant proteomic methods include [[w:HPLC|HPLC]], [[w:Mass_spectroscopy|Mass Spectrometry]], [[w:SDS-PAGE|SDS-PAGE]], [[w:Two-dimensional_gel_electrophoresis|two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]], and perhaps [[w:List_of_protein_structure_prediction_software|in silico protein modeling]]. 

Since there are multitudes of sample type, sample preparation, and analytical technology combinations possible, it is obvious why careful planning from a broad-based proteomic perspective is critical. By planning upfront, an efficient proteomic study can be conducted. And when the efforts of many broad-based proteomic studies are taken together, understanding the proteome in its entirety becomes a realistic possibility.

'''Main Focus'''                                                 

The article summarizes recent improvements as well as some principal limitations of shortgun tandem mass spectrometry based proteomics. Furthermore, it also briefly introduces steps of targeted driven quantitative proteomics.

'''Summary'''

In recent years, great improvements have been made in all the parts of non targeted mass spectrometry based
proteomics including sample preparation, data acquisition, data processing and analysis. In the sample preparation 
process, with the introduction of IEF separation method, resolution obtained from classical two dimensional 
chromatography peptide separation is greatly improved. Improvements are also made in the field of data quality which
is increased by the development of highly reproducible capillary chromatography methods and quantitative analysis by 
stable isotope labeling method. High mass resolution and accuracy could be achieved now by different types of mass 
spectrometry such as TOF-TOF,Q-TOF in the data acquisition process. Furthermore, different types of mass analyzers 
and ion sources have been combined to increase the proteome coverage. With the development of database search tools, 
the quality of proteomics data could be more accurately assessed and estimated in the data processing and analysis
process.

Despite all these improvements achieved, limitations exist in shotgun approaches. For example, shotgun MS datasets 
are extremely redundant which greatly affect the identification of peptides present in proteomic samples. The 
existence of semi-tryptic or non-tryptic peptides in samples made the sample more complex. Saturation effect greatly
reduces the discovery rate of new proteins. Many peptides that detected by Mass Spectrometry could not be identified, making it difficult to compare sample to sample.  

The limitations of shotgun approaches made the development of targeted driven quantitative proteomics necessary. 
The first step of targeted driven quantitative proteomics is protein and peptide selection. This step could be 
finished both experimentally and computationally. For the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and data analysis step,
multiple reaction monitoring was applied to proteomics data analysis.
Relevance to the course: this source is a brief overview of recent improvements in targeted mass spectrometry
(one method of proteomics) based proteomics as well as some limitations. It also introduced another field of
proteomics: targeted driven quantitative proteomics.

===Broad-Based Proteomic Strategies: A Practical Guide to Proteomics and Functional Screening===

[http://jp.physoc.org/cgi/content/full/563/1/1 Graham David, Elliot Steven, Van Eyk Jennifer. &quot;Journal of Physiology&quot; 563: 1-9 (2005)]

'''Main Focus'''

This article summarizes what broad-based proteomics is and how one can design a study using this global-view strategy. It first briefly looks at the current technology in proteomics and then discusses how these technologies can be incorporated into a study.

'''Summary'''

Proteomics as a field is becoming a very daunting one to enter because many studies are getting lost in the complicated focused details. To help assist with this challenge, a researcher can employ broad-based proteomics. Broad-based proteomics is a strategy where careful planning is employed upfront to answer a question about a proteome (for instance, comparisons between a tissue in a diseased state and a normal state) using the most appropriate and applicable technologies available. By developing a strategy at the beginning of a proteomics study, possible setbacks during the study are avoided. 

The first step is to develop a general hypothesis that is specific to the problem or issue that is being studied. Since proteomics mirrors genomics, a proteomic study is increasingly difficult when the genome of the model organism isn't known. For this reason, organisms where the majority of the genome is known (80% or greater) should be chosen. Once a proper organism has been chosen for study, the next factors to consider are the type of data that will be generated and also the sample source. Some proteomic methods yield qualitative data, while others yield quantitative; so the type of data needed should be determined before a method is chosen. At the same time, the source of the sample is important in determining the extraction and purification methods. Typical sample types include: urine, blood (plasma/serum) and mucosal secretions. Protein concentration within the sample is important, and one should expect reasonable extraction if the protein can be visualized on a coomassie blue stained gel (&gt; 300 ng). The separation technique chosen should reflect the characteristics of the protein(s) of choice (hydrophobic vs hydrophilic, molecular mass, etc). 

Another major factor in the planning process is estimating the difficulty in the preparation of the fractioned sample for mass spectrometry identification. Each mass spectrometry technique requires varying degrees of preparation, and some are much more complicated than others (2DE with MS/MS analysis requires greater preparation than HPLC with MS, for instance). Since mass spectrometry is often the step where a lot of proteomic studies encounter difficulty (both in preparation and in interpretation of the results), it is very important to choose a method that is appropriate for the protein sample. 

With the advent of proteomic databases in recent years, bioinformatics has had an increasing presence in proteomic studies. For this reason, almost all proteomic studies should incorporate bioinformatics; and consequently it's important for the research team to have some bioinformatics knowledge. And depending on how much data will be received at the end of the study (depending on the analysis methods chosen), the research team can determine how much bioinformatic analysis should be needed.

A final factor to consider is whether to bring in outside assistance or to attempt the study in a more self-contained way. Keeping it self-contained allows for the research team to keep its data integrated and also keeps miscommunication to a minimum. Bringing in outside help, on the other hand, could allow a researcher to tackle problems that would be large and normally not solvable with a smaller team. While bringing in outside assistance seems promising, it's important to not lose control over the data and to make sure that the team is not spread out trying to accomplish more than it can handle.

Since there are many ways to study a cell's proteome, careful planning should be implemented at all stages of a proteomics study. Through broad-based proteomics, a researcher can define a test plan before any actual study is performed. And when used appropriately, this strategy can lead to productive and efficient projects that will bring science one step closer to understanding the proteome as a whole.

'''Main Focus'''

This web page is about how the Association of Bimolecular Resource Facilities relates to proteomics. Of particular importance is the Proteomics Research Group within the ABRF. 

'''Summary'''

The Association of Bimolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) is an international association of research facilities and laboratories that is focused on core research in Biotechnology. The association encourages the sharing of information through conferences, a quarterly journal, and group studies. The ABRF has a heavy influence on the field of proteomics, and there are five main research groups (RG) that deal with proteomics in some way: Protein Expression (PERG), Protein Sequencing (PSRG), Protein Informatics (iPRG), Proteomics (PRG), and Proteomics Standards (sPRG). 

Of particular importance, the Proteomics Research Group allows for researchers throughout the world in the field of proteomics to share their protein analysis information freely. Obviously, since understanding the proteome is about bringing together information on many different proteins (which is information that requires a great amount of effort/time/money to achieve), the sharing of protein/subproteomic information is imperative to beginning to understand a proteome in its entirety. This website has numerous links to studies performed by research groups throughout the world.

'''Main Focus'''

This web page is about the importance and challenges in proteomics. It also introduces major steps of proteomics briefly.

'''Summary'''

Proteomics is important for us to understand biological processes since all the functions are accomplished by proteins in cell.But as the number of proteins are so large and amino acids(which are units of protein) are so small, the study is quite challenging.There are five steps to analyze protein sequences: sample preparation,separation,ionization,mass spectrometry and informatics.First of all, we obtain cells and extract proteins from the cells.Then we use methods such as 2D electrophoresis to separate different types of cells. Next, we use protease to cut proteins into peptides.Mass spectrometry allows us to identify individual peptides as well as peptides fragments.Finally, by interpreting the data, we are able to determine the sequence of proteins.

'''Main Focus'''

This website discusses the aims and definitions of proteomics. It also introduces two important methods in proteomcis studies - 2D protein electrophoresis and mass spectrometry as well as proteomics in medicine

'''Summary'''

Proteomics is a broad field which includes expression proteomics,protein distribution in subcellular compartments of the organelles,post-translational modifications of the proteins,structural proteomics and functional proteomics, clinical proteomics and so on. Even though analysis of the expression on transcripts level is possible with the introduction of RNA/cDNA microarray,proteomics is still important since not all mRNA will be translated and the processes such as RNA splicing, posttranslational protein modifications exist.

Two-dimensional (2D) protein electrophoresis is commonly used to separate proteins based on their PI and mass.
Mass spectrometry is an important method in proteomics since it cannot only be used for protein identification  but can also be used for protein posttranslational modification analysis.

One of the major application of proteomics in medicine is the identification of markers in all the steps to treat diseases. Other applications include drug discovery and pharmacoproteomics.

== Wikibook Layout ==

There are 3 main parts to the organization of this Wikibook. These are the lessons, chapters and levels. 

'''Levels''' are the largest and most broad category. These cover large amounts of information and contain several chapters. There are 3 levels: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

'''Chapters''' come after and are smaller than levels, but larger than lessons. Each chapter contains three or four lessons.

'''Lessons''' are the final and smallest section, but the most important.  Lessons contain the information the student will use to speak, read, write and live the Italian language.

== Lesson Layout ==

Each lesson should include:

* A short summary of what the student will learn

* One or two conversation pieces

* Vocabulary

* Exercises and challenges

* A final Lesson Review
